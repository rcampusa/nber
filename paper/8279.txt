                           Keiretsu and Relationship-Specific Investment:
                           Implications for Market-Opening Trade Policy


1. Introduction

          It is well known that Japanese tariff rates on manufactured goods are lower than for most

other industrialized countries, but that Japan imports significantly less. This has lead to complaints,

particularly in the United States, that Japan has very high non-tariff barriers. Since visible and formal

non-tariff barriers such as quotas are not evident, one focus of complaint has been that typical

Japanese corporate groups, referred to as keiretsu1, have acted as a barrier to imports2. These

complaints have received some support from empirical studies that find lower imports in industries

with a high keiretsu presence3. In response, policy makers in the United States, have put pressure on

Japan to open its markets to meet quantitative targets such as VIEs (voluntary import expansions)

in which a country is forced to agree to a given market share or total value for imports of particular

products. Prominent targeted products include semiconductors and auto-parts4.

          Despite these measures to ensure greater access to the Japanese market, it is debatable

whether keiretsu constitutes an “unfair” barrier to trade. In particular, the long-term supply



 1
     This would include auto producers such as Toyota and Nissan. For further discussion see Gerlach (1989).
 2
  For example, according to Church (1995), the keiretsu “do business mainly with each other, freezing out
competing buyers and sellers, both foreign and domestic. This system forms the very fabric of the way the
Japanese do business, and it does more than outright trade barriers or even government `administrative
guidance’ to keep out foreign products. Especially, it seems, U.S. auto parts ...Some U.S. auto parts such as
shock absorbers, mufflers, tailpipes and disk-brake pads...sell for less than half to only a third the price of
made-in-Japan parts of comparable quality. What then limits American parts to around 1.5% of the Japanese
market? The keiretsu system, Americans conclude”.
 3
     Examples include Lawrence (1991, 1993) and Fung (1991), but Saxonhouse (1989) has an opposing view.
 4
   In the 1991 semiconductor pact, the U.S. demanded a 20% market-share target. The 1995 agreement on
Japanese autos and parts demanded (among other things) that Japan’s automakers increase annual purchases
of parts from the U.S. by $9 billion in three years (Bernier, et al., 1995, p.16).
arrangements within vertical keiretsu have been defended as a means of raising efficiency due to

gains from relationship-specific investments by keiretsu suppliers5. These are investments directed

at making a product more valuable to a particular buyer (in this case, the keiretsu automaker), but

not to other potential buyers. There are a number of possible examples6, but most important for our

purposes are investments in the design costs of modifications that improve the fit or ease of assembly

with other parts produced by the keiretsu, but which are not relevant to the particular production

processes of other auto manufacturers.

        Using the auto-industry as an example, Spencer and Qiu (2001) model the effects of

relationship-specific investments7 by suppliers within a vertical keiretsu on the ability of U.S. auto-

parts producers to access the Japanese market. By raising efficiency, these investments increase the

range of parts produced in the keiretsu at the expense of imports. However, the rents that these

investments create are not easily observable outside the keiretsu and Spencer and Qiu (2001) argue

that this, combined with some counterintuitive responses of imports, could create a strong

impression of a trade barrier. Thus, even if keiretsu do not “unfairly” block access to the Japanese

market, attempts by the U.S. to impose market opening policies may nevertheless be understood as

a natural response to the perception of a trade barrier.

        In the present paper, we build on Spencer and Qiu (2001) so as to consider the implications



 5
   McMillan (1996) argues persuasively that the favoring of keiretsu suppliers in contract renewals helps
solve the “holdup problem” so as to provide appropriate incentives for these investments, which are financed
by the supplier with no guarantee that costs will be covered by the subsequent sale of parts.
 6
   Another example might involve investment by suppliers in “just in time” delivery, such as locating close
to the automaker’s plant or cooperating with other suppliers to coordinate delivery. For applications within
keiretsu, see Aoki (1988; pp 216-218) and Dyer and Ouchi (1993, p 55).
  7
   Also see McLaren (1999), who argues that less formal bargaining arrangements can dominate formal
contracts in encouraging cooperative investments.

                                                     2
of keiretsu for various policies aimed at opening the Japanese market for intermediate goods, such

as auto- parts. We consider three types of VIEs. The simplest, referred to as a ‘content VIE’, requires

that autos produced in Japan achieve at least some specified U.S. content per auto. We also consider

a ‘market-share VIE’, which forces Japan to meet a market-share target for imported parts, as well

as a ‘total-value VIE’, which requires that Japan import a given total value of U.S. parts. Since there

is a continuum of parts, with parts ordered in terms of their contribution to the total cost of an auto,

referred to as their ‘cost-share’, we can address the effects of policy on the range of imported parts

as well as on their overall value. In line with U.S. complaints, one implication of Spencer and Qiu

(2001) is that the keiretsu tend to import only those parts that are least important for production8. A

natural question is then whether a VIE would be met by the import of just a few additional parts,

each making a large contribution to the target because of a high cost-share, or if instead, rather more

parts would be imported, but with the parts continuing to be of the more peripheral type. There is

some indication that the latter was the case with respect to the 1995 U.S.-Japan auto agreement9 and,

consistent with this, the model predicts that for all three types of VIEs, additional imports would be

in the order determined by increasing cost-shares, with lower cost parts first. Higher cost-shares

increase the returns from relationship-specific investments, making the automaker more reluctant

to replace these parts with imports.

        Generally a VIE reduces relationship-specific investment, raising the keiretsu cost of

  8
   For example, Rubenstein (1990, p8) observes that “American suppliers primarily provide Japanese
carmakers with bulky, low-value, low-skill products such as carpets, glass, tires, exhaust systems, and audio-
equipment. High-value, highly-skilled components such as engines, transaxles, suspension systems, and
brakes are made for Japanese carmakers by Japanese-owned suppliers.” See also Aoki (1988, pp 208-209)
and Dyer and Ouchi (1993, Fig 1, p.52).
  9
   For example, in response to the 1992 agreement on autos, “initially simple mechanical parts and such
items as carpets and aluminium were purchased, rather than more technologically complicated parts like
electronic controls and engines” (see McMillan, 1996).

                                                      3
production, which leads to a reduction in Japanese auto output and hence to a reduction in the total

Japanese demand for parts. Thus although the U.S. share of the Japanese parts’ market rises due to

the import of a greater range of parts, it is possible that a content or market-share VIE would be self

defeating in the sense that the total value of U.S. parts exported to Japan would fall. For the same

reason, it may not be feasible that Japan achieves a specified increase in the total value of its parts

imports, particularly if the demanded increase is large10. However, if Japan imports no or very few

parts at free trade, which could arise due to a high productivity of relationship-specific investment,

then U.S. parts exports would rise.

          Consideration is also given to the effects of a VER (voluntary export restraint11) and an

import tariff which limit U.S. imports of autos from Japan. As we show, these policies can have

significant effects in opening the Japanese market for auto-parts. This result may initially appear

surprising because in standard models, a restriction in final-good output would reduce the demand

for both domestically produced and imported parts. However, in the current framework, the fall in

Japanese auto production reduces the incentive for keiretsu suppliers to undertake relationship-

specific investment. This leads to an increase in the range of imported parts and hence raises the U.S.

share of the Japanese parts market.

          The effects of a VER or tariff are particularly relevant since these policies have been

extensively applied against the Japanese auto industry, including being used as threats to gain




 10
   This may partly explain the $0.6 billion shortfall in meeting the 1994, $3.6 billion target for U.S. exports
of auto parts to Japan, which was part of the 1992 auto-parts agreement with President Bush. As stated in
the New York Times (July 14, 1995), Japanese imports fell short because production of vehicles in Japan
declined, leading all of Japan’s top five automakers to miss their targets for the import of parts.
 11
      The VER acts as an import quota in which the Japanese manufacturer of autos gains the quota rents.

                                                      4
agreement for a VIE in auto parts12. A main result is then to show that a credible threat of a VER (or

tariff) giving rise to the same total value of U.S. parts exports as a VIE applied to parts would always

be sufficient to induce the Japanese automaker to comply with the VIE13. This follows because the

VER causes a greater reduction in keiretsu investment and output. This raises the price of autos and

if the aim is to achieve a given target value of U.S. parts exports, U.S. consumers as well as the

keiretsu would prefer the VIE. Nevertheless, U.S. profit from auto production is higher under the

VER and since the gain in profit can more than offset the consumer loss, we find that the U.S. is not

necessarily better off using a VIE than a VER as a policy to expand parts exports.

        Managed trade in general and VIEs in particular are strongly opposed by many economists.

In 1993, more than 50 economists sent a letter to President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa

asking the two leaders to reject the demands for managed trade14. However, significant support for

the idea from policy makers has lead to considerable interest in research on the topic. Bhagwati

(1987) is among the first to criticize VIEs and much of the literature, including Greaney (1996),

Krishna et al. (1998) and as well as the current paper, show that, by raising the price of the product

concerned, market-share VIEs tend to be anticompetitive15. Bjorksten (1994) considers both VIEs



  12
   In the 1995 U.S./Japan auto-dispute, Japan was threatened with prohibitively high tariffs on Japanese
luxury automobiles if Japan did not agree to market-share targets in its auto parts industry (see Levinsohn
(1997)). Also, VERs have been extensively applied to autos, including by the U.S. in May 1981.
 13
    In a model with Cournot competition between a U.S. and Japanese parts’ supplier, Krishna and Morgan
(1998) show that the threat of a sufficiently high tariff on autos can induce the U.S. firm to increase exports
to comply with a market-share target, but a tariff on its own causes a decease in the export of parts.
  14
    As explained in the letter (see FEER, 1993, p26), the “principal factor underlying such demands for
managed trade has been the crude and simplistic view that Japan is importing too few manufactures owing
to ‘structural barriers’ which make Japan ‘special’.”
  15
   There are some exceptions, particularly when the policy applies to the intermediate good (see Krishna
and Morgan, 1998 and Krishna et al., 2000).

                                                      5
and VERs and shows that in a Kreps-Scheinkman duopoly model with price competition and

capacity constraints, a VER has similar effects as under Cournot competition, leading to a reduction

in profits by the exporting firm as in the present paper. However, as shown by Krishna (1989), this

outcome tends to be reversed under Bertrand competition. Also, Cronshaw and Markusen (1995)

consider the implications of hidden trade barriers for policy in a simple, but useful, asymmetric

information framework, but they do not directly model the effects of VIEs or VERs. The current

paper differs from all this literature because of its explicit consideration of the effects of keiretsu.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the model and develops the

main effects of the keiretsu under free trade. Section 3 then considers the types of parts that will be

imported in response to a VIE and also the implications for the total value of parts imports. Next,

Section 4 concerns the use of a VER or tariff applied to final-good exports as a market-opening

policy with respect to the import of parts. Comparisons are then made as to the magnitude of the

effects of the VIE versus the VER or tariff, leading to some welfare implications. Finally, section

5 contains concluding remarks.



2. The investment model

        This section sets out the model for the base case in which there is free trade. Additional

justification and explanation of the model can be found in Spencer and Qiu (2001).

2.1. Relationship-specific investment and cost of production

        A final good, such as an auto, is produced in both Japan and the United States based on

Cournot competition between a Japanese firm, referred to as a J-maker and a U.S. firm referred to

as an A-maker. The J and A makers produce homogeneous outputs, denoted yJ and yA respectively.

Our basic results also apply to the case in which the J-maker has a world monopoly, but the

                                                   6
extension to oligopoly seems appropriate given the institutional reality of oligopolistic competition

between U.S. and Japanese auto producers and the importance of U.S. production in motivating U.S.

trade policy. In order to consider the effects of U.S. import restrictions applied against Japanese

autos, we make the convenient assumption that autos are all sold in the U.S. at a price P = P(Y)

where Y = yJ + yA.

        The J-maker and its long-term suppliers in Japan, referred to as J-suppliers, are assumed to

form a keiretsu16 in which J-suppliers potentially engage in relationship-specific investments of value

to the J-maker, but not to the A-maker. Suppliers in the U.S., referred to as A-suppliers, produce

parts for the A-maker and potentially also export these parts to be used by the J-maker, but they

operate based on short-term contracts under pure competition17 and hence do not make relationship-

specific investments. The assumption that A-suppliers do not make relationship-specific investments

of value to the J-maker captures the institutional reality that the long-term suppliers of parts for

Japanese production of autos are overwhelmingly Japanese18.

        Rather than unfair exclusion, we would argue that this is most likely due to the severe

difficulties faced by non-Japanese firms in gaining access to the flow of technical and other keiretsu



 16
   Our analysis applies to top ranked (or first-tier) firms with technological expertise and long-term supply
relationships and not to the more marginal firms that may be used as short term capacity buffers so as to help
maintain permanent employment in the core manufacturer (see Asanuma, 1989, pp 16-18 and Aoki, 1988,
pp 208-209). Keiretsu are very stable. For instance, “ member firms of Kyohokai, an association formed by
Toyota parts suppliers, numbered 171 in 1984. Of these firms, 153 had been continual members of Kyohokai
during the 11 years since 1973" (see Asanuma, 1989, p. 5).
 17
   For example, a large number of establishments produce auto-parts in the U.S., for example, 4856 in 1992
(Office of Automotive Affairs) and the average length of contract was only 2.5 years in 1989, up from 1.3
years in 1984 (see Dyer and Ouchi, 1993).
 18
    See Dodwell Marketing Consultants (1990), which lists the main suppliers to each automaker in Japan.
Levinsohn (1997, p18) estimates that the share of U.S. parts manufacturers in sales to Japanese automakers
in Japan is only about 1%.

                                                      7
information necessary for suitable design of parts in coordination with other keiretsu suppliers19. In

addition to a knowledge of Japanese language and customs, access to this information requires

mutual trust, which first involves the development of a good business relationship, perhaps as a

simple manufacturer of outsourced parts sold to Japanese assemblers in the supplier’s home

country20. Proximity also facilitates the exchange of information and due to this and other

advantages, such as the ease of “just in time” delivery, actual production in Japan may be necessary

if U.S. firms are to become long-term keiretsu suppliers within Japan21. Since any such production

does not form part of U.S. exports to Japan (and is currently small), it would not change our basic

results concerning the effects of trade policy on the volume and pattern of U.S. exports of parts to

Japan22. As for the lack of relationship-specific investment with respect to the A-maker, this




 19
      Branstetter (2000) documents the importance of the flow of technical information within keiretsu.
 20
   For example, Tenneco made agreements with Unisia-Jecs Corp (a keiretsu supplier to Nissan) and with
Futuba (a keiretsu supplier to Toyota) to produce parts (such as shock absorbers) designed by its Japanese
partners for sale to Japanese plants in the U.S.. This increased confidence in Tenneco’s expertise and now
Tenneco hopes to supply Japanese automakers in Japan (see Automotive News, April 27, 1998).
 21
   In addition to alliances with keiretsu suppliers, the importance of location in Japan for the ability to sell
parts in Japan is emphasised by Levinsohn (1997, p18). An example is TRW (a U.S. firm), which initially
engaged in joint ventures with Japanese firms supplying the U.S. plants of Toyota and Nissan and then began
supplying these firms back in Japan, but only by producing most of these parts in Japan. Also, there is
evidence that Japanese suppliers tend to follow a main keiretsu assembler in setting up production facilities
in other countries, but in addition, parts are often imported from Japan (see for example, Belderbos and
Sleuwagen, 1998 and Head et al., 1995). This supports the idea that a presence in Japan is important for
gaining access to the information flow within keiretsu, but once the benefits are realized, parts incorporating
relationship-specific investments can then be exported to keiretsu assemblers or produced locally in a host
country. Suppliers producing just in the U.S. (or Europe) would be at an informational disadvantage.
 22
    An interesting possibility suggested by a referee is that a U.S. VIE might put pressure on the J-maker to
more easily accept U.S. suppliers into the keiretsu, which (in future work) might be modelled as a reduction
in the J-maker’s bargaining power, making it more profitable for these suppliers to undertake investments.
Because of the importance of access to information from keiretsu suppliers in Japan, this analysis would
require consideration of U.S. foreign direct investment as well as exports to Japan.

highlights the institutional differences across countries, but is mainly for simplicity of the model23.

        In modelling investment within the keiretsu, a central role is played by the fact that parts

differ with respect to their costs of production and hence their importance for downstream costs.

Assuming constant returns to scale in production and letting ci and c*i denote the respective marginal

(and average costs) of production of part i in Japan and the U.S., we arrange auto parts in order of

increasing average cost of production. This ordering is assumed to be the same in both countries.

Exploiting the fact that the number of parts, N, is large, it proves convenient to express marginal

costs as differentiable and increasing functions, ci = c(i) and c*i = c*(i) on the interval i  [0,N]. The

production of an auto requires parts and labor to be combined in fixed proportion and without loss

of generality, we set the units of output of each part i so that each auto is produced using just one part

of each type. For the keiretsu parts producers, the importance of part i for downstream costs is then

captured by the ‘cost-share’, )i () is Greek s for share), defined as )i = )(i)  c(i)/C(N) for C(N)

 ,0N c(i)di, where the ordering of parts ensures )1(i) > 0. In order to focus on the export of parts

to Japan, we assume that parts can be produced more cheaply in the U.S.. Since we also assume (for

simplicity) that ci = c(i) and c*i = c*(i) are linear in i with equal slopes, it follows that the efficiency

gap, denoted      ci - c*i  0 between Japan and the U.S. is constant24.

        For each part i, a J-supplier, namely supplier i, potentially makes a relationship-specific

investment, denoted ki. This creates rent for the J-maker (but not the A-maker) in the form of a

reduction in the cost of the process of assembly for each auto using the part from supplier i. For


 23
  A more complicated model could be developed with symmetric institutions in which the A and J suppliers
make relationship-specific investments of value to the A and J-maker’s respectively, but this would not
change the pattern of trade with Japan or the main insights with respect to trade policy.
 24
    These assumptions can be relaxed as in Spencer and Qiu (2001) to allow for some parts to be produced
at lower cost in Japan and also to allow for to depend on i with 1(i)  0.

                                                     9
example, the investment might improve the fit of part i with the other parts that the J-maker uses to

produce autos. The magnitude, denoted ri , of the rent created per auto, is assumed to be proportional

to the initial value, denoted wo, of the cost of the assembly process per auto in the absence of

relationship-specific investments and also to the relative contribution of part i to cost, as measured

by the cost-share, )(i).This last condition reflects the idea that the greater the proportion of costs

associated with the part, the greater the potential for cost reduction. For example, a given amount

of investment is likely to be more effective in reducing costs when it applies to engines rather than

to seat covers. Also, this has the reasonable feature that the level of rent is invariant to an inflation

in the costs of all parts.

             Consequently, letting  denote the productivity of investment, we assume

                                      ri = wo)(i)h(ki) for 0 <   max,                                       (1)

where max  min{1, C(N)/wo} and h(ki) satisfies:

                                  h(0) = 0, h1(ki) > 0, h2(ki) < 0 and h(ki) < 1.                               (2)

From (1) and (2), higher levels of investment create more rent for the J-maker, but at a decreasing

rate25. Also, the restrictions on the magnitude of the rent, due to   max and h(ki) < 1, ensure that

there is no “free lunch” from assembly or from the production and use of keiretsu parts26.

             Letting pi represent the price paid to supplier i, the J-maker’s marginal cost for part i is given

by     i
            pi - ri if the part is purchased from within the keiretsu and by c*i if the part is imported. The

J-maker’s overall marginal cost, denoted , is then equal to the total cost of parts plus w0. In the

U.S., the A-maker obtains each part from the A-suppliers at a price c*i, giving rise to a marginal cost,


 25
      i.e. 0ri/0ki = wo)(i)h1(ki) > 0 and 02ri/(0ki)2 = wo)(i)h2(ki) < 0.


                                                                                         ∫
                                                                                             N
 26
      These conditions imply ri < )iC(N) = ci and ri < wo)(i), which implies wJ  wo -           r i d i > 0.

denoted by      *, which we assume to be constant. The J-maker, supplier i and the A-maker

respectively earn profits:

                          %J = yJ(P(Y)- ), 1i = yJ(pi-ci) - ki and %A = yA(P(Y)- *).                        (3)

2.2. Order of moves and bargaining over parts’ prices

        In the free trade setting, the order of moves is as follows. At stage 1, each supplier i commits

to its investment ki  0, and simultaneously, the J-maker and A-maker both specify their respective

outputs, yJ and yA . Since each firm sets its choice variable to maximize own profit taking the other

choice variables as given, this gives rise to a Nash equilibrium in ki, yJ and yA. In making these

decisions, the J-maker and J-suppliers correctly anticipate the outcome of the stage 2 bargaining

process determining the prices, pi, for parts. Profits for the J and A makers are assumed to be strictly

positive, but for some J-suppliers, investment at stage 1 could cause a loss. If 1i < 0 for all ki  0

or if agreement would not be reached at stage 2 for supplier i to produce the part, then supplier i sets

ki = 0 and exits the market at stage 1. At stage 2, the J-maker engages in simultaneous Nash

bargaining over the price of part i with each remaining J-supplier i. The bargained price, pi, is set

taking into account the rent, ri, but third party verification problems27 are assumed to prevent

payments based on ki directly. If an agreement is reached, the J-maker orders its desired number of

parts from the J-supplier. Otherwise, the J-maker imports the part at a price c*i from the lower cost

U.S. producers.

        Considering stage 2 first, in bargaining with supplier i, the J-maker’s objective is to minimize

the total cost yJ   i
                        = yJ(pi - ri) of part i for the given output yJ committed in stage 1. Since the J-

maker’s disagreement or “threat point” is to import the part if bargaining breaks down, the payoff


 27
   It is possible that a judge would not be able to verify the value of ki, even if all parties can estimate the
value of ki from knowledge of ri, )i and .

                                                      11
to the J-maker from reaching agreement is yJ(c*i - i). Correspondingly, since investment, ki, is sunk,

supplier i maximizes variable profit 1i + ki = yJ(pi - ci) with a threat point of no production and zero

profit. Letting   [0,1] represent the bargaining power of the J-maker and 1- the bargaining power

of each supplier, it follows28, using         i
                                                  = pi - ri and       = ci - c*i, that at the Nash bargaining

equilibrium,

                               pi - ci = (1-)(ri - ) and    i
                                                                 = c*i - (ri - ) > 0.                        (4)

As (4) shows, supplier i gains a share, 1-, of the net rent, ri - , that it creates due to relationship-

specific investment. The J-maker’s share, , of net rent is reflected in a reduction in the marginal
          i
cost,         , of part i below the cost c*i of an imported part, but          i
                                                                                   remains strictly positive. The

respective payoffs to the J-maker and supplier i (relative to the disagreement point) are: yJ(c*i -            i
                                                                                                                   )

= yJ(ri - ) and 1i + ki = yJ(pi-ci) = yJ(1-)(ri - ). This implies that (with ki sunk), agreement is

reached for supplier i to produce the part if and only if the rent created from investment is

sufficiently large to make ri -       0. Thus all J-suppliers remaining as producers set ki > 0. If ri -

< 0, then part i is imported. Consequently, supplier i’s profit at stage 2 is

                        1i = yJ(1-)(ri - ) - ki if ri -  0;         1i = - ki if ri - < 0.                  (5)

2.3. Stage 1: Relationship-specific investments and output

          At the Cournot-Nash equilibrium at stage 1, the J and A-makers set their outputs and J-

suppliers simultaneously set their investment levels to maximize their respective profits. For J-

suppliers, this involves the optimal choice of investment supposing that they would produce the part

and also the decision whether to remain in the market. With respect to the first decision, supplier i

sets ki  0 to maximize 1i as in (5), taking yJ, yA and the investments kj for j g i of the other


   Setting pi to maximize Gi  yJ(c*i- i)(pi-ci)1-, we obtain dlnGi/dpi = (1-)/(pi-ci) - /(c*i- i) = 0. Using
     28

c - ri > 0 in (4), we obtain i = (1-)c*i + (ci - ri) > 0.

suppliers as given29. Using ri = wo)ih(ki), this gives rise to the Kuhn-Tucker first order conditions30:

                         01i/0ki = yJ(1 - )wo)ih1(ki) - 1  0 and (01i/0ki)ki = 0,                       (6)

which define ki = k()i,yJ) where 01i/0ki = 0 if ki > 0 and ki = 0 if 01i/0ki < 0 (parameters  and 

are omitted for convenience). Since investment takes place only if J-suppliers receive some rents,

we assume  < 1. As for the decision to remain in the market, it follows, setting ki = k()i,yJ) in (5)

for ri -      0, that, with free trade in parts, supplier i would produce the part if and only if 1i  0.If

bargaining would break down (i.e. if ri  < 0) or if production revenues are positive (due to ri -

 0), but are not sufficient to cover the cost of investment, then supplier i exits the market and part

i is imported.

           From the ordering of parts from low to high cost-shares, investment, ki, and rent, ri, are

increasing in i for ki > 0 (see (A2) of the Appendix). Supposing that suppliers i and j for i > j make

the same level of investment, then since )i > )j, part i generates a higher level of rent, which is partly

captured by each supplier based on the share 1-. This translates into a higher incentive to invest

with the result that ki > kj and 1i > 1j. Thus from (5), using 01i/0ki = 0 and 0ri/0)i = ri/)i, we

obtain:

                                  d1i/di = yJ(1-)ri )1(i)/)(i) > 0 for ki > 0.                            (7)

Expressing 1i = 1(i,yJ;) at the stage 1 equilibrium and supposing that part i = T (T for trade)

satisfies

                              1T = 1(T,yJ;) = yJ(1-)(rT - ) - k()T,yJ;) = 0,                            (8)

it then follows that T represents the marginal or lowest cost-share part produced by the keiretsu. If



  29
       The investments kj for j g i and output yA influence ki only through their effects on yJ.
  30
       For  < 1, 1i is strictly concave in ki, since, from (6), 021i/(0ki)2 = yJ(1)wo)(i)h2(ki) < 0.

10 = 1(0,yJ;)  0, then all parts are produced in the keiretsu31.

           As illustrated in Fig. 1, parts i with equal or higher cost-shares (i.e. for i  T) are produced

within the keiretsu and parts i with lower cost -shares (i.e. for i < T) are imported. Production and

investment takes place in the keiretsu only if this raises efficiency relative to importing. Thus, for

i  T, the rent from investment ki, shown as the difference between c(i) and the dashed line, c(i) -

r(i), more than offsets the efficiency gap so as to at least cover the investment cost. For i < T, the

difference between these lines is the rent that would have been created if the part had been produced

in the keiretsu.




                    Fig. 1: Costs and the range of imported parts


           From (8), using (7), since yJ varies exogenously due to a VER, it is useful to express the

marginal part T as a function T = T(yJ;), where dT/dyJ < 0 from (A4) of the Appendix. The increase

in profit associated with an increase in yJ allows more J-suppliers to remain in business and hence



 31
      If 10 > 0, then since (7) implies 1i > 0 for all i  [0,N], T is not defined.

reduces the range of imported parts. Also, since T varies due to a VIE (see next section), we express

the J-maker’s marginal cost as         = (T,yJ;), where        = ,0T c*i di + ,TN    i
                                                                                          di + wo. Letting C*(N)

 ,0N c*(i)di denote the total cost of parts if all parts are imported and using           i
                                                                                               = c*i - (ri - ) from

(4),     can be rearranged into the form:

                                  = (T,yJ;) = C*(N) - ,T N (ri - )di + wo.                                    (9)

          As (9) shows, if  > 0, then the rents from relationship-specific investment reduce marginal

cost below the level, C*(N) + wo, achieved when all parts are imported, but if  = 0, then                        is

constant whether or not parts are imported. Since, this latter possibility would prevent a determinate

outcome as to the set of imported parts under a VIE (see Proposition 2 below), we assume  > 0. It

is true that if J-suppliers had all the bargaining power (i.e. if  = 0), they would set ki at an efficient

level for a fixed level of yJ, but this is not optimal since, as shown by Spencer and Qiu (2001), a

small increase in  would reduce the J-maker’s marginal cost, leading to an increase in output and

aggregate J-supplier (and keiretsu) profit32. Since we require  < 1 for ki > 0, this implies   (0,1)

and hence that all parties have some bargaining power.

          Now considering the determination of output, since at the Nash equilibrium in yJ, yA and ki,

the J-maker sets yJ treating ki (and yA) as fixed, it follows (see (9)) that the J-maker treats ri and hence

  as fixed. Thus, there is no strategic role for output in influencing the prices paid for parts at the

second stage bargaining game. Since the A-maker sets yA to maximize %A as in (3) taking yJ (and ki)

as given, final-good outputs, yJ and yA satisfy the standard Cournot first order conditions:

                %JJ  0%J/0yJ = P + yJP1 -      = 0 and %AA  0%A/0yA = P + yAP1 - * = 0,                      (10)

where subscripts J and A represent partial derivatives with respect to yJ and yA respectively.

      J-suppliers benefit due to pi - ci > 0, but the J-maker would prefer a higher value of .

Assuming that the following second order and stability conditions

                          %JJJ = 2P1 + yJp2 < 0, %AAA = 2P1+ yAP2 < 0 and

                          Ho  %JJJ%AAA - %JJA%AAJ > 0 = p1(3p1+Yp2) > 0,                             (11)

hold globally, conditions (10) define equilibrium output levels, yJ = yJ( ) and yA = yA( ) where the

constant * is omitted for convenience. However, the dependence of ki = k()i,yJ) on yJ means that

     = (T,yJ) is also dependent on yJ and hence we require the additional (global) stability conditions:

                            %JJJ - d /dyJ < 0 and H  Ho - %AAA(d /dyJ) > 0,                          (12)

where for  > 0, d /dyJ = (0 /0T)(dT/dyJ) + 0 /0yJ < 0 from (A4) and (A5) of the Appendix. From

(10), treating     as a constant with respect to yJ, we first obtain the standard result that an increase

in     reduces yJ and then, using (12) to take account of the effect of yJ on , we obtain:

                      dyJ/d = %AAA/Ho < 0 and 1 - (dyJ/d )(d /dyJ) = H/Ho > 0.                        (13)

In the event that T is fixed due to a VIE, we require 1 - (dyJ/d )(0 /0yJ) > 0, but since d /dyJ <

0 /0yJ < 0, this condition is implied by (13). Also, for consideration of trade policy, it is useful to

assume that outputs are strategic substitutes (i.e. %iij = p1+ yip2 < 0 for i g j) and hence that

                         dyA/dyJ = - %AAJ/%AAA < 0 and dyJ/dyA = - %JJA/%JJJ < 0.                     (14)

          Finally, taking into account the endogenous determination of both output and investment and

using a superscript F to denote values at free trade, the set of imported parts is given by     F
                                                                                                     {i: i

< TF}, where

                         TF = T(yJF;) for yJF = yJ( F) and   F
                                                                  = (TF,yJ( F);).                    (15)

Letting T=N represent the value of  at which supplier N just breaks even (i.e. 1(N,yJ;T=N) = 0),

then TF = N and all other parts are imported. Similarly, letting T=0 satisfy 1(0,yJ;T=0) = 0, then TF

= 0 and all parts are produced in the keiretsu. Since, as shown in (A8) of the Appendix, an increase

in  causes a reduction in TF, parts are fully supplied by imports for   [0, T=N) and by the keiretsu

3. Voluntary import expansion: VIE

          This section concerns the effects of VIEs designed to open the Japanese market for imported

parts. Three types of VIE’s are considered: a content VIE, a market-share VIE and a total-value VIE.

A content VIE specifies a minimum level of U.S. content per auto produced in Japan, whereas the

market-share target under a market-share VIE depends on U.S. content per auto, but also on the way

Japanese parts are valued. A natural possibility, which we focus on here, is that Japanese parts are

valued at their marginal cost, ci, of production34. This reflects the idea that the rents enjoyed by the

J-maker from the purchase of keiretsu produced parts and also the prices of these parts as obtained

through bargaining would be hard for outsiders to observe, particularly if the observers are foreign,

such as the U.S. government. Marginal cost, ci, is more easily observable, since ci is the price that

supplier i would quote if it were to sell to outside firms, such as the U.S. automaker. The third

possibility of a total-value VIE also depends on U.S. content per auto, but in addition, induced

changes in Japanese production of autos play a central role in achievement of the target.

          As argued by Krishna et al. (1998), the effects of a VIE can depend crucially on how it is

implemented. In the current setting, it seems most natural to suppose that the J-maker is responsible

for achieving compliance with the policy. One possibility, developed in the next section, is that the

J-maker’s actions are motivated by a threat of a VER or tariff. However, our results also apply if


 33
      We assume that max is sufficiently large that 1(0,yJ;max) > 0 and hence that T=0 < max.

   As shown in an earlier working paper, Qiu and Spencer (2000), our results also apply if Japanese parts
are valued at the J-maker’s net marginal cost, i = pi - ri . The valuation method for parts is important for
Proposition 2 (below), showing that the VIE is satisfied by importing parts in the order of lowest to highest
cost-share, but given this result, the particular method used does not affect the further insights.

                                                      17
compliance by the automaker to the VIE is achieved by direct pressure from the Japanese

government as was partly the case in the 1986 semiconductor agreement (see Irwin, 1996, pp 11-12).

Pressure to make buying firms responsible is understandable, particularly since the complaints

leading to VIEs commonly involve beliefs of unfair procedures by buying firms. For example, with

respect to auto parts, U.S. firms complained that they had difficulty in obtaining the necessary

information for bids (see Levinsohn, 1997, pp.15-16).

        With respect to the order of moves, we assume that governments commit to trade policy, such

as a VIE , a VER or a tariff, prior to any actions by firms. In response to a VIE, the J-maker makes

a commitment at stage 0 to import at least the set of parts denoted by          . The quantity of these

imports is subsequently determined by the J-maker’s need for parts arising from its equilibrium level

of output. Since the J-maker sees through to the outcome of the game, the set        is chosen to ensure

compliance with the VIE (if feasible). There are no other changes in the order of moves. Decisions

as to investments, ki, and final-good outputs, yJ and yA , are made at stage 1, with bargaining over

the prices for parts within the keiretsu at stage 2.

        It is important to emphasis that at stage 0, the J-maker makes no commitment as to the set

of parts to be purchased from J-suppliers. These parts are endogenously determined as before,

leaving open the possibility that further parts in addition to          will be imported. Thus, while

compliance with the VIE requires some commitment by the J-maker as to a minimum set of imports,

the model maintains the feature that the J-suppliers do not get an advance contract before making

relationship-specific investments35. It is also important that the modification of the model to allow

for a first mover capability of the J-maker at stage 0 confers no strategic advantage and has no effect


 35
   A commitment by the J-maker at stage 0 not to import a particular part would change the threat point at
the bargaining equilibrium, affecting the incentives for investment and the prices paid for parts.

on the outcome of the model under free trade. To show this, recalling that                     = {i: i < TF} represents

the set of parts that would be imported at free trade, since J-suppliers for i                F
                                                                                                   would anyway make

losses from production, an up-front commitment to import parts in                     does not change the outcome.

Secondly, as we show in Proposition 1, the import of any additional part j Õ                       F
                                                                                                       serves to raise the

J-maker’s marginal cost due to a loss of relationship-specific investment. Thus the J-maker’s output

and profit falls (and the A-maker’s profit rises). Consequently the J-maker would not use its

commitment ability to import additional parts under free trade and any difference in outcome under

the VIE is due to the effects of the VIE and not to a change in the strategic behavior of firms.

        To further explain Proposition 1, suppose that at stage 0, the J-maker announces the import

of part j Õ    F
               . Since rj -       > 0, the J-maker’s marginal cost,      j
                                                                              c*j - (rj - ), for part j  [TF, N]

from supplier j is strictly less than the import price, c*j, giving rise to a direct increase in the J-

maker's marginal cost of:

                             mj  c*j -   j
                                              = (rj - ) > 0 for  > 0 and j  [TF, N].                              (16)

At stage 1, the increase in the direct cost due to kj = 0 will cause a reduction in yJ and a reduction in

ki and ri for i g j and i  [TF, N], reinforcing the fall in the J-maker’s profit. The A-maker’s profit

increases since outputs are strategic substitutes. The proofs of all propositions, including Proposition

1, are in the Appendix.

Proposition 1. For   (0,1), commitment by the J-maker to an import set                        that includes at least

one part j Õ       F
                       will result in (i) an increase in marginal cost for part j, (ii) higher             and lower k i,

r i, y J and % J and (iii) higher % A compared with free trade.

        Proposition 1 reflects the fact that the use of keiretsu suppliers raises efficiency. However,

this conclusion is quite different from common beliefs arising without consideration of the keiretsu



                                                           19
structure. Part of the impetus for the U.S./Japan Auto Agreement arose from complaints that keiretsu

“unfairly” purchase more expensive Japanese auto parts rather than cheaper U.S. imports. Thus, a

VIE directed at opening the Japanese parts market was expected to reduce Japanese production costs

(lower ) and raise Japanese output of autos ( larger yJ). As a result, in addition to an increase in U.S.

market share, a VIE was expected to increase the total Japanese demand for parts, further raising the

value of U.S. parts exports. Since, taking into account the endogenous determination of relationship-

specific investment within keiretsu, a VIE would reduce Japanese production of autos, our results

suggest that a VIE requiring a given market share for parts could be significantly less effective than

expected in raising the value of U.S. parts exports.

          Now turning to the question as to the types of parts that will be imported first in response to

the VIE, in making this choice (at stage 0) the J-maker is assumed to maximize profit subject to

satisfying the VIE. Suppose that the J-maker announces the import of just one part j Õ               F
                                                                                                         at stage

0. To the extent that part j has a higher cost-share, there is a greater loss of rent from investment,

which causes the direct cost, mj, incurred by the J-maker to rise36. This suggests, as shown in

Proposition 2, that to satisfy a VIE, additional parts j  [TF, N] will be imported in the order from

lowest to highest cost-share. However, to prove this result37, it is necessary to also take into account

the contribution, c*j, of each additional imported part towards achieving an increase in U.S. content.

Consequently, it is the effect of a higher cost-share on mj/c*j that is important, and since the use of

higher cost parts will allow the VIE target to be met with a smaller range of imported parts (c*j is



 36
      From (16) and (A2) of the Appendix, we obtain dmj/dj = (drj/d)j))1(j) > 0 for  > 0.
 37
    Linear demand simplifies the proof of Proposition 2(iii) for the total-value VIE by ensuring that dyJ/d
is constant. The result generalizes to other demand structures if d2yJ/(d )2 < 0 so the effect of an increase in
   in reducing output is magnified as increases or, alternatively, if d2yJ/(d )2 > 0 but sufficiently small.

also increasing in j), this complicates the proof and the result is not obvious.

Proposition 2. Assume   (0,1). To satisfy (i) a content VIE, (ii) a market-share VIE or (iii) for

linear demand, a total-value VIE, additional parts, j  [TF,N], above the free trade level will be

imported in the order determined by increasing cost-shares (i.e. import lower ) j).

          As a result of Proposition 2, a (feasible) VIE target for any of the three forms of VIE is

implemented by the import of the set of parts denoted ∆T  {i: i < 
                                                                   T} where 

raises U.S. content per auto, but reduces the J-maker’s output, it is possible that a greater range of

imported parts can actually lower the total value of imports39 (making dV*T/dT < 0) and hence that

                                                                         *, is satisfied. However,
there may be more than one value of T at which some total-value target, V

                      equal to the smallest value of T  (TF, ) satisfying V*T = V
the J-maker will set T                                                              *so as to

minimize the increase in marginal cost due to the loss of relationship-specific investment.




 38
   Since an increase in T (and U.S. content) reduces Japanese content (i.e.v1(T) = - cT < 0), we obtain S*1(T)

            Fig. 2: Value of U.S. parts exports


        As illustrated in Fig. 2, we can gain some insights as to the pattern of response in the total

value of U.S. parts exports based on the size or restrictiveness of the VIE target as well as on the

magnitude of the productivity, , of relationship-specific investment. If  is sufficiently large that

there are no imports at free trade (i.e. if  = T=0 and hence TF = 0), then any VIE, even a drastic VIE

which forces Japan to use only imported parts, must result in an increase in the value of U.S. exports.

Thus, as shown by the solid line from the origin at TF = 0, corresponding to  = T=0, V*T is positive

         > 0, reaching a value of V*N under a drastic, content or market share VIE, which is
for any T

                   = N. However, it is quite possible that the value of U.S. exports is not maximized
satisfied only at T

    = N. As Fig. 2 indicates, V*T initially increases with T, but, as the VIE becomes more
at T

restrictive, the reduction in the J-maker’s output may eventually cause V*T to fall, leading to an

M, would not maximize the value of U.S. exports.

          As this possibility suggests, a content or market-share VIE, particularly if it is highly

restrictive, may actually be counterproductive as a means of raising the total value of U.S. parts

exports. By contrast, a total- value VIE has the advantage of retaining more flexibility for the J-

maker as to the range of parts to be imported. Consequently, faced with a total-value VIE requiring

the same total value of U.S. exports as would be achieved from a content or market-share VIE at

      > M, the J-maker would import fewer parts (with T
some T                                                  < M) so as to satisfy the VIE based on

a lower U.S. content per auto, but a higher level of production. However, a less restrictive content

                                                     M would have exactly the same effects as
or market-share VIE that can be satisfied for some T

a total-value VIE with the same total value of U.S. exports.

          Since the J- maker’s loss of output tends to be larger the greater the productivity, , an

internal maximum for U.S. exports is most likely if  = T=0 (see Fig. 2) and there are no (or very

few) exports at free trade. However, an internal maximum is also possible for lower productivity

settings in which a significant range of U.S. parts are exported at free trade. As illustrated by the line

from V*A to V*N, corresponding to T=A and TF = A, a lower productivity  results in a positive

                                                                               (below N) is reduced41.

   A sufficient condition for an internal maximum is dV*T/dT         = N. Since an increase in U.S. content

VIE at T                          = N would reduce the value of these exports below the level, V*A,

achieved at free trade. Moreover, at an even lower productivity (and higher free trade level of

imports), it is possible that the value of U.S. exports is maximized at free trade and hence would be

reduced by any market-share VIE, small or large. As this last possibility indicates, a total-value VIE

with any target above the free-trade level may actually not be feasible.



4. Voluntary export restraint (VER) or tariff

       This section develops the effects of a VER, or alternatively a tariff, applied to U.S. imports

of Japanese autos as they work through the vertically connected markets, taking into account the

further linkages to relationship-specific investment within the keiretsu. This is of interest in itself

since VERs and tariffs have commonly been applied to Japanese auto exports, but the main objective

is to provide comparisons with the effects of VIEs so as to gain a better understanding of the

implications of both types of policies for access to the Japanese market for imported parts.

       A VER specifies a maximum value of imports of a particular good from a particular country.

Since we have assumed that all of the final good is consumed in the U.S., a binding VER would limit

keiretsu production and exports of autos to a given level, denoted by *
                                                                      yJ where *
                                                                               yJ < yJ( ). Since there

is no change in the free trade relationships involving parts suppliers, similar to (15), the VER gives

rise to a set of imported parts,     y
                                          {i: i < TF for TF = T(y*J;)} and a marginal cost       y
                                                                                                       

    *J;),y*J;) for the J-maker where the superscript y represents equilibrium values under a VER.
 (T(y

This analysis is easily adapted to apply to a tariff. Given Cournot behavior in the final-good market,

a VER differs from a tariff only because the J-maker rather than the U.S. government receives the

                                                  24
quota rents. Thus if a specific tariff, denoted t, restricts the J-maker’s output to yJt, then the J-maker’s

marginal cost is given by -  (T(yJt;),yJt;) + t for yJt = yJ(-). Setting yJt = *
                                                                                  yJ, then, since - =      y


                                                                                                       y
+ t, the J-maker’s marginal cost is higher by the amount of the tariff, but the import set,             , is

unchanged and the tariff is otherwise equivalent to the VER.

        We first show, in Proposition 3, that a VER (or tariff) applied to final-good exports has a

market opening effect with respect to the range and market share of imported parts. This is due to

the endogenous response of relationship-specific investment. By reducing the J-maker’s output, the

VER (or tariff) causes this investment to fall and, since production by some J-suppliers becomes

content per auto and hence U.S. suppliers gain a larger share of the Japanese parts market. Not

surprisingly, keiretsu investment is crucially important for this result. In standard models without

relationship-specific investments, a reduction in a country’s final-good output would reduce that

country’s demand for intermediate-goods, including the demand for imports.

                                                               y J, and relationship-specific

                             * J), enlarging the set
investment, ki, but raises T(y                            y
                                                              of imported parts and the U.S. share of the

Japanese parts market.

        Although a VER (tariff) and a VIE (all three types) both enlarge the range of imported parts

and reduce keiretsu output, comparing the magnitudes of these effects, we show in Proposition 4((i)

and (ii)) that the VIE is more effective in raising the range of imported parts (for a given level of the

J-maker’s output) and the VER is more effective in reducing the J-maker’s output (for a given range

of imported parts). Letting V*y  v*(T)y
                                       *J for T = T(y*J,) represent the total value of U.S. parts

exports under the VER and comparing the policies for the same value of these exports (i.e. for V*y



                                                    25
= V*T), it follows, as set out in Proposition 4(iii), that the import set is larger and the J-maker’s

output is smaller under the VER than the VIE. For this last comparison, we assume that the policies

raise the value of U.S. exports in the relevant range: i.e. that,

                 dV*T/dT > 0 for T  [TF, T
                                           ] and dV*y/dyJ < 0 for yJ  [yJ( F), *yJ].               (17)

Proposition 4. (i) For yJ(   T
                              )=*
                                y J, the VIE enlarges the import set by more than the VER or tariff

      > T(y* J)). (ii) For T = T(y* J), the VER (tariff) restricts the J-maker’s output by more than the
(i.e.T

VIE (i.e. *
          y J < yJ( T)). (iii) Assume (17). If V*y= V*T, then the import set is larger and the J-maker’s

                                                              *J) > T and *y J < yJ(
output is smaller under the VER (tariff) than the VIE (i.e. T(y                          T
                                                                                          )).

        The basic insight is that a direct reduction in the range of keiretsu produced parts has less of

an effect in reducing relationship-specific investment and hence less of an effect in reducing output

than the same reduction in keiretsu produced parts achieved by a direct cut in output. Consequently,

for the same total value of U.S. parts exports, the VER has more of an effect in reducing output and

less of an effect in raising the range of imported parts than would a VIE. These results are not

surprising based on the idea that the more direct policy should have more of an effect on the variable

of interest (other things equal). Nevertheless, since the results depend on the relative strength of

effects on investment decisions by many firms in response to policies applied at different stages of

the vertical market, they are also not immediately obvious.

        Both types of policies reduce the J-maker’s profit due to the loss of output and relationship-

specific investment. However, as Proposition 4(iii) suggests, for the same total value of U.S. exports,

a VER would reduce the J-maker’s profit by more than the VIE and, as set out in Proposition 5, it

follows that a credible threat of such a VER is sufficient to induce the J-maker to comply with the




                                                   26
VIE without the need for further pressure from the Japanese government42.

Proposition 5. Assume (17). If V*y = V* T, then the J-maker’s profit is lower under the VER (tariff),

making the credible threat of such a VER (tariff) sufficient to induce compliance with the VIE.




        Fig. 3: VIE vs. VER for a constant value of U.S. parts exports.


        In Fig. 3, starting from free trade (at point F), the path of the import set (given by T) and the

J-maker’s output, yJ, as a VIE or a VER become more restrictive is shown by the solid lines FH and

FG respectively. Each contour V*I, V*II or V*M represents the combination of the range of imported

parts and the J-maker’s output required to produce a constant total value of U.S. parts exports. The

value of these exports ranges from V*I at free trade to the maximum value, V*M, achievable under

a VIE at 
         T = TM. The value, V*II, is reached with either a VIE at 
                                                                  T = TA or with a VER at *
                                                                                          yJ = yJB.



 42
   There is empirical evidence that the U.S. 1981 VER on autos raised the profits of Japanese automakers
(see Ries, 1993). If our model were relaxed to allow for more keiretsu automakers or for autos to be strategic
complements, then Japanese automakers could also benefit from the VER. However, the effects of a tariff
are robust and Propositions 3 and 4 are a consequence of the reduction in investment as output falls and do
not depend on the assumption of strategic substitutes or whether J-maker profit rises or falls.

                                                     27
Since yJA > yJB and TA < TB, this illustrates Proposition 4(iii). Since points H and G at T = N are

above V*I (and V*II), Fig. 3 illustrates a case in which both a drastic VIE and VER would raise the

value of exports above the free trade level. However, the value of U.S. parts exports is maximized

at an internal VIE corresponding to 
                                    T = TM.

        Finally, Proposition 6 examines the welfare implications of the VIE and VER policies.

Consumer welfare is represented by the additively separable utility function, u(Y) + Z, where u(Y)

is the utility from autos and Z is the utility from a tradeable numeraire good produced under pure

competition using labor alone. Supposing that all income is spent and that trade is balanced with all

autos sold in the U.S., it follows, letting 0 = 0(T, yJ)  ∫ NT ϕ (i, y J )d i denote the total profit of J-

suppliers, that welfare in the U.S. and Japan is respectively given by:

                             WA  u(Y)  P(Y)Y + %A and WJ = %J + 0,                                   (18)

where Y  yA + yJ and u1(Y) = P(Y). Aggregate or world welfare is W  WA + WJ.

Proposition 6. Assume (17). If a VIE and VER would achieve the same value of U.S. parts exports,

then, (i) U.S. welfare is higher under the VIE than under the VER if dWA/dyJ > 0, and lower if

dWA/dyJ < 0. (ii) Japanese welfare falls, but the reduction is less under the VIE than under the VER.

(iii) If *  , then world welfare falls, but the reduction is less under the VIE than under the VER.

        As Proposition 6(i) shows, the U.S. is better off using a VIE than a VER to achieve a target

value of U.S. parts exports if and only if the reduction in auto imports would lower U.S. welfare (i.e.

iff dWA/dyJ > 0). The import of fewer autos reduces consumer welfare by raising prices, but there

is potentially an offsetting gain due to the shift of profits to the A-maker from the J-maker.

Consumer interests tend to dominate if yA is sufficiently small relative to yJ (which occurs if the A-




                                                    28
maker has significantly higher costs43) and in this case, the VIE is preferred to the VER, but both

policies reduce U.S. welfare. For example, for the case of linear demand, the VIE dominates44 if and

only if yJ > 2yA. By contrast, if the A-maker is an equal or lower cost producer at free trade (i.e. if

 *     F
         ) then yJ  yA under free trade and the VER would dominate. Japanese welfare is reduced

by both policies, but as shown in Proposition 6(ii), the VIE is the better policy for Japan, since it

involves less of a reduction in Japanese output and relationship-specific investment due to a smaller

increase in the range of imported parts. Finally, Proposition 6(iii) shows that if the J-maker is an

equal or lower cost producer (i.e. if *          for        evaluated under the VIE or VER) then average

world production costs are increased by a reduction in yJ, making the VIE the preferred policy from

the point of view of world welfare.

        From a more general perspective, the welfare results are related to the theory of non-

economic objectives developed by Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1969) and Bhagwati (1971) in a setting

of pure competition. This is the idea that when variables are restricted to certain ranges by non-

economic objectives, then the least cost way to achieve these objectives is to choose the policy

intervention that directly affects the constrained variable. Although our results broadly satisfy this

insight, there are significant differences caused by the presence of other distortions in the economy

due to imperfect competition and incomplete contracts for relationship-specific investment. Thus

from the U.S. viewpoint, a VIE is only more cost effective than a VER in raising the total value of

parts exports from the U.S. if the secondary effects in other markets, such as the reduction in



  43
   This could be due to higher U.S. assembly costs. According to Dyer and Ouchi (1993, p53), for 1984,
U.S. assembly costs were higher than in Japan, both as a proportion of costs (23.1% vs 15.7%) and in total.
 44
    Using %AA = 0, we obtain dWA/dyJ = - YP1(dY/dyJ) + yAP1 = -YP1(dyA/dyJ) - yJP1, where dyA/dyJ < 0 for
strategic substitutes. For P2 = 0, using (11) and (14), we obtain dWA/dyJ = - P1(yJ - 2yA)/2 > 0 iff yJ > 2yA.

Japanese auto output due to the reduction in relationship-specific investment are actually

undesirable.



5. Concluding remarks

        Although a number of studies have addressed the effects of market opening policies such as

VIEs directed at Japan (see the Introduction), this literature has not considered how the response to

such policies is affected by the special nature of keiretsu. In this paper we develop the effects of

such policies in the context of the Spencer and Qiu (2001) model, which captures some important

features of long-term keiretsu supply relationships45, including relationship-specific investments and

bargaining over parts’ prices. There are at least three reasons for examining market opening policies

in a framework that explicitly incorporates keiretsu. First, keiretsu form a large part of the

manufacturing base of the Japanese economy and are responsible for a substantial share of both

imports and exports46. Secondly, much of the political pressure to impose market opening policies

with respect to Japan arises from complaints that trade barriers are created by keiretsu practices and

forms of organization. Finally, consideration of the keiretsu structure gives rise to some richer

predictions as to the effects of trade policies directed at opening the Japanese market.

        In keeping with the perception of a trade barrier, relationship-specific investment causes

some parts not to be imported by Japan, despite lower production costs in the U. S.. However, in

contrast with the beliefs of those pushing for intervention, the model predicts that if Japan is forced


 45
   Some other important features, such as cross-share holding, are not directly modelled. However, provided
asymmetric information continues to make relationship-specific investment non-contractible, cross
shareholding or even full vertical integration would not fundamentally change the nature of results.
 46
   In 1985, the keiretsu share of Japanese net income was around 32 %, accounting for about 25% of annual
sales in Japan, about 44% of Japan’s exports and about 68% of Japan’s imports (Lawrence, 1991, p.313).

                                                    30
to import more parts due to a VIE, this will reduce keiretsu efficiency (due to a loss of relationship-

specific investment), causing a fall in production levels and in Japanese demand for parts. It is even

possible that a VIE might reduce the total value of U.S. parts exports. The model also predicts that

any additional parts imported by Japan in response to market opening measures such as VIEs will

tend to be the least important for production, such as tail pipes and seat covers. Finally, consideration

of the keiretsu form of organization has significant implications for trade policies, such as VERs or

tariffs, that restrict the exports of final goods from Japan. Since relationship-specific investment is

reduced together with output, causing some keiretsu suppliers to be replaced by imports, a VER or

a tariff has a market-opening effect with respect to the range of parts imported by Japan.

Nevertheless, for any given value of U.S. parts exported to Japan, the VIE proves to be less costly

than the VER or tariff in terms of the loss of output and consumer welfare and also with respect to

the loss of Japanese profit. If consumer welfare dominates so that the U.S. would gain from an

increase in the purchase of autos, then the VIE would also reduce U.S. welfare, but by less than the

VER or tariff.

A.1. Comparative statics.

        First, using (2) to sign the terms, a useful expression for the comparative statics is

                                      i  (h1(ki))2/h(ki)h2(ki) > 0 for ki > 0.                          (A1)

From differentiation of d1i/dki = 0 as in (6), we obtain dki/d)i = - h1(ki)/)ih2(ki) and since dri/d)i =

woh(ki)[1 + )ih1(ki)(dki/d)i)/h(ki)] from (1), it follows, using (A1) and (2), that for ki > 0,

                          dki/d)i = - h1(ki)/)ih2(ki) > 0 and dri/d)i = ri(1+i)/)i > 0.                   (A2)

        Similarly from (6) for ki >0, using dri/dki = rih1(ki)/h2(ki) and (A1), we obtain:

                             dki/dyJ = - h1(ki)/yJh2(ki) > 0 and dri/dyJ = rii/yJ > 0.                    (A3)

Also, since   (0,1), supposing that T = T(yJ;) satisfying (8) exists (i.e. 10 = 1(0,yJ;)  0), it follows

from (8) using 01T/0yJ = (1-)(rT- ) > 0 and (7) that

                                          dT/dyJ = (rT ))T/yJrT)1(T) < 0.                                (A4)

Since   (0,1), it follows from (9) that       = (T,yJ,) has partial derivatives:

                            0 /0T = (rT - ) > 0, 0 /0yJ = - ,TN (dri/dyJ)di < 0.                         (A5)

        Next examining changes in , since 01TF/0 = yJ(1)rT/ > 0 (from (8) using 01TF/0kT = 0), it

follows using (7) that for yJ held fixed and   [T=N, T=0],

                            0T/0 = )(T)/)1(T) < 0.                                                      (A6)

Since 0ki/0 = - h1(ki)/h2(ki ) > 0 for ki > 0 from (6) using i as in (A1), we also obtain 0ri/0 = wo)ih(ki)[1

+ ih1(ki)(0ki/0)/h(ki)] = ri (1+i )/ > 0 for ki > 0 and hence, from (9) and  > 0,

                                   0 /0 = - ,TN (0ri/0)di < 0 for T < N.                                (A7)

From    F
            = (TF,yJF;), TF = T(yJF,), yJF = yJ( F) and (13), using (A5), (A6) and (A7) to sign expressions,

we obtain d F/d = [(0 /0T)(0T/0) + 0 /0]H0/H < 0 and using (A4), (A6), (A9) and (13), it follows that:

                               dTF/d = (dT/dyJ)(dyJ/d )(d F/d) + 0T/0 < 0.                              (A8)

Finally, using      (T
                       ,yJ( );), (13), (A5) and (A7) , it follows that for  > 0:
                                 = (dyJ/d )(0 /0T
                           dyJ/dT                 )/[1 - (dyJ/d )(0 /0yJ)] < 0.

                           (dyJ/d)   *
                                      T   = (dyJ/d )(0 /0)/(1- (dyJ/d )(0 /0yJ)) > 0.                     (A9)

                                                         32
A.2. A VIE and the order of parts’ imports

            For Propositions 1 and 2, which involve consideration of the import of one additional part, we use

the discrete version of the model. The proofs could be adapted for the continuous model, but to have a finite

impact on marginal cost, this would require consideration of the import of a range of contiguous parts.

Proof of Proposition 1. Assume  > 0. For the discrete version of the model, parts i = 1, 2.. TF -1 are

imported at free trade and marginal cost at free trade is given (analogously to (9)) by :

                                                                         ∑
                                                                               N
                             F
                                 = (TF,yJF,) = C*(N) -                            m i + wo for mi = (ri - ).                         (A10)
                                                                             TF

Supposing the J-maker imports an additional part j  [TF, N], then, taking stage 1 levels of ki, yJ and yA as

given, this causes a direct increase, mj = c*j -                 j
                                                                     = (ri - ) > 0, in marginal cost (see (16)). Letting yJ–j denote

equilibrium output when part j is imported and taking into account induced changes in ki for i g j, the J-
                                          –j
maker’s marginal cost, denoted                , becomes:
                                          –j
                                                (TF,yJ–j,) + mj where yJ–j  yJ( –j).                                                (A11)

Next, from (A10) and (A11), evaluating 0 /0yJ for a given TF at some yJ between yJ–j and yJF, evaluating

dyJ/d   j
            at some   between      –j
                                        and         F
                                                        and applying the mean value theorem, we can express (TF,yJ–j,) -

 (TF,yJF,) = (0 /0yJ)(yJ–j - yJF) for yJ–j - yJF = (dyJ/d )(                      –j
                                                                                        -   ). Since d /dyJ < 0 /0yJ < 0, we obtain 1 -
                                                                                            F



(0 /0yJ)(dyJ/d ) > 0 from (13) and using (A10) and (A11), it follows that for  > 0, a commitment at stage

0 to import part j  [TF, N] causes the following increase in the J-maker’s marginal cost at stage 1:
                                               –j

Since dyJ/d < 0, yJ falls causing ki and ri to fall. Also, from(3), using (11), (13) and (14), we obtain, d%J/d

= -yJ(1-p1(dyA/dyJ)(dyJ/d )) = -yJp1(2p1+yJp2)/Ho < 0 and d%A/d = yAp1(dyJ/d ) > 0.                                                        a

            The proof of Proposition 2 uses the following result, which we refer to as Lemma 1.

Lemma 1: The direct increase mj/c* j in the J-maker’s marginal cost per unit of the increase in U.S. value

added from the import of part j is strictly increasing in j for all j  [TF,N].

Proof: Letting )s > )j for parts j,s  [TF,N] it follows using mj = (rj - cj) from (16), that ms/c*s - mj/c*j =

6/c*jc*s > 0 iff 6  c*j(rs - ) - c*s(rj - ) = (c*s - c*j) + c*jrs - c*srj > 0. Adding and subtracting c*jrjcs/cj,
we obtain c*jrs - c*srj = c*j(rs - rjcs/cj) - (c*scj - c*jcs)(rj/cj). Since                     = cj - c*j = cs - c*s, it follows that c*scj -

                                                                          33
c*jcs = (c*s - c*j) and hence that

                                             6 = (c*s - c*j) (1 - ri/ci) + c*j(rs - rjcs/cj).                                    (A13)

Using ri = wo)ih(ki) and )i = ci/C(N), we have rs - rjcs/cj = wo)s (h(ks) - h(kj)) > 0 for )s > )j and since ci -

ri > 0 (no free lunch from (1)), we obtain 6 > 0 from (A13).                                                                         a

Proof of Proposition 2: Since profit, %J = %J( ) = yJ(P(y)- ) for yJ = yJ( ), depends only on                               and d%J/d

< 0, the J-maker imports additional parts to minimize the increase in                               subject to achieving the VIE target.

Thus the first additional imported part j  [TF, N] is chosen to minimize the increase in marginal cost,                             –j
                                                                                                                                          -
 F
  , per unit of the contribution of part j to achieving the VIE target.

(i) For a content VIE, since part j  [TF,N] contributes c*j towards the target, it follows, using (A12), that

part j is chosen to minimize

                                       Mj (    –j
                                                     -   )/c*j = (mj/c*j)/[1 - (0 /0yJ)(dyJ/d )],
                                                         F
                                                                                                                                 (A14)

where 0 /0yJ is evaluated holding T =TF fixed. Since from Lemma 1 and (A14), Mj is strictly increasing in

j, the first part imported is j = TF, which has the lowest cost-share in [TF, N]. If the VIE is not satisfied, the

same argument can be repeated with respect to a second part, j  [TF+1, N], but with part j = TF now included

in the initial import set. In (A14), 0 /0yJ is then evaluated holding T fixed at TF + 1.

(ii). For market-share VIEs, denoting the free trade levels of U.S. and Japanese content (at marginal cost)

                        ∑            c *i and vF  v(TF)  ∑ T F c i respectively, the corresponding U.S. market share is
                            T F −1
by v*F v*(TF) 
                                                                   N
                            1

SF  v*F/7F where 7F  v*F + vF. If just one part j Õ                           F
                                                                                    is imported in addition to   F
                                                                                                                 , the U.S. market share

becomes SF+j  (v*F + c*j)/(7F - ) and the contribution towards satisfying the VIE is SF+j - SF. Consequently,

part j  [TF, N] is chosen so as to minimize:

                                                         MSj (   –j
                                                                       -    F
                                                                            )/(SF+j - SF).                                       (A15)

Using Mj  (   –j
                    -   )/c*j from (A14), we can express (A15) in the form MSj = MjXSj for XSj  c*j/(SF+j - SF)
                        F



and since SF+j - SF = (v*F + c*j)/(7F - ) - v*F/7F = (c*j7F + v*F )/7F(7F - ), we obtain

                                               XSj = 7F(7F - )/[7F + v*F( /c*j)] > 0.                                            (A16)

Next, letting part s satisfy )s > )j for j,s  [TF,N], it follows that the J-maker will choose parts j in increasing

order of cost-share on j  [TF, N] if and only if MSs - MSj = (Ms - Mj)XSs + Mj(XSs - XSj) > 0. Since XSs - XSj

                                                                           34
> 0 from (A16) and c*s > c*j for s > j and Ms - Mj > 0 from the proof of (i), the result follows.

(iii) For total-value VIEs, letting V*F  v*FyJ( F) denote the total value of U.S. exports at free trade, if part

jÕ      F
                 is imported in addition to                 F
                                                             , the total value of U.S. exports becomes V*F+j = (v*F + c*j)yJ(                 –j
                                                                                                                                               ) and

the contribution towards satisfying the VIE is V*F+j - V*F. Hence part j  [TF, N] is chosen to minimize MVj

(     –j
             -     F
                      )/(V*F+j - V*F). Using d2yJ/(d )2 = 0 from (13) and (11) for P2(Y) = 0 (linear demand), we have

y J(   –j
        ) - yJ( F) = (dyJ/d )(             –j
                                                -       ) and, using (18A), we obtain MVj  (
                                                        F                                              –j
                                                                                                            -   F
                                                                                                                )/(V*F+j - V*F) = 1/[v*F(dyJ/d )

+yJ(        –j
             )/Mj]. Since Ms > Mj from the proof of (i) and yJ(                        –s
                                                                                        ) < yJ(   –j
                                                                                                   ), it follows that yJ(      –s
                                                                                                                                 )/Ms < yJ(    –j
                                                                                                                                                   )/Mj

and hence MVs > MVj, proving the result.                                                                                                            a

A.3. Effects of trade policies

Proof of Proposition 3. Since trade in parts is not restricted by a VER or tariff, parts continue to be imported

                                                                               *J > 0 for ki > 0 from (A3) and
in the same order (i.e. increasing cost-share) as under free trade. Since dki/dy

   *J)/dy
dT(y    *J < 0 from (A4), a reduction in *yJ due to a VER reduces ki and increases                                    y
                                                                                                                          leading to a rise in U.S.

content per auto and market-share in the same way as for a VIE. For the tariff, from - = (T,yJ; ) + t for

yJ = yJ(-) and T = T(yJ(-),), it follows, using (13) that d-/dt = 1/[1 - (d /dyJ)(dyJ/d )] > 0 and dyJ/dt =

(dyJ/d-)(d-/dt) < 0. Setting yJ(-) = *
                                     yJ, the results follow for the tariff as for the VER.                                                          a
                                                                                         > TF = T(yJ( F)), then
Proof of Proposition 4. We first show that if the VIE is binding at free trade (i.e. if T

expression reduces to 1- (d /dyJ)(dyJ/d ) > 0, which is the stability condition (13). Since for a VER (or tariff
