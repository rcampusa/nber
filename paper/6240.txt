       Low saving rates raise questions about Americans’ ability to maintain consumption levels

in old age. Using the Health and Retirement Study, this paper explores asset holdings among a

nationally representative sample of people on the verge of retirement. Making reasonable

projections about asset growth, we assess how much more people would need to save in order to

preserve consumption levels after retirement. We find that the median older household has current

wealth of approximately $325,000 including pensions, social security, housing, and other financial

wealth, an amount projected to grow to about $380,000 by retirement at age 62. Nevertheless, our

model suggests that this median household will still need to save 16% of annual earnings to preserve

pre-retirement consumption. For retirement at age 65, assets are expected to be about $420,000 and

required additional saving totals 7% of earnings per year. These summary statistics conceal

extraordinary heterogeneity in both assets and saving needs in the older population. Older high

wealth households have 45 times more assets than the poorest decile and this disparity increases with

age. There are also large differences in prescribed saving targets, ranging from 38% of annual

earnings for those in the lowest wealth decile to negative rates for the wealthiest decile.

         Future retirees will bear a larger responsibility for ensuring their own well-

being in retirement, judging horn projected social security system insolvency and

the national shift from defined benefit to defined contribution private pension

plans. Yet household saving rates in the United States have dropped from over

10% in   the 1950’s to around 3% in the first half of the 1990’s (Gokhale et al. 1996).

This discouraging pattern raises serious concerns about Americans’ ability to

maintain consumption levels in old age. They are underscored by a recent research

controversy over whether workers are adequately prepared for retirement. A

comparison of baby boomers’ assets to those of their parents recently argued that

saving for retirement is on track (CBO 1993). But using a different benchmark, a

recent study concluded that US households were saving at only one-third the rate

needed to fund a comfortable retirement (Bernheim 1992, 1994). The present paper

contributesto this debate by using a rich new dataset, the Health and Retirement

Study, to explore patterns of asset accumulation and saving shortfall among a

cohort of older Americans. Our goals are to determine (1) how much retirement

wealth older people on the verge of retirement actually have, and (2) how much

more they would need to save if they wished to preserve consumption levels after

retirement. Our research will show that the median older household is projected to

have retirement wealth of approximately $400,000, yet will still need to save 16% of

annual income to preserve pre-retirement consumption. This summary statistic

conceals extraordinary heterogeneity in both assets and saving needs in the older

population.

        In what follows we first discuss the rationale for the replacement rate model

and prior studies examinin g saving behavior. Next we describe wealth levels and

composition for HRS households in 1992, and show how those wealth patterns

would be expected to change at retirement ages of 62 and 65. These wealth

measures are then converted to saving rates, which are then compared to optimal

saving rates required to smooth lifetime consumption. A final section spells out

implications.



I. Saving Patterns and Replacement Rates in a Life Cycle Model

        Economic models of saving behavior rely on a life cycle model in which

individuals are posited to maxim& e utility by smoothing consumption through

time. In this f&mework, people are predicted to save when they have periods of

relatively high
            .   income, and dip into accumulated savings or borrow when income is

relatively low, including in retirement .I One recent study implementing an

augmented life cycle model derived optimal saving rate paths using dynamic

programming, in which the optimal saving path proves to increase in age up to


1 Franc0 Modigliani was a believer in this model that garnered him the Nobel prize. When asked
what he would do with his prize money, he is alleged to have responded that he would spend l/T of
it where T represented the remaining (and assumed known) years of life remaining.

retirement (Bemheim 1992). 2 Predicted saving rates are then compared with

actual rates derived in empirical analysis of respondents. Bernheim concluded that

workers in his sample saved at only one-third (35%) the prescribed rate that they

should have been saving, if they sought to meet target consumption goals. However

this estimated shortfall omitted from peoples’ wealth levels the value of their net

housing wealth, on the argument that relatively few people liquidate their housing

on retirement.3 His calculations of saving shortfalls if housing assets are included

in retirement wealth is somewhat lower - on the order of about 16% per year. The

extent to which Bernheim’s results are generalizable is unclear, however, because

his sample is relatively small and better off than the average population. In

addition he focuses on the typical saving pattern rather than examining the

dispersion in saving shortfall, a topic of central interest below.

       A different approach to the retirement saving question relies on a

“replacement rate” approach. As we describe below, this methodology evaluates the

ratio of household income needed to finance desired retirement consumption

relative to annual pre-retirement income. The object here is to equate pre-

income is assumed to be exhausted. Then the household is posited to maximize utility in period T- 1
given uncertainty of living to period T. Actual consumption (and hence saving) is determined by
solving for CT-I given U(CT), the utility of consumption; p,the rate of pure time preference (discount);
PT.1, the probability of surviving from time T-l to time T ; and the objective function max U(CT.I)+PT.
1 PU(C’T). The process is then resolved for periods back to the starting point, and under a range of
assumptions regarding other variables.

3 Whether housing wealth should be included in a tally of retirement assets is a hotly debated issue.
Retirees are often reluctant to move from the houses they lived in while working, in which case they
see their housing wealth as an emergency contingency fund (and possibly serves as a bequest). In
addition, moving costs can make accessing housing equity expensive. However we note that
housing wealth may be used to increase consumption through mechanisms such as second

retirement and post-retirement consumption on an expected value basis4 Recent

work by Palmer (1988, 1991, 1993) uses several cross-section Consumer

Expenditure Surveys to examine this issue, and concludes that gross replacement

rates have varied over time depending on tax changes and household saving rates.

       An invaluable dataset with which to explore older Americans’ wealth

positions as they near retirement is the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This

extensive questionnaire on wealth and income was addressed to a nationally

representative sample of 7607 households in 1992, where at least one respondent

was age 51 to 61 and their spouses.5 Under certain restricted conditions,

researchers may also access special files needed for measuring pension and social

security wealth (described in more detail below). One previous study using these

data by Mitchell, Olson, and Steinmeier (hereafter MOS 1996), explored expected

present values of social security benefits for HRS respondents. A second analysis,

by Gustman, Mitchell, Samwick, and Steinmeier (hereafter GMSS 1997) examined

both pension and social security wealth for these same households, using actual

pension information and imputed or estimated social security data.



mortgages,  home equity loans, and reverse mortgages, so in this paper we include housing wealth in
the set of assets that could finance retirement.

4 From a theoretical economic perspective, this is less appealing than a true life cycle-dynamic
programmin g approach as it ignores utility theory and behavioral responses to uncertainty.
However, it is a popular model among retirement planning practitioners and can be seen as a
relatively tractable approximation or rule of thumb to the life cycle model.

5 The HRS is structured as a longitudinal or panel data set with households re-sampled every two
years, and should prove a fertile source for researchers in the future. Currently only the first wave
is available in public release, and only public release data can be merged with the pension and
social security data to be described below. Further information on the HRS is available by Internet
at http://www.umich,edu/-hrswww.


Svgdoc - 05/05/97 - Moore/Mitchell
       These two studies show that estimated median total household wealth for

HRS respondents on the verge of retirement totaled approsimately $340,000 in

1992 (mean values were approximately half a million dollars). Total wealth

depends on four components: net financial wealth, net housing equity, and the

present value of expected pension and social security benefits. At face value, these

wealth amounts would seem to indicate that the “average” HRS household is in

relatively good shape for retirement. But in a follow-up study, Mitchell and Moore

(hereafter MM, 1997) assess the adequacy of these asset accumulations, and

suggest that the median older American family faces a substantial saving shortfall.

Specifically, n/n/r project anticipated wealth as of age 65 for a hypothetical median

couple, and then compare this with the level of wealth needed to sustain the

family’s pre-retirement consumption derived from targets offered by Palmer (1994).

The required saving rate needed to build assets to desired levels for this

representative HRS household is quite high - between 13% - 23% of gross income

per year in the decade leading up to retirement. In the next section we will explore

whether this conclusion - derived for a representative couple - is informative for

the older population
           ‘\        as a whole.



II. Initial and Projected Wealth in the Health and Retirement Study

       The present study improves on previous analyses in three ways. First, we

evaluate retirement wealth and saving needs for the entire nationally

representative sample of HRS households. This is important since focusing on a

median family conceals wide differences across the population, and asset levels are

S\*g.doc - OWOW97 - MoordMitchcll
quite disperse across older households. Second, our approach determines

replacement and saving rates jointly given the households earnings level and

projected assets to age 62 and 65. Third, we assess saving needs in the older

population as a whole, and describe these patterns by income and wealth level.

       The starting point for our analysis is an examination of HRS households’ net

wealth levels. The primary components of this wealth can be broadly categorized

into four groups?

        1) net financial wealth, including saving, investments, business assets, and

            non-residential real estate less outstanding debt not related to housing;

        2) net housing wealth, or the current market value of residential housing

            less outstanding mortgage debt;

        3) pension wealth, or the present value of employer-sponsored retirement

            benefits; and

        4) the present value of social security benefits.

 “Current” values for net financial wealth and net housing wealth are those

reported by-respondents in the HRS 1992 survey. Values for pension and social

security wealth
           .    reflect actuarial present values of these contingent income sources

based on service and salary through 1992 (see the Appendix). Pension wealth for

respondents with employer-provided pensions is calculated using software

developed at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan This

software uses information collected f%om employers of HRS participants to calculate



ti All wealth values reported in this   paper are weighted by I-IRS sample weights.

                                                                                           7


benefit streams based on workers’ salary and service. Social security wealth is

calculated using administrative records on covered earnings and benefit formulas

available from the Social Security Administration as described in Mitchell, Olson

and Steinmeier (1996).

       Values of current wealth by deciles are reported in Table 1. One result that

will not be surprising to many is the wide disparity of wealth across the population,

even though it is on the verge of retirement. The mean value in the tenth, or

wealthiest decile, is $1.8 million, or 45 times that of the mean value for the poorest

decile. The composition of this wealth also differs dramatically across wealth

deciles. For the poorest decile, the value of anticipated social security benefits is

greater than total wealth (107%), as a result of negative net housing wealth. At the

other end of the wealth distribution, expected social security benefits comprise less

than one-tenth of household wealth.

       Graphical representations of the data are also useful. Dollar estimates of

total wealth appear in Figure 1, and wealth sources by percentage are given in

Figure 2. I&III values for almost all sources monotonically increase in total

wealth, but the relative importance of the individual components varies across

group. For example, to focus first on social security payments, the present value of

these benefits falls as a fraction of total wealth as wealth levels rise, because of the

plan’s redistributive benefit formulas. Net housing wealth is negative for the

lowest decile, indicating that these households have over-levered their housing

stock. Beyond the poorest group, housing assets rise as a fraction of wealth,

attaining almost one-fifth of wealth for households in the middle of the total wealth

Svgdoc - OS/O5/97 - Moore/Mitchell
                                                                                                8



distribution, and then fall in relative importance for the wealthiest households.

Net financial wealth is rare among the poorer half of the wealth distribution:

households in the bottom two-fifths have less than $50,000 in assets of this sort.

Only the top two-fifths of the population have more than $100,000 in net financial

assets.

          Looking across the entire HRS sample, we see that the median household

group holds slightly over $325,000 in total wealth, while the mean household has

almost $480,000. Not only do levels differ; composition also varies across the mean

and median household. At the median, the split can be characterized as a “rule of

fifths.” Social security constitutes two-fifths of total wealth, and the other three

asset categories each comprise a fifth. This balance is shifted for the mean, since

net financial wealth plays a much more prominent role for wealthier households (it

comprises as much as two-thirds of wealth for the wealthiest group represented).

          It is interesting to compare our results to those reported by GMSS (1997),

who obtained a mean value of almost $500,000 in total net wealth, and $340,000

for the median 10% of households.7 These are very close to our estimated values of

$478,000 a,nd
           \ $325,000, respectively. Our figures differ because, first, GMSS
calculate a value for retirement health insurance ($7600 at the mean) which we do

not include; and second, our analysis uses social security wealth using actual

administrative earnings records. By contrast, GMSS did not use the restricted

55th percentile of the wealth distribution. This value is presented instead of the true median to

administrative records data, but instead estimate it from self reported earnings

data. Their estimated figures of $134,000 and $145,000 for the mean and median

values are slightly higher - around 10% -- than our mean and median of $120,000

and $134,000 calculated using actual Social Security Administration records. 8

Our estimates for pension wealth are very close to theirs, differing by less than 10%

($l,OOO)at the mean, ($117,000 versus $116,000).

       Having established current wealth levels and distributions for the HRS, the

nest step is to project existing assets to an assumed retirement age. We do this

because two households holding the same initial wealth in different forms could

prove to be in quite different circumstances a decade later, even assuming no

additional saving out of earnings. To examine this possibility we project assets to

two assumed retirement dates, the early and normal retirement ages for                   social


security. Age 62 is the age of earliest entitlement for early social security

retirement benefits and also corresponds to the modal retirement age in the United

States. The social security normal retirement age, historically 65, is the age at

which an individual is eligible for full, unreduced Social Security benefits and is a

decision. In the present study we follow HRS practice where the survey interviewer

designated as the primary respondent the household member with the greatest

knowledge of the household’s hancial matters. Usually this respondent was age-

eligible for the HRS survey; in this case we assume the retirement assumption is

triggered on this person’s attainment of age 62 or 65. If the primary respondent

was not HRS age eligible, this guarantees that the secondary respondent is age

eligible. In this instance, we assume that the retirement age is keyed off the

attainment of 62 or 65 by this household member.

       Asset values for each of these classes are projected to these retirement dates

using a range of projection technologies and assumptions.10 Net fLnancial wealth is

projected forward using averages of market returns based on historical rates.

Historical return rates are drawn from Ibbotson (1996). Housing wealth is projected

forward using survey data on the purchase price of the respondent’s house, year of

purchase, outstanding debt owed on homes, and mortgage payment amount and

frequency. The process consists of increasing the market value of the house into the

future, andalso reducing the debt outstanding on the house. We assume that the

market value
           . of the house grows in line with the general inflation rate so there is
no real appreciation in housing values; rather what does change is the amount

owed on the house for those with outstanding mortgage values. Each mortgage

payment decreases the remaining principal on the mortgage. Respondents’ pension


9 Legislation is increasing the normal retirement age to 67 over a period of several years, and for a
few HRS respondents the normal retirement age will be age 66.

10 hIore discussion of projection methodology and rates of growth are given in the Appendix.

and social securitv wealth values are projected assuming workers remain employed

to their respective retirement ages. Pension benefits are derived based on the plan

provisions of employer provided pensions and respondents’ answers to salary and

years of service (where appropriate). Social security projected amounts are

computed as described in MOS (1996). Present values of benefits are calculated

using mortality, interest rate, inflation, and wage growth assumptions as described

in the Appendix; all values are in 1992 dollars.

       Initial and projected wealth values for HRS respondents are reported in

Table 2. Median household wealth is anticipated to grow by almost 20% in real

terms by age 62, to slightly over $383,000. If retirement were postponed until 65,

the median household wealth value rises by approximately 30%, or $421,000. Mean

increases are similar in percentage terms and translate to wealth figures of

approsimately $566,000 and $625,000 at ages 62 and 65 respectively.

        While percentage changes are similar by decile, those in the top two wealth

deciles are projected to have amassed considerable additional net worth. The

second wealthiest decile has more than $1 million dollars on average, and the

wealthiest has more than $2.3 million. For the wealthiest decile, this is largely due

to financial and business assets which make up some 60% of assets ($1.4 million).

Pension assets make up 23% ($535,000 on average), leaving social security and,

surprisingly, net housing wealth as relatively unimportant 8% each. Yet this is still

almost $200,000 for both. Pension wealth plays a larger role for the ninth decile

comprising some 38% of total wealth




Svgdoc - OS/O5/97 - MoorcIMitchell
                                                                                                   12


        The most dramatic change in projected benefits is attributable to increases in

pension wealth, which is found to rise by one-third by age 62, and by one-h&by

age 65 for the mean household. For the median respondent family, pension present

value figures rise by nearly one-half and three-quarters for the same ages. By

contrast, social security wealth increases only 743% by age 62, and by about 20% by

age 65. Much of this difference is attributable to the well-known nonlinear accrual

pattern common to employer pensions, rewarding additional service at older ages.

A smoother pattern characterizes social security benefits, since most HRS

households have already reached entitlement and additional service changes their

benefits by relatively little .11 About the mean and median, the different rate of

growth of these asset classes has relative little impact in changing the composition

of projected wealth. Pension wealth does play a slightly larger role at the assumed

retirement ages, mostly gaining a few percentage points from net housing wealth

and social security.

       As social security plays a much greater role for the poorest decile, their

wealth gains to age 62 and 65 are relatively modest. The value of their social

security we,alth rises by about $6,000 to age 65, matched by gains in housing

wealth. Unfortunately, about half of these gains are offset by declines in the

average value of their fkancial and other assets, mainly due to decreases in vehicle

additional benefits may be accrued by extra years of contribution to social security.

value . 12 At 65 this poorest decile still has total wealth of under $50,000, the vast

majority of which (98%) is comprised of future social security benefits.

        It is important to note that averaging may mask significant differences at the

household level. For example, a household with $100,000 in pension wealth and

no housing assets at 55 looks very different at 62, than would an equivalent

household with a $100,000 house that is completely paid for. Both households will

look different than a household with the same $100,000 in net housing wealth but

with a substantial mortgage outstanding. Nonetheless, as we shall show below,

prospects are slim for projected movement across wealth deciles with age. Most of

those households that are projected to change deciles either move up or down a only

single decile. In other words, initial wealth is the best predictor of projected

retirement wealth: our estimated correlation between initial and projected wealth

to age 62 is 0.9’7. There is a much weaker correlation between initial earnings and

initial wealth, of 0.44, and a nearly identical correlation between earnings and

projected wealth.



III. Saving Needs, Replacement Rates, Wealth, and Income
           ,
        Having established that asset holdings are quite disperse in the HRS, the

question remains as to what this implies about saving needs and replacement rates

for retirement. In this section we assess target replacement and saving rates

jointly, given initial earnings levels and the households’ projected assets at age 62

and 65.

       To solve for saving and replacement rate targets simultaneously, we begin

with the basic replacement rate concept. This equates net income pre-retirement to

net income post-retirement: l3

       YP - G      - S = Y, - TF                                             0)

where YP is pre-retirement income, TP is pre-retirement taxes, S is saving,              YF   is

post-retirement income, and TF is pre-retirement taxes. Rearranging (l), dividing

through by YP, and expressing saving as a percent of income, S= s YP , gives the

formula for replacement rate, RR.

              Yp ( l - s ) - Tp +TF    Y,
       RR=                            =-                                     (2)
                       YP              YP

The replacement rate gives a target income level such that a household may smooth

consumption before and after retirement.

       The future income stream, YF , may then be converted to a level of wealth

needed to sustain that income level in retirement by multiplying by an appropriate

annuity factor,
           .    AF .I1 Thus the wealth level required to maintain a smooth

consumption profile in retirement is:



13 One could estend the analysis by allowing for changes in specific consumption prior to and after
retirement and Palmer (1994) does this. In this paper we do not model this possibility and note that
consumption choices are a decision variable rather than an exogenous variable, dependent on assets
and income.

14 Annuity factors are calculated with the same assumptions used for valuing pension and social
security wealth, a real interest rate of 2.3%, and the moderate assumptions used in the long range
projections of the Social Security Administration. Annuity factors employ the SSA mortality tables


Svgdoc - OWOY97 - Moo&Mitchell
                                                                                                15


       AF*Y,=AF”RR*Y, = AF[Y,(l-s)- Tp -I- TF]               .            (3)

The difference between this need level and the projected value of assets already

held by any given household, PROJ, is the amount that must be saved between now

and retirement, or the shortfall in projected retirement assets. This wealth shortfall

may be defined as:

       AF*Y,-PROJ = AF[Y,(bs)-T,+T,]- PROJ                                (4

      The wealth shortfall may f5nally be used to determine a prescribed saving

rate. This rate represents what the households would need to save as a percent of

income each year until retirement to achieve the projected consumption standard.

Assuming that a wealth shortfall is met by saving some level percent of earnings

per year, the amount saved at retirement would be:
 T                                  T

C Y,(l+JVg)’ (l+rhz)T-f s =sYcC (l+wg)' (l+ral)‘-’ = s Y, z               (5)
t=I                                f=I



where YC is the household’s current income, and wg and rtn are assumed rates of

wage growth and return on savings, respectively. Using (4) and (5) we can then

solve for a rate of saving s. Equating the two equations and solving for s gives

            ‘AF[Y, (l+wgy -Tp+TF]-PROJ
       s=                                                                  (6)
                     YJz+AF(l+wg)T]

       We note that it is not appropriate to simply pick a desired replacement rate

and solve for the resulting saving rate, or vice-versa. This is because a given

replacement rate might imply an infeasible saving rate given a household’s

earnings and projected assets. In addition, taxes depend on how much the

(see hIOS 1996). For married couples the annuity factor used was a Joint and Survivor annuity

                                                                                                        16


household has saved .15 Thus replacement rates and saving rates are determined

jointly through an iterative process. We fkst select an arbitrary replacement rate

as a starting point and use this replacement rate to determine an initial level of

post retirement income and taxes. Then resulting taxes are substituted into

equation (6) to obtain an implied saving rate. This saving rate is then substituted

into equation (2) to determine a new replacement rate. The process is then iterated

until saving and replacement rates converge such that both equations (2) and (6)

hold. For our calculations, reported earnings are used to determine taxes using the

IRS regulations in place for the 1991 tax year. Taxes are calculated using the

standard deductions and married couples are assumed to f3e jointly.16



IV. Saving and Replacement Rate Results

        Saving and replacement rates are reported for the 6306 HRS households who

reported positive earned income in 1991. For this group, the median prescribed

saving rate for retirement at age 62 in this sample is 16.1%, which corresponds to a

replacement rate of 69%. The saving rate drops to a more modest 7.3% if

retirementisI. delayed to age 65, with a replacement rate of 78.1%. In other words,



paying ‘is% to the surviving spouse.

15 Depending on how the saving is done, the rate of saving may effect either pre-retirement taxes,
post-retirement-taxes, or both. For our current calculations we assume saving out of earnings is
done on an after-tax basis so it only affects post-retirement taxes; all pension saving is assumed to
be pre- tax.

‘6We do not account for state and local taxes in this version of the paper. To the extent that these
differ pre- and post-retirement, this may bias calculated replacement rates. If pre-retirement state
and local taxes were higher than post-retirement taxes, this would lead to replacement rates being
overstated.

the later the retirement date, the lower is the prescribed saving rate needed to

achieve consumption smoothing.

       Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of prescribed saving rates across HRS

households, who are alternatively assumed to retire at either age 62 or 65. Vertical

lines represent, respectively, a zero prescribed saving level, and the median of the

distribution. Both distributions have large tails below zero, indicating that there is

a substantial segment of the population for whom additional savings is not

prescribed. For retirement at 62, almost a third (31%) of the population is in this

zero-or-negative saving category; for retirement at age 65, some 40% of the

population is estimated to not need any further saving out of earnings beyond

accumulation occuring “automatically” through asset appreciation. The peak of the

density functions lies to the right of the medians, indicating that the modal, or most

commonly prescribed, saving rate is in excess of the mean and median rates.

       To further describe the heterogeneity of saving and replacement rate

patterns across the HRS sample, we report median values in Table 3 sorted by 1992

wealth and .earnings deciles .17 One conclusion is that saving rates fall

monotonically,
           \ and replacement rates rise, with wealth. Another conclusion is that
many people are unlikely to be able to save signifkantly for retirement without

making drastic changes in their current consumption levels. For the poorest decile,



17 hIedians are presented instead of means as they give a more accurate representation of typical
values within decilcs. Means give curious results because of the presence of outliers; for example, a
saving rate value for a household where earnings are at the lower extreme for earnings within a
wealth dccile might indicate significant dissaving as optimal behavior, possibly to the tune of large
multiples of earnings. Averaging that value with others more representative of the subsample
mulct drastically understate the prescribed saving rate for the “typical” household.


Svg.doc - OS/O3/97 - MoorcIMitchell
                                                                                                     18


retirement at age 62 would require saving nearly 40% of pretax earnings. Waiting

to retire until 65 would require a more modest, yet still substantial, 27% of             gross


earnings. The pattern of saving shortfall extends quite far up the wealth

distribution: for each of the first four wealth deciles, prescribed saving rates to age

62 are greater than 20% of earnings and rates to age 65 are 13% or higher. By

contrast, prescribed saving rates are quite small at the top of the wealth

distribution. Those in the wealthiest decile have more than s&Cent assets to fund

a comfortable retirement, and for some, negative rates indicate that they could dip

into their stock of assets to enhance current consumption.18

       Another interesting result is that saving patterns switch sign for households

in the eighth and ninth wealth deciles, inasmuch as they have positive prescribed

saving rates to age 62, but negative ones to 65. This indicates that their “optimal”

retirement age assuming no further saving might lie somewhere between these two

ages. Households towards the middle of the wealth distribution have what are

substantial but perhaps not impossible savings targets if they want to retire at age

62, needing-to save ll- 18 % of income. This would yield replacement rates of about

two-thirds of. current earnings. If they continued to work to age 65, annual saving

needs would be cut in half, and replacement rates rise to approximately three-

quarters of current earnings.




1s Of course, it is possible that these households may have a strong bequest motive, in which case
the pure replacement model may understate their need and taste for saving. To the extent that
thcrc is heterogeneity in the desire to provide bequests, those with a stronger motive likely have
accumulatedgreater assets to date and appear here as “over-savers.”


Svg.doc - 08/05/97 - Moore/Mitchell
                                                                                      19


        A more traditional way of examinin g replacement and saving rates is to tally

these by household income rather than by wealth. The data in Panel B of Table 3

indicate that saving rates are quite negative for the lowest earnings decile: these

households would most likely desire to consume out of wealth prior to retirement if

they could. In practice, however, such households probably face substantial

liquidity constraints in that their wealth is not immediately available for

consumption. This would be the case for workers anticipating social security or

pension benefits at some future age.19

        The results in Table 3B also show that prescribed saving rates rise with

earnings. Those in the second pay decile need to save a little less than 6% of

income to achieve a replacement rate of 85% by age 62. Without additional savings,

they could achieve current living standards by retiring some time before reaching

65. For higher earner deciles, double-digit saving is required to retire at 62 with

the same relative standard of living. Delaying retirement to age 65 cuts required

saving by 7- 1 l%, depending on the family’s earnings decile. Similarly, replacement

rates fall with earnings but rise with retirement age.

        A conclusion that our data on assets and pay highlights is that saving and

replacement rates obscures the intertwined relationship between income and

wealth. Of course, people with higher earnings also tend to have greater wealth,

but this relationship is far from perfect given that the correlation between earnings

and initial wealth is only 0.44. Figure 4 plots prescribed saving rates as a function




Svg.doc - OS/OS/97 - Moore/Mitchell
                                                                                                  20


of both earnings and wealth. Median prescribed saving rate values by earnings-

wealth decile pairs are presented for an assumed retirement age of 62.*O Figure 5

presents the same information in a contour plot with contour lines at 5% intervals.

These figures illustrate substantial heterogeneity in prescribed saving rates within

the same income decile: most households fall along the “diagonal” with wealth

increasing with earnings, but there are some households with substantial wealth

given their earnings, as well as others whose net wealth seems low in comparison to

earnings. The “diagonal” corresponds to the sloped region in Figure 4, running

from the bottom left corner to the top right corner of the figure. The closeness of the

contour lines in Figure 5 point out that the topology of the surface in Figure 4 is

rather steep. In other words, saving rates for households falling along the diagonal

are very sensitive to small changes in income or assets.

       Descriptive regressions of prescribed saving rates in Table 4 summarize some

of the complex multivariate relationships. Coefficients are calculated using median

regressions to minimize the effects of extreme observations. For each retirement

age, we first relate saving rates as quadratic functions of income and earnings

alone, andthen
           .   add age and other indicator variables indicating whether the

household is comprised of a single male or female (versus a married couple),

whether individuals in that household have pension wealth, and whether the

household owns its own home.


19 In addition, their “desire” to consume out of future income may be overstated, inasmuch as
earnings esclude non-cash transfers such as food stamps and housing subsidies to the very poor.

“0 Plots for age 65 retirement look qualitatively very similar.


Svgdoc - 08/03/97 - Moore/Mitchell
                                                                                                    21


        All estimated parameters are statistically s@if&nt at conventional levels.

The estimates suggest that, about the median earnings level of $33,000, the effect of

an extra $100 per year in earnings is to raise the prescribed saving rate by 0.095%

(for retirement by 62) or by 0.097% (at age 65). That is, given the median saving

rate of 16.1%, raising the rate to 16.195% implies that $47.5 of the additional $100

in income would be saved? The effect of $1000 more total wealth on prescribed

saving is about the same for the median household, but in the opposite direction,

causing the saving rate to 62 to fall 0.097%. This translates to approximately $32

less in saving in the f&t year. The coefficients for single men and women reflect

the impact of different mortality rates by sex; since women live longer than men,

they need to save at a greater rate, and this difference is rather substantial. For

esample if age 62 retirement is the target, a woman’s prescribed saving rate would

esceed the otherwise equivalent man’s by 9.1%. The results also show that owning

a home and having a employer sponsored pension affect prescribed saving

substantially. Since “current” pension wealth and net home values are captured in

the initial household wealth variable, these estimated coefficients reflect additions

to future w?alth - in pensions due to additional service, contributions, and portfolio

returns where applicable, and in housing stock due to the paying down of

outstanding mortgage debt and home appreciation. The regressions indicate that

the presence of a pension reduces prescribed saving by 34% per year, while saving

previous income, i.c. 0. I6 195* 100 + 0.00095*33,000.

done through the home is equivalent to saving an additional 7.6% out of annual

earnings at the median.



V. Discussion

        We have explored the adequacy of asset holdings in the Health and

Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of older Americans on the

verge of retirement. One conclusion is that despite seemingly large accumulations

of total retirement wealth, the majority of older households will not be able to

maintain current levels of consumption into retirement without additional saving.

In particular, the median HRS household has more than $380,000 dollars in

projected wealth by age 62, but would still have to save an additional 16% of

earnings to smooth consumption for age 62 retirement.

       Another lesson from our analysis is the importance of retirement decisions in

generating adequate retirement consumption. Delaying retirement by only three

years reduces the saving burden substantially, and allows for a sizable increase in

consumption both before and after retirement. In our sample, if retirement were

delayed to age 65, the asset base would total $421,000 and prescribed additional

saving would be a relatively manageable 7% of earnings at the median.

        We also show that initial and projected assets are distributed quite unevenly

across the older population. Therefore conclusions about the median household will

conceal extraordinary heterogeneity in saving needs among these households.

Small changes in earnings or assets may lead to sizable differences in prescribed

saving rates near the median. Average current holdings of the wealthiest HRS

Svg.doc - 08/05/97 - Moore/Mitchell
                                                                                                     23


decile are 45 times those of the poorest decile, and 48 times that of the poorest by

age 62. This dispersion arises mainly because of pension and financial wealth,

since social security wealth is relatively evenly distributed and housing wealth does

not comprise a large fraction of assets for the wealthiest. Assets are more evenly

distributed across the other deciles, with the second highest group having 8 times

more total wealth than households in the second lowest.

       How do our conclusions square with other research on saving patterns? One

way to compare them is to see how well prescribed saving rates f?om our

methodoloav align with actual rates, as in Table 5. Here we tabulate our saving

rates for HRS married couples and actual saving rates derived fkom the 1990

Consumer Eqenditure Survey (CES) for the worker group age 50-64 (Palmer

1994). The evidence indicates that actual saving rates are only about a third of the

levels prescribed by our calculations. *2

       Another approach is to compare our results to those of Bernheim (1994), who

presents after-tax “target” saving rates around twice as large as ours for similarly

aged households. For example, his target saving rates for a married couple age 55-

64 with   (without) a pension and earnings of $30,000 is 12.1% (18.1%); at $50,000 it

is 19.2% (24.3%); and at $75,000 it is 22.9% (28.1%). Adjusting these rates to

reflect saving as a percent of gross income reduces them by approximately 20-30%.

However as noted earlier, Bernheim’s target rate calculations omit housing wealth,




22 Palmer’s (1994) shows that the 1984 and 1988 CES saving rates are higher for certain   earnings
groups, .wt they still fall short of our median prescribed rates.


Svg.doc - 08/05/97 - Moorc/MitcMl
                                                                                                               24


which if included would narrow the difference between our prescribed saving rates

substantially?

       A third way to assess the comparability of our results with those in the

literature is to compare projected replacement rates. Figure 6 shows our HRS

target replacement rates with those generated using the 1990 CES (Palmer 1994),

and some differences emerge. The HRS profiles both fall with earnings, in contrast

to those derived from the CES data which are flatter and rise for higher incomes.

Part of the difference between our results and Palmer’s is that his method implicitly

assumes observed saving rates are optimal. To the extent that retirement income is

not provided by social security, pensions, or existing assets, and needs to be

provided by additional saving, this will lead to Palmer’s replacement rates

overstating actual replacement rates .*d Palmer’s research also assumes an age 65

retirement age . We also note that the age-65 replacement rate for the HRS sample

is substantially above the age 62 rate, illustrating the importance of retirement

ages in the methodology. If retirement occurs earlier, and empirical evidence

suggests it does, this is further cause to believe that average actual replacement

rates fall below those estimated by Palmer.




z3 Another way to think about housing wealth is that mortgage payments have both an investment
component and a consumption component. The investment component recognizes the purchase of
the house as an investment in a tangible asset. The consumption component represents what the
homeowner would pay for housing services, or for the non-homeowner, rent. Since shelter is a large
consumption expense, paying off the mortgage represents a substantial decrease in income required
to cover consumption needs or a prefunding of later housing consumption.

” Schieber (1996) offers additional criticism of Palmer’s methodology arguing that that are upwardly biased.


 Svgdoc - 08/05/97 - Moore/Mitchell
                                                                                    25


        One question we have not yet explored in any depth is why observed saving

patterns appear to fall short of target saving benchmarks, both ours and others

such as Bernheim’s. One possible answer is that some households are simply too

poor to defer consumption, but this appears unlikely for those other than the

poorest in our sample. Other possible explanations center around informational

issues, for example, households may simply underestimate their likely life

expectancy in retirement, though recent research by Hurd and McGarry ( 1995)

suggests that HRS respondents have quite reasonable forecasts of survival

probabilities into old age. An additional hypothesized explanation is that people

discount the future to varying degrees and some may do so very heavily. The rich

set of standard and experimental questions in the HRS and future information

provided by these households may provide clues to discovering the answers.

Data Appendix: Wealth Projections Using the Health and Retirement Study
        In this Appendi.-.- we describe briefly the methods used to project elements of retirement
wealth forward to age 62 and 65 for the HRS sample described in the text.

A. Social Security Wealth
         Social security wealth measures are contained in the Earning and Benefits File (EBF), a
restricted dataset available under controlled access conditions and described in Mitchell, Olson and
Steinmeier (1996). This file reports covered earnings under the social security law and estimated
old-age and disability benefit amounts for HRS respondents who gave permission for administrative
data to be linked to their survey responses. Retirement benefits are calculated based on earnings
through 1991 and projected earnings to age 62 (the eligibility age for early retirement benefits), and
also to the social security normal retirement ages (65 for most HRS participants). In addition the
EBF file indicates household wealth figures which for married couples includes spouse and
survivor benefits.
         Assumptions used to compute these benefit amounts are consistent with those used by the
Social Security Administration (SSA) under its “intermediate assumptions” scenario outlined by the
Social Security Trustees to forecast the system’s fiscal status. Details of the calculations of Social
Security benefit amounts, present values, and other available variables are described in Mitchell, et
al. (1996). Of the 7607 HRS households, 4334 had useable Social Security wealth from the EBF file.
          For those households where earnings records were not available, values were imputed using
HRS dataset. Separate regression models were constructed for married couples and households
with single individuals. The coefficients of the prediction model were estimated using the sample
for which EBF social security wealth was available. Regressor variables used were those common
to all households in the HRS dataset and include male earnings, female earnings, financial net
wealth, net housing wealth, respondent age, spouse’s age, a dummy for white primary respondents,
and a dummy for single female, with the log of social security wealth as the dependent variable.
Estimated coefficients were used out of sample to estimate social security wealth for those
households not appearing in the EBF.

B. Pension Wealth
         The Institute for Survey Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan asked HRS
respondents covered by employer-provided pensions for permission to contact their employers for
information about these pension plans. Having obtained the names and addresses of the employers,
ISR requested a pension plan Summary Plan Description (SPD) for each worker’s current and past
plans, and followed up with requests for the SPD at the US Department of Labor where employer-
supplied documents were not obtained. The SPDs were then coded using a format developed at ISR,
and combined with a special software program developed by Curtain and others (1997). The
software uses information collected from the SPDs to calculate benefit streams based on
respondents’salary profiles and service, at alternative retirement ages. Vested terminated benefits
as well as ben’efits available from current pension plans are included in the analysis in this paper.
The employer sponsored pension information and pension provider software are in the
developmental phase and can currently be accessed only under restricted conditions.
         Mortality, interest rate, inflation, and wage growth valuation assumptions are consistent
with those used by the Social Security Administration in its annual reporting to Congress. For
defmed benefit plans, present values tire calculated assuming a 2.3% real interest rate and a 4.0%
inflation assumption (implying a 6.3% nominal discount rate). For defined contribution plans, real
returns on contribution balances are assumed to be 4.0% annually (8.0% nominal). The same
assumption is used for calculating present values. The pension provider software does not permit
different assumptions for contribution growth and discounting, but we feel it is appropriate to use
the higher discount rate in the defined contribution pensions plans due to the greater uncertainty of
future benefit levels. Defined benefit plans sponsored by HRS participants’ current employers are
assumed to pay cost of living adjustments of half the inflation rate, mirroring historical practice.
 Benefits from previous employers and defmed contribution plans are assumed to have no cost of

living adjustment. The percentage of plans for which we were able to use the ISR software to
estimate the present value of plan benefits varied by plan type, but was generally between 60%-
70%.
        For those households where pension plan data were not generated by the ISR software,
values were imputed using I-IRS dataset. Separate regression models were constructed for each
pension type. Regressor variables used were those common to all households in the I-IRS dataset
and include earnings, age, service in the plan, dummies industry, job description, race, sex, and
union status. The log of pension wealth is the dependent variable. Estimated coefficients were
used out of sample to estimate pension wealth for those households with missing pension data.

C. Housing Wealth
         Net housing wealth reported in the HRS is the value of owner-occupied primary housing
less debt owed on the property. The projected net value we use in this study is derived as the
projected market value of the housing less projected debt. We assume that the market value of
housing assets is constant in real dollars, or in other words, the increase in home value is equal to
the assumed rate of inflation. Projecting debt is more complicated, as will be explained.
         The I-IRS provides information on first mortgages, second mortgages, home equity loans,
and lines of credit against housing equity. To roll forward debt we need a) the outstanding balance
on the mortgage or other debt, b) the payments and frequency of payments on that debt, and c) the
interest rate on the debt. The HRS provides the fast two of these three which necessitates the use
of alternative sources for the mortgage rate.
         Given the purchase date of the house, a datum reported by HRS respondents, we use
historical interest rates as prosies for current rates. However this ignores the possibility that the
homeowner refinanced his mortgage. We know that interest rates fluctuate over time, and a
common “rule of thumb” has the mortgage holder refinance when rates drop by more than 200 basis
points (2%). Therefore, for esample, using the blay 1980 average 30 year mortgage rate for a house
purchased in May 1980 would likely overstate the actual interest costs for many if not most
households. A different approach would be to take the purchase price of the house reported in the
HRS. the payment amount, and some assumption regarding the term of the mortgage (e.g.: assume
a 30 year fised-rate mortgage). This has the problem that many households’ mortgage payments
include their property tases, homeowners insurance premiums, or both. Imputing mortgage
interest rates from the raw payments would bias upward the derived mortgage interest rates.
          Data from another survey mitigates some of these problems. The American Housing Survey
 (AHS; 1993) provides interest rate data for houses in its sample. From this source, we calculate a
series of actual mortgage rates paid by averaging conditional on year of home purchase and use
 these to roll forward first mortgage debt. Analysis of these rates as opposed to issue rates indicate
 that they embed substantial refinancing for periods such. as the early 1980’s. For years prior to
  1953 where data are thin, or where HRS households do not indicate a year of purchase, we use the
 average mortgage interest rate for the sample, approximately 8.5%.
          The &IS also has information on tax and insurance payments. These in addition to tax
 payment information contained in the HRS are used to calculate an effective mortgage payment, or
 the amount of the mortgage that actually services the debt. HRS households indicate whether
 given payments include tases, insurance, both, or neither. When taxes are given, these are used to
 reduce mortgage payments. When they are not the average rate of tax as a percent of payment as
 calculated from the AI-IS is used instead. A similar procedure is used for insurance payments when
 they are included in mortgage payments. The AI-IS derived values for taxes and insurance are
  18.11% and 5.90% of mortgage payments, respectively.
          For second mortgages and home equity loans the HRS does not contain information on year
 of issue. These amounts are therefore projected forward using the average rate on such debt from
 the AI-IS, approximately 9.5%.
          Missing observations on mortgage payment amounts are imputed assuming a 30 year fL.ed
  mortgage at the rate associated with the purchase year when purchase year and price are available.
  When this information is unavailable, it is assumed that the payments are such that the mortgage

is paid off at age 70. For missing secondary debt, a IO-year term is assumed to pay off the
remaining balance. There are 123, 47, and 36 missing payments that are imputed in this manner,
respectively

D. Other Financial Wealth
         Other financial wealth includes such assets as savings, investments, business assets, and
non-residential real estate less outstanding debt not related to housing. Asset values in 1992 are
provided by HRS respondents. To obtain projected net financial assets, as noted in the text, we
project individual components of this asset category separately. That is, equity components of
assets are projected in line with historical equity returns, bond returns are used to project fixed
income holdings, and personal business assets are projected using the equity rate of return.
Assumed growth rates are geometric averages of real returns over the period 1926.‘95 as
calculated using the Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation series from Ibbotson Associates.
         The components of net financial wealth as tabulated in the HRS and the rates used to
project them:
  - Vehicle and RV Wealth - Depreciated over ten years using straight line depreciation.
  - Checking, Savings, money market accounts - Real t -bill rate (0.5%)
  - CD’s, savings bonds, T-bills - Real t-bill rate (0.5%)
  - IRA’s and Keough Accts. - 50150 Corporate Bonds/Stocks (2.3%/7.2%)
  - Stocks, Mutual Funds - Stocks (7.2%)
  - Business Equity - Stocks (7.2%)
  - Other Assets, Real Estate, Second Home - held constant in real terms
  - less other debt, second home debt - held constant since we lack other information to estimate
     changes in value
