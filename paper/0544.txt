                      Gold Monetization and Gold Discipline


                                    ABSTRACT


     The paper is a study of the price level and relative price effects

of a policy to monetize gold and fix its price at a given future time and

at the then prevailing nominal price. Price movements are analyzed both

during the transition to the gold standard and during the post—monetization

period. The paper also explores the adjustments to fiat money which are

necessary to ensure that this type of gold monetization is non—inflationary.

Finally, some conditions which produce a run on the government's gold

stock leading to the collapse of the gold standard and the timing of such

a run are examined.

        "Money"   is a theoretical concept whose imperfect realization has assumed
the    form of a sequence of particular physical objects. Since the supply

process for each particular physical object is unique, an object which is

"money" in one epoch may he supplanted in another epoch by an object whose

supply process is (perhaps temporarily) superior. While there exists a flow

of objects through the category called "money", the sequence of "money"

objects in modern times has been so limited that it can readily be characterized

as a "gold-fiat-gold" cycle.

        Given the recurrent use of gold as a monetary standard, economic agents

will believe that gold may be restored by a government as a money, even in an

epoch in which gold is demonetized. Fluctuations in the intensity of such

beliefs must then be reflected in gold price fluctuations.

        Recently, large movements in the price of gold have initiated two lines

of thought concerning government gold market policy. First, Salant and

Henderson 1978 (S-H hereafter), have developed a partial equilibrium gold

market model to analyze the interaction between rapid gold price rises and

government gold auctions. Second, Laffer (1979) has advocated a return

to the monetary gold standard.' Simultaneously, Barro (1979) has constructed

a model to study money and price dynamics under a gold standard. The present

paper integrates these approaches, together with a method recently devised by

Krugman (1979) to study exchange crises, to construct a framework for simul-

taneously analyzing government gold and monetary policy. The model which we

develop is suitable both for the study of historical gold standards and for

the analysis of a future gold standard.

        Specifically, we wish to study three questions which arise in the context

of transition to and from a monetary gold standard:

       (i)   What is the inflationary effect of a policy to monetize gold at

             some future date?

      (ii)   Given that a gold standard will be adopted, which monetary policy is consistent
                                                 2

               with price     stability and minimum disruption of the   gold    market during

               the transition to monetization?

     (iii) If a monetary authority implements a gold standard but does not

               adhere to the "discipline" of the standard, what is the anatomy of

               the   gold   standard's collapse?

Qiiestions(i) and (ii) address recent plans for monetization while question(iifl

is posed to provide both some perspective for realistic policy discussion

and some tentative steps toward understanding the breakdown of the gold

standard       in the 1930's.      In addressing question (iii) we also propose a

technical       definition of the concept called      "the discipline of the     gold standard";
the    definition       allows us to   Uctermine if a particular monetary policy is

consistent with "gold discipline".

        We    present   our analysis in four sections. Tn     section   I we   introduce    the

components       of our model and      develop equi I ibrjum price paths for a world where

agents       believe gold will never be money.       In section ii we study gold's price
path    following an announcement that gold will be monetized at a fixed future

date, with gold's price pegged at the prevailing market level on that date.

Section [II contains our analysis of the price level effects of moncti zation

along    with our model's       prescription for monetization without inflation.           In

section IV we        study   the forced demonetization of gold, the collapse of a

gold standard. Section IV is followed by some concluding remarks and our

technical appendix. To maintain clarity of exposition most results will

I)e introduced in the text without proof; the detailed algebra involved

in    the proofs will       be left either to the appendix or to footnotes.

I)    Th& World Without Monetary Gold


       We will first analyze a world in which gold has no monetary u.se. Such

a world is very similar to that studied by S—H, except there will be no

government auctions. Throughout the paper we employ a continuous time model

in which agents have perfect foresight. To minimize technical complexity,

we present our ideas in the context of a specific, linearized example.

       We divide our economy into two sectors, a gold sector and a monetary

sector.        Both the output of    goods other than gold and the real rate of

interest       r are fixed at constant levels exogenously to the                   gold and monetary
           2
Sectors.
a)    The Gold Sector

      The operation of the gold market can be described by equations (1)-(3):

(1)            I   [)(t)   + G(t)

(2)            D(t) = v[D*(q(t))     —
                                          D(t)J     ,        D*I   <   0

(3)            q(t) =   rq(t)       for G(t)            0.

       I is a fixed, total world stock of gold.3 D(t) is the quantity of gold

which has been transformed for industrial or consumption purposes (or which

remains in the ground). G(t) is the quantity of gold privately held as

ingots or coins in         sl)eculative   hoards.        E)*(q) is a target for the sum         of
consumption and industrial demand, which depends negatively on (j(t) the

relative price of gold in terms of other goods.4'5 v is a positive, constant

speed of adjustment which may, if desired, depend on                       r;   and we assume

      Equation (1) states that the total supply of gold privately available

is held either in speculative hoards as ingots or in tile form of jewelry or

other consumption goods. Equation (2) is an adjustment equation which

indicates the      rate    at which actual non-speculative holdings adjust to desired

non-speculative holdings. Equation (3) is a requirement that                          the   relative
                                                      4

price of gold must increase at the real rate of interest for any gold to he

held in speculative          IoanIs.
        Our gold      sector model is similar to the gold model developed by S-Il.

We depart      from S-Il in      our   equation (2)       which allows   consumers and producers
to    disgorge gold from final uses. The S-Il model precludes the possibility

of gold's return to speculative hoards after its conversion to final use.

We have adopted this modification                both because it     captures the recently

observed disgorging of gold from consumption stocks and because it is tech-

nically      convenient to allow I) to hear no prior constraints.8
     Equations (l)-(3) form a system of differential equations in l)(t)
and q(t). We assume that

(4)            D*(q(t)) =


where        is a constant.
        In   the   remainder of this         section, we solve (l)-(4) for (1(t) and l)(t).

Equation (3)        yields

(5)           (lIt) = q(O)ert               when C(t) > 0.

Substituting from (5) and (4) in (2) we                   derive


(6)           I)(t)   = —vl)(t) +          v -rt
                                             e

which has the         solution


(7)           D(t) =      l)(O)e_Vt    +                    0(v-r) dT

       To complete        the solution in (7) we require an initial condition for l)(0)

and   a condition on        speculative gold holding to determine q(0). First, we

assume   that t)(0) =       0.        Second, if I   is the date when l)(t) =     0, G(T) must
equal zero,        i.e.   the speculative       gold stock must he exhausted when there is flO
                                                             5

further    accumulation of non-speculative gold. This requirement is the terminal

condition imposed by S-li, where speculative gold is held only in anticipation

of future non-Speculative gold accumulation.'0 Since G(T) =                                     0,

 (8)           1 = D(T) =         D*(q(T))

          equations (4) and (8), we can determine the relative price of gold
        From

at the time that speculative hoards are exhausted,

               (1(T)


which, together with equation (5), yields


(9)            q(0) =         0-rT

        In addition, the              condition       that I = 1)(T),       the    non-speculative gold

accumulation equation, (7), and our                        assumed value D(0) =            0 imply

                                 rT                                   -vT        (v-r)T
               1 = ye -vi                  S
                                               c (v-r)Tdi        ye         (e           -1)—

                                 j —                                             (v-r)
Substituting         for q(0) in (10)            we can solve for

(ii)             =     log   r - log v
                              r-v


which with      equation (9) implies
                                 iog r -             log
(12)           q(0)    =     e                 r-v

b)     The lonetary Sector

        These results indicate that the relative price of gold and the quantity

of gold held in various categories are determined by the operation of the

gold sector alone. In order                    to determine nominal prices, we must appcn(1 a
monetary sector to our model. The Operation of this sector will have no
real    effect in      a model        in   which     gold has no monetary function; we introduce the
                                                      6


monetary sector at this point to serve as a preliminary to the analysis in
Section II.
        We   assume that money market equilibrium         is.   given by'2

(13)          P'1(t)     —
                             a[r   +   P(t)

        or

(14)          M(t) =   (( - r)P(t) -          aP(t)



where P(t) is the price level for all goods, M(t) is the
                                                         exogenous money
supply and (3—ar) >       0.

        In this section we assume that M(t) =C, where C is

the (constant) quantity of currency in circulation. The                 solution   to (14)
di   ctatecl by market   fundamentals         is13

(15)          P(t) = j3C -r

The nominal price path for gold is obtained by multiplying q(t), from equation
(5), by P(t), from (15) with q(O) given by equation (12).

IT)     The World with an Announced Gold MonctizaIon


        The monetization policy studied in this section will consist of a government's

unanticipated announcement that at a future time t=w it will fix the price of

gold at the nominal level prevailing at w and that from.w onward speculative

gold holdings can be used as money4'15The announcement is assumed to occur at

time c, where

        This policy differs from the relative gold price

pegging policy studied by S-H in that gold, which can be used for monetary

purposes, will generate the same service return that any money yields and in

that we assume that          the nominal price is pegged. However, the method which
we employ to   analyze the problem will be qulte similar to that of S-Il: we
first    determine a set of conditions which must prevail at the time of monetiza-
tion    and   then solve backward to find the initial                 relative price at time c

i.rnpljed    by   profit maximizing behavior.

a) The World after Gold is 1oney
        Our   goal in this part is to derive an expression for                 the relative price

of gold at the time of monetization w; such an expression will be essential

in linking the gold standard world to the basic system studied in section 1.

Because of the tedious algebra requi red to determine the path of the relativc

price    of gold, we will         only present a sketch         of the required steps in the main

text and      then   skip to the relative price solution. We leave the details to

the appendix.

        We   assume that oniy gold held in speculative hoards                 is   a perfect substitute
for    currency.      If Q(w) = Q is the nominal price of gold at t=w, equilibrium
in the money and          gold   markets for t >       w   requires

              C + QG(t)
(16)                         =   (s-ar)   -   a P(t)
                   P(t)                        I'(t)
                                                                            8



 (17)                 0(t) = vI---- - 0(t)]

Equation            (16)      is equation (13) with the additional gold comI)onent added to

the      money supply; the nominal                           price of gold is pegged at Q                = Q(w)   for   t>w.

Substitution               from equation (4) into equation (2) produces equation (17)
It     will be         convenient          to transform (16)-(l7) into


(18)                 i(t) =      (ar)          P(t)      -
                                                                  G(t)      -




(19)                 G(t) =            P(t)        -
                                                        vG(t) +        vi
                                 0
which      are       two     linear differential equations in G(t) and P(t) •17 Equation (19)
is    derived by substituting for E)(t) from equation (1').
     Since the determinant of the system (18) -(19) is negative, the characteristic
polynomial has a positive root A1,and a negative root A2, therefore, the
system exhibits saddlepoint                             stability.                  Steady-state values of the system are
     =          + 1 J/(-ar+)               and         G* =       [I(-r)        -

for    t>w obeys

        The relative price of gold depends on the quantity of gold used for

non-speculative purposes at the time of the monetization announcement, on the

speed of adjustment of non-speculative gold holdings, on the real rate of

interest, and on the long run non-speculative gold holding parameter, (S.

        We wish to compare the relative price of gold in a world with monetary

gold to the relative price derived in section 1. To do this we consider

the relative prices at time c.           In particular, we will show that Q(c)/P(i;)

jumps at    the time of the announcement as long as w<T.
        From equation (5) we need only discount Q(w)/P(w) by 0r( to
find

III) Inflation and the Gold Standard


         In this section we analyze the inflationary effects of the gold monetiza-

tion policy proposed in section II.               In addition we consider the monetary

policy which must accompany gold monetization in order to prevent price level

movements.

         To begin, we note in Figure I that the pre-announcement price, P(c);

/(1-ar), the horizontal intercept of the P=0 schedule. The line ss is the

system's saddlepoint path after gold monetization; therefore, it indicatcs

the path for G(t), P(t.) for t>w.

         With these facts we can readily establish that P(w)>P(). Since P(w)

is on ss and ss lies entirely to the right of P(c) it follows that P(w)>P(c).

         Next, we   consider the behavior of P          at time c   and during the period
(c ,wJ .    While P may jump in an unforeseen manner at time c, agents cannot expect

it     to move discontinuously in          the future; otherwise, the     expected rate of
price      change would be infinite at the time of a jump, producing money market

disequilibrium.        Therefore, P moves smoothly (differentiably) to P(w)

during Cc ,w

         We can easily show       that    during the period (c,w] ,    P>0.   If, on   the contrary

P<()   at some time in the interval, the money market can clear only if P<P(c)
since C is unchanged before w. This precludes the smooth rise of price to
P(w) .     Since P(t) >0, tc (c ,wI , P(t) must lie between P(c) and P(w) ; hence

the initial jump a ftcr the moneti zation announcement is also to a price
between P(c) and P(w)
         To summari zc ,   we find   that the jri cc level jumps s inni I taneously Wi th     the

monetization announcement and rises smoothly until the date of monetization.
However, after time w,        the price level and          monetary gold holdings will     follow

the path ss in       Figure 1 .      If   G(w) <G , then   price will rise in a gold inflation,
                                                       1.2

ultimately converging to P*. if G(w)>G*, the price level will dec Inc in
a gold deflation as gold is extracted from circulation and used for
consumption. The price level will he stable after time w only if G(w)_G*

Moncti zation without Inflation

        1vidcntly, a government             announcement of eventual gold monetization cannot

succeed       as a policy to avoid inflation in the absence of other measures.
Therefore,      we wish to employ our framework to explore how a government simul-

taneously can announce the monetization of gold, avoid inflation and

minimize the disruption of the gold market.

        The   policy van able available             to the government   is   the amount of

tion-gold money,          C, which we   have previously set at      the constant     level C.

We require a time path for C                which   will cause the nominal prices of gold and
goods to follow

(24a)          P(t) =     (1




(24b)          0(t)   =   rQ(E)er(t
(24c)          Q(t)       U                   t>w


given monetization at w. Condition (24a) requires P to remain constant
indefinitely. (241)) and (24c) require Q both to move cont iniionsiy at the rate
r   between      and w and to remain constant after w; in parti cul ar, (241))
prevents Q from jumping di scont i nuous ly at t ime c
        We can use the money ma rket to determine the requl red path for C:

(25a)          C(t)   =   C(c)                                          ,

(25b)          C(t) = P(s) [ -ar        -
                                            Q(c   )e G(w)                    t=w


(25c)          C(t) = Qflr(w-c)(;()                                          t>w
                                                13

       In    the above equations, G(w) equals I—[)(w); and I)(w) can he den ved
from (7) as

(26)              E)(w) =   D(c)e + :r)-vw (v-r)w (v-r)c-     -e        I


In addition, for t>w, G(t) can be
                                            determined from equation (19) by setting
P(t)=P()

       From time c unti.1 w, the policy requires that C            remains constant. At
time w,      C   must decline by the amount Q(w)(.(w)=Q(e)er(w-c) ('4w) to accommodate

monetized gold. Following w, the government stabilizes price by                  exactly
balancing        with    currency injections or withdrawals the value of gold which

leaks into or out of consumption and industrial use.

       The       only   component of the policy lacking in   simplicity     is (25h); this

element's complexity arises from the goal of minimizing the disruption to

the   gold   market.        Indeed, any discrete reduction in C at time w would, when

combined with (25a) and (25c), stabilize P. However, any reduction in C

other than (25b) will disturb the gold market.'9

IV)    Anatomy of a Crisis (Demonetization.) in the Cold Market

        Tn previous sections we did not account for government gold reserves

since, except fo.r fixing the price of gold, the government was passive; merely

its willingness to intervene was sufficient to produce the derived results.

however, if the government adopts additional policies which potentially

conflict with the maintenance of a gold standard, we may no longer treat

gold market intervention as implicit; rather, we must directly consider the

government's role in the gold market.

        In this section we introduce government gold reserves, R, and initially

assume    that the government ss;cs      the overall money growth rate   at the positive
constant      g. With finite R such a money growth policy must lead to a break-

down of the gold stmdard.2° In addition, it is possible for the gold

standard to break down even if money is decreasing, providing that prior to

the inception of the gold standard there was "too much" money in cxi stence.


A Breakdown with      Constant Money Growth

        We can readily show that tile gold standard must collapse when money grows

at a    constant, posItive rate.         If there were no breakdown and money grew   at
the    rate g, then P must      rise at tile rate g. Since P rises, q=Q/P must    decline
at the rate g; then i)*6/q rises at the rate g. Therefore, I)* and D increase
toward infinity, which is incompatible with a finite R. It follows that the
gold standard must collapse at some time.

        our   analysis of the    dynamics of a gold standard col lapse draws di rect ly

from Krugman' s (1979) study        of   the breakdown of a fixed exchange rate system.
In Krugman's paper, a small country's monetary authority fixes the price of
foreign    exchange   and expands    the   domestic component of the money supply at
a posit ive, constant rate. Eventual ly, a crisis must          occur;   there is a run on
                                                             15

the monetary authority's foreign exchange holdjjigs and an end to the fixed
exchange rate.
         In Krugman's model the exchange rate and the price level are essentially
the    same variable;      no relative price effects arise from the crisis.                      Our
model of a gold market crisis displays the Krugman-type run on government

stocks, but it extends his analysis by allowing for real effects of the

CT! SI   S.

         We   now define I as the total stock of gold inclusive of government

reserves,

(27)            1 =   R(t) + G(t)       +    D(t)
While gold is money, the money supply is, as before, M(t) =                         C(t) + i)G(t).
If    the government sets H on a "crisis path", rising at the.                    positive rate g,
then     at some time z a crisis must occur in the gold market. At the time of

the crisis QG(z) will be demonetized; also, R(z) in currency will be exchanged

for government gold during the run on government stocks. In all, the money

stock at the instant of the crisis must fall by


(28)            Q(R(z) +   G(z))    =       Q(I   —
                                                      D(z)

where the equality follows from (27).                        Thus, the time path of the money stock is


(29a)           H(t) =   1(0)gt                          ,        t<z

(29b)           H(t) =   1(0)gZ             Q1i—E)(z) j ,         t=z

(29c)           M(t) ()(t_.z)                            ,




        We    should emphas.i ze that while gold is money' the government may                  control the
growth rate of N         hut may not control the division of M              between C and Q(. Because
the    size of C is indeterminate, the size of R is also indeterminate. However,
for the problem of determining the time of the crisis                        ,   only   the allocation
                                                              16
of I between 1) and (R÷G) is important.
        Next we will employ                (29a)-(29c) to determine both the pro-crisis price
path and the           time of     the     crisis. Crucial to our analysis is the recognition

that    speculators will force the crisis to take place without any foreseen
jumps in P         or Q.

        The   time path for P              is obtained by solving the equation l'1(t) =            P(t) [-rj   -ctP(t)
for
(30)           P(t) =      e       J
                                       M(T)        eTdT

where A =               > 0.       For t<z we use equations (29a)-(29c) in (.30) to obtain

(31)           P(t) =                      {j       [(x)t} -
For    t=z (31) becomes

(31i)          P(z) = _±ic__               -{M(0)e           ö[iDjj}
        Both (31) and (31a) depend on                     the,   as     yet, unknown values of l)(z) and z.

To    find   these     values we use both our               knowledge about consumption gold accumu-

lation   and the condition that Q                    cannot      jump at the moment of crisis. After
the crisis, the relative price of gold can be determined from the model in
section I as

(32)           q(z) =      S
                           — e —r(T—z)


where    T, as before, is the choke date. Since DF) =                              1, we require

                               -v( I -z)                    fF          (v-r)T
(33)           1       I)(z)               +   ye    1e           1de    (z)' dT


                       2.(J .v(T_z)                 v       (r-v) (T-z)

                                                   v-r [1 -
(33a)              =                           +



l;quation (33a) follows directly from (33), and (33)                             is   a reinterpreted version
                                                     17
of equation (7). Equation (33a) may, in principle,be solved for 'F as a
funct ion of D(z) , z, and 1, i.e.

(34)           T     (D(z),     z, 1).   with          1                   0.

        The   requirement that gold's price does not jump at time z is
(35)          (1(Z) =      Q/P(z).
Since    q(z) is identical in (32) and (35), we substitute from (34) to derive


(36)                  =                     z, I)-z]
              P(z)


I:quat ions (31a) and (36) are two              equati oiis in the three   unknowns   P(z) , D(z)
and z. The         third    equation,    which can he used    to coniplete the solution, is
the    accumulation equation

(37)          fl(z) = D(0)e"         + veZ


       It   is evident that closed form solutions to z are unlikely, even in

simple models. In practice, numerical techniques would be required to derive

z for particular parameter values.




A   Gold Standard Inconsistent Currency Love I

       That   a gold standard must eventually collapse from an inflationary money
creation process agrees with intuition. Less obvious is the possibility
that a gold standard may collapse in a period of monetary and price decline.
                                                              18

        As   an example of such a               case,    we generalize the     post-monet i zati           dynamics
of    equations (18) and (19) by allowing for government reserve holdings R(t).
The    government     changes C        only      by    exchanging curency      for its reserves           at the
fixed price Q; otherwise,                  it   does    not intervene   in the money     or gold markets.

The    money supply at. any time that the gold standard exists is then

(38)           M(t) =      (C   -            Q(R(t)      +   G(t))
                                    QR&+

where R0 is the quantity of gold reserves and C is the quantity of outstanding
currency      at tile beginning of the analysis (t=O). 21
        The dynamic system analogous to (18)—(19) is

(18a)          P(t) =      -ar P(t) -           Q(R(t)÷ G(t)) -      CQR()



(19a)          [R(t)+G(t)j =                 P(t) - v(R(t) + G(t)) + vi.
                                       Q

The solution to the system is similar to that for (l8)-(19) .                             P    and (R÷G)
converge ultimately to the steady state values N and [R*+G*] ; however, nothing
guarantees that (R*+I*) is positive. Indeed, [R*+G = [I (8-ar)                                  —   6   (C-QR0/Q] / (8 -ax'+6)
can   he negative         if   the term 6(C-QR0)/ is large enough.
        We have depicted the case of a negative (R*+G*J in Figure II. The (R+G)=O
and   P=()   loci are analogous to those in Figure 1, except that the steady state
value for R*+C* is negative. Since the consumption demand for gold tinder
tiìis gold standard eventually exceeds tile total available, the system must
collapse at sonic I)Oint.              At the time of the collapse, currency will he exchanged
for all the governments reserves at the fixed rate Q; and                           gold will cease to

he   money. hence , the             post—collapse money stock           will   he C —
                                                                                        QR()
                                                                                               ; and the     pr i cc


level   will be (C-QR0)/(8—ar) , represented by point A in Figure II.
        In   order   to   prevent      the      infinite profits associated with price level

the   collapse. Similarly, to prevent a jump in the nominal gold price Q,

there must still be some gold in      the hands of the public           at   the time of the

collapse. The gold price then gradually rises, thereby reducing the slope
of the (R+G)=O locus and rotating it counter-clockwise until it intersects
the P-axis at A. The lines through the points FIIA represent the path
followed by    the price level and (R÷G). The Fit segment, located to the left

of the stable manifold ss, is a solution Path for the system (l8a)-(l9a).

Thus, we have forced a collapse of the gold standard even when the money

stock and prices continually fall; formal derivations of these results

together    with an equati on determining the timing of the collapse arc presented
in the    append:ix.



Gold Discipline

      In the two preceding examples, we have demonstrated that a gold standard

                        inflationary monetary policy is in effect and when
can collapse 1)0th when an

money and prices are declining. In this section we explore the restrictions
on the money supply process which guarantee that a gold standard will survive
indefinitely. We call such a restricted policy a strictly_gold-disciplined
money 1)011 cy, and we seek a means of determi fling whether a particular policy
is strictly golddiscijlined. One such method, presented in the appendix,
consists of solving directly for z, the time of the collapse. If a finite
solution    for z exists, then the monetary policy can be classified as a z-year

gold-disciplined policy; if z is infinite, then the monetary policy is strictly

gold-disciplined.      In the main text, we   develop          an equivalent method.

      A policy is a sequence of money growth rates g(t). We model government

caused money growth, i.e. all changes in          the   money supply     except that discon-
tinuous   change associated   with the gold standard collapse, as a smooth

        Our model requires I> l)(t), Vt, which is a real resource constraint

holding independently of the monetary regime. The real resource constraint

applicable to the gold standard is I >                           D(t), Vt.         A gold standard, once

imposed, will collapse if and only if agents foresee that. in the absence of a

collapse there would he some finite t when I =                                D(t).
        We define a strictly gold-disciplined money growth policy as a policy such

that

             I >    D(t)                Vt


where    I)(t) is   the    value       of D(t) constructed from equations ( 30) and ( 37)

using    the money growth policy and setting k(z)O. We emphasize that D(t)
need not he less than or equal to I. The [)(t) values arc, for our model,

a sequence of hypothetical values calculated by setting k(z)O.

t rises. hence we can not have i>D(t) for all t.

V) Conclusion and Extensions


       A government may announce the fixing of the nominal price of gold in a

number   of   different environments. Gold may currently circulate along with
fiat   money as part of the money supply with   a freely floating nominal price
of   gold.    Alternatively, gold may have no monetary role until the fixing

of its nominal price. In this paper we have analyzed the movement of the

price of gold in the latter case.      Tn the context of our model we have shown

that only a very Special money supply process will prevent inflation when

gold is monetized.      In addition we have devised a method for determining the

timing of a gold standard's collapse and produced a formal definition of

"the discipline of the gold standard."

       'I'he model employed may be developed in a number of ways. The model

specifies a fairly simple demand and supply behavior for money and gold rather

than invoking explicit maximizing behavior. Also, agents are assumed to

have perfect foresight. We think that it is worthwhile to place our model

of a gold standard's collapse in a stochastic environment. Given such a

framework it    is possible to investigate the collapse of the   1920's go]d

standard to determine if it was vial)le when it was formed.

          I Laf for proposes to have the government announce that gold will he mone-
tized at the market price prevailing on a certain future date. To prevent
inflation in the interim, the government woul.d follow an "austere" monetary policy
and sell, a large portion of its gold holdings.
     2 can easily relax the fixity of other goods, providing that other
goods are given exogenously to the model developed here. Allowing for changes
in the real rate of interest would greatly complicate our analysis; thus,
the development of -our models is an exercise in partial equilibrium analysis.
In (S-Il), r is given exogenously and output of other goods is ignored. l.n Barro,
both r and goods production are exogenous.


          3UnLil section IV we ignore government gold stocks.


     4it is possible to interpret 1)*(q(t)) and E)(t) as desired and actual
consumption holthngs of gold plus desired and actual gold remaining in the
ground, respectively. T en the model allows for gold to be mined at increasing costs.

          5Our model coiitans an analogue to the choke price used by                  (S-li). When
f)*   (q (t) 1 = [)(t)    ,   I)(t)   =   0,   and there i s no further change in specul at ive gold
holding. The (1(t) for which this condition holds is the analogue of the choke
P i CC.

       n an opt imi zi iig model, the speed of adjustment, v, would depend on r.
We avoid the complex problems that this causes by fixing r.

       If q/q < r, there would he no demand, for speculative gold holdings, and
the pri cc of gold would                  fall
                                discontinuously. If q/q >                      r,
                                                               speculative demand
would cause a discontinuous upward j ump i n gold pri cc. Since forsecable
di scout i nuous jumps in q are not consi stent with speculative equi Ii hriiim, l
must follow equation (3).

                    there     is no gold mining, equation (2) is identical to Barro's (1979)
adjustment equation for non—monetary gol.d except that we don't include depre-
ciation. To the extent that there is gold mining in our model., equation (2)
differs         from liarro's adjustment equation because our D is the difference between
newly consumed and              newly      mined gold.
      We have also explored an alternative form for the D* function which
includes anticipated capita.1 gains to gol.d holding as an argument; this form
does not substantively change our results. See the appendix for this analysis.

        15The       fixing   of the pri cc of gold at a giving future time has a precedent
in the       Greenback period      of the U.S.   In 1875, Congress passed a law requi ring
a return to the gold standard in .January, 1879 at the pre—Ci vii War pan ty.
in this case gold circulated as money with a fluctuating greenback exchange
rate.        For dctai ls, see Friedman and Schwartz (1963), Ch. 2.

cause the price of gold to be fixed; however, the government need not actually
intervene. hence , we can ignore movements i.n government reserves. In sect ion TV
we generalize the model to the case in which the government must intervene
directly with its reserves to preserve the gold standard.
            81t is possible to extend the model to an uncertain world in which the
timing       of the future fixing to gold is unknown.                 In       the append i x ,   we   explore

        A gold standard is said to break down when a private run on government
reserves exhausts those reserves. As Krugnian has rioted a government may

       More genera Ely, we could begin the analysis at time c, the moment that
the future monetization of gold .i s announced. Agents at time would real i ze
that the gold standard to be implemented at w will not be permanently viable.
They will     prepare for the expected demonetization so that at time w the nominal
 and relative prices of goods and gold and the quantity of consumption gold
 holdings will be different from the results of section TI.
           Still more generally, the government may hold secondary and tertiary
 gold reserves in preparation for new gold standards to be established at some
time after the collapse of the current standard; i.e. to defend the
standard in the crisis, it will only expend a known part of its totalcurrent reserve.
'lit I s rhythm i c wi thdrawal from and return to the gold standard wi 11 reflect
 itself in yet different paths for the price level and gold consumption from
those which we have examined thus far.
      22
        A possible (though very conjectural) application of this analysis is to
the  study of the reestablishment and cot Iajse of the inter-war gold standard.
The U.S. continuously used a gold standard until 1933, but other major
countries, i.e,. Germany (1924), Great Britain (1925), France (1927), fixed
their currencies to gold in the 1920's. It is often suggested that the gold
parities which were established were "inappropriate". here we can interpret
"I nappropri ate" to mean that there was too much currency outstanding in the
world to   maintain the viability of the gold standard.

Since w-c is given, and D() and I arc given,                                    equations (Al) and (A2) are a

 IT —   Solution   to the    System     (18)—(19)


        In this appendix we derive equation (20), the stable manifold for G(t)

 and P(t) 'after monetization. Equations (18) and (19) are a system of

 differential equations in G(t) and P(t).                 The steady state values of the
 system   are G* =   —             — and     P* = C+QI
                       B—ar+6
        The determinant of the homoegenous system is

                                   —v

Since   the determinant is egative, the roots of the system are of opposite

sign, indicating saddle point type stability. Assume that the roots are

and A2<0. Complete solutions of (18) and (19) are then of the form


            C(t) =                 +              + c*
                      C1A1eA1t         C2A2eA2t

            P(t) =             +            + p*
                      C1eA1t       C2eA2t

with A1 = —s---——- and A2 =                   .     For stability we require that C1       0.
            Q(v+A1)                Q(v+A2)
Therefore, P(t) =           G(t) + (P*            G*).

III    —
            Subjective        Probabilities over Monetization


           In this section, we generalize, the model of section IT, to the case in

which agents have a probability density function over the timing of monetization.

Fortunately, most of the required drudgery has already been done in section II

because the solution for the time c relative price of gold falls easily out

of    equation (22). This case is similar in form to the various policies studied

by Salant and Henderson when agents are uncertain about the timing of policy

implementation. The results which we derive here can be employed in an alter-

native interpretation of the relative gold price movements described in the

first       pages of Salant and Ilehderson.
           We will assume that our gold speculators arc risk neutral              and that the

subjective p.d.f. over the time w of monetization is the same exponential

p. d. f. used by Salant and             Henderson    in their appendix, i.e.


(a)                f(w) = ye -ó(w-)        for w >

The relative l)rice solution in equation (22) is conditioned on a particular

announcement            time c and monetization time w.        Here we assume that at time E
the    government         announces that    gold will l)e monetized at     some uncertain future
time       w with the p. d. f. over w given by (a).            Let us denote the relative price

solution          in   (22)   as   Q/P(r/w), to indicate that it    is conditional on the time
of monet zat i on.
              i




           Risk   neutral speculators will act to set actual relative price at time c
equal to the weighted average of the Q/P(e/w) 's, where the weights arc                     given

in    (a).        The expected return to speculative gold holding at c will then equal

the real rate of interest. However, as long as the actual monetization does

not occur, the relative               price of gold must rise at    a   higher rate than   the

real       rate of interest.
                                               31

      We proved in section II that if w>T,          Q/P(/w)   >   q(c).       The expected value
of Q/P(/w) can be writtcn as

The determination of the time path for Q/P(c/w), conditional on monetization's

not yet having occurred, has proven to be intractable (for us).

3)      Just after the run, the relative price of gold is q(z) =                                                     - e1C              (

        Then      we can solve for 1— z:

                   (G+R)      =                       +                          + (G*+R*) or at t=O

        where
                                                                                                                 1(13-ar) -

                                                                                                                         B -   ar   +

      From (4a) we solve for C1 in terms of C2:

                                -ö(v+A )                                        v+A
                   C =                       [I—D(o)      —
                                                               (R*+G*)] — C

                                                                           2v+A2
      Using (2a) we can solve for
                                                     C2 explicitly:

                                             Q(v+A)
                            p(z)_p* +                    [I —
                        =                    v6
                    2                                    v+A
                                                   A,z — ____
                                                         _____
                                              Le
                                                                2


             Thus, we can solve for C1,C2 in terms of the parameters, the initial,

      and the terminal conditions. This determines
                                                                               exactly the price path.

5)   Now we must find z. From equation (33a),


                1=      D(z) -vF           v    (r-v)F
                            I     e      +—[1—e
                                          v-r          )]



     so


     (5a)       D(z) =          ieVFti   -
                                             vV_r   (l_e_V))

             From   the accumutation equation for D(z),

     (5b)       D(z) =          D(O)e        + veJZ J               P(t)eTdr

     We   know what D(z) must be from (5a). Then we need only plug in our
     price   path in (Sb), integrate and                       solve   for z. The integral is essentially

     Then    (Sb) is

D* =    6/q.    This simple form was chosen because of its tractability. In this

appendix we demonstrate that none of the conclusions we reach in the text

would be altered by changing our assumption about D* to conform with that

assumed by Barro. In our notation, one functional form which has the
                                                                                                             2+63 (q/q)
qualitative properties assumed by Barro (1979, pg. 15) is D* =                                   +
                                                                                                                  q
where y is real output, assumed constant in our paper, and the linearization

is appropriate only over ranges where [62+tS3q/q] >                     0.   We differ from Barro in

that he assumed unit income elasticity, but this does not seem substantive for

present purposes.

       With the new specification of D* we may write the differential equation

system (18),             (19) from the text as

phase diagram appears as in Figure A. The important point about this figure

is that, if positive, the slope of the G=0 schedule is less than that of the

P=0 schedule. The slopes of these schedules are

It is evident from Figure A that the stable branch, ss, is qualitatively

unchanged from Figure I. Finally note that in the steady state q/q       -.P/P =   0

and   hence   for the steady state including the rate of return variable is

irrelevant.
