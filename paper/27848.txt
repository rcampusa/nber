                                          ABSTRACT

Estimating medical care productivity is a central economic challenge. This paper develops a
satellite account for the US health sector that appropriately measures health care productivity and
applies that to the elderly population between 1999 and 2012. The central output of the satellite
account is health. The primary input is medical care; we also examine the impact of behavioral
risk factors. Our empirical work measures the change in medical spending and health outcomes
for a comprehensive set of 80 conditions. We estimate that medical care has positive productivity
as a whole, with aggregate productivity growth of 9% over the time period. However, there is
significant heterogeneity in productivity by condition. At the upper end, care for cardiovascular
disease has been extremely productive. In contrast, care for people with mental illness and
musculoskeletal conditions has been costly but not productive.

         “The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income.”
                                                                  -   Simon Kuznets (1934)


         Estimating medical care productivity is a central economic challenge. The National Income
and Product Accounts (NIPAs) report that multi-factor productivity in the health care and social
assistance sector declined by 0.4% annually between 1987 and 2018, 1 in contrast to the 0.9%
increase in the economy as a whole. Given health care’s size in the economy, about 18% of GDP,
low productivity in medical care influences aggregate productivity growth. Further, the low rate
of measured productivity growth contributes to ongoing concern about wasted resources in
medicine (Chandra and Skinner, 2012).
         However, official medical care productivity estimates suffer from a variety of problems
(Boskin Commission, 1996; Berndt et al., 2001; Dunn et al., 2015). Quality adjustment is an often-
noted issue. The primary output of medical care is improved health, yet health is not easily
measured or attributed to medical interventions. Thus, health improvements are undercounted in
official productivity estimates. This limitation was evident as far back as the 1930s, as the above
quotation from Simon Kuznets attests. In addition, the national accounts have difficulties when
care from one type of provider substitutes for care from another. Each provider type is treated as
a separate industry in the national accounts, for example pharmaceuticals, hospitals, and
physicians. Thus, if a medication is developed which avoids the need for hospitalizations, the
savings in hospital costs are not credited to the pharmaceutical industry. For each of these reasons,
medical care productivity by sector may be significantly misstated.
         To address these issues, proposals have periodically been made to establish a ‘satellite
account’ for health. Such an account would measure health outcomes and medical inputs, and thus
more accurately account for new goods and substitution of treatments (Schultze and Mackie, 2002;
Abraham and Mackie, 2005; Rosen and Cutler, 2007; National Research Council, 2010). 2 The goal
of this paper is to develop a satellite account for the US health sector and measure the productivity


1
  This includes health care and social assistance, although social assistance represents less than 10% of the total. Health
care services includes inpatient and outpatient facilities but excludes pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Over the
1987-2016 time period, the reported MFP of the pharmaceutical industry was -1.7% annually and the reported
productivity of the medical equipment and supplies industry was 0.7% annually.
2
  Health is not the only area with these concerns. Other areas for which satellite accounts are proposed include home
production (Landefeld and McCulla, 2000), the environment (Muller et al., 2011), education (Fraumeni et al., 2017),
and free goods (Brynjolfsson et al., 2019).

                                                            1
of medical care.
       The key design innovation in our accounts is to use medical conditions as the industries,
not providers of care. For example, there is an industry for heart disease and a second one for lung
cancer. Our accounts make no distinction based on the type of care provided; all that matters to
people is how much they spend on care and their resulting health.
       The data needs for a satellite account are substantial, including measures of population
health and medical spending matched to clinical characteristics and other sociodemographic
factors. Our primary data are from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), an ongoing
survey of the elderly population with data from 1999–2012. The elderly account for one-third of
total medical spending.
       We start by identifying a set of 80 conditions that are prevalent and severe enough to affect
the elderly population. Of these conditions, 78 are clinical, for example heart disease and lung
cancer. The remaining two are moderate and severe frailty. Frailty is not a disease that clinicians
code, but we show that it is vital for both spending and health. We measure the prevalence of each
condition using information from medical claims combined with imputations based on self-reports
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
       Medical spending is straightforward to measure, but health is not. The concept we wish to
measure is quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), defined as the expected number of years a
person will live adjusted for the health-related quality of those years. To match our focus on the
elderly, we measure QALE as of age 65. Mortality by age is readily available; quality of life is
not. We develop an empirical measure of quality of life based on survey data asking about
necessary physical activities, sensory impairments, and how much health interferes with social
interactions. We estimate that over the 1999–2012 time period, quality-adjusted life expectancy
increased about one year age at age 65. The increase in QALE is the net effect of two offsetting
trends: the prevalence of chronic disease is rising as obesity increases, while people with chronic
diseases are on average living longer.
       The bulk of our empirical analysis compares the change in spending for each condition
over time with the change in health outcomes for people with that condition. Measuring the growth
in medical expenditures and health implications of each condition is complicated because of
comorbidities. If a person has a heart attack, should the spending for the hospital stay be attributed
to the coronary event itself or to the mental illness, which made taking preventive medication

                                                  2
difficult? Since both conditions are at fault, we need a method of decomposing spending and health
decrements that partials out the spending and health decrement to both conditions appropriately.
       Our assumption, consistent with clinical literature, is that medical care for a condition
affects the health of people with that condition but not the prevalence of other conditions. That is,
care for a heart attack influences the length and quality of life for people with a heart attack but
not whether the person develops cancer. The only exceptions we make to this assumption are for
conditions with well-identified clinical links, such as high blood pressure leading to heart disease.
The implication of our assumption about there being few clinical risk factors is that most
prevalence changes are assumed to fall outside of the medical sector. Thus, the productivity of
medical care is mostly determined by health trends for people once they have acquired diseases.
       Even focusing on the outcomes per case of disease, there are still empirical challenges in
attributing outcomes to conditions. Most people have more than one condition, and thus a method
must be used to decompose spending among conditions. We use a propensity score framework to
do this. We compare spending, mortality, and quality of life for a person with each condition to
similar people who do not have the condition. This yields an estimate of spending and health
outcomes that result from that condition. The estimates are then further adjusted so that total
spending and mortality match national totals. The result is condition-specific spending, mortality,
and quality of life for each year 1999–2012.
       To test the quality of our estimates, we compare the health changes we estimate to disease
models in the literature. For both heart disease and some cancers, there are well-validated disease
models indicating how specific treatments have affected survival. We show that the impact of
medical treatment changes using our method is very close to that in the literature.
       Using our estimates of spending and health changes by condition, we estimate productivity
for medical care alongside productivity for each of the 80 conditions. On net, we estimate positive
productivity growth in medical care. Aggregate productivity growth is 9% over the time period or
0.7% annually. In comparison, official data indicate a productivity change of 0.1% annually over
this time period.
       However, there is considerable heterogeneity in productivity by condition. At the upper
end, care for cardiovascular disease has been extremely productive; health has significantly
improved with minimal cost changes or in some cases cost reductions. Similarly, there is improved
health in areas as diverse as kidney failure, lung and colorectal cancer, and frailty. At the other

                                                 3
end, productivity growth is low for patients with mental illness, arthritis, and other musculoskeletal
conditions. There are some areas with negative productivity growth, but the magnitude of these
productivity reductions is not large. Instead, the data show some conditions with very high
productivity and a number indicating little or no productivity growth. This heterogeneity in
productivity is indicative of a medical system where input allocation is not always optimized.
         The paper is structured as follows. The first section discusses the conceptual issues in
health accounting. The second section describes our data. The third section details our
methodology for estimating condition-specific spending growth and health improvement. The
fourth section estimates spending changes by condition, and the fifth section does the same for
health improvement. The sixth section presents productivity estimates. The last section concludes.
There are two appendices: one describing our data set and the adjustments we make to it and a
second giving details on our spending and health attribution models.


I.       Accounting for Health
         A.       Current Treatment of Medical Care in NIPAs and Problems
         The United States has two sets of medical spending accounts, one a part of the NIPAs and
a second maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The two have
many features in common (Sensenig and Wilcox, 2001). Both measure medical spending, not
health outcomes. Both divide spending into industries based on the type of provider, not the
disease. In the NIPAs, there are 13 industries relevant to health care, reflecting a mix of goods
(prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, and medical equipment) and services (e.g., hospital
care and physician care). 3
         The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures prices in each industry via surveys.
Providers in the price surveys are asked to price the same bill over time, holding constant patient
characteristics, payment source, and method of payment (for example, a hospitalization for a heart
attack without significant comorbidities, covered by the Blue Cross-Blue Shield HMO plan). As
in most industries, quality adjustment is designed to occur at the price index stage. Real output is
nominal spending deflated by quality-adjusted prices (BLS, 2007).


3
  The full list of services includes professional services (physicians’ services, dental services, eyeglasses and eye care,
and other medical professionals) and hospital and related services (hospital services, and nursing homes and adult day
care). Health insurance is its own category. CMS further decomposes spending by payer (public insurance, private
insurance, out-of-pocket, etc.), though that is not our concern in this paper.

                                                            4
           In practice, there are several difficulties with the national account treatment of health. We
demonstrate these issues with an example consisting of a single condition, heart disease. The first
problem is adjusting for changing quality. Imagine that a new surgical procedure is developed that
allows people with heart disease to live longer. The impact of the new surgery on the medical price
index will depend on how it is paid for. If the new service is placed in its own payment bucket, it
will be linked to the existing price index and its introduction alone will not affect price trends. If
the new surgery is placed in the same billing category as an older surgery or is put there by BLS, 4
the price index will rise or fall depending on the relative reimbursement for the old and new
surgery. However, neither of these methods has an explicit quality adjustment.
           BLS does not have a good quality adjustment in health care. Respondents to the BLS
pricing surveys are asked to indicate if the good has changed materially, but few say so. And many
changes in quality result from a series of small steps more than one large change. This is true in
many industries, so other quality-adjustment techniques are standard. In many industries, quality
adjustment is done through hedonic analysis (Groshen et al., 2017). For example, prices for each
procedure or medication over time could be regressed on characteristics of the therapy, including
outcomes and side effects (Cockburn and Anis, 2001; Comaner et al., 2005), with the non-quality
component of a price change being the price index.
           For several reasons, however, hedonic analysis is unlikely to work well in medical care
(Berndt et al., 2000): consumers rarely pay the full cost of care they use, so marginal valuations
are not equal to price; hedonics do not work well in life-or-death decisions; information
asymmetries mean that consumers are unlikely to know the real value of services when they
receive them; and health outcomes are difficult to parcel out to particular interventions, making it
difficult for doctors and patients to know the consequences of what they are doing. As a result,
hedonic analysis is not used in health care.
           The impact of omitting quality change could be substantial. Life expectancy at birth
increased 3.2 years between 1990 and 2017, at a time when estimated medical care productivity
was falling. If even a portion of the health improvement were due to medical care, and this effect
was captured, the overall evaluation of medical care productivity could change considerably.
           A second problem with current methods is that they do not account for substitution across
industries. Returning to the heart disease example, suppose that a new class of pharmaceuticals is

4
    For example, BLS made brand and generic drugs equivalent in the medical spending account.

                                                         5
developed that substitutes for surgery in people with heart disease. No lives are saved, but the new
medication is sufficiently inexpensive that less is spent in total. Regardless of whether the new
drug is linked into the existing pharmaceutical index or included in a basket with other
medications, the national accounts will not show any productivity gain from reduced surgery. That
is because pharmaceuticals and hospital care are different industries. In essence, the shift from
surgery to medication will be attributed to consumer tastes, not to medical care productivity.
           To make progress on both of these issues, we need to partition medical care into more
appropriate industries. The assumption we make is that the patient cares about their health and the
total amount they spend on treatment, but not what particular treatment they receive. That is, pills
and surgery differ only in their cost and whether they lead to different health outcomes. On all
other metrics, they are the same. As a result, the relevant industries are not the providers of therapy
but rather the conditions being treated.
           The Bureau of Economic Analysis has reached a similar conclusion and has recently started
experimentally measuring medical spending on a condition basis (Dunn et al., 2015). However,
the methods to do this are complex, as we explain below. And no attempt has been made to measure
health outcomes systematically.


           B.       A Satellite Health Account
           To understand the concept behind a health account, we start with individual behavior and
then introduce technological changes. Our framework parallels that of Murphy and Topel (2006),
though it is richer in the treatment of medical advances.


           Individual utility
           Consider a population of ex-ante identical individuals who receive utility from two goods:
health and non-medical consumption. 5 Health is denoted Ht(a) for a person aged a in year t. We
denominate health so that it ranges from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). In any period, the utility is
multiplicative in health and a concave function of non-medical consumption, xt: Ut (a) =
Ht (a) U(xt ), where U′>0 and U″<0. Thus, greater non-fatal health increases the value of all other
consumption, a reflection of quality-of-life improvement. Lifetime utility is the present value of
flow utility for each year the person is alive. Denote St(a0) as an indicator for whether the person

5
    For convenience, we omit labor supply. Adding a labor-leisure choice would not change the results materially.

                                                           6
is alive in year t conditional on being alive at age a0 in t=0. ρ is the discount rate. Lifetime welfare
is then given by:
                      ∞

          W(a0 ) = � (1+ρ)-t St (a0 ) Ht (a) U(xt ) .                                                        (1)
                      t=0

        If people are fully insured or nearly so, medical spending in any period will be the average
spending in the population, denoted mave,t. 6 mave,t may vary over time because the quantity of
treatments change or the price paid per treatment changes; given our external measure of quality,
we do not need to differentiate these. The budget constraint is then that the present value of medical
and non-medical consumption must be less than or equal to the present value of income plus initial
assets (A0 ). With perfect annuity markets, this will be an equality:
           ∞

          � (1+ρ)-t St (a0 ) (Yt -xt -mave,t ) + A0 = 0 .                                                    (2)
          t=0

For convenience, we assume the interest rate is equal to the discount rate, but this is not necessary
if individuals can borrow and lend. Individuals maximize utility (1) subject to the budget constraint
(2). The formulation of this problem is given in equation (3)
                     ∞

          W(a0 ) = � (1+ρ)-t �St (a0 ) Ht U(xt ) + μ St (a0 ) (Yt -xt -mave,t )� + μ A0 .                    (3)
                    t=0

Equation (3) is denominated in utils. To translate this into dollars, we divide both sides by the
marginal utility of wealth, μ.
        There are two objects of choice in equation (3): medical spending and non-medical
consumption. 7 While medical care decisions are the outcome of some optimization problem, it is
not clear that it is a rational decision. In any event, our empirical work does not rely on the
optimality of medical care decision-making. To derive the relevant accounting, we assume only
optimization of non-medical consumption. This implies that the marginal utility of non-medical
consumption is the same in all periods; Ht U't = μ.


        The Impact of Medical Treatment

6
  In the absence of this assumption, the value of medical spending varies because marginal utility of income changes
with spending on medical care.
7
  One might imagine that some consumption goods also affect health, for example smoking. Our empirical analysis
does not assume that such goods are chosen optimally, and there is much evidence that they are not.

                                                          7
          We now provide more detail on medical conditions and treatments for them. People have
one or more medical conditions, each one denoted by c. The prevalence of condition c at time t is
prevct, and spending is mct. Prevalence may be exogenous or endogenous; we specify which in the
empirical section. Similarly, we omit for now the problem of decomposing spending among
comorbid conditions. Bold terms denote vectors, where each element is the value for each
condition. Thus, condition prevalence and medical spending per condition at time t are given by
prevt and mt. Population average medical spending is the product of these two terms: mave,t =
prevt ∙mt .
          The vector of mortality rates for each condition is denoted γat. This varies by age and may
change over time as medical treatments or other factors change. Aggregate mortality is the
prevalence-weighted average of the mortality rates for individual conditions: Γat = prevat∙γat. 8 The
survival rate in equation (3) is the product of the survival rate at each age up to a: St (a0 ) = ∏t-1
                                                                                                   τ=0 (1-

Γa� τ ), for a� =a0 +τ.
          Medical care also affects quality of life. We assume quality of life is linear in the decrement
associated with each condition: Ht (a) = h�t (a) - prevat∙hat , where h� t (a) is the level of health for
people with no conditions – which may be below one due to non-captured conditions – and hat is
the vector of health decrements associated with each condition, which depend on medical
treatments.
          The question we ask is how welfare is affected by changes in medical treatments. Consider
treatment changes for a single condition, c. For notational simplicity, consider a situation where
the amount paid for each service does not change, so that treatment changes are synonymous with
changes in condition spending. 9 Changes in mc affect welfare in up to three ways. The first is the
direct monetary effect of changes in spending. The lifetime spending impact of treatment changes
is − ∑∞t=0 (1+ρ)-t St (a0 ) prevct ∆mc , the discounted sum of spending increases among people who
are alive at each age.
                                                                                            dSt (a)      dγ
          Second, treatment changes may affect survival or quality of life. �                         � �dmc � prevct ∆mc

  By adding across conditions, we are assuming that mortality rates are independent; i.e., the mortality rate from cancer
does not depend on whether the person also has heart disease. Our data are not rich enough to allow us to estimate
interaction effects in mortality rates.

  If prices were changing as well, we would need to distinguish the effect of quantity changes from the effect of price
changes.

         Finally, changes in medical care for some conditions might affect the prevalence of other
conditions. We term such conditions risk factors, as opposed to ‘direct conditions’, which have an
immediate effect on health. In our empirical analysis, a condition can be both a risk factor and a
direct condition, as with diabetes. Consider a risk factor c that influences the prevalence of direct
                                                                                                    dS             U

The first row is the direct effect on health, the second row is the impact on health through risk
factors, and the third row is the loss from increased spending.
         Equation (4) is the multi-factor productivity (MFP) of medical treatment changes, or what
Abraham and Mackie (2006) term ‘social profit’. MFP can be positive or negative. We express
                                                                                                             W(a0 )

         An alternative metric of treatment impacts is the quality-adjusted price of medical care.
The price of providing medical care in the base period is the present value of lifetime medical
spending: P0 = ∑∞t=0 (1+ρ)-t St (a0 ) mave,t . Over time, this rises to P1 as treatments change. The


                                                                      9
quality-adjusted price change is the unadjusted price change less the dollar value of the
                             �)/P0, where ∆V
improvement in health, (P1- ∆V             � is the value of health in period 1 prices. 10
         Equation (4) is written from the perspective of the average person in society (a ‘per capita’
measure). An alternative is to estimate productivity for a person with condition c (a ‘per case’
measure). The per capita and per case measures are approximately related by the prevalence rate. 11
In evaluating each condition individually, we present the per case metric. That is, we ask the
question: how is the welfare of people with condition c affected by treatment changes for that
condition, assuming the person had the condition in the first and all subsequent years? We do this
so that we can more easily compare across conditions. In contrast, when we evaluate medical care
as a whole, we consider treatment changes per capita: what has been the impact on social welfare
of all the medical care changes that have occurred?
         To estimate productivity, we measure each term of equation (4) empirically. The primary
difficulty in doing so is isolating the impact of treatment changes from other factors influencing
health and medical spending. We detail our approach to this issue after first describing the data we
employ.


II.      Data and Population Trends
         The data needs in constructing a satellite health account are substantial, including
information on overall medical spending matched to disease prevalence, risk factors, and other
socioeconomic information. Our primary dataset is the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
(MCBS), an ongoing survey of the Medicare population. We describe the data briefly here and in
more detail in Appendix A.
         Medicare is nearly universal in the elderly population and covers disabled people below
age 65. To ensure a representative sample of the population, we utilize only the population age 65
and over, roughly 13,000 people per year. MCBS has data on all medical services – both Medicare
and non-Medicare. Spending on the elderly is about one-third of national medical spending.
         We modify MCBS data in two ways. First, claims data, and hence costs of care incurred,
are only available for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare (i.e., not in Medicare Advantage HMO


10
   See Sheiner and Malinoskaya (2018). Note that nothing constrains prices in period 1 to be positive. A negative price
is equivalent to an innovation sufficiently valuable that people would have to be paid in period 1 to take the treatment
in period 0, given that period 1 treatment is available.
11
   They are not exactly the same because survival is non-linear in prevalence.

                                                          10
plans). To account for this, we reweight the population in traditional Medicare to reflect total
Medicare enrollment, adjusting for the different demographics and health status of the two groups.
Second, the MCBS spending totals differ slightly from national estimates of medical spending in
the elderly (by roughly 10% on average; CMS, 2018). We adjust MCBS spending by type of care
to reconcile the MCBS to national totals.
        Figure 1 shows per capita spending for elderly Medicare beneficiaries, in real $2010 dollars
(all spending data in this paper are in real dollars). Spending rose from $13,096 per capita in 1999
to $17,736 per capita in 2012, an increase of $4,700 or 2% annually. There is a slowdown in
spending growth around 2005, which we return to below (see also Cutler et al., 2019).
        MCBS has a variety of sociodemographic and behavioral controls, shown in Table 1. This
includes demographics (age, gender, and race/ethnicity), socioeconomic information (poverty
status, the highest grade of education completed, marital status, and service in the armed forces),
behavioral risk factors (smoking and Body Mass Index [BMI]), self-reported health (one year prior
and relative to others of the same age), and difficulty with everyday activities such as eating,
shopping, walking, preparing meals, and doing light housework.


        A. Population Health
        Our primary measure of health is quality-adjusted life expectancy or QALE. Using the
notation from section IA above, QALE at age a0 is defined as: 12

        QALE(a0 ) = ∑Tt=0 St (a0 )∙Ht (a) .                                                                (5)

Consistent with our focus on the elderly population, we take a0 to be age 65.
        Actual QALE will depend on a cohort’s realized survival and quality of life. Following
conventional methods, we measure health using period methods. We assume that the survival rate
and quality of life for a person as they age will equal average survival rates and quality of life for
people of that age in the base year.
        Survival rates are straightforward to measure, as mortality is tracked in national data.
Figure 2(a) shows the age-adjusted mortality rate in the elderly population from 1999 to 2012.
Mortality fell by 23 percent between 1999 and 2012.


12
  QALE is not discounted in this equation, while welfare discounts health. That is largely a semantic distinction.
QALE is a physical concept – years of quality-adjusted life. Such a unit is better expressed without discounting. The
value of those years, in contrast, is discounted.

                                                        11
          There is no universally accepted metric of quality of life. We thus develop a metric using
available data. We measure quality of life based on a person’s ability to engage in essential aspects
of living, such as caring for oneself or engaging in social activities. We term these health indicators
‘symptoms and impairments’ and denote the vector of prevalence rates as sit. These may change
over time as medical care improves or a health condition worsens. 𝐡𝐡𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬 is the corresponding vector
of health decrements. In principle, hsi could also vary over time; in practice, we do not have the
data to allow for this. Quality of life is thus defined as Ht (a)= h� t (a) - sit(a)∙𝐡𝐡𝐬𝐬𝐬𝐬.
          Our choice of symptoms and impairments, along with the health decrement weights, are
determined by data availability. The symptoms and impairments from MCBS we analyze are those
in the upper part of Table 1. A first metric is functional limitations, including difficulty walking,
stooping/crouching/kneeling, lifting or carrying heavy objects, reaching or extending arms, and
writing or grasping small objects. People are also asked whether they have impairments in any of
6 Activities of Daily Living (ADLs, including dressing, bathing, or toileting) or Instrumental
Activities of Daily Living (IADLs, such as managing money, shopping, or doing light housework).
In addition, people are asked whether they have difficulty seeing or hearing. Finally, people are
asked whether health limits their social interactions. Appendix Figure A3 shows the trend in each
of these measures of health over time. While this is a rich set of metrics, it is worth noting that
several domains of health are not asked about explicitly, including pain, cognition, and mental
health.
          To estimate the hsi vector of health decrements for each symptom or impairment, we use
data from the 2002 Medical Expenditure Panel Study (MEPS). This survey asks people questions
about their health similar to the MCBS and also included an overall health assessment on a scale
from 0 (‘worse imaginable health state’) to 100 (‘best imaginable health state’).13 To form the
disutility weight associated with each impairment, we regress the scale response on the symptoms
and impairments. 14 The results of the regression are shown in Appendix Table A5. The constant
term, an estimate of h� , is .85, and is statistically different from 1. The deviation from 1 indicates

13
   The specific question is from the EQ-5D: “To help people say how good or bad a health state is, we have drawn a
scale (rather like a thermometer) on which the best state you can imagine is marked by 100 and the worst state you
can imagine is marked by 0. We would like you to indicate on this scale how good or bad your own health is today,
in your opinion. Please do this by drawing a line from the circle below to whichever point on the scale indicates how
good or bad your current health state is.” https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/
14
   We do not include demographic variables such as age because we do not want them to pick up the effect of symptoms
and impairments. That said, the estimates associated with the symptoms and impairments do not differ greatly if
demographics are included.

                                                        12
unmeasured symptoms and impairments and possibly health decrements not due to articulated
problems, such as unmeasured frailty. All of the coefficients for the impairments are negative and
statistically significant. The largest decrements are for health interfering with social interactions (-
.16 for moderate impairment and -.20 for severe impairment) and for severe walking difficulty (-
.12).
        We use these coefficients to calculate quality of life for each person in the MCBS. The
lowest imputed quality of life is 0.26; the average is 0.69. Figure 2(b) shows the trend in quality
of life between 1999 and 2012. Quality of life was generally unchanged with a very modest
increase. Put another way; survival has increased without creating a larger impaired population.
        The combination of falling mortality and relatively constant quality of life implies that
quality-adjusted life expectancy increased. This is shown in Figure 2(c), which plots QALE at age
65 over time. In 1999, the typical person aged 65 could expect to live 12.2 quality-adjusted years.
In 2012, the value was 13.2 years, a 1-year increase in just over a decade.


        B. Identifying Conditions
        There is an enormous number of medical conditions; over 68,000 are noted in the latest
International Classification of Diseases (ICD, version 10). This is too many for our analysis. The
Agency for Health Care Research and Quality has consolidated this list into 285 Clinical
Conditions (termed CCS; Elixhauser et al., 2014). However, even this condensed list is too
granular for our purposes. For example, over 20 codes are for pregnancy, and many others are for
childhood conditions. In consultation with clinical experts, we reclassified the AHRQ summaries
into 80 conditions (Raghunathan et al., 2020), shown in Appendix Table A6. 15
        One way to characterize these 80 conditions is by chapters of the ICD manual: circulatory
disease, respiratory disease, and so on. There are 19 chapters in the 9th edition of the ICD. We
delineate highly prevalent conditions within each chapter and generally create an ‘other’ category
for the remainder. For example, our cardiovascular disease conditions include ischemic heart
disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and cerebrovascular disease, and other heart and vascular
disease – the latter of which is the residual. In some cases, there are no apparent subsets to pull
out, and the entire chapter is left as one condition (as with gastrointestinal and liver disease). Some


15
  These conditions largely combine CCS categories, though some CCS categories are disaggregated given relatively
high prevalence and differing disease courses in the elderly.

                                                      13
catchall categories are a bit broader. Two of our conditions are ‘aftercare’ (general sequelae to a
hospitalization, for example physician visits for medication monitoring after surgery), and ‘signs
and symptoms’ (adverse medical events of unknown origin, such as fainting or nausea).
        In addition to clinical conditions, we create conditions for moderate and severe frailty. We
think of these as akin to ‘old age’. The frailty measures are based on self-reports of difficulty or
inability to do 5 activities: stooping/kneeling, lifting 10 lbs, reaching over one’s head, writing, and
walking 2-3 blocks. People with a lot of difficulty or an inability to do activities in 1-3 areas are
classified as moderately frail, and people with difficulty in 4-5 areas are severely frail.
        As noted in section I, an important classification of conditions is by whether they directly
influence health (direct conditions) or mostly affect the prevalence of other conditions (risk
factors). Seventy-one of the conditions are posited to have a direct effect on mortality or quality
of life. Five of the conditions are exclusively risk factors. These include hypertension, high
cholesterol, eye and ear disorders, and infectious disease immunization (flu and pneumococcal
vaccine). Two conditions, diabetes and mood disorders, are both direct conditions and risk factors
for other diseases. Finally, there are four cancer screening variables: breast, colorectal, prostate,
and cervical cancer. Conceptually, these are closely related to risk factors, in that they influence
health by affecting direct conditions. The difference is in the nature of the health impact: cancer
screening does not reduce the incidence of cancer and may increase it (Welch and Browley, 2018),
while the treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of heart disease. 16 Thus, the empirical
treatment of screening and risk factors is different. Figure 3 shows the direct conditions that are
matched to each risk factor condition.
        Most of the conditions that we measure have long-term impacts on health and medical
spending, for example heart disease or kidney failure. 17 Thus, our measure of prevalence is
whether the person ever had the condition. In principle, one might want to distinguish cases that
are entirely chronic from those where an event occurred in the indicated year. However, the annual
incidence of many conditions is too small to permit this.
        To measure the prevalence of each condition, we start with diagnoses in the claims data in
MCBS for all conditions except frailty, which is based on self-reports. Claims data are known to


16
   Colon cancer screening through colonoscopy is a hybrid; it both detects cancer earlier and reduces the development
of colon cancer, for example by removing polyps.
17
   Exceptions include conditions with an explicitly temporary impact, such as acute infectious disease and cancer
screening.

                                                        14
underreport prevalence, especially for less severe conditions. For example, 23% of people in the
MCBS have a claim for arthritis in a year, but nearly half of the aged population in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) reports having been diagnosed with
arthritis. To estimate true prevalence, we impute ‘calibrated conditions’ using self-reports of ever
having had a condition in NHANES.
       The procedure is described in detail in Appendix A.4. When a disease that has a self-report
question in NHANES matches one of our categories (e.g., ischemic heart disease), we impute
prevalence in the MCBS to match the prevalence in NHANES, using demographic and health
measures to match individuals across surveys. When there is not an exact self-report, we impute
prevalence using conditions that have a similar overall prevalence rate to the relevant MCBS
condition. In each case, we form five multiply-imputed datasets, based on imputing different
people to have each condition.
       One important addition that comes from using the NHANES is that we can impute
undiagnosed hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes, which are included in the NHANES
from measurement and blood draws. As we show below, the treatment of cardiovascular risk
factors is a significant part of health and spending changes for the elderly, so this imputation is
quite valuable. Since the NHANES data are from 1999 on, our analyses are limited to 1999–2012.
       For presentation purposes, we generally aggregate the 80 conditions into 30 groups of
relatively similar conditions. For example, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and coronary
atherosclerosis (build-up of plaque in the coronary arteries) are grouped into ischemic heart
disease. Within the 30 categories, trends tend to be relatively similar for the individual conditions.
Appendix B shows all of our results for the 80 conditions.
       The list of aggregated conditions, along with prevalence in 2012, is shown in Figure 4.
Cardiovascular risk factors are the most common condition; 86% of the elderly population has one
or more. Other common conditions include musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., arthritis and back
pain), eye and ear problems, respiratory problems, and uncategorized signs and symptoms. The
presence of multiple chronic conditions is very common. The average elderly person has 13
conditions, and 95 percent of people have three or more conditions.
       The prevalence of most conditions is rising over time (Appendix Table A6). The largest
increases are for cardiovascular risk factors, chronic renal failure, and musculoskeletal issues, all
of which are partly a consequence of obesity. We return to the role of obesity in section IV. The

                                                 15
major exception to the trend of rising prevalence is frailty. Moderate frailty was constant over time,
and severe frailty fell.


III.    Methodology for Estimating Spending, Survival, and Health Decrements by
Condition
        Our primary empirical challenge is to determine the effect of changes in treatment for each
condition on medical spending for that condition and health outcomes. As with any production
function, we make several assumptions to allow us to identify the impact of a particular input. A
first assumption was noted above: disease prevalence is determined by factors outside of the
medical system. The only exceptions to this are clinically identified risk factors, shown in Figure
3.
        Even with that assumption, there are still empirical issues to overcome. The primary
concern is comorbidities. When people have multiple conditions, it is difficult to know which
condition to attribute spending and health outcomes to and thus which conditions are more and
less productive over time. There are two general approaches in the literature to addressing
comorbidities (Ghosh et al., 2020a). The first approach relies on physician identification. Most
medical claims have a diagnosis, coded by the treating physician. These diagnoses can be used to
distribute the dollars associated with an event to conditions. For example, some analyses attribute
all spending to the primary diagnosis, while others divide among primary and secondary diagnoses
based on some type of rule. Similarly, the physician or coroner certifying death indicates an
underlying cause, which can be used to classify the cause of death. There is a long history of
researchers using physician attribution to measure condition-specific spending and health
outcomes. 18
        However, the physician attribution methodology has several drawbacks. As noted above,
not all diseases are coded on claims records. Thus, spending cannot be parceled out to all
conditions. Death certificates are subject to similar error. Because heart stoppage is the definition
of death, heart disease is overcoded on death records relative to other causes (Messite and
Stellman, 1996). Further, there is no obvious methodology for allocating quality of life to
conditions, since physicians do not rate quality of life decrements for patients. Finally, the


18
   See, for example, see Rice (1967) and Thorpe et al. (2004) for models of spending. The BEA uses this methodology
in their satellite spending accounts (Dunn et al., 2015; Dauda et al., 2019).

                                                       16
physician attribution approach cannot account for non-medical contributors to outcomes. If people
are more obese and thus cost more when they have a disease, the physician attribution approach
has no way to distinguish this from the provision of less valuable medical care.
        We thus pursue an alternative approach to condition attribution. We relate medical
spending, survival, and quality of life in a year to all the conditions the person had that year along
with demographic and behavioral characteristics. Comparing people with a condition to otherwise
similar people without the condition gives an estimate of the spending and health outcomes that
result from that condition. We estimate these models each year and calculate productivity over
time as the dollar value of the change in health less the increased spending.
         The specific methodology we employ is described briefly here, and in more detail in
Appendix B. Before presenting details, it is worth noting that we do not have random variation in
treatments with which to measure the impact of medical treatments. As a result, our evaluation of
health and spending changes is a form of ‘residual analysis’ – the difference for people with and
without each condition after controlling for other factors that influence health. To validate our
most important results, we show below that our attribution of the sources of health improvement
matches simulation models in the clinical literature where such models exist.


        Step 1: The first step is to estimate the effect of each condition on spending and the impact
of the direct conditions (i.e. conditions that are not exclusively risk factors) on mortality and
quality of life. To do this, we use a propensity score model. 19 A separate logistic regression for
each condition and year is used to predict whether a person has each condition. The covariates
include the demographic and behavioral risk factor variables shown in Table 1 along with dummies
for the other 79 conditions. 20 The results of the propensity score models are used to stratify the
population into quintiles based on the probability of having the indicated condition, or
quartiles/terciles for conditions with relatively low prevalence. The difference in the within-strata
outcomes of people with and without the relevant condition, averaged across strata, is the first
stage estimate. We apply this methodology to each of the five multiply-imputed data sets and


19
   Trogdon et al. (2008) do this in a regression approach. The methodology we propose does somewhat better in out-
of-sample prediction than the regression method; see Ghosh et al. (2020a).
20
   We exclude those conditions that have a deterministic or extremely tight correlation with the condition of the
interest. For example, undiagnosed hypertension is not included in the model for diagnosed hypertension, and gender
is not included in the model for prostate cancer. Appendix Table B1 provides more detail.

                                                       17
average the resulting condition-specific outcomes across replicates.
         Table 2 shows the cohort balance tables for coronary atherosclerosis and acute myocardial
infarction in 1999 as an example. The overall F-statistic fails to reject equality of the means
between cases and controls, and only 2 of the 40 comparisons are statistically different. This is
representative of all the conditions in all of the years.


         Step 2. Adjusting for national totals and outliers. Because each condition model is
estimated separately, the prevalence-weighted average of the spending and mortality estimates in
step 1 will not necessarily add to population average spending and recorded deaths. 21 There is an
additional concern for spending: summing condition-specific costs at the personal level does not
predict anywhere near the number of high spenders that are in the actual data. 22 High spenders
generally do not have different conditions than low spenders. Instead, they have relatively common
conditions that become expensive.
         We address each of these issues in a second stage. For mortality, we adjust the mortality
rate of each condition proportionately so that the aggregate mortality rate in each of three age
groups (65-74, 75-84, 85+) equals the actual mortality rate in that year. In general, the adjustment
is about 20% (Table B4). For medical spending, the procedure is somewhat more complex, since
we also want to reflect the spending of high spenders. We do so with a regression analysis. We
relate the actual cost for each person to the predicted cost based on summing the first stage
estimates to the individual level, interacted with a series of variables capturing high use of services
(Xit ): ActualCostit = PredictedCostit ∙ (Xit 𝛂𝛂𝐭𝐭 ) + εit .
         Xit includes the number of conditions, that number squared, an indicator for any
hospitalization, the number of nights in the hospital, the number of hospital admissions, the number
of days institutionalized, survival in the indicated year, the number of months survived for those
who are deceased, and the number of outpatient claims. We average the Xit 𝛂𝛂
                                                                          � 𝐭𝐭 estimates across
people with each condition to form a condition-specific correction factor. This is then multiplied
by the first stage cost estimates to estimate spending for each condition.
         This adjustment is estimated for each year separately, to allow the impact of high utilization


21
   The quality of life adjustment estimates do not use such an adjustment because there is no national quality of life to
adjust to.
22
   In the data, the ratio of the 90th/10th percentile of spending is 30. Using predicted condition-specific spending, in
contrast, the ratio is only 5. See Appendix Figure B2.

                                                          18
to vary over time. Appendix Table B3 shows the estimates of the equation for the year 2009. The
X variables lead to increased spending in the expected direction; for example, people who spend
more time in a hospital or an institution cost more than people who do not.


         Step 3. Smoothing over time. The estimates from step 2 are subject to noise as the sample
sizes of people with each condition in each year vary and are not always large. To account for this,
we take the annual estimates of spending, mortality, and quality of life decrement for each
condition and fit a second-order polynomial. The fitted values for the beginning and ending years
are then used to estimate productivity changes. 23
         Figure 5 shows an example of the spending and health outcomes for coronary
atherosclerosis and heart attack. Together, these form the category of ischemic heart disease, which
is among the categories where we find the highest productivity growth (as discussed below). The
first panel shows the trends in cost per case, along with the 95% confidence interval (discussed
below) and the fitted values. While there are some outlier years, the trend is generally smooth. The
second and third panels show the same for quality of life and mortality.


         Step 4. Outcomes for Risk Factors and Screening. Our final step is to estimate outputs for
risk factor conditions and screening. To determine the impact of treating risk factor conditions on
downstream conditions, we estimate regression models for each of the final conditions for which
there is an identified risk factor condition. The prevalence of the direct condition (i.e., ischemic
heart disease) is related to the prevalence of the risk factor conditions (i.e., hypertension, high
cholesterol, and diabetes), demographics, and health behaviors such as obesity and smoking. The
resulting coefficients indicate the impact of each risk factor condition on the direct condition over
time. We do this in an early period (1999-2001) and a later period (2010-12). Multiplying these
impacts by the risk factor condition prevalence gives the share of the total population that has the
direct condition as a result of having the risk factor condition. For example, 57% of people in
1999-2001 had hypertension, and people with hypertension were 7.5% more likely to have
ischemic heart disease in those years. Thus, 4.3% (= 57% x 7.5%) of the population had ischemic
heart disease as a result of hypertension. Where possible, we compare our estimates of the impact


23
  Analyses using the average of data in the first three years of the sample and the last three years of the sample provide
similar results, as shown in Appendix Figure B4.

                                                           19
of each risk factor condition on the direct condition to estimates in the clinical literature; Appendix
Table B7 shows that they match up reasonably well.
         To reflect this impact in the health accounts, we increase the total spending, mortality, and
quality of life decrement associated with the risk factor condition by the indicated amount. To
continue the example above, the effect of hypertension is incremented by 4.3% of the health and
spending impacts estimated to be due to ischemic heart disease. 24 This is offset in the ischemic
heart disease condition accounting by reducing the prevalence of heart disease; some of those cases
have been moved to other conditions.
         Appendix Table B6 shows the dollars and deaths that are reallocated from direct conditions
to risk factors. In our heart disease example, one-third of ischemic heart disease cases in 1999-
2001 are estimated to be due to risk factors.
         To account for cancer screening, the ideal data would disaggregate cancers by the stage of
detection; greater screening should reduce late-stage cancer and increase early-stage cancer.
However, our data do not contain cancer stage. 25 In the absence of better data, we take the mortality
impacts of screening from the clinical literature. As shown in Appendix Table B7, the clinical
literature shows clear benefits of breast and colorectal screening for reducing mortality, but unclear
benefits of cervical and prostate cancer screening, especially in the elderly. We thus model only
mortality benefits from breast and colorectal cancer screening. We assume no impact of cancer
screening on quality of life, since quality of life likely varies with any treatment, and treated cases
rise with screening. For these reasons, we note that the productivity of cancer screening is subject
to more uncertainty than are other conditions.


         Step 5: The Impact of Smoking and Obesity. To estimate the contribution of obesity and
smoking to spending growth and health changes, we use a methodology similar to that for clinical
risk factors. We first estimate the impact of BMI and smoking on the prevalence of conditions that
are listed in clinical reviews as resulting from these risk factors. 26 Using data on changes in obesity
and smoking in our sample, we then simulate the impact on the prevalence of direct conditions.

24
   This assumes that the cases that result from hypertension have similar clinical outcomes to those that do not.
25
   An alternative would be to estimate the impact of cancer screening on mortality by interacting the presence of cancer
in the mortality equation with whether the person was screened. A screened person would be expected to have lower
mortality given a cancer diagnosis. Because many of the cancers we examine are reasonably rare, our data do not
permit such an interaction.
26
   Appendix Table B9 compares the values we estimate to those in the clinical literature.

                                                          20
The overall smoking change in the elderly was small in this period (see Appendix Table B10).
While current smoking declined slightly, former smoking increased, especially at the oldest ages.
Thus, the net impact of changes in smoking was minor. Obesity increased rapidly among the
elderly in all age sub-groups.


        Productivity estimates. In estimating productivity, two additional parameters are needed:
                                     U
the value of a year of life V = � t' + (Yt -xt -mave,t )�, and the discount rate (ρ). Our baseline
                                 U       t


assumption is that the value for a year of life in good health equal to $100,000 (Viscusi and Aldy,
2003). We conduct sensitivity analyses assuming the value is alternatively half and twice that
amount. We use a baseline discount rate of 0% and perform sensitivity to a rate of 3% (Gold et
al., 1996).


        Standard Errors. Our estimates of the spending and health impacts of each condition in
each year are a combination of several different estimates. To calculate standard errors for them
and the resulting productivity estimates, we use a bootstrap technique. We draw 1,000 simulated
MCBS samples, taken from the actual MCBS population with replacement. We do this separately
for each multiply-imputed dataset. For each draw, we estimate all four steps above. We use this to
calculate the empirical 95% confidence interval for the spending, health, and productivity impacts
of each condition.




IV.     Change in Medical Spending by Condition
        In this section, we present our estimates of spending by condition. The first two columns
of Table 3 show spending per case for the 30 aggregated conditions in 1999 and 2012 (all in 2010
dollars). Appendix Table B5 shows direct spending for each of the 80 conditions; Appendix Table
B6 shows the transfers from direct conditions to risk factor conditions.
        Almost all conditions are associated with higher spending. The major outlier to this is
cancer screening, where the estimates suggest slightly lower spending for people who are screened
relative to those who are not. It may be true that cancer screening saves money, though it is also
possible that elderly people who are screened for cancer are healthier in ways that our model does
not capture. In some studies (Trogdon, 2008), condition-specific spending is constrained to be non-

                                                21
negative. That may not be necessary for our application, however, as we are interested in the
change in spending at the condition level. If the bias from unmeasured health status is constant
over time, the change in spending will be accurate even if the level of spending is not. Thus, we
do not constrain spending to be positive. That said, caution is warranted about the estimated cost
changes for cancer screening.
        The conditions for which per case spending is highest are generally the ones we would
expect: heart disease, certain cancers (especially lung cancer), dementia, kidney failure, and frailty.
The case-specific cost estimates may seem low, but it is important to recall that these are the cost
per prevalent case of disease, not per incident case. For example, spending on heart attacks is the
average among everyone who ever had a heart attack, not new heart attack cases. Because past
cases generally add a smaller increment to spending than new events, our estimates are smaller
than are typically found in studies looking at acute disease onset.
        Spending for most conditions rose over time. The largest increases were for lung cancer (a
$2,500 per case increase) and arthritis and musculoskeletal problems (an $800 per case increase).
Notably, the conditions that cost the most at a point in time are not always the ones for which
spending rose the most. For example, spending for ischemic heart disease rose only modestly over
the time period, despite starting at a high level.
        This fact has important implications for the understanding of medical spending increases
in this time period. Figure 6 shows the change in per capita spending—per case spending times
the prevalence rate—accounted for by each of our 30 aggregated conditions. Acute cardiovascular
diseases together account for 17% of spending in 1999, but only 4% of the spending increase. The
largest contributors to increased spending are cardiovascular risk factor conditions,
musculoskeletal diseases (which includes arthritis and back pain), and aftercare. Together, these
three conditions account for 40% of the increase in spending.
        Spending per capita can increase because the prevalence of disease increases or because
each case costs more. The importance of each of these is shown by disease in Appendix Figure B5
and overall in the first column of Table 4. Sixty percent of the increase in spending is due to the
greater cost per case, and one-third is due to greater prevalence (the residual is the covariance
term). As noted above, prevalence changes are particularly significant for cardiovascular risk
factors, renal failure, and musculoskeletal problems. These three conditions are also among the
group most likely to be affected by obesity.

                                                     22
            Table 4 shows the simulated impact of smoking and obesity changes on medical spending.
Increased obesity led to an increase in spending of $342 per person while smoking declines led to
a reduction of $64 per capita. There is also a sizeable residual increase in the prevalence of many
conditions not associated with smoking or obesity changes, $1,382, shown in the last row of the
table. 27


V.          Change in Health by Condition
            In this section, we decompose changes in health into the same conditions for which we
estimate the change in spending. Estimates of mortality and quality of life impact for our 30
aggregated conditions are shown in the third–sixth columns of Table 3; results for all conditions
are in Appendix Tables B8a and B8b. The direct conditions are almost all associated with higher
mortality and lower quality of life than not having the condition. Further, the relative magnitude
makes sense; people with lung cancer have an annual mortality rate 15% greater than comparable
controls (this includes past as well as current cases of lung cancer); acute kidney failure adds a 3%
increment to mortality; a person with both would have an 18% higher mortality rate.
            The mortality estimates are worthy of some note, as our method of assessing cause of death
differs from Vital Statistics. The Vital Statistics estimates are based on a single cause judged most
important by a physician or coroner. Our estimates, in contrast, allow each of the conditions a
patient has to contribute to death.
            Our methodology attributes far fewer deaths to heart disease than do Vital Statistics (see
Ghosh et al., 2020b, for details). For example, Vital Statistics data indicate a death rate from
ischemic heart disease of nearly 1,400 per 100,000; our estimates are half as large. The deaths that
we do not code as heart disease are spread across several conditions: kidney failure and blood
disorders, for example. Frailty is also a major cause of death, which is not recorded in the official
data at all. Effectively, our data say that systemic failure is a cause of death more than heart disease
by itself.
            The mortality and quality of life data allow us to estimate QALE for people with each
condition in 1999 and 2012, and thus the change in QALE by condition. These results are shown
in Figure 7. The largest increase in QALE was for cardiovascular diseases—particularly ischemic


27
  It is possible that the impact of obesity on spending is understated, as we only have data on current weight and
conditions are likely to be affected weight in the past in addition to current weight (Preston, et al., 2018).

                                                       23
heart disease but including other cardiovascular diseases as well. People with cardiovascular
disease in 2012 experienced an increase in QALE of 1 year over similar people in 1999. Many
other conditions had increases in QALE that were somewhat smaller than this but still substantial.
For example, people with lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and acute kidney failure all experienced
QALE increases of around 0.4 years. Frail people lived an additional 0.3 quality-adjusted years
over the time period.
        Table 4 shows the combined impact of medical treatments and other factors on QALE at
age 65. The overall increase in QALE noted above (1.0 years) is the net effect of two offsetting
trends. Holding prevalence constant, QALE would have increased by 1.7 years. However, the
rising prevalence of conditions reduced QALE by -.9 years. Some of this reduction in QALE was
a result of increasing obesity (-.13 years). This effect, while only a portion of the prevalence
increase, is quantitatively very large. For example, the impact of obesity on QALE is roughly
equivalent to the entire QALE increase from improved care of musculoskeletal conditions and
mental health conditions combined. 28


VI.     The Productivity of Medical Care
        Having estimated the cost and health consequences of changes in medical treatments, this
section brings the two together to measure productivity. Figure 8 and Table 5 show the calculation
of productivity by condition and for the medical system as a whole. The first column in Table 5
shows the increase in the present value of lifetime costs, the capitalized version of the changes in
Table 3. As with our estimates of quality of life changes, we assume that future spending on each
condition as a person ages is equal to current average spending on that condition at older ages.
        The second column is the increase in QALE. The remaining columns show productivity
estimates for different values of V (the value of a year of life) and ρ (the discount rate). Standard
errors are presented in Table 5 for the productivity estimate for medical care as a whole and in
Appendix Table B12 for each of the conditions.
        Several results are apparent. The overall estimate of medical care productivity, shown in
the first row, is positive. On net, medical care increased in value by $113,000. This estimate is
statistically significantly different from zero. The value of health improvement is roughly


28
  To make these comparisons, we convert the QALE increase per case for these conditions into the QALE increase
per capita. This is done by multiplying by the prevalence rate.

                                                      24
$170,000, offset by an increase in spending of $84,000. The value of remaining life at age 65 was
about $1.22 million in 1999 (12.2 years x $100,000 / year). Thus, medical care increased in
productivity by 9% over the time period ($113,000 / $1.22 million), or 0.7% per year.
       The high overall productivity estimate is a mix of heterogeneous estimates for different
conditions, shown visually in Figure 8. The most productive part of medical care is treatment for
cardiovascular disease, both acute conditions and risk factors. Productivity estimates for acute
cardiovascular diseases are $89,000 in aggregate—79% of the total increase. Other conditions
have more modest but still large increases in value-added. For example, the net benefit from
treatment changes is $38,000 for people with colorectal cancer, $30,000 for people with acute
kidney failure, and $22,000 for frail people. Very few conditions have negative productivity
growth, but many are near 0. For example, there was little productivity change for people with
mental illness ($4,000 on net) or arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions (-$3,000 on net), even
though treatment changed rapidly for both conditions. The declining productivity of treating
musculoskeletal conditions likely reflects the increased use of opioids over this period. These
drugs are expensive and do not appear to be very effective in reducing pain (Phillips, Ford, and
Bonnie, 2017). The poor productivity of mental illness is more difficult to understand. Despite a
vast increase in the number of people treated with drugs for mental illness, the population’s mental
health showed essentially no change over time.
       Columns 4 and 5 of Table 5 show the impact of varying the value of a life-year, to $50,000
in column 4 and $200,000 in column 5. These changes affect the net value of medical care as one
would expect. Medical care as a whole has a value of about $25,000 at the lower value, with a 95%
confidence interval that includes 0. The higher value of life raises the net benefit to just above
$280,000.
       The final column of Table 5 shows the impact of using a 3% discount rate for both cost
and utility discounting. The results are in the same pattern, though the overall magnitude is
somewhat smaller. The net benefit of medical care is $50,000 per person.
       We can alternatively express the impact of treatment changes as the change in quality-
adjusted prices. Real spending per person net of prevalence increases grew by 1.6% annually.
However, taking account of the value of quality-adjusted life, the price index fell by 2.4% annually.


       A.      Cardiovascular disease

                                                 25
        Because cardiovascular disease is so prominent as a cause of death, researchers have
developed clinical models of cardiovascular disease mortality reductions to which we can compare
our results. The most commonly referenced heart disease model is the IMPACT model (Ford et
al., 2007; Ogata et al., 2019). The IMPACT model sorts people into cells based on the presence or
absence of heart disease and uses clinical trial evidence on the impact of different treatments to
simulate how mortality changed over time with treatment changes. For example, one cell of the
model estimates the differential mortality rate for people with prior heart disease who are and are
not taking antihypertensive medications. Using this coefficient and the share of people taking anti-
hypertensive medications over time, the model estimates the change in mortality that is predicted
to have occurred because of the expanded treatment of hypertension. We use the parameters of the
IMPACT model and apply them to treatment changes in the elderly population. 29
        In addition to looking at heart disease, we replicated the structure of the IMPACT model
for congestive heart failure and cerebrovascular disease. In some cases, the studies that provide
the impact of treatments on mortality are the same as those for ischemic heart disease. In other
cases, we find comparable meta-analyses (see Cutler et al., 2019).
        Table 6 shows the comparison of our results to the IMPACT model. The first column shows
national totals for cardiovascular disease mortality. Relative to a constant age and sex-specific
death rate over time, cardiovascular disease mortality in the elderly declined by 300,000 deaths
between 1999 and 2012. The results of the IMPACT model are shown in the second column. The
model suggests there should be 219,000 fewer deaths resulting from medical treatments over the
time period we examine.
        The estimates from our models, presented in the third column, are that medical care
accounts for 233,000 fewer deaths over the time period. This is within 17% of the IMPACT model
estimates. One would expect our results to be somewhat greater than the IMPACT model since we
allow for all effects of cardiovascular risk factors, which include non-cardiovascular complications
such as kidney disease. Thus, the estimates are very close.
        In addition to matching model totals, our results add richness to them. In the national data,
very few deaths are attributable to cardiovascular risk factors, and in the IMPACT model, deaths
due to poor risk factor management are not separated. Our data shows that much of the


29
  The impact of treatments on outcomes is generally not estimated differently for the elderly and non-elderly
populations.

                                                     26
improvement in cardiovascular disease mortality comes from better control of risk factor
conditions. That is, the prevention industry is critical alongside the treatment industry.


         B.       Cancer
         We can also compare our results for certain cancers to those in the clinical literature. Table
5 shows large productivity gains in lung, colorectal, and ‘other’ cancers (most common skin
cancer, benign neoplasms, and cervical cancer). The quality-adjusted life expectancy for each of
these conditions increased about 0.4 years. We compare our results to the clinical literature on lung
and colorectal cancer.
         Survival data for people with cancer are collected by the National Cancer Institute’s
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. 30 Case survival is generally
equivalent to the mortality rate in our results. The trend in mortality that we attribute to lung cancer
matches well with national data. SEER data indicate that mortality per diagnosed case fell 10%
between 1999 and 2012; our estimate is a reduction of 8%. For colorectal cancer, there is a larger
discrepancy: SEER data indicate an 8% reduction in per case mortality, compared to 35% in our
data. This may reflect some additional cases of colorectal cancer detected in our data that are not
in SEER data, perhaps because of polyp removal being coded as cancer. Thus, our colorectal
cancer rates may indicate productivity growth that is too high.
         We attribute the survival gains to medical treatment advances; the clinical literature helps
us evaluate that as well. The major alternative to treatment advances is that improved survival is a
result of detecting smaller cancers that would never become fatal or detecting cancers that would
be fatal but doing so earlier in the process, so it appears that people survive with them longer. 31
Bias from increased diagnosis is unlikely to be an issue in lung cancer, where screening was
minimal over the time period, and most tumors grow rapidly (Noone et al., 2017). Further,
treatments have improved over time. Lung surgery is generally less invasive, and chemotherapy is
more common, as are biomarker-targeted therapies. van der Drift et al. (2012) and Gunn et al.

30
   The SEER data give survival in each year after diagnosis for people diagnosed in each calendar year. To calculate
the mortality rate in a calendar year, for example 1999, we find mortality rates in the first year among people diagnosed
in 1999, in the second year among people diagnosed in 1998, and so on. We weight these mortality rates by the share
of people alive in the relevant year who would have been diagnosed in each past year.
31
   This goes by several names, including lead time bias (the treatment has no impact but the cancer is known about for
longer), length bias (screening detects more slowly growing cancers so that the average mortality rate among clinically
treated cancers falls) and overdiagnosis (the detection of preclinical cancers that would never have become clinically
relevant).

                                                          27
(2018) argue that these treatment changes have improved lung cancer survival in the Netherlands
and Finland.
        Screening for colorectal cancer grew over the time period, therefore diagnosis changes
could be an explanation for improved survival. Other evidence suggests that the attribution to
treatment is likely accurate, however. Treatment changes for colorectal cancer include greater use
of pre-surgical radiation, increased employment of adjuvant chemotherapy, new medications for
metastatic disease, and development of new targeted biologic agents. Colorectal cancer models
suggest that greater use of therapies known about in 2000 could lead to reduced mortality on the
order of what occurred (Vogelaar et al., 2006). Lemmens et al. (2010) and Brouwer et al. (2018)
argue that these treatment changes can explain the improvement in case-specific colorectal cancer
survival that was observed in the Netherlands. However, there is no definitive evidence as yet for
the US.


        C.       Comparison to Existing Economic Estimates
        There are several estimates of health care productivity in the economic literature (Sheiner
and Malinskaya, 2018). However, making comparisons between our analysis and other papers is
difficult. Conceptually, some studies look at changes in the average cost of a year of life over time
(e.g., Romley et al., 2015, 2020), in contrast to the marginal value of additional spending that we
analyze. An increased average cost per unit of health is judged to reflect declining productivity.
Our data show such an increase. 32
        However, this conclusion is only valid if one could have bought additional years of quality-
adjusted life at the same price in the base period. In that case, spending more on health gains in a
later time period is a productivity reduction. If that is not the case, spending more to get more
health may reflect a quality improvement if the health benefit is greater than its cost.
        Empirically, comparisons across studies are difficult because different studies use different
measures of quality. Quality metrics in past studies include clinical estimates of the value of
innovation (Lakdawalla et al., 2015), predicted survival based on biomarkers (Eggleston et al.,
2011), and expert opinion about the value of treatment changes (Berndt et al., 2002). It is unclear

  In 1999, lifetime medical spending of $245,000 bought 12.2 years of quality-adjusted life expectancy in 1999. In
2012, $303,000 of lifetime spending bought 13.9 years (ignoring reductions due to prevalence increases). Thus, the
cost per year of life rose from roughly $20,000 to roughly $22,000.

how these relate to actual changes in outcomes. Even studies that look at health outcomes (Romley
et al., 2015, 2020) do so over different time horizons.
       The most comparable papers to ours are Cutler et al. (1998) and Dauda et al. (2019). Cutler
et al. estimate price reductions of over 14% annually for elderly heart attack sufferers. Dauda et
al. estimate price reductions of over 7% annually for elderly people hospitalized with heart attack,
heart failure, or pneumonia conditions. The price reductions in both of these studies are larger than
we estimate for the average elderly person, reflecting the very high benefits of treatment change
for acute cardiovascular events.


VII.   Conclusion
       Measuring the productivity of medical care is a central policy concern. In this paper, we
model the productivity of the medical sector as a whole and also of specific conditions. We do so
in the context of a satellite health account, an account designed to show the costs and benefits of
medical treatment changes over time.
       Our analysis of medical care productivity yields three primary conclusions. First, medical
treatment changes as a whole have brought benefits greater than their cost. We estimate that the
medical treatment sector expanded in value by $113,000 per elderly person between 1999 and
2012, corresponding to a productivity growth rate of 9% percent. This is below other estimates for
specific conditions, and likely reflects the heterogeneity in the costs and benefits of medical
treatments across conditions.
       The considerable heterogeneity in productivity across conditions is our second major
conclusion. Conditions with significant increases in value include cardiovascular disease,
colorectal cancer, lung cancer, acute kidney injury, and frailty. The major exceptions to the rising
value of care are for people with mental illness and arthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders,
where cost increases have been large, but health outcomes only modest.
       Third, the net benefits of medical treatment changes are partly offset by adverse changes
in the prevalence of diseases. Taken as a whole, rising obesity and other factors leading to
increased disease prevalence reduced quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.9 years between 1999
and 2012.
       One limitation of our analysis is that we have estimated the value of medical care for the
typical elderly person. However, health trajectories have not been the same for all people. For

example, Case and Deaton (2017) show disparate trends in mortality by race and ethnicity in the
adult population. How such findings affect the experience of different socioeconomic groups in
the elderly is unknown and is a worthy topic for future research.

            life disutilities are based on a regression model relating self-rated health on a 0-100 scale in MEPS 2000-
            2002 to measures of ADL impairments, IADL impairments, functional limitations, sensory problems, and
            whether health limits social activities. These impairments are available in the MCBS each year from 1999–
            2012. Weights are assumed to be constant over time. Quality-adjusted life expectancy is the expectation of
            quality-adjusted years of life remaining, using age- and year-specific mortality and quality of life weights.

Note: Each of the risk factors on the left is matched to downstream conditions on the right, based on studies
in the clinical literature. Mood disorders include depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety/PTSD. CVD
includes ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, other heart disease, and peripheral vascular
disease, strokes, and cerebrovascular disease. Renal includes acute and chronic renal failure or end-stage
renal disease. Eye and ear include disorders of the eye and ear. Accidents includes all injury: accidents,
falls, poisoning. The full list of conditions in each category is shown in Appendix Table A6.

Note: The figure shows the prevalence of different conditions in the elderly population in 2012. Except for
frailty, each condition has two parts: the prevalence as measured by claims, and the additional prevalence
added via calibration to prevalence in the NHANES. Frailty is based on self-reports of frailty in MCBS.
Data are weighted using population weights. CNS = Central nervous system; COPD = Chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease; ESRD = End-stage renal disease; ID = Infectious disease.

outcomes over the period, expressed in dollars. Health change is the change in QALE attributed to medical
care and not changes in the prevalence of the condition. The hatched bar shows the change in medical
spending. The red dot shows the net productivity estimate, defined as the dollar value of health improvement
minus the increase in spending.

Note: Spending change uses the present value of expected lifetime costs for each disease per person in the population. QALE
change uses expected QALE at age 65 for each disease per person in the population. The discount rate is 0% in the columns
varying the value of a year of life. The value of a year of life is $100,000 in the column varying the discount rate.

Note: The simulated total decline in mortality is relative to a counterfactual where
age-specific rates were assumed to be constant over time. Estimates from the
IMPACT model are based on the most recent adaptation of the model (Ford et al.,
2007; Ogata et al., 2019). The NHA estimate is from the analytic work underlying
the national health accounts. It includes change in mortality attributed to medical care
and not changes in the prevalence of the condition.
