        The impact of international
                                      capital flows reaches far beyond a Single
  sector of the hnerican
                           economy, however. Every U.S. firm feels the effect,
  which conies through two main channels. First is the
                                                       availability of
  capital, as reflected in interest
                                       rates. Large corporations are increas-
  ingly often borrowing from
                                foreign residents, and portfolio managers are

  increasingly investing abroad. it even the many firms who borrow
                                                                   only at
  home, or the many individuals who
                                      hold only domestic assets, are affected,
  because U.S. interest rates
                                are increasingly determined on world capital
 markets jointly with other countries' interest rates. The
                                                              second channel
  through which U.S. producers are affected is the exchange
                                                             rate, which by
 the l980s has become
                       overwhelmingly determined by flows of capital rather
 than flows of goods.
                        Again, even those firms that don't export are
 affected, to the extent they
                               compete with imports or buy imported inputs.
       This paper is organized in five
                                       sections. Section II reviews briefly
 the postwar history of the U.S. capital account
                                                  up to the l970s, a period
 throughout which Americans were
                                steadily building up a positive net foreign
 investment position. Section III
                                  considers those factors, other than
expected rates of return, that
                                  discourage or encourage international capi-
tal flow: transactions
                        costs, government controls, taxes, default and
other political risk, and exchange risk. The record is
                                                        generally one of
gradually diminishing barriers. Section IV describes the historic
                                                                   swing of
the U.S. capital account in the 1980s toward massive
                                                     borrowing from abroad.
Section V examines international
                                 differences in rates of return on various
assets, and shows how the increase in
                                      interest rates in the United States
in the early l980s attracted
                                the large net capital inf lows.   Section VI
concludes the paper with an analysis of U.S. government

capital inflow. The lesson that emerges             in   the end is that the primary

source of the large U.S. borrowing from abroad, and theref ore of its

counterpart the large U.S. trade deficit, is the federal budget deficit.

 the components of the reverse side of the balance of payments coin, the

 was on net steadily flowing out of the country. Sit the story nevertheless

 features a number of twists and turns over the years.

          In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the United States ran

 large trade surpluses, as measured either by the merchandise balance (goods

 alone) or the balance on goods and services.               These surpluses were the

  The war—ravaged countries had lost much of their industrial and

  agricultural capacity, and needed to import basic necessities of consump-

  tion, as well as capital goods to rebuild their economies. They had a

  shortage of dollars with which to buy such goods. The flow of goods from

     the United States to Europe was financed partly by foreign aid and other

holdings of international reserves •     This last means that the United States

was running a surplus in its overall balance of payments: the surplus in

the current account—defined as goods, services, and transfers—was greater

than the net private capital outflows.

     In the 1950s, as the European and other economies recovered, their

trade balances improved and, as a natural consequence, the U.S. trade

surplus returned to more normal levels. By the end of the decade, the

surplus in goods and services had fallen below the deficit in transfers and

private capital flows, so that the United States was running substantial

overall balance of payments deficits.


2.    The balance of    payments problem in   the l960s

      One could view the emerging U.S. deficit of this period, and the rest

 of the world's surplus, as the natural outcome of steady worldwide growth

 under the "dollar standard." Although the 1944 conference at Bretton

 Woods, New Hampshire, that established the postwar international monetary

 system did not give the U.S. dollar this role officially, the dollar soon

 became the de facto reserve currency of the system, because it was conver-

 tible into gold and because of the economic wealth and political prestige

 of the United States. As world trade grew, countries needed to hold

 growing levels of reserves, and running balance of payments surpluses was

 the only way other countries had of acquiring dollar reserves.          This is the

 sense in which the U.S. balance of payments deficits could be viewed as a

 natural consequence of worldwide economic growth under the monetary system.

 Nevertheless, the increasing ratio of dollars held abroad to gold held by

 the U .5 •   Government began to cause concern •   It    seemed that the system
                                       —5—



 could only become more and more vulnerable over time to a crisis in which

 the holders of dollars around the world would try to cash in their claims

 for gold and the United States would be unable to pay.

      In the early l960s, the balance of payments deficit was entirely a

 deficit of the capital account. The
                                       merchandise trade balance, goods and
 services balance, and current account were all in substantial surplus.

 But, beginning under the Kennedy Administration, capital outflows became

 the subject of increasing concern. Under
                                             "Operation ltdst," monetary
 policy sought to raise short—terra interest rates to attract short—term

 capital from abroad, at the same time as long—term interest rates were kept

low with the aim of stimulating investment. A series of increasingly

strong direct controls on the outflow of capital were also put into place,

though they were not very effective: the rise of the Euromarket, outside

the grasp of U.S. regulators, dates from this period.

     Much of the capital outflow took the form of U.S. direct invesment in

Europe and elsewhere. Outward direct investment increased from $2.9

billion in 1960 to $10.2 billion in 1970, explaining most of the increase

in measured private capital outf low.1 One view was that the United States

was playing a useful role as the world's banker:
                                                    borrowing short—term and
lending long—term. A bank does it by taking deposits and lending to

businesses and homeowners; the world's banker would do it by creating

liquid dollar reserves for others to hold and investing in plant and

equipment abroad. Bit some, the French in particular, resented the idea

that Americans were buying out their factories and land, offering in return

only paper that was less and less adequately backed
                                                      by gold.

3•      The breakup of the ketton Woods syst
        In the late l960s, the U.S • balance of payments problem became more of
a    trade balance problem. The reason was expansionary macroeconomic poli-

cies. After 1965, military spending increased rapidly because of the

escalation of the Viet Nam War. At the same time, domestic spending was

increasing under Lyndon Johnson's Great Society program. Furthermore,

monetary policy accommodated the expansion, with the exception of a couple

of brief attempts at braking. Rapid growth in income resulted directly in

rapid growth in imports. The economy also became overheated, giving rise

to inflation. U.S. inflation, in a system under which the dollar was sup-

posedly not allowed to devalue, resulted in a gradual loss of competitive-

ness by American firms on world markets. In 1971, the U.S. trade balance

went into deficit for the first time in the postwar period. In response to

the trade deficit and to a corresponding loss in reserves, Richard Nixon

unilaterally devalued the dollar in terms of both gold and foreign curren-

cies, placed    a tariff surcharge on imports, and ended the U .S. Government's
commitment to sell gold for dollars to foreign central banks •        This marked

the    end of the Bretton Woods system. Most foreign central banks continued

to cooperate in the effort to prop up the system of fixed exchange rates,

buying up unwanted dollars. Sit by now, private speculators knew that

selling dollars was a good bet. As a result, capital outflows were very

high throughout the early 1970s. In the accounts in Table 1, they show up

as an increase in the rate at which U.S. residents acquired claims abroad

    (and in the statistical discrepancy) .   In   the first few months of 1973,

several of the major central banks had to absorb unprecedented quantities

of dollars, with no end in sight. In March 1973, they ceased their
                                     —7—



commitments to buy and sell dollars at fixed exchange rates. In other

words, the world moved from the fixed exchange rate system to the current

system of floating exchange rates.

     With the exchange rate now free to move, the desire of investors to

allocate a higher proportion of their portfolios to foreign assets suddenly

took the form of an increase in the price of foreign assets in terms of

dollars, that is, a depreciation of the dollar. The depreciation meant

that American manufacturers and farmers could once again compete in world

markets on favorable terms. The current account returned to surplus in the

years 1973—76.


4.   Capital outflow in the mid—l9lOs

     The rate of net private capital outflow reached a stable plateau in

the mid—1970s. This outflow was not primarily a sign of lack of confidence

in the U.S. economy, as it had been in 1970—73. Indeed, there were times,

for example in the immediate aftermath of the late—l973 oil crisis, when

investors increased their demand for dollar assets    Rather, the United

States was behaving as a mature industrialized country generally is

expected to behave: running a current account surplus ($18.1 billion in

1975) and investing the proceeds in other countries where they can earn a

higher rate of return.

     The financial situation began to deteriorate, however, in the latter

half of the decade. Following the oil crisis and the 1975 world recession,

there was concern, particularly in the United States and in developing

countries, that worldwide saving was too high and expenditure too low to

sustain growth. There had been a massive transfer of wealth to the members
                                        —8—



of OPEC, many of whom had a high tendency to save the wealth rather than

spend it. The United States undertook steady fiscal and monetary expan-

sion, with the Europeans following only reluctantly and with a delay. The

result was rapid growth in U.S. imports and a fall in the trade balance; in

1977 and 1978, the current account registered substantial $15 billion

deficits. The Carter Administration could have argued that the trade

deficits were not cause for concern, but to the contrary, were precisely

what was needed: The expansion in demand was sustaining recovery in the

United States, and at the same time was allowing those developing countries

that were faced with sharply increased oil import bills to earn the foreign

exchange to pay them by exporting to the United States, kit the record

deficits did generate concern. In 1977—78, as it was to again in 1985—86,

the U.S. Treasury pressured foreign governments to expand their own

economies   in order to increase purchases from the United States. In both

episodes, reluctant foreign governments had to face the alternative that

the sane goal, reducing the U.S. trade deficit, would instead be accom-

plished by an accelerated depreciation of the dollar.

      We will discuss in later sections the declines in real interest rates

and in the value of the dollar during this period. Here we note that the

swing from surplus to deficit on the -current account in 1977—78 was not

associated with an offsetting swing from deficitto surplus on the private

 capital account •   Private   capital on net continued to flow out at a steady

 rate of about $20 billion a year.3 The U.S. current account deficit was

 financed by increased holdings of U.S. assets on the part of foreign

 central banks ("official foreign assets" in Table 1), rather than on the

 part of foreign private citizens. Much as at the beginning of the decade,
                                      '-9—




foreign central banks were buying dollars in an unsuccessful attempt to

prevent the dollar from depreciating and their own     currencies   from

appreciating.

      The depreciation of the dollar stimulated exports enough to return the

country to a surplus in goods and services in 1979 and 1980. At the same

time, the nature of capital flows began to change. This was the end of a

long period of steady U.S. net investment abroad.4 In the l980s, capital

on net began to flow in to finance U.S. trade deficits, reversing the

pattern of the preceding 35 years •   We   will be picking up the story of the

capital inflows in Section IV.



           III. Rtsk, Government     (bntrols, and Other Ibrriers or
                  Incentives   to International (Spital )bvements

     Many factors influence investors' decisions to move capital Inter-

nationally. The most obvious factor is the expected rate of return that

can be earned in one country or another. In Section V, we will be looking

at various measures of rates of return in the United states and other major

countries, with special reference to the increased attractiveness of U.S.

assets in the early 1980s. &it other factors are important as well.

Indeed, if investors cared only about expected returns and nothing else,

then one would not observe any differentials in rates of return. Investors

would refuse to buy the assets with the lower return and would have an

unlimited demand for the assets with the higher return. In other words,

arbitrage would quickly insure that expected returns were equalized        We

will see in Section V below that this does not quite seem to be the case.

In this section we consider factors other than expected rates of return:
transactions costs, capital controls, taxes, default risk, and exchange

risk.


1.      fransactions costs

        An unavoidable barrier to international capital movements is transac-

tions costs, as represented in the case of securities by a brokerage fee or

a bid—ask spread. Bit this barrier is extremely small for countries with

developed financial markets •    Several factors have worked to reduce trans-

actions costs steadily over the years. Deregulation, innovation, and

economies of scale in international dealings, particularly in the Euromar—

ket, have made the world banking and securities industry more efficient.

Some of the many recent innovations in international markets to make the

issuance of securities, or the management of the accompanying risk, more

convenient for borrowers or lenders include: currency and interest rate

swaps, dual currency issues, mismatched floating rate notes, zero coupon

bonds, equity—related issues, note issuance facilities, and Eurocommercial

paper.6 Reduced telecommunications costs and other technological advances

have also been important. The real cost of sending a telegraphic message

from New York to lnndon or Paris in 1985 was only 8—9 percent of what it

was in 1900, and the real cost of a three—minute off—peak phone call

between Washington and Frankfurt was only 5 percent of what it was in

l950.

        Another factor, exchange rate variability, has worked to raise foreign

exchange transactions costs since currencies began to float. lb make a

market in foreign exchange, banks have to take open positions in foreign

currency, even if only briefly, and the riskiness of doing so has gone up
                                    '-11—




with the variability of exchange rates. As a result, bid—ask spreads have

generally been higher since 1973 than in the past.8 Nevertheless, they are

still on average small—not high enough to create much of a deterrent to

investors' shifting their portfolios in response to a change in the

attractiveness of a country's assets.

     The result of these reduced costs is a very high volume of financial

transactions internationally. For example, a survey by the Federal Reserve

Bank of New York in March 1986 documented a very high level of turnover in

the New York foreign exchange market: $50 billion a day among banks, 92

percent above the previous survey in April 1983, and $26 billion a day

among non—bank financial institutions, up 84 percent over 3 years

earlier,9 The volume of foreign exchange trading was even greater in

London at $90 billion a day.1°

     Due to economies of scale, transactions costs tend to be lower in

currencies that are widely used in trade and financial transactions. The

U.S. dollar has been the world's vehicle currency ever since it inherited

the role from the pound sterling early in the century. A non—U.S. resident

wishing to buy assets of a third country generally must buy dollars first,

before converting them into the third currency. Banks and large corpora-

tions around the world hold dollar transactions balances •   In   1985 over 60

percent of international bond issues were denominated in dollars, as can be

seen from Thble 2. A disproportionately high share of world trade is also

invoiced in dollars.

     Other currencies also play a role in international transactions •     In
ascending order of transactions costs in the 90—day forward markets, as

measured by the percentage bid—offer spread in the period September 1982—
                                     —12—



December 1985, are: the mark, yen, Canadian dollar, Dutch guilder, pound,

and Swiss franc." This ranking of the currencies corresponds roughly to

their ranking in volume of foreign exchange trading in New York: mark,

yen, pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, French franc, and Dutch

guilder.'2 In the 1980g. there has been talk of the yen beginning to play

a more central role. The use of the yen as a currency in which to invoice

trade, issue bonds, and hold reserves, is indeed increasing relative to the

low levels of the past. The share of yen—denominated issues in inter-

national bond markets has gone from 5 .2 percent in 1982 to 10 .4 percent in

1986, including many U.S. borrowers. This is now a greater share than that

of the Deutsche mark, as can be seen in Table 2.13 However, there is

little prospect of the dollar being seriously challenged as the world's

vehicle currency.

     One might also include the cost of obtaining information in the

category of transactions costs, as another barrier discouraging residents

of one country from holding assets in another •   Information   costs are

 relevant, for example, for mortgage holdings because of the difficulty of

 evaluating the credit—worthiness of the borrower. Foreigners hold essen-

 tially no mortgages in the United States, while Americans in the aggregate

 hold about 25 percent of their portfolio in that form. Information costs

 are not a problem f or U.S. 1'reasury securities on the other hand; indeed

 the safety and liquidity of U.S. government securities is so attractive to

 foreigners that they hold about 43 percent of their U.S. portfolio in that

 form, as compared to about 21 percent for Americans.'4 Eurobonds issued by

 well—known U.S. corporations have also been very popular with foreigners in

 recent years for the same reason.

2. pital controls
     In many countries, government controls have been serious barriers to

the international flow of capital. The postwar international economic

system established at Bretton Woods did not incorporate a presumption,

analogous to the one incorporated regarding international trade, about the

undesirability of government intervention in international capital markets.

     The more common use of controls is to discourage the outflow of

capital from a weak—currency country, as in many developing countries, or

as in the United States in the l960s and early 1970s. Sit they are also

sometimes used to discourage capital from flowing into a country, when it

wishes to avoid a real appreciation of its currency or is worried about a

potential loss in monetary control. For example, Germany and Switzerland

had special taxes on interest payments to nonresidents, and maintained

other measures to discourage foreigners from holding assets in their

countries, until 1975.15 Though the controls on capital inflow into

Germany and Switzerland, like the controls on capital outflow from the

United States, were never very effective, their removal no doubt

facilitated part of the increased U.S. acquisition of foreign assets in the

mid—1970s that shows up in Table 1.

     The United Kingdom maintained controls to discourage capital outflows

until 1979. St when Margaret Thatcher came to office, Britain too joined

the club of countries with essentially open financial markets, which by

then consisted of the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the

Netherlands.

     An interesting case is Japan. Until relatively recently, Japan had

very highly regulated capital markets, both domestically and with respect
                                        —'4—




to   international transactions. In the period 1975—78, the Japanese con-

trols worked to discourage capital inflow, with the aim of dampening the

appreciation of the yen. Foreigners were not allowed to hold gensald (a

three—month repurchase agreement) and other Japanese assets •      That the

controls worked to discourage capital inflow can be seen by looking at the

differential in interest rates between gensaki in lbkyo and three—month

Euro—yen in London, which averaged 1.84 percentage points:'6 If it were

not for the controls, investors would not have been willing to hold biro—

yen when a higher interest rate was available in Tokyo.

       When the yen began to depreciate rapidly in 1979, the Japanese moved

quickly to remove restrictions on foreign purchases of Japanese assets.

The differential between the gensaki and Siro—yen interest rates dropped

sharply. Indeed, the London rate exceeded the Tokyo rate after April 1979,

although the differential was relatively small.17 This is evidence that

Japanese controls on capital inflow were liberalized more quickly than

controls on capital outflow, with the objective of dampening the depreci-

ation of the yen against the dollar, If some barriers to capital outflow

had not remained, Japanese investors would not have been willing to hold

assets in Tokyo when a higher interest rate on comparable yen securities

was available in London.

       A controversy arose in October 1983 when some American businessmen,

alarmed by devastating competition from Japanese exporters, convinced top

officials in the U.S.   freasury   Department, despite the evidence just cited,

that   the Japanese Government was still using some form of capital market
restrictions to keep the value of the yen lower than it    would   otherwise
be. There followed a campaign by the U.S. Government to induce the
                                     —15—



Japanese to adopt a whole list of measures further liberalizing their

financial markets. This campaign caine to fruition in the May 1984

Yen/Dollar Agreement between the U.S. Treasury and the Japanese Ministry of

Finance •   Measures liberalizing capital inflows included the elimination of

the "designated company" system that restricted foreign direct investment

in 11 companies. Measures liberalizing capital outflows included relax-

ation of restrictions on nonresident issue of yen bonds (called Samurai

bonds when sold in the Japanese market), relaxation of "administrative

guidance" on the part of the Ministry of Finance over overseas lending by

Japanese banks, and permission to Japanese residents to purchase foreign—

issued commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The Ministry of

Finance retained ceilings on foreign security holdings by insurance com-

panies and trust banks, equal to 10 percent of total assets, until the

ceilings began to become binding in early 1986, at which point they were

raised to a much higher level.

      The result of the liberalization was an increase in net capital

outflows: The Japanese rate of acquisition of long—term assets abroad

jumped from $32,459 billion in 1984 to $56,775 billion in 1985,18 the

majority of it in the form of portfolio investment, as shown in Table 4.

The positive offshore—onshore interest differential, which had been 50

basis points (briefly) as recently as November 1983, disappeared altogether

in 1984.19 Furthermore, the yen depreciated another 8 percent against the

dollar in 1984. In short, the Yen/Dollar Agreement was successful at

increasing Japan's integration into world financial markets, but not at

promoting capital inflow into Japan or a short—term appreciation of the yen

if that was its goal.

     As of early 1986, only France, of the largest industrial countries,

maintained capital controls that were clearly binding by the test of

interest rate differentials. These are controls on capital outflow that

were tightened when the Socialists came to office in 1981. &it even the

French, like the Italians, are in the process of liberalizing. The

offshore—onshore differential, which was 3.88 percent in March 1986,20

vanished thereafter with the election of Jacques thirac, at least

temporarily.

     In the Pacific region, Australia and New Zealand have recently removed

their capital controls, and Hong Kong and Singapore have had open financial

markets for some time. Elsewhere among developing countries, however,

markets remain heavily controlled. Table 5 shows onshore—offshore interest

differentials for a cross section of 24 countries. Many have differentials

that are highly variable and significantly negative on average, indicating

effective controls on the outflow of capital to the world market.21


3.   Thxes

     Taxes are a determinant of international capital flows that might be

considered a sort of government control. Bit it is more common that

avoiding taxes is an incentive to invest abroad than paying taxes is a

barrier to it.        -

     The mere fact that the citizens of one country are taxed at a higher

rate than those of another does not necessarily create an incentive for

capital flows, assuming both groups of citizens are taxed at the same rate

on their foreign interest earnings as on their domestic earnings. Bit in

practice, investors can sometimes evade taxes by keeping their money in tax
                                     —17--




havens, in the Caribbean and   elsewhere.    The United States has to an extent

played the role of tax haven in recent years. U.S. borrowers have offered

bearer bonds, whose ownership depends on physical possession rather than

registry, to eager investors in Fhrope and latin America.22

     The requirement that banks hold a certain fraction of their deposits

in the form of reserves, rather than lending them out at market interest

rates, might be thought of as another tax. U.S. reserve requirements were

one reason for the growth of the Eliromarket in the 1960s and 1970s. Banks

do not have to hold reserves against their offshore deposits and for that

reason are willing to pay a higher interest rate on deposits in the Eliro—

market than on deposits in the United States •    The differential in three—

month interest rates between the &irocurrency market and the U.S. interbank

market exceeded 100 basis points in 1980, as the second column of table 6

indicates.

     By the early 1980s, discouraging capital outflow was no longer a goal

for the United States, and authorities were concerned that the U.S. banking

industry was losing business to Eliro—banks. Beginning December1981, U.S.

banks were allowed to participate in a sort of domestic Eurornarket by

establishing International knking Facilities (IBF5), which are simply a

separate set of deposit accounts without reserve requirements.23 There

followed a large shift in accounts from overseas offices of U.S. banks to

the offices at home, the majority in New York. hit the change is to be

thought of as a shift in the location at which banking services are pro-

vided, rather than as a net capital inflow: &th claims and liabilities to

foreigners were shifted to U.S. banks.

     An important factor in determining international capital flows is

withholding taxes. Until recently, the United States and most other major

countries withheld income taxes on bond interest paid to foreigners, unless

the foreign residents fell under bilateral tax treaties, on the theory that

the income might otherwise escape taxation altogether. .it in July 1984,

the United States abolished its withholding tax.24 This move was an

inducement to foreign investment in the United States •    West Germany,

France and Japan have since also found it necessary or desirable to abolish

their own withholding taxes, in order to "remain competitive" in the eyes

of international investors. Now most countries are potential tax havens

for residents of other countries.


4. Default risk and other Political rislC

     A   corporation   or other borrower that has a possibility of defaulting

on its obligations has to pay a correspondingly higher interest rate to

compensate lenders for that possibility. For example, the reason investors

in the early l980s were willing to hold deposits in U.S. banks at lower

interest rates than could be earned in the Euromarket, in the absence of

controls on capital outflow from the United States, may be that they

thought there was a greater risk of default in the Euromarket. The

differential baetween the Sirodollar and domestic deposit rates cannot be

explained solely by the difference created by reserve requirements on the

side of banks' costs. Figure 1 shows that the differential existed even

when the U.S. deposit rate is adjusted for reserve requirements.

     While U.S. government debt has always been considered close to free of

default—risk, the 1980s debt crisis has forcefully established the point

that governments can default. Indeed, in many Latin American and other

financially troubled countries, government debt has turned out to be no more

guaranteed than private debt •   Even many European governments have to pay a

default—risk premium over U.S. Government debt, as shown in figure 2b below.

     One cannot look at interest rates on new bank lending to the troubled

debtors after 1982 for a measure of the perceived probability of default.

The banks that have large loans already outstanding, knowing that the

likely alternative is default on the earlier debt, have "involuntarily" had

to put in new money in rescheduling agreements. The new loans have been

made at interest rates that——though maintaining positive fig—leaf spreads

over LIBOK (London Interbank Offered Rate)—are far lower than would com-

pensate them for the true risk. Bat one can estimate the perceived default

risk from the discount at which loans trade on the secondary market. As of

December 1986, banks loans were trading at a discount of 32.9 percent for a

weighted average of 15 problem debtors, as reported in Table 17 of

Dornbusch (this volume) .   There is also a secondary market in bonds issued

by some of these countries. Before August 1982, when the Mexican debt

crisis first surfaced, the rate of return on Mexican or frazilian bonds was

below that on World Bank bonds. The prices of the bonds fell to a discount

thereafter, so that their rate of return rose above that on World Bank

bonds. The difference, which should be interpreted as a default risk

premia, peaked at 8.14 percent in April 1983 for Mexican bonds and 6.71

percent in January 1985 for Brazilian bonds.25 (See Table 7.)

     Many analysts believe that the perceived increased risk of default in

Latin America and elsewhere in the world after August 1982 caused a large

flow of capital to the United States, which was considered a safe haven,

and that this was responsible for the large appreciatiân of the dollar.

That there was massive unrecorded "capital flight" out of latin America is
                                       —20--




clear. Comparisons of the current account deficits of countries such as

Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina with the bank debt incurred suggest there

must have been a large increase in unrecorded overseas claims by citizens

of those countries •   It   is less clear that this explains why the demand for

U.S. assets should have been increasing over the entire period 1981—85,

particularly relative to European or Japanese assets as would be necessary

if it were to explain the appreciation of the dollar. If there was a shift

during this period into U.S. assets based on increased perceptions of

safety in the United States, relative to assets held in Europe, then one

would expect interest rates on U.S. assets to decline relative to compa-

rable dollar assets in Europe. This did not happen in short—term interest

rates     Figure 1 shows that the Eurodollar rate actually fell relative to

the domestic U.S. deposit rate after August 1982. Table 6 shows that the

offshore—onshore differential also fell by other measures between 1980—82

and 1983—85. The domestic interest rate can be measured by the U.S.

Treasury bill rate instead of by the interbank rate (first column), and the

offshore rate can be measured in pounds or marks, covered on the forward

exchange market, instead of by the Eurodollar rate (last five columns). In

every case, the short—term interest differential moves the opposite direc-

tion from what the safe—haven hypothesis would predict. (In Section 5

below, we consider analogous long—term interest differentials.)

        There are other kinds of risk, besides the risk of outright default,

that can discourage investors from holding a country's assets. Even if the

country does not currently have taxes on interest payments abroad, or on

the repatriation of profits, and does not have controls on the removal of

principal, there is always the possibility that it will enact such policies
                                     —21—



 in the-future. This is particularly relevant for countries that have had

 capital controls in the past. In the case of direct investment in less

 developed countries, there is the possibility of nationalization of the

 industry. This is one of the reasons why investment in these càuntries

 prior to 1982 usually took the form of bank lending rather than direct

 investment. All these forms of "political risk" are less applicable to

 assets held in the United States than elsewhere, consistent with the view

 of the country as a safe haven for capital. On the other hand, U.S.

 authorities have in recent years been ready to freeze assets of unfriendly

 states, Iran and Libya; and Soviet fears along these lines 30 years ago may

 have been behind their decision to hold dollars in London banks—the

genesis of the Ekiromarket ,26


5. Exchange risk

      cause of the risk of changes in the exchange rate, assets

denominated in dollars are viewed by investors as different from assets

denominated in other currencies. This is true even in the absence of

transactions costs, capital controls, taxes, political risk, or other

barriers to the movement of capital across national boundaries.

     There are many ways residents of one country can increase their net

investment position in another country without increasing their exposure in

its currency. In the first place, even if all assets were denominated in

the currency of the country where issued, U.S. residents could, for

example, increase their net investment position abroad
                                                         by buying back
previously issued dollar bonds. A net capital outflow can be either an

increase in foreign assets or a decrease in liabilities, as the high gross

flow numbers in lSbles 1 or 9 illustrate.
                                   —22—



     In the second place, an investor can acquire claims on foreigners

without their being denominated in foreign currency, and can acquire assets

denominated in foreign currency without their being claims on foreigners.

Many smaller countries issue bonds denominated in dollars, rather than in

their own currencies, so that they will be more acceptable to international

Investors.27 The majority of bank lending to less developed countries has

been denominated in dollars, and the rest in the currencies of other major

industrialized countries, not that of the borrower. Even the United States

Government issued "Carter bonds" denominated in marks in 1978—79. Corpo-

rations increasingly borrow abroad in foreign currency, either as a foreign

bond issue or in the Euromarket.

     At the shorter end of the maturity spectrum, there have been active

forward exchange markets for some time; borrowers are able to hedge foreign

currency liabilities by buying exchange forward, and lenders to hedge

 foreign currency assets by selling exchange forward. At the longer end of

 the maturity spectrun, the rapid growth of currency swaps in the 19805

 allows U.S. corporations to issue Euroyen or Euromark bonds to Japanese,

 Germans, or anyone else wishing to hold these currencies, and then to swap

 the proceeds into dollars. Finally on the list of ways that currency of

 denomination can be divorced from the location of the asset, the prices of

 equities and direct investment are not fixed in any currency, either

 domestic or foreign (though the dollar price of foreign equities does often

 seem to move one—for—one with the exchange rate)

      While these ways exist for an investor to buy a foreign asset without

 taking a position in foreign currency, not all investors should wish to

 avoid taking such a position. Unless an investor is indifferent to risk,
                                    —23—



or is certain what the future exchange rate will be, or is tied to his own

currency by accounting practices, he should wish to diversify his holdings

among dollars, marks, yen, pounds, francs, etc., so as to reduce the

variability in the value of his overall portfolio. It is easy for an

investor, particularly an American, to slip into the habit of viewing his

own currency as safe and others as risky. This view would assign exchange

risk a purely negative role, a cost to be weighed against other factors

like expected return in the decision to buy foreign currencies •   it   the

value of domestic currency is not completely safe, even for an American. A

firm that imports raw materials, intermediate inputs, or other goods from

abroad is vulnerable to an increase in costs from a depreciation of the

domestic currency; such a firm would be wise to take an "open" position in

foreign currency, i.e., to hold some foreign assets or to buy some foreign

exchange on the forward market. (The word "open" is in quotations because

in this case the firm is reducing overall exposure to currency risk, not

increasing it except in the most narrow of accounting senses.) Households

also consume some imported goods, and thus are partially vulnerable to a

depreciation, though there is generally a lag before the depreciation is

passed through to retail prices. Furthermore, the possibility of inflation

in prices of domestically produced goods, whether associated with a change

in the exchange rate or not, provides another reason why the domestic

currency should not be viewed as perfectly safe. The point is that even a

highly risk—averse American might want to hold some foreign currency

assets.

     To citizens of smaller, more open, countries, this point is more

important. In countries with a past history of hyperinflation, parti—
                                        —24—




cularly   in Central Europe and Latin   America,   the desirability of holding

some foreign currency is well understood even by relatively unsophisticated

citizens. The role of "asset least likely to lose purchasing power" has

been played by various currencies at various times •       In   the l970s, marks
                                                                                          1

and Swiss francs, in addition to gold, were popular.            it in   the 1980s, the

U.S. dollar is the currency of choice, in large part due to the firm anti—

inflation policy of the Federal Reserve Board under chairman Paul Voleker.

In countries that are highly unstable monetarily, residents are willing to

give up interest earnings on securities to hold dollars in the form of

currency. Dollars are known to circulate freely in such countries as

Argentina and Israel. There are no data on foreign holdings of U.S.

currency, but Cooper (1986, p. 7) conjectures that over $20 billion of the

roughly $169 billion in dollar currency in circulation at the end of 1984

was held abroad.

      Because exchange rates have become more variable since 1973, and even

since 1980, the typical international investor should be more diversified

among currencies than in the past. Despite this, and despite the low level

of transactions costs and capital controls among major industrialized

countries, residents everywhere appear to hold far less foreign assets, and

 far more of their own   country's   assets, than would be present in a

 theoretically well—diversified portfolio. For example, Thble 8 suggests

 that most U.S. assets are still held by U.S. residents. Similarly, most

 Japanese assets are still held by Japanese residents, and so forth. &it

 investors everywhere are increasing their level of diversification, which

 explains why U.S. residents are increasing their gross claims on foreigners

 even at a time when capital is on net flowing out of Japan (Table 4) .            This

 process can be expected to continue for many years.

                      IV •   U.S.   (pital Inflows   in the 1980s


     The 1980s   have witnessed an historic swing in the U.S. capital

account. In 1980, U.s. residents were on net investing overseas, as they

had for many   decades,   at a rate estimated in the last line of Table 9 at
                                                                                 I
$10.4 billion a year. By 1982, U.s. residents appear to have been on net

borrowing from abroad, at a rate of $10.5 billion a year. The estimated

rate of net borrowing rose very rapidly, to $41.8 billionth 1983 and

$106.5 billion in 1984, until it reached an apparent plateau in 1985 of

$122.9 billion.28 During this same period, the dollar appreciated sharply.

     The balance of payments statistics in Table 9 give some        (limited)
insight   into the composition of the net capital inf low. The inflow has

primarily taken the form     of   foreigners increasing their holdings of U.S.

assets. U.S. residents have not noticeably cashed in their holdings of

foreign assets. In fact, U.S. residents have continued to increase their

investments abroad.


1. U.s. assets abroad

     Some have argued that the sharp fall in the recorded rate of U .S.

acquisition of foreign assets, from $110.2 billion in 1982 to $15.0 billion

in 1984 and $25.8 billion in 1985, means that actions by U.S. residents are

dominating the net capital inflow, not actions by foreign residents •29

there are several things to be said against this argument. In the first

place, the recorded stock of U.S. assets abroad continues to rise; it is

only the rate of change that has declined. In the second place, part of

the apparent fall in U.S. investment abroad is an apparent fall in foreign

direct investment between 1980 and 1982—84 (line 5 in Table 9; the recorded

figure for 1982 even shows a net decrease in the U.S. foreign direct

investment position) .   hit   this fall in recorded direct investment is in

part due to the problem of U.S. corporations obtaining funds via subsidi-

aries in the Netherlands Antilles. When these credit items are moved from

the direct investment numbers to foreign purchases of U.S. corporate

securities where they belong, foreign direct investment shows less of a

decline in the early 1980s 3O

     In the third place, and quantitatively much more importantly, the

reported slowdown in the period 1983—85 in U.S. banks' acquisition of

claims on foreigners (line 8 in Thble 9) relative to 1981—82 can be traced

to exaggeration of the 1981—82 figures by the establishment of IBFs

(International Banking Facil-ities) in the United States beginning in

December 1981. $44 billion of IBF     liabilities   to foreigners originated in

1981, and $72 billion in 1982. Since these increased liabilities were

matched by increased claims when the accounts were moved from overseas, the

acquisition of foreign assets reported by U.S. banks is estimated to have

been exaggerated by these amounts.31 Thus, the decline in acquisition of

foreign assets in the subsequent years is exaggerated similarly. More

generally in the case of bank—reported flows, the statistics need say

nothing about the residence of investors on whose behalf the banks are

reporting. In the case of interbank transactions, the distinction between

increases in liabilities and decreases in claims is particularly lacking in

economic significance.

2.   Foreign direct lnvestaent In the United States
     The side of the balance sheet covering foreign investments in the
United   States is perhaps the more interesting, as the country is becoming

increasingly dependent on the willingness of foreigners to continue to

increase their lending. From lines 11 to 16 in ible 9, foreign acqui-

sition of U.S. assets during 1983—85 consisted 18 percent of direct

Investment, 17 percent purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, 24 percent

purchases of Other securities, 1 percent other U.S. liabilities to

unaffiliated foreigners reported by U.S. nonbanking concerns, and 40

percent U.S. liabilities reported by U.S. banks not included elsewhere.

     Table 10 shows the foreign direct investment position in the United

States at the end of 1985. The investment is mostly in the hands of

Europeans: 66 percent. Nine percent is held by canada, 10 percent by

Japan, 9 percent by Latin America, and only 5 percent by the Middle East

and all others. The largest category is in manufacturing (33 percent),

followed by trade (18 percent), petroleum (15 percent), real estate (10

percent), banking (6 percent), insurance (6 percent), other finance (3

percent), and   other   industries (8 percent).

     A highly publicized component of foreign direct investment in the

United States is the purchase or construction of factories by foreign

manufacturers to avoid current or threatened U.S. restrictions against

investment in North America is in nonmanufacturing industries and only 29

percent in manufacturing industries (5 percent in transportation machinery

and 8 percent in electrical machinery) 32 This is in contrast to U.S.

direct invesment in other countries which as of end—l985 was 41 percent in

manufacturing, 25 percent in petroleum, and only 16 percent in banking,

finance and insurance. (U.S. direct investment in Japan is 51 percent in

manufacturing, 24 percent in petroleum, and only 8 percent in banking,

finance and insurance.)33 Japanese direct investment in manufacturing in

the United States may be important for redirecting trade flows, or for any

transfer of managerial practices that may be taking place; but it is not a

quantitatively substantial part of the capital inf low into the United

States


3.   Securities   sales   vs. banking flows

     In   the past, banking transactions have generally been the largest
component of the capital account. Bit in 1984 foreign purchases of     U.S.

securities passed bank—reported liabilities as the largest component of the
capital inflow, either on a gross or net basis.
     This trend, which accelerated in 1985, partly reflects the securiti—
zation of international capital markets: the rapidly growing role of
direct investor purchases of bonds and equities, at the expense of bank
intermediation. Some of the reasons that have been suggested for the
decline in banking's share are deregulation and innovation in securities
markets, concern over bank exposure to developing countries, the pressure
on banks to increase their capital/asset ratio, and concern over the
Continental Ulinois &nk crisis in 1984.35 A rapidly growing component of

NOTES TO TABLE 11, PAGES 4-5

  i-Starting with 1979, the SDR value of European currency units (ECU5)
issued against 1.1.5. dollars is added to the SDR value of U.s. dollars, but
the SDR value of ECUs issued against gold is excluded from the total
distributed here. For classification of countries in groups shown here, see

Appendix IX. Only selected countries that provide information about the
currency composition of their official holdings of foreign exchange are
included in this table.

  2The column is for comparison and indicates the currency composition of
reserves when holdings of ECus are treated as a separate reserve asset,
unlike the earlier columns starting with 1979 as is explained in the
preceding footnote. The share of ECUs in total foreign exchange holdings
was 10.9 percent for all countries and 20.2 percent for the industrial
countries in 1985.

  3This residual is equal to the difference between total identified
reserves and the sum of the reserves between the seven currencies listed in
the table.

  4The calculations here rely to a greater extent on Fund staff estimates
than do those provided for the group of industrial countries.

$50.9 billion in 1985, over nine times higher than the level of five years

earlier.

       Another   large chunk is increased purchases of U.S. Government bonds.

In 1984 the U.S. Treasury began a new effort to tap foreign savings and

help finance the enormous federal budget deficit by issuing "foreign—

targeted registered obligations" directly into the Eurobond market.

Foreign purchases of all Treasury securities reached $20.5 billion in 1985,

almost eight times higher than the level of five years earlier. A remark-

able 83 percent of the foreign purchases were by Japanese residents.37

This reflects the magnitude of the capital inflow from Japan, and the

relative preference of Japanese investors for U.S. bonds rather than

equities, though it has been argued that Japanese purchases of Eurodollar

bonds may exceed their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds.38


4•     Official reserve holdings of dollars
       Until 1973, the holdings of international        reserves by central banks

were   thought of as endogenous, as accommodating the decisions of private
residents regarding either investment or current account transactions.
With the end of the &etton Woods system, the obligation for the major

central banks to intervene in the foreign exchange market ended. Most

continued to intervene as it suited them, the Thsropean and Japanese central

banks much more so than the U.S •    authorities   •    For example, their purchases

of   dollars to try to dampen the dollar depreciation of 1977—78 was several
                                    —30—



times greater than the record U.S. current account deficits. One could

think of the major central banks during this period playing to an extent

the same role they did under the Bretton Woods system: financing U.S.

current account (and private capital account) imbalances.

     In the early l980s, as the dollar swung from a level perceived as too

low to a level perceived as too high, the European and Japanese central

banks reversed the direction of their intervention, now selling dollars to

dampen the depreciation of their own currencies. &xt even in 1985, when

the U.S. Treasury under Secretary James Baker abandoned its previous policy

of benign neglect and spearheaded a new cooperative effort to get the

dollar down, the quantity of intervention was relatively small. Reported

U.S. liabilities to official institutions in Western Furope fell by only

$7 .3 billion between the end of 1980 and the end of 1985 .   Dollar
holdings by most smaller central banks increased steadily over this period

(except in 1985); they either were unconcerned about the strength of the

dollar or viewed themselves as. too small to affect it, and were more inter-

ested in the high rates of return they could earn on dollar securities.

The result was the positive numbers in line 10 of Thble 9.

     The U.S. statistics probably underestimate the dollar holdings of

central banks, those in developing countries in particular, because they do

not count Eurodollar holdings. Statistics on reserve holdings reported by

the central banks themselves show greater increases in quantity terms in

1983_85,40 It is as if central banks in the aggregate acted like

"destabilizing speculators," rather than "leaning into the wind" to resist

swings in the dollar 41 The tendency for central banks to shift their

portfolios in the same direction that currency values are already moving is
                                        —31—



necessarily even stronger when reserves are reported in value terms. As

Table 11 shows, the share of official reserve portfolios allocated to

dollars declined rapidly from 1977 to 1980, and then rose from 1980 to the

end of 1984, like the value of the dollar itself.

     Despite the "Plaza Accord" of September 22, 1985, at which the five

largest central banks agreed to coordinated intervention in order to bring

down the dollar, such dollar sales were not very evident in the 1985

figures, and   there   is even less reason to think that they will dominate the

figures in 1986 or in the future. Perhaps central banks should be lumped

together with other foreign residents in their portfolio behavior ,42



                                V •   tes of turn
     What could cause swings in net capital flows of the magnitude seen in
the 1980s? From the      standpoint of macroeconomic policy, the most important

determinants   of capital flows between countries are expected rates of
return.    U.S. interest   rates increased sharply after 1980. Interest rates
in other   major industrialized countries also increased, but not as much.

The differential between the U.S. ten—year interest rate and a weighted

average of other countries' ten—year interest rates averaged zero in 1976—

80, but rose to about 2 percent by 1982, and rose further to about 3 per-

cent in 1984. This increase in the differential rate of return on U .S,

assets is widely considered the most important cause of the net capital

inflow that began in the early 1980s. hit measuring expected rates of

return is not as straightforward as might appear. For equities or direct

investment, the rate of return is uncertain, and     investors   treat such
                                       —32—



 assets as different from bonds so that one cannot use the bond interest

 rate to measure their expected rate of return. Even for deposits, loans,

 and bonds, where the nominal interest rate is known in terms of domestic

 currency, the dollar interest rate on U.S. bonds cannot be directly

 compared with the mark interest rate on German bonds because of the

 likelihood of future changes in the mark/dollar exchange rate.


 1.   Dollar bond   rates in the domestic and biro markets

      If we are interested in the investor's decision whether to invest in

bonds issued in the United States versus bonds issued in other political

jurisdictions per se, rather than necessarily dollar bonds versus other

currencies, then we can get around the problem of exchange rate uncertainty

by comparing U.S. interest rates to Eurodollar interest rates •   This is the
same thing we did in Table 7 for three—month deposit rates. Figure 2 shows

four series of long—term dollar interest rates, two on each side of the

Atlantic. The dominant impression is that the rates move together,

suggesting that capital controls or political risk are relatively unimpor-

tant and that arbitrage works relatively well. &t there is still some

variation in the differential.

      Figure 2a shows the domestic U.S. versus Eurodollar interest rate on

bonds issued by U.S. corporations. In the mid—l970s, the rates were

essentially the same. The domestic U.S. interest rates began to rise,

especially in 1980 and 1981, providing a strong incentive for capital to

flow from the Earomarket into the United States. The &irobond rate also

rose, but not by as much. The differential, represented by the solid line

in Figure 2c, reached 3.3 percent in July 1981.    Evidently, the capital

inflow was not large enough to arbitrage it away. It is not clear why U.S.

corporations did not elect to do even more of their borrowing in the

Euromarket      at the cheaper rate
        Figure 2b shows the U.S. and Eurodollar interest rates for government
bonds.     These Eurodollar bonds are issued by European governments, so the

fact that they offered a higher interest rate than the U.S. bonds in the

1970s was presumably compensation for somewhat greater risk of default.

bat when the U.S. rate rose in 1980—81, the Faromarket rate lagged behind,

just as with the corporate bonds; the differential turned positive and

reached 1.7 percent in September 1981. When the U.S. corporate and govern-

ment interest rates fell in mid—1982, the respective Eurobond rates again

lagged behind and the differentials returned to their earlier levels.

        The drop in the Euro—U.S. long—term differentials in mid—1982 is

consistent wl.th the idea that investors sought to shift their portfolios

into U.S. assets for "safe haven" reasons associated with the Latin

American debt crisis .''         bat the evidence is also consistent with the idea

that U.S. interest rates were merely leading the way and Eurodollar rates

following with a small lag.

       When comparing incentives to invest in U.S.   versus   foreign—currency

bonds, we must consider exchange rate expectations in addition to interest

rates •   This is difficult, because there are many different views as to how

exchange rates move, and no way to measure expectations directly. &t it

is possible to get a rough handle on the exchange rate expectations that

investors must have held during this period.

       There is an historical tendency, albeit very slow and erratic, for the

exchange rate eventually to return to a long—run equilibrium in real terms

(that is, adjusted for changes in the price level). The large appreciation

of the dollar from 1980 to 1984, 35 percent against a weighted average of

15 trading partners' currencies, was not much offset by higher inflation

abroad, and so constituted a similar appreciation in real terms, 32

percent      The result of this loss of competitiveness was the rapidly


growing trade deficit, which reached $113 billion in 1984 and $124 billion

(on a "balance of payments basis") in 1985. It was widely believed at this

time that the trade situation was unsustainable, that the dollar was over-

valued and would in the future have to depreciate back to levels at which

U.S.   producers   could compete on world markets. Such expectations of future

depreciation must have had an effect on investor thinking.

       There exist surveys of the forecasts made by participants in the

foreign exchange market, and they tend to confirm the idea that the large

appreciation of the dollar in the early l980s generated an anticipation of

a future depreciation back to equilibrium. One survey conducted by the

American Express nk Review shows that the forecasted depreciation of the

dollar one year ahead climbed from approximately zero in the late 1970s

(—0.20 on average in 1976—79) to a peak of 8.47 percent in the year 1984.
                                       —35—



Another survey conducted by the Economist Financial Report (beginning only

in 1981) shows the forecasted depreciation of the dollar rising to 10.02

per annum in 1984. A third survey, by Money Market Services, Inc.,

(beginning in 1983) shows three—month ahead forecasts of dollar depreci-

ations rising to 7 .26 percent (per annum) in 1984       It seems unlikely

that investors based their portfolio decisions on the full magnitude of the

expectation depreciation numbers reported in the surveys; since the expec-

ted depreciation numbers were considerably in excess of the interest

differential, there would not be much incentive for investors to hold

dollar assets •   It   is likely that investors at each point assigned a signi-

ficant probability to the possibility that the forecasted fall in the

dollar would not materialize in the coming year, as was reasonable given

that such forecasts had turned out wrong for four years. In that case the

rising interest differential could have been an adequate offset for expec-

ted depreciation, providing adequate incentive for investors to continue to

increase their holdings of dollar securities in the 1981—84 period.

     Given our argument that investors expect deviations from long—run

equilibrium such as the 1984 overvaluation of the dollar to be corrected,

investors' expectations of future depreciation should have diminished after

March 1985 when the dollar depreciation finally took place. In other

words, if one thinks, as of the end of 1986, that much of the return to

 equilibrium has already taken place, then one should think that less

 depreciation remains to be accomplished in the future. The survey data

 conf inn this, as can be seen by the dashed line in figure 3c. For example,

 the Economist survey showed an expected one—year depreciation of the dollar

 against the mark of only 4.9 percent as of October 30. 1986, as compared to
                                         —36—



9.3 percent on September 5, 1985, just before the Plaza Accord (or 10.7

percent on average between June 1981 and December 1985) .      The 1985—86

decline in the expected rate of future depreciation explains how foreign

residents would have wished to continue increasing their holdings of dollar

assets despite the decline in the nominal interest differential shown in

Figure 4a.

      A useful alternative way to measure the expected rates of return on

different countries assets is to look at the differential in real interest

rates, that is, nominal interest rates adjusted for expected inflation.48

There is no unique way of measuring expected inflation, but the problem is

not as difficult as measuring expected exchange rate changes. Alternative

possible measures of expected inflation tend to give similar answers.

      During the late 1970s, and through 1980, the U.S. real interest rate

by the available measures was usually below foreign real interest rates.

As Figure 3a shows, the real interest differential increased in the early

1980s even more steadily than did the nominal interest differential, and

peaked in June 1984. Depending on whether expected inflation is measured

by a three—year distributed lag on actual inflation, the three—year fore-

cast of Data Resources, Inc., or the two—year forecast of the OECD Economic

Outlook, the average long—term real interest differential rose between

1979—80 and 1983—84 by 4.79 percentage points, 3.88 percentage points, or

3 .54 percentage points         This increase in return differentials was a

significant inducement to demand for U.S. assets.


3 •   U.S.   vs.   foreign returns on equity
      lb   compare countries' rates of return on real capital we can look at

the earnings—to—price ratio or dividend—to—price ratio on equity. These
                                   —37—



numbers are already expressed as real rates of return and need not be

corrected for inflation. They are reported for stock markets in hirope,

the Far East and Australia, in addition to the United States, by Capital

International Perspective of Geneva.51

     The difference in the rate of return on equity between the United

States and abroad is shown in Figure 5. Like the real interest differ-

entials, the measures of return on equity show a substantial increase from

1980 to 1984, with a dip in between at 1983. The difference in dividend

yields rose from 1.1 in 198052 to 2.3 at the first peak in mid—1982, and

2.1 at the second peak in early 1984. The difference in earnings/price

ratios followed a similar pattern, but with larger swings, rising from 1 .6

on average in 1980 to 5.6 at the first peak in early 1982, and 3.9 in mid—

1984. Both the dividend yield and the earnings/price ratio show the dif-

ferential between the United States and foreign equity markets declining in

1985 and 1986. As of 1987, the rate of return on U.S. equities was still

perceived as high, particularly relative to Japanese equities, attracting

new foreign money into the U.S. stock market. The same could have been

said for U.S. real estate.

     To summarize the results on various assets, they generally show that

the low or negative differentials in the rates of return between the United

States and other countries in the late 1970s, turned to substantial posi-

tive differentials in the early 1980s. Since the dollar was weak in the

late 1970s and strong in the early 1980s, the evidence supports the argu-

ment that the change in return differentials induced a shift in investor

preferences, away from foreign assets and toward U.S. assets. One dent in

the simplicity of this story is the dip in return differentials from mid—

1982 to 1983, while the   dollar   was still appreciating. Some argue that

this may have been due to safe—haven effects associated with the debt

crisis. The other problem of timing is that the second peak in return

differentials occurred nine months before the dollar peaked in March

1985. It is possible that a "speculative bubble" was driving the dollar

during that short period, with investors increasing their demand for

dollars due to short—term expectations of continued appreciation formed by

extrapolating past trends.53 &st the subsequent 1985—1986 decline in the

value of the dollar, simultaneous with continued declines in all of the

measures of return differentials, supports the causal relationship between

the two.



           VI. Saving, Investment, and U .S • Macroeconomic iblicies


     If rates of return have been the driving force behind international

capital flows and the exchange rate, what is the driving force behind rates

of return?

     Interest rates and securities prices are determined by many factors.

Particularly on a daily or monthly basis, corresponding fluctuations in the

market—clearing price will result from whatever unpredictable fluctuations

in demand for an asset occur. Interest rate volatility has been even higher

in the l9BOs than previously. This is partly the result of deregulation

and innovation in world financial markets. However, the dominant source of

the longer—term swings in the real rates of return discussed in the pre-

ceding section appears to be domestic: U.S. macroeconomic policies. So

far in the 1980s, international capital markets have worked to dampen
                                      —39—



 swings in u.s. rates of return, rather than working as a source of dis-

 turbances. Thit in the future, U.S. interest rates will increasingly be

 determined at the mercy of foreign investors.


 I. Itnetary policy
      In the latter half of the 1970s, expansionary monetary policy on the

part of the Federal Reserve Board drove down U.S. real interest rates.

 That is, even though nominal interest rates were at high levels by his-

torical standards, the expected inflation rate was also very high, so that

the difference of the two was low, even negative. lbward the end of the

decade public concern shifted toward the inflation problem, and away from

employment and growth which had turned out to be surprisingly steady. The

Fed tried to brake the rapid rate of money growth, particularly after

Paul Volcker was appointed thairman, but with no success at first. Hone—

tarist economists charged that the problem was the Fed's use of the nominal

interest rate as an intermediate target, as opposed to the supply of bank

reserves or the monetary base, which was argued to be evidence of a lack of

true commitment to the yearly announced target for growth in the aggregate

money supply (Ml) .   By October 1979 Volcker had decided that interest rates

would have to be allowed to rise much more sharply if money growth and the

inflation rate were to be reduced. } went along with the monetarists to

the extent of announcing that the Fed would no longer target the interest

rate on federal funds, even on a short—ten basis, but would instead target

reserves. This was a convenient way of tightening monetary policy without

taking the political heat for higher interest rates. Interest rates have

been significantly more volatile ever since (though the various measures of

the money supply have also been more variable than before)
                                   —40—



    With a small lag, the new policy produced the anticipated reductionn

in demand for goods when interest rates shot up, particularly after credit

controls were imposed in March 1980. After the brief 1980 recession had

passed, monetary policy was tightened anew, and interest rates climbed

further. The period of dollar appreciation dates from this time. The

second, more serious, recession began in mid—1981. A major consequence of

the higher degree of international capital mobility in the 1980s compared

to earlier decades is that changes in monetary policy operate strongly

through the exchange rate and foreign demand for U.S. products, rather than

solely through the interest rate and domestic demand.

     Although nominal interest tates had reached a plateau, and even

dropped discretely in August 1982 when the Federal Reserve responded to the

Mexican debt crisis and general macroeconomic conditions by increasing

money growth, inflation was coming down. Thus, long—term real interest

rates continued their general upward trend through mid—1984, with the

further consequences for the behavior of international investors and the

appreciation of the dollar that we have seen.

     Money growth by the conventional measures has been relatively rapid

ever since the recession; Ml grew 10 3 percent per year from 1982 It to

 1986 u.54 For the first four years after the acceleration began, the

monetarists warned that inflation would resurge with the customary 6 to 18

month lag. Voicker publicly justified exceeding the yearly money targets

by pointing to exogenous shifts in velocity (defined as the relationship

between the money supply and dollar GNP). The exogenous shifts were at

 first identified as the special factors of maturing "All—Savers'

 certificates" and the nationwide legalizing of interest on checking
                                          —41—



accounts, then more generally as the environment of deregulation and

innovation in the banking industry. An equally important reason for

allowing faster growth in the money numbers was the endogenous shift in

velocity that occurs when people wish to hold more money because expected

inflation and nominal interest rates have fallen.

        In the event, Volcker was right and the monetarists were wrong.

Inflation did not reignite during this period. Even with the recovery of

real economic activity that began in 1983 I, which proceeded rapidly until

mid—1984 and then continued at a considerably slower pace through 1986,

nominal GNP grew more slowly than the money supply: 8.0 percent per year

from 1982 II to 1986             Thus velocity grew at 2.3 (= 10.3 —      8.0)
percent per year, in contrast to its past historical pattern of declining

roughly 3 percent per year. If the Federal Reserve had followed the

explicit monetarist prescription of rigidly precotmuitting to a money growth

rate lower than that of the preceding period, say 3 percent, and velocity

had followed the same path, then nominal CNP would have risen at only 0.7

per year. This is an upper bound, because with even lower inflation than

occurred, velocity would almost certainly have fallen even more than it

did. The implication seems clear that the 1981—82 recession would have

lasted another four years.


2.      (brporate tax   policy and investment

        If   the velocity—adjusted growth rate of money was not unreasonably
high after 1982, neither was      it   low. How   do   we explain the fact that the
long—term     real interest rate in mid—1984 was as high as or higher than it
was in mid—1982? Or that even in late 1986 it was still higher than in

1980?
                                          —42—



        Think   of the   real interest rate being determined so that the funds

needed for investment do not exceed the funds available from saving, the

investment rate depending negatively on the real interest rate, and the

national saving rate also depending (presumably positively) on the real

interest rate.56 (Investment is defined as additions to business plant and

equipment, the residential housing stock, and inventories. National saving

is defined as private saving plus public saving.) Then the increase in

real interest rates could be due either to an upward shift in investment, a

downward shift in national saving, or some combination of the two.57 We

consider first investment.

        The productivity slowdown of the 1970s convinced many that enhanced

incentives to capital formation were called for, and Ronald Reagan was

elected in 1980 in part on that platform.58 The 1981 tax bill granted

liberalized depreciation allowances (ACRS: the accelerated cost recovery

system) and a liberalized investment tax credit. When investment grew

rapidly in 1983—84, some claimed that the tax incentives, together with the

more general      pro—business climate (a "golden age of capitalism"), was
responsible,      and that the demand for funds to finance the investment boom
in turn explained the increase in real interest rates and the net capital

inflow. The argument seemed to fit in well with the safe—haven explanation

for the strength of the dollar. The main problem with it is that the

investment rate always rises in expansions, and the increase in the 1983—84

recovery was no greater than the decrease in the 1981—82 recession.59 By

 1985   the investment rate had     merely reattained the approximate level of the

 1970s, as Thble 12 shows.6° A second argument is that calculations        of the
benefits    of the tax incentives suggest that (1) they were smaller than the

increase in real interest rates, so that the after—tax real cost of capital

to firms was not reduced, and that (2) the investment boom was concentrated

in sectors like office computers, where the tax incentives were not very

relevant and a technological explanation seems to fit instead.6'

     Ironically, the Treasury tax reform plan of December 1984, and the

revised tax reform plan actually passed by thngress and signed by the

President in 1986, sharply raised corporate taxes. The logic was that

raising corporate tax revenue was the only way to change personal income

tax brackets and deductions in such a way as to leave a majority of

taxpayers feeling that they were better off, and simultaneously maintain

overall "revenue—neutrality ."   Bat the effect was to undo the incentives to

investment enacted in 1981.


3.   hdget deficit

     Having found that there has been no increase in the investment rate,

relative to the l970s, to explain by itself the high level of real interest

rates and the high capital inf low in the mid—1980s, we now turn to national

saving. We begin with the "dissaving" of the government, that is, the

budget deficit.

     The federal budget has not been in surplus since 1969. In the 1975

recession the budget deficit reached the then all—time record high of $69

billion. Steady growth in national income over the next four years raised

tax revenues, and reduced the deficit to $16 billion by 1979. However,

this was still considered too high.

     The improbable "Laffer O.xrve Theory," which held that a reduction in

personal income tax rates would stimulate production and income so much as
                                     —44—



 to raise total tax revenues rather than lower them, helped to convince

 politicians to enact large tax cuts in 1981, to be installed over three

 years. At the same time, some categories of domestic spending were cut

 sharply, but they were a relatively small part of the total. Given the

 enormous buildup in military expenditure, the exemption of social security

benefits from cuts, the runaway increases in some other categories like

 farm support, and the exogenous fact of enormous interest payments on the

national debt, it was inevitable that the federal budget deficit would soar

to unprecedented levels. Initially it was possible to blame the increased

budget deficit on the reduced tax revenues from the 1981—82 recession, It

was claimed that rapid growth in income and therefore in tax revenues would

return the budget to balance in a few years •   bit   the tax rate cuts and

spending increases were phased in as quickly as income grew. The deficit

reached $208 billion in l983—more than three times the "intolerably high"

levels of the late 1970s—and remained in the vicinity of $200 billion for

the following four years. The increase in the federal deficit relative to

the 1970s was 3 .0 percent of CM', as Table 12 shows.

     State and local governments in the aggregate improved their surplus by

about $30 billion between 1980 and 1985,62 or by 0.5 percent of CM'

relative to the 1970s, as ble 12 shows. Thus the decline in the general

government budget balance was not quite as bad as the decline in the

federal budget balance.

Gross saving is the sum of national disposable income and consumption of fixed

is the surplus available     from    current transactions to finance gross capital   formation and capital transactions with the rest of the world.   It is the

figure for the United States in 1984 was 17.0 percent, and the average for

the others was 23.1 percent. Even aside from public dissaving in the form

of government budget deficits, there are disparities in private saving

between the United States and other countries. The U.S. household saving

rate, at Sd percent of disposable income in 1985, is extremely low by

international standards. The United Kingdom's is 11.9, West Germany's

13.0, and Japan's 22.5.63 Japan's especially high rate of household saving

has been attributed to, among other things, a pro—saving tax and financial

system, a shortage of housing, leisure, and consumption goods on which to

spend income, and a demographic bulge in the generation of Japanese who

will be retiring over the next 20 years.

       According to some theories, an increase in the U.S. budget deficit

such as has occurred in the 1980s should produce an increase in private

saving to offset it. The theoretical argument is that households will

think ahead to the day when the government has to raise taxes to pay off

the debt, and that they will increase their saving today so that they or

their children will have the resources to pay those taxes. The original

supply—siders in the Administration relied less on that theoretical argu-

ment than on the argument that households would respond to a higher after—

tax rate of return by saving more. In any case, the predicted increase in

the   personal saving rate did not materialize. The personal saving rate, as
a   percentage of disposable personal income, fell from 7.1 percent in 1980

to 5.1 percent in 1985. Corporate saving rose, on the other hand, by 1

percent of GNP in 1985 relative to the 1970s. When personal and corporate

saving are added together, total private saving as a share of GNP in 1985

was approximatelythe same as it was on average in the 1970s.

        Thus, there was no upsurge in private saving to offset the increase in

the budget deficit. This means that there was less national saving left

over to finance investment.


5   •   The   relationship between   national saving and investwent

        In a closed economy, that is, one cut off from the rest of the world,

the fall in national saving would have driven up the cost of capital how-

ever much necessary to reduce the level of investment to the level of do-

mestic funds available to finance it.64 As it was, the cost of capital did

rise in the 1980s, whether measured as the real interest rate or the return

on equity, as we saw in the previous section. bit because the increase in

interest rates attracted a large capital inflow ("net foreign investment,"

In 1ble 9), investment in plant and equipment was not crowded out as much

as it otherwise would have been. The net capital inflow is precisely the

current account deficit, which has generated so much concern, viewed from

its more flattering profile. That a decline in national saving must either

be offset by a net capital inflow or else reflected as a decline in

investment, is a very general proposition; the natural mechanism is the

increase in real interest rates, but the proposition must hold, no matter

what happens to financial market prices.

        An interesting question is how changes in national savings have been

divided between changes in capital flow and changes in investment in prior

historical episodes. Figure 5 shows U.S. national saving, investment and

the current account surplus (capital. outflow) over the last three decades,

less. That is, before the l980s, foreign capital usually played a small

role in financing U.S. investment.

     ftit it would be wrong to conclude from this correlation alone that a

change in national saving resulting from an exogenous change in fiscal

policy is necessarily reflected in investment rather than in the current

account. The close correlation between saving and investment rates in

Figure 5 could result from the effect of a third factor on both, rather

than a causal relationship between the two. The business cycle is the most

obvious third factor; saving rates and investment rates are both known to

rise in booms and fall in recessions.

     There are several ways of attempting to address this problem. One

would be to adjust saving and investment cyclically, or to use more sophis-

ticated econometric techniques. A second is to look at saving and invest-

ment rates across countries rather than over time. Table 14 gives the

investment rates for 24 countries to match the national saving rates in

Table 13. It is clear that a country like the United States—or Belgium,

Denmark and Sweden——that has a low rate of national saving, also tends to

have a low rate of investment; the countries like Japan——or Finland, Norway

and Switzerland—that have high saving rates tend to have high investment

rates.

     A third way to get around the problem of cyclical variation in saving

and investment   is to average yearly observations over somewhat longer time
intervals to take out some of the cyclical effect. Figure 6 shows decade
averages   of saving, investment and the current account from the 1870s to

the 1970s. The saving and investment rates are still highly correlated.

The only time when the two diverged as widely as they have in the mid—1980s
                                          —48—



was the 1910s •     United   States investment had fallen slightly below national

saving, that is, the country had begun to run current account surpluses, in

the 1890s. Sit this capital outflow reached its highest during World

War I , as the United States was lending to finance dissaving in Ehrope.

Subsequent divergences between saving and investment were much smaller.

     The experience of the 1980s stands out among industrialized countries,

even if we look only at the absolute magnitude of the net capital flow (as

opposed to the direction) .       The United States and other economies, which

erected barriers to trade and capital flows in the 1930s and 1940s, have

become more integrated since. The increasing degree of integration of

financial markets in the 1970s and 1980s allows countries to have different

saving rates without the differences in investment rates having to be as

large; international capital flows make up the difference.


6. The United      States as   a net debtor

     The   U.S.   current account at present stands out, even more than by

virtue of its absolute magnitude, because a wealthy country is running

persistent deficits. Through most of the 20th century the United States

has run current account surpluses, as we have seen. Even in the 1970s,

when the two oil shocks raised import spending, the current account was on

average equal to zero.

     As the direct implication of the current account surpluses from the

1980s to the 1960s, the United States was accumulating net claims on

foreigners. During World War I the country passed from being a net debtor

vis—a—vis the rest of the world, to being a net creditor, by 1981 the

United States had attained a recorded net investment position of $140.7
                                    —49—



billion (with 37 percent of the private assets consisting of direct

investment and 47 percent consisting of bank—reported claims) •65

     Net interest and other income on this investment position earned $34.1

billion in 1981, more than enough to pay for the deficit in merchandise

trade and leave a surplus in goods and services or in the overall current

account. hit the current account went into deficit in 1982, as we have

seen, as a result of the pattern of high U.S. real interest rates, capital

inflow from abroad, strong dollar, and U.S. trade deficit. The situation

deteriorated rapidly. ' 1985 the current account deficit reached $117.7

billion. (Despite the depreciation of the dollar that began in March 1985,

the current account deficit in 1986 was in the neighborhood of $135

billion.) It took only three years of current account deficit to undo a

century of accumulation of foreign assets. Sometime in early 198566 the

country on the books returned to net—debtor from net—creditor status, as

Table 15 shows. ' the end of 1986 the U.S. recorded position was

approximately —$225 billion, a debt far higher than the creditor position

was at its peak. Even if the depreciated dollar leads to an improved trade

balance in 1987, as it is expected to in line with the customary lags, the

United States will probably continue to run substantial trade deficits for

quite a few years, and the net debt will continue to mount rapidly.

     Even if the 1985—86 depreciation of the dollar soon reduces the trade

deficit to a plateau of $100 billion, the net debt position would reach the

vicinity of $600 billion by the end of 1989. Simply multiplying by an

interest rate would suggest that the annual cost of interest and dividends

to investors in other countries would then run on the order of $40 to $50

billion. In other words, to eliminate the overall current account deficit

in the 19905 would then require not just an elimination of the remaining

$100 billion trade deficit, but a reversal to a trade surplus of $40 to $50

billion in order to earn the money to service the debt that has been

incurred in the meantime.

     Calculation of the interest and dividend payments is more complicated

than this, however, because different assets pay different rates of return

and the composition of U.S. overseas assets is different from the compo-

sition of U.S. liabilities. Foreign investments in the United States are

somewhat more concentrated in easury and other bonds (19.3 percent of

privately—held assets) as opposed to direct investment (21 .3 percent) and

bank—reported liabilities (41.3 percent). (brporate stocks are 14.7 per-

cent, and other U.S. liabilities are 3.4 percent.) This is as compared to

U.S. investments abroad which are relatively less concentrated in bonds

(8.9 percent of private assets) and relatively more in direct investment

(28.3 percent) and bank—reported assets (54.4 percent). (rporate stocks

are 5.0 percent, and other U.S. assets are 3.4 percent.) Earnings on

direct investment and bank loans tend to be greater than interest earned on

bonds; as a result, recorded earnings on U.S. assets abroad still exceed

recorded payments on foreign investments in the United States, even a year

after its return to net debtor status. In 1986 (first three quarters), the

recorded return on all U.S. investments abroad ran at an average 9.7 per-

cent, the payment rate on U.S. liabilities at only 6.5 percent. If this

differential holds up. the recorded balance on overseas investment income

will decline more slowly than one would otherwise think. bit an unprece-

dented decline will nevertheless take place. Estimates by the Institute of

 the range of —$15 to —$25 billion (Islam, 1987)

      If the funds borrowed from abroad in the 1980s were being used to

finance productive investment in plant and equipment, then the additional

output would be available in future decades to service the debt. Unf or—

tunately, as we have seen, the funds have been going to finance the federal

budget deficit (or, equivalently, to offset crowding out of private invest-

ment) .   As many less developed debtor countries have discovered over the

last five years, military arias or consumer goods don't generate the foreign

exchange earnings needed to service the debt incurred when they were

purchased.

     It must be noted that all of the above figures on the U.S. net indebt-

edness position are subject to more than the usual amount of measurement

error. The two major sources of error go in opposite directions. On the

one hand, if most of the statistical discrepancy in the balance of pay-

ments, which has run at roughly $25 billion a year from 1979 to 1986, is

unreported capital inflows, then the true net indebtedness is worse by some

$200 billion.67 On the other hand, some of the foreign assets acquired in

the past, particularly direct investment, have undergone increases in value

that are not reflected in the figures, suggesting that the true position

may be better than recorded. It seems likely that the first effect is at

least as important as the second. The Federal Reserve B3ard estimates that

the country may have become a net debtor in 1983 rather than 1985, with net

indebtedness reaching $235 billion in 1985.68 In any case, the sheer inag—

nitude of the current account deficits guarantees that the net indebtedness

position is deteriorating very rapidly.

6 •   Ornclusion
      Massive U.S. borrowing from the rest of the world in the 1980s is the

result of massive borrowing by the U.S. government. By 1980, the U.S.

government had accumulated a debt of $914 billion over two centuries. This

debt precisely doubled by 1985, and is estimated to have reached $2,130

billion by the end of 1986.69 The role of foreigners in financing the U.S.

budget deficit is dramatized by the fact that foreign owership of Treasury

securities is rising rapidly; recorded private holdings stood at $84

billion as of the end of 1985, and official holdings at $136 billion, kit

from an economic viewpoint, it is immaterial whether foreign residents buy

U.S. government debt directly or whether they lend the money to private
                                                                     -


U.S. residents who use it to buy government debt.

      The big increase in government borrowing after 1980 was not on the

whole accommodated by monetary policy. While the total federal debt

doubled, the debt held by the Federal Reserve went up by somewhat less and

consequently the debt held by the public went up somewhat more. The

borrowing drove up real interest rates in the United States, attracting

capital inflows from all parts of the world and in all forms. This capital

inflow has been made easier by reduced taxes and controls on international

capital movements and a general trend of liberalization and innovation.

The favorable aspect of the inflow is that by helping to finance the

federal deficit it has kept U.S. real interest rates lower than they would

otherwise be. The unfavorable aspect is that the counterpart to the record

capital account surpluses are the record trade and current account

deficits .o
                                      —53—



     The widespread feeling is that these imbalances are unsustainable.

The U.S. trade deficit may be politically unsustainable, in the sense that

Ongressmen will be pushed, by those of their constituents that suffer from

the international competition, into enacting protectionist barriers. This

would be very costly both for the country as a whole and for the world

trading system as a whole.

     It is also possible that the borrowing from abroad is unsustainable in

the sense that at some point foreigners will tire of accepting ever—larger

quantities of U.S. assets into their portfolios. The consequence then

could be a sharp fall in the value of the dollar combined with a sharp

increase in U.S. interest rates. For the dollar by itself to accomplish

enough trade improvement to return the country to current account equi-

librium, the depreciation would have to be considerably larger than what we

have already seen in 1985 and 1986.

     The unpleasant alternative is that the same improvement in the trade

balance would at some point instead be accomplished by a recession,

reducing imports. The large stock of debt that is already outstanding

means that U.S. policy—making will from now on find itself much more

restricted in its ability to respond to adverse developments. cause the

federal deficit is already large despite four years of economic expansion,

the government will not be able to respond to any future recession by

reducing taxes or raising expenditure. Still less will the Federal Reserve

be able to respond to a recession by lowering interest rates, if the source

of the recession is a reduction in the willingness of foreign investors to

keep supplying the United States with capital. Indeed, the outstanding

debt to foreigners means that a likely scenario is the one in which
                                       —54—



investors' fears that the U.S. will have difficulty maintaining the futnre

value of those assets win cause the depreciation of the dollar to

accelerate and interest rates to rise. In such a scenario the Federal

Reserve would be reluctant to expand monetary policy because that might

further enhance fears of inflation and dollar depreciation. At that potts

there might be no alternative to a combination of sharply higher interest

rates and recession in order to reduce imports and restore the confidenra

of financial markets. This position, a familiar one to many debtors, wnu]Ld

be a new one for Americans.

     As of the beginning of 1987, the financial markets are still absorbuii*g

the imbalances with little difficulty. The decline of the dollar has been

a "soft landing" rather than a "hard landing" in the sense that interest

rates have come down since 1984 rather than gone up. This is probably

because the dollar depreciation has been the result of a combination of

(1) easier monetary policy, (2) perceptions of reduced future budget

deficits under the Gramm—Rudman legislation and (3) a confidence—inspiring

process of consultation and coordination between U.S. and other authori-

ties, most dramatically represented by the September 1985 Plaza Accord.

The federal budget deficit and trade deficit will each probably decline lint

a minor way in 1987 •   bit   the policies now in place imply continued massive

federal deficits, and as a result continued capital inflows and trade

deficits, into the indefinite future.

 1. In Table 1, the private capital outflow is measured as increases in U.S.

     "private   assets abroad" (which appear with negative signs because they

     are accounting debits) less increases in other foreign assets in the U.S

     (which appear with positive signs because they are accounting credits)

 2. Under the floating exchange rate system, when investors increase their

     demand for dollar assets, this can take the form of an increase in the

     exchange value of the dollar and does not need to show up as an actual

     inflow of capital.

 3. This figure is arrived at by assuming that the statistical discrepancy

     represents primarily unreported capital flows.

 4. If the statistical discrepancy is interpreted as unrecorded private

     capital inflows, then the true private capital account was approximately

    in balance in 1979—80 (a surplus in 1979 for the first time in decades,

    and a deficit in 1980) .   The recorded private capital account continued

    to show a deficit in 1979 and for several years thereafter.

21 •   When there is a large and variable differential (even with the offshore

       interest rate measured in domestic currency) it means that barriers must
                                        —57—



     exist, in the form of either capital controls or the sort of political

     risk discussed below. Although there is no sure—fire way of telling

    which sort of barrier is operating just by looking at the interest rates,

     there is a useful rule—of—thumb. When a country is seen to experience an

     increase in perceived riskiness, due to high budget or balance—of—

    payments deficits or political instability, if the offshore rate rises

     relative to the onshore rate it signifies that controls are preventing

     the free outflow of capital; if the onshore rate rises relative to the

    offshore rate, it signifies that political risk is scaring off investors

    and so a higher return is needed to clear the market.

22. U.s. corporations issue bearer bonds in the Euromarket. In October 1984,

    the U .5. government began to do the same, in the form of "specially

    targeted treasury notes .'     The premium that investors were willing to pay

    to hold these securities, relative to regular registered Theasury notes,

    fluctuated from around 40 basis points to zero, apparently as foreign

    perceptions fluctuated as to how onerous was a requirement that bond—

    dealers certify that the beneficial owners are not U.S. citizens or

    residents. (Merrill Lynch, 1985, p. 14).

24. One   (intended)   result of the abolition of the U.S. withholding tax was

    the demise of large—scale Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations through

    subsidiaries in the Netherlands Antilles to avoid the tax. This

    corporate borrowing, which previously showed up in the balance of

    pyaments accounts as reductions in U.S. direct investment claims on

    foreigners, now takes its true form, foreign purchases of U.S.

    securities.

25. The source is Folkerts—Landau (1985), or Edwards (1986).

26. Interestingly, U.S. Theasury securities issued in the Euromarket often

      must pay a higher yield than Eurobonds issued by top—rated U.S.

      corporations, suggesting some perceived default risk. (Gonzales (1985,

      Table 14)).

27. Golub (1986, 8a) estimates that net borrowing in dollars by 18 OEW

      governments alone rose from $2.619 billion in 1972 to a peak of $25.852

      billion in 1982. Dollar borrowing by developing countries was much
                                                            -

      greater, at least until recent years.

28.   The recorded capital inflow (change in foreign assets in the United

      States less U.S. assets abroad, not counting official reserve assets) did

      not turn positive until 1983, and climbed to $99 .852 billion in 1985.

      Most of the statistical discrepancy is thought to be unrecorded capital

      inflows; hence, the higher capital inflow numbers in the text. bit some

      fraction of the discrepancy is probably unreported service exports,

      particularly interest earnings, so that the capital inflow numbers in the

      text may   be   a little overstated.

29. The subsequent discussion draws on Isard and Stekler (1985)

30. The borrowing via Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries was reversed,

      following the abolition in 1984 of the U.S.withholding tax; in 1985,

      U.S. corporations began retiring the past debt issued through the

      subsidiaries.

     until 1985. However this rise in dollar holdings can be completely

     accounted for by interest earnings.

41. Central banks make the decision to trade their own currencies for foreign

     reserve currencies on the basis of macroeconomic considerations, hit the

     decision how to allocate a given portfolio of foreign currency reserves

     is influenced by expected returns on the various currencies.   Admittedly
     the distinction can be blurred because some countries, habitually do their

     foreign exchange intervention in dollars, perhaps for the sake of

     convenience. The argument that central bank portfolio behavior is

    destabilizing is due to Bergsten and Williamson (2001)

42. The argument that official reserve transactions should be classified

    together with the private capital account, validates the decision made by

    the Department of cbmmerce ten years ago to cease reporting the "official
                                       —60—



    settlements balance" in the balance of payments statistics, to force

    readers to look at the trade or current account balances in its place.

    See Stern (1977) .   table   9 here compromises, by reporting some net

    balances within the capital account, both private and official.

43. Kidwell, Marr and Thimble (1986) document this differential in more

    detail. B.st it is possible that the apparent differential is simply due

    to different composition of the corporations issuing the bonds in the two

    markets. Maharajan and Fraser (1986) test the widespread perception that

    U.S. corporations can borrow more cheaply in the Euromarket than at home,

    by examining 92 pairs of bond offerings that are closely matched with

    respect to corporate parent, rating, maturity and other characteristics

    between 1975 and 1983. They find, to the contrary, no differential.

44. For the periods 1980—81 and 1983—84, increases in the interest

    differentials do not support the safe—haven explanation of the dollar

    appreciation. Similarly, the period when the differentials resumed their

    decline, 1985—86, is the period when the dollar was finally depreciating,

    not continuing to appreciate as one would expect under the safe—haven

    hypothesis. Even in 1982, the one year in which movement in the long—

     ten interest differential supports the hypothesis, the evidence from

     short—term differentials goes the other way, as we saw in Section In.

45. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. The

     interest rates are yields on government bonds, in their own currencies,

    with maturities ranging from 10 years or more for Japan and Canada to 20

    years for the United States and Canada. The weights are moving averages

    of GNP shares. The source is the International Monetary Fund.

46. Morgan Guaranty's index. The weights are based on 1980 U.S. bilateral

       trade in manufactures and the price levels are wholesale prices of non—

       food manufactures.

47 •   The three statistics are simple averages of dollar depreciation against

       other currencies: the mark, yen, pound, French franc, and Swiss franc in

       the case of the American Fcpress and Economist surveys, and the first

       four currencies in the case of the Honey Market Services survey. For

       further description and analysis of the survey data, see Frankel and

       Froot (1986)

48. If arbitrage equates the nominal interest differential to investors'

       expected nominal depreciation, then the real interest differential will

       equal expected real depreciation.

49. The peak real interest differential by this measure was 4.2 percent. The

       expected inflation rates in the figure are calculated by the

       International Monetary Fund from distributed lags on actual inflation

       rates.

50. The interest rates are on 10—year bonds from Morgan Guaranty. The

       trading partners are the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan,

       weighted by GNP shares. Following the logic of the footnote—before—last,

       one might infer from a 1984 10—year real interest differential of 3

       percent that investors must have expected the dollar to depreciate in

       real terms over the next ten years at an average rate of 3 percent a

       year, or approximately 30 percentcumulatively. If 10 years is thought

       to be a long enough time to guarantee a return to long—run equilibrium,

       this rough calculation suggests that in 1984 the market considered the

       dollar to be about 30 percent above its equilibrium. (Note that investors
                                      —62—



    do not respond directly to real interest differentials, but rather to

    nominal interest differentials and expected exchange rate changes;

56. The identity is that investment is equal to national saving plus the net

    capital inflow from abroad.

57. In this framework, how would we interpret an increase in real interest

    rates caused by a monetary contraction as in 1980—82? One could think of

    it as a fall in the private saving rate associated with the recession.

58. Reductions in personal income taxes were more important to the suply—

    siders in the Reagan camp than the corporate investment tax incentives.

59. Investment net of depreciation shows more of a   decline   after 1980 than

    gross investment because the capital consumption allowance is higher in

    the l980s than in the 1970s.

60. Dnworth (1985) .   Feldstein   (1986) finds no evidence of an effect of

    changes in corporate tax rates and investment incentives on interest

    rates. He estimates that the increase in projected budget deficits was
                                    —63—



    responsible for about two—thirds of the rise in interest rates between

    1977—78 and 1983—84.

61. It should be noted that an upward shift in firms' desire to invest could

    lead to an increase in real interest rates, without an increase in the

    quantity of investment actually undertaken, if the sources of saving

    available to finance investment were competely unresponsive to interest

    rates. hit even if domestic U.S. saving, both private and public, is

    indeed unresponsive to interest rates, the available supply of foreign

     saving is to the contrary highly responsive to the U.S. interest rate.

     Thus the failure of the observed investment rate to rise in the l980s is

    valid evidence against the claim that enhanced investment incentives can

    alone explain the increase in the U.S. interest rate and the capital

    inflow.

    income, when the economy is operating at less than full employment. lb

    focus on the relationship among saving, investment, and overseas bor-

    rowing as percentages of aggregate income, it helps to think of monetary

    policy in the background holding income constant. It is, in fact, not

    unrealistic to think of the Federal Reserve as having targeted nominal

    GNP in recent years.

66. The 1982—84 figures were revised in 1985 to incorporate the results of a

    1982 benchmark survey of U.S. direct investment abroad. On the revised

    figures, the United States passed into net debtor status in January 1985.

67.   The uncertainties are particularly large vis—a—vis Latin America. Much
      capital flight to the United States is unreported. Furthermore, one
      might not   wish to count the loans of U.S. banks to troubled debtors at
      full   value as they now appear on the books. A 50 percent write—down, for

      example, would wipe out over $100 billion of claims on Latin America

      alone.

68. Federal Reserve Balletin, May 1986, p. 294. A separate point is that a

      precise definition of the term "net debtor" would include only loans and

      bonds, excluding corporate stock and direct invesment. See Van der Ven

      and Wilson (1986, p. 11). However, investment income has to be paid to

      foreign residents not just in the form of interest on the debt, but

      equally in the form of dividends and repatriated earnings on the rest.

69. Economic Indicators, October 1986.

70. From the viewpoint of other countries, the favorable aspect of the

      capital flow is their trade surpluses vis—a—vis the United States, and

      the unfavorable aspect is that their real interest rates are higher than

      they would otherwise be •   Thth points are particularly relevant for

      troubled debtors who must compete with the United States for funds.
