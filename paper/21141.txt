It's Good to be First: Order Bias in Reading and Citing NBER Working Papers

                                           ABSTRACT

Choices are frequently made from lists where there is by necessity some ordering of options. In such
situations individuals can exhibit both primacy bias towards the first option and recency bias towards
the last option. We examine this phenomenon in a particularly interesting context: consumer response
to the ordering of economics papers in an email announcement issued by the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER). Each Monday morning Eastern Standard Time (EST) the NBER issues a “New
This Week” (NTW) email that lists all of the working papers that have been issued in the past week.
This email goes to more than 23,000 subscribers, both inside and outside academia, and the placement
order is based on random factors. We show that despite the randomized list placement, papers that
are listed first each week are about 30% more likely to be viewed, downloaded, and cited over the
next two years. Lower ranking on the list leads to fewer views and downloads, but not cites; however,
there is also some recency bias, with the last paper listed receiving more views, downloads and cites.
The results are robust to a wide variety of specification checks and are present for both all viewers/
downloaders, and for academic institutions in particular. These results suggest that even among
expert searchers, list-based searches can be manipulated by list placement.

        In the canonical economic model, choices are made from sets. However, as emphasized

by Rubinstein and Salant (2006), choices are often instead made from lists. This appears to be

increasingly true as individuals search for information and goods online where choices are

naturally presented as a list. Consumers make fewer and fewer choices in brick and mortar

establishments where pairs of goods are naturally compared, but rather in online market places

where they are presented with a list of choices from which to pick. Similarly, the practice of

going through physical libraries to browse through stacks of books and journals arranged by

topic has largely been replaced by searching databases or the web with keywords, and typically

selecting from a list of results.

        The fact that individuals are choosing from a list raises the distinct possibility that list

ordering matters. As Miller and Krosnick (1998) and Mantonakis et al. (2009) argue, in some

settings there may be a “primacy effect”, where individuals are biased towards selecting items

listed first in a set. This can arise because of fatigue in working one’s way through a list,

because of serial-position effects on memory, because initial impressions are most lasting, or

simply through “satisficing” behavior when options are considered similar and continued search

is at all costly. On the other hand, there may be a “recency” effect biasing towards items later

in the list as well, because of biased processing of earlier vs. later information. For example,

cognitive fatigue and short-term memory congestion could cause individuals to be less critical

in moving their way down a list. Past evidence from a variety of arenas, ranging from multiple

choice testing, to elections, to judging contests, to pension fund investments, suggest the

presence of both types of effects.



                                                   2
        In this paper we revisit list ordering effects in a particularly interesting context: search

over research papers. We focus on measures of consumer response to the ordering of

economics papers in an email announcement issued by the National Bureau of Economic

Research (NBER). The NBER is one of the most prominent non-academic institutional

affiliations for economists. The NBER serves as a home for grant making, and runs dozens of

conferences each year across the spectrum of economics. It is perhaps best known for its

Working Paper series, through which recent economics research is widely disseminated and

which remains one of the most visible forms of distribution of cutting edge economics research

in the U.S.1 Each week the NBER typically issues 20 new working papers; while originally

distributed in paper form, they are now available (exclusively to individuals) electronically.2

        Most importantly for our purposes, each Monday morning Eastern Standard Time (EST)

the NBER issues a “New This Week” (NTW) email that lists all of the working papers that have

been issued in the past week. This email goes to more than 23,000 subscribers, both inside and

outside academia. Papers are listed solely based on the order in which they were received and

processed through the various filters that are required of authors (e.g. disclosure of conflicts).

Since the order of receipt and the extent of delay is impossible to predict ex-ante, this is a

process that is essentially impossible to game. Indeed, the employees responsible for

constructing this email view themselves as generating these lists randomly and, as we

document below, paper ranking in this email is effectively random with respect to most

observable characteristics.

  The goal of the NBER working paper series is to “make results of NBER research available to other economists in
preliminary form to encourage discussion and suggestions for revision before publication.”

  Paper copies are still available to libraries.

       We build a database that matches each week’s NTW ranking of papers with information

on paper abstract views (hereafter referred to as “hits”), PDF downloads and forward citations.

The first two are available over the 2013-2014 period, while for citations we use the 2012-2013

period (to allow citations to accrue). For the first two we are able to separate out academic

from non-academic institutions to try to differentiate the expert nature of the view/download.

       Our findings are striking: despite the effectively random allocation of papers to the NTW

ranking, we find much higher hits, downloads and citations of papers presented earlier in the

list. The effects are particularly meaningful for the first paper listed, with a 33% increase in

views, a 29% increase in downloads, and a 27% increase in citations from being listed first. For

measures of downloads and hits, although not for citations, there are further declines as papers

slide down the list. However, the very last position is associated with a boost in views and

downloads. The results are robust to a wide variety of specification checks and are present for

both all viewers/downloaders, and for academic institutions in particular. These results

suggest that even among expert searchers, list-based searches can be manipulated by list

placement.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Part I briefly reviews the related previous literature.

Part II discusses the NBER Working Paper process. Part III describes our data and empirical

strategy. Part IV presents the basic results. Part V presents some specification checks to

illustrate the robustness of our findings, while Part VI shows some extensions. Part VII

concludes.

                                          Part I: Previous Literature

        Miller and Krosnick (1998) review evidence for primacy effects in a number of contexts,

such as choice of answers in multiple choice testing and preference of food from a set of

choices. They also find strong evidence for primacy effects in local elections, with a 2.5%

increase in vote share for those listed first; they also suggest that the primacy effect weakens as

expertise rises. Danziger et al.’s (2011) study of decision-making by Israeli judges shows that the

odds of parole declines as judges move through their list of cases, and then resets when judges

come back from a break. And Karlsson et al. (2006) find that individuals choosing where to

invest their pension funds are more likely to select investment options reported at the

beginning of the menu of funds. On the other hand, several studies of panel decisions in

sporting events seem to suggest that options presented at the end of the list fare better, as

judges tend to “loosen” standards over time.3 Mantonakis et al. (2009) review studies showing

recency effects, and in their study of choice of wine from a list of options finds both primacy

and recency effects.

        Some previous research finds order effects in scientists’ citation behavior. Huang (2014)

finds for U.S.-based scientific journals that papers whose primary author’s surname (but not

later authors’ surnames) initials appear earlier in the alphabet get more citations.4 Haque and

Ginsparg (2009) find that astrophysics and high energy physics papers disseminated on arXiv

receive more citations when they appear early in a list of new submissions announcements.

But both of these papers suffer from potential manipulation of authors who may anticipate

these impacts. In the former case, teams of authors can place the author with an

alphabetically-early name as primary author; in the latter case, as the authors acknowledge, the

impact is well known and submissions are timed to take advantage of it.5

        Most related to our work is a recent paper by Novarese and Wilson (2013) that looks at

order effects in research paper downloads (but not citations). They find papers randomly listed

first in lists of new papers from Research Papers in Economics (RePEc) receive more downloads,

and that the effect is stronger when the lists are longer. While they are able to control for list

placement, the interpretation of their results is complicated by the fact that papers in these

announcements are normally presented in descending order of estimated value, so that there is

a natural bias towards primacy effects. We also note that these announcements are not widely

read - the average number of downloads in their sample is 5, while in our sample mean

downloads is 195. For these reasons the effect of list placement on paper visibility remains an

open question.



                                 Part II: The NBER Working Paper Process

        Each Monday morning (EST), the more than 23,000 subscribers to the “New this Week”

(NTW) email receive that week’s paper listings. Appendix A lists the format for a typical week.

Papers are listed in order of working paper number. The top of the email just lists the paper

titles and links, while the remainder of the email provides abstracts and links to a web page for

that working paper. The link leads directly to the web page specific to that working paper,

which includes the abstract and a link to a PDF of the full-text of the paper and other summary

5
 The authors find an enormous spike in submissions in the minutes after the 4:00 deadline past which papers are
selected for the next day’s list. These submissions are thus a highly selected sample of papers submitted to arXiv.


                                                         6
information. While everyone can view the web page, free full-text PDF downloads are restricted

to individual and institutional subscribers to the series, corporate associates, journalists, federal

government employees and military personnel, and residents of developing countries. 6 The

number of papers per week varies from 7 to 45 each week during the 2013-2014 period, with a

mean of 20.3 and a median of 19.5.

        The working paper process proceeds as follows. After a paper is submitted to the NBER

publications department, the NBER staff check whether a number of criteria are met, including

that the paper has not been published elsewhere, that the NBER’s disclosure policy has been

read by all authors and they have accordingly disclosed sources of research funding and

financial relationships that bear on their research, and that the paper does not “make policy

recommendations or offer normative judgment about policies”.7 Once the staff member

indicates in the database that these checks have been completed, the paper is then

automatically assigned the next available working paper number. Papers are processed in

batches between Tuesday to Thursday each week and working papers published by Friday are

then included in the email announcement sent out on the following Monday.

        As a result of these checks, working papers are not necessarily assigned numbers in the

order in which they are submitted. In particular, delays between submission and number

assignment have grown in recent years due to a more rigorous disclosure policy. In addition, in

some cases, the announcement of a working paper is delayed to a subsequent week after a

working paper number has been assigned. This occurs, for instance, when authors send a

revised file after a number has been assigned but before the email announcement is sent out. 8

        It is true, as we will show below, that ranking is correlated with submission day and with

delays from submission. The former is due to the process described above, while the latter is

due to the fact that if papers are delayed, they are placed earlier in the queue when they are

listed. But there is no evidence that either submission date or delay are in any way chosen

strategically by either the NBER or authors. We have the advantage of being able to talk

directly with the NBER employee responsible for creating the working paper list. She reports no

effort by the NBER to influence placement on the NTW list, and she has never received a single

author inquiry about the ranking process or request for list placement. There were a handful

of targeted decisions made about which Working Papers would receive particularly notable

numbers (e.g. 15,000 or 20,000). But even in these cases there was no effort to influence

placement in the NTW list.

        One restriction to our data is that only about half the subscribers to NTW get the full list

of papers, while the other half select the topics or keywords for which they want notification

(see http://www.nber.org/prefs/notify). Papers may therefore be ranked higher on a selected

list than it is on the general list, but not lower. Unfortunately, we cannot match our outcomes

of interest to the rank on the selected list. But the ability to create specialized lists should bias

our results downward by creating noise in the true ranking.




8
  There are a small number of working papers with excessively delays of more than 50 days, presumably due to
issues such as the difficulty of obtaining author permissions. We exclude these cases. Including these papers does
not weaken our results.


                                                        8
                                 Part III: Data and Empirical Specification

        For this project, we have collected the NTW email lists over the past three years.9 We

match these lists to three outcome variables. The first two are the number of clickthroughs

from the link in the NTW email to the paper’s web page (“hits”) and the number of downloads

of the PDF file. Data on these come from 2013-2014 only.

        The third dependent variable is the number of citations to the working paper and

subsequent versions of the paper. The citations counts were collected from Google Scholar, as

other sources such as Web of Science and Scopus do not index working papers. Google Scholar

aggregates citations across different versions of the same paper. We use the set of working

papers announced in 2012 and 2013 for the citations analysis, as we observe only relatively few

citations (yet) for papers listed in the 2014 NTW emails.

        Using these data, we run ordinary least squares10 regressions of the form:

(1)     ln(VIEWit) = α + β*RANKit + Xitδ + ρt + εit

Where i indexes papers and t indexes weeks; VIEW is some measure of the attention paid to

the paper, using the three dimensions denoted above; RANK is one of several measures of the

paper’s ranking in the NTW email; X is a set of paper-specific control variables; and ρ is a set of

fixed effects for each calendar week. So this specification allows us to ask: among all papers

submitted in the same week, how does the placement in the NTW email influence the attention

that is paid to that paper?




9
  For about 25 papers out of the 1800 that we use for our downloads/clickthrough results, they either did not
appear in NTW or we do not have information on where they placed. They are excluded from the analysis.
10
   As a robustness check, we run Poisson Quasi-Maximum Likelihood regressions with similar results.


                                                        9
        For controls, we include the number of authors on the paper; log of the number of

working paper publications from the most (working paper) published coauthor on the paper;

the presence of a “star” co-author, which is defined as having an author with a previous NBER

Working paper that was in the top 5% in terms of forward citations (relative to other working

papers published in the same year); the number of NBER programs in which the paper is

listed11; and a set of dummies for each NBER program in which the paper is listed. In order to

control for any potential concerns over endogenous placement, we also include 7 daily

dummies for the day of the week on which the paper was submitted (in case authors were

trying to find the day of the week that generated highest placement), and the number of days

delay (in case authors were hoping to use more delay to generate higher placement).

        The means of our data are presented in Table 1 for the 2013-2014 sample (except for

citations, which come from the 2012-2013 sample). The typical paper has 921 hits, with 195

downloads and 14 citations by the end of 2014. The typical paper has 2.5 authors, and 5% of

papers feature a “star” co-author. The average length of delay is 12 days. Submissions are

higher earlier in the week and lowest on the weekends. The programs with the most working

papers are Economic Fluctuations and Growth, Labor Studies, and Public Economics.


                                             Part IV: Basic Results

        Tables 2 shows our basic results, for hits, paper downloads and citations, respectively,

for the effect of being ranked first. Turning first to the control variables, we find that the stock

of working papers by the most prolific author leads to more hits and downloads, but not more

11
  More information about the NBER research programs is available at http://www.nber.org/programs/: “The
research activities of the NBER are organized into a series of twenty research programs and fifteen working
groups… (which) correspond loosely to traditional fields of study within the field of economics.” Each paper is
assigned a program primarily based on the affiliation of the authors (for those with an NBER affiliation).


                                                        10
citations. We find that papers with more authors have fewer hits and fewer downloads, but are

cited more often. We find that having a “star” coauthor is the largest and most consistent

effect, raising hits, downloads and citations. The number of programs in which the paper is

listed also has mixed effects. There is little impact of days of delay on ranking effects.

       Turning next to our variables of interest, the most important common finding is a very

sizeable positive effect of being ranked first. We find in the second column that being ranked

first leads to 33% more hits, 30% more downloads, and 27% more citations. This is a striking

effect from random list placement.

       Table 3 extends the results to consider other measures of ranking. The first column

shows the linear effect of rank. The second column includes both the rank and rank1 included

together. The third column includes dummies for being ranked first or second (rank1 and

rank2). The fourth column includes a dummy for last rank while the fifth column has both last

rank and rank together. Finally, the last column considers three dummies for being in the

bottom three quartiles of the list.

       Unlike the results for being ranked first, there is more inconsistency across dependent

variables for these different measures. The citation regressions find that neither linear rank,

nor being ranked second, nor the quartile of ranking, has much effect on citations. The

coefficient for last rank is positive but not significant. Thus, beyond being ranked first, we find

no clear evidence that other placement on the lists matters for citation counts.

       For hits and downloads, however, other elements of list placement matters. For

example, the linear rank coefficient is highly significant in the first column, with each spot lower

in the rank leading to 1% fewer hits and 0.9% fewer downloads. When rank1 and linear rank are



                                                 11
included together, both are significant and not importantly changed in effects relative to their

independent inclusion. When rank2 is included, it is positive but not significant. The results are

similar even when rank, rank1 and rank2 are all included.

       The very last position is associated with a 10% increase in hits and a 17% increase in

downloads. When we control linearly for rank (and hence the tendency for attention to

decrease over the list), these effects are even stronger. Indeed, conditioning on rank, the effect

of being listed last on downloads is not significantly different from the effect of being listed

first. Finally, the results of rank by quartile suggest that there is an insignificant penalty for

being in the second quartile, which grows to be sizeable and significant for the third and fourth

quartiles.

       To summarize, we find that placement on the NTW list has a significant effect on hits,

downloads and citations. This is true for all measures for being ranked first: the first ranked

paper each week is much more likely to be viewed and cited. For other measures of ranking,

there appears to be an effect on hits and downloads, but not on citations.



                                    Part V: Specification Checks

       In this section, we provide the results of a number of tests to show the robustness of

the striking finding of the effect on NTW list placement. We begin by showing that there are no

important correlations between the rank measures and other observable characteristics of

working papers. Table 4 shows regressions for paper rank and being ranked first on working

paper characteristics for the 2013-2014 sample used for hits and downloads. Paper rank is

correlated with day of the week that the paper was submitted; papers submitted on Tuesday-



                                                  12
Thursday have lower ranks. At the same time, papers submitted on Wednesday and Thursday

are less likely to be ranked first. There is also a significant impact of delay on ranking or the

odds of being ranked first. Importantly, neither day of the week nor delay is meaningfully

correlated with citations in Table 2.12 The variables that are strong predictors of citations, such

as whether there is a “star” author or the number of authors on the paper, or the presence in

particular NBER programs, are uncorrelated with ranking.

           The strong correlation between ranking and delay is a potential source of concern. It is

possible, for example, that the most famous authors are the busiest and therefore have the

longest delays in their papers, in a manner that is not captured by our “star” measure. As

noted, delay is not correlated independently with hits/downloads/citations. Nevertheless, to

more precisely address this point, we can restrict the sample only to the first ranked paper and

to other papers submitted the exact same day as the first ranked paper. The results of this

exercise are shown in the first column of Table 5. This table has rows for each of our three

measures (hits, downloads and citations). The regression includes all of the control variables

noted earlier, except for delay and day of the week, which is homogenous within this sample.

           The results for this small sample show that, if anything, the results are stronger when

rank1 papers are compared to papers submitted the same day, using all three dependent

variables. The estimate is not significant for citations, but it is highly significant for the other

measures.

           More generally, one might be concerned that the best papers are being placed towards

the top of the list. To address this more explicitly, the next column of Table 5 shows results

     As a stricter test, they are not correlated with citations even in regression that exclude the rank measures.

when we restrict the sample only to the first and second ranked papers on the list. If there is a

general tendency to put better papers higher on the list, the effects of being ranked first should

be mitigated compared to the second ranked paper. This is in fact not the case – the effects are

very similar when restricted to this much smaller sample (albeit not significant for citations).

       Our final specification check relies on the fact that we also have data available on hits

that come from locations other than through link in the NTW email. As shown in Table 1, there

is a much larger number of hits that come outside the NTW link itself. For these users, the

ranking within the list should not matter – they aren’t clicking directly from the NTW list, but

are searching on some other criteria.13 Therefore, non-NTW hits serve as an excellent proxy for

paper quality that is independent of placement on the NTW list. Indeed, there is a very strong

correlation between non-NTW hits and hits from NTW emails: one more non-NTW hit is

associated with almost 0.3 more hits through the NTW links.

       The next two columns of Table 5 replicate our base regressions from Table 2, but

include this “quality” measure as an extra control. This measure is only available starting in

March, 2013. This means that we cannot use it for the citation measure, and that our sample is

somewhat smaller for the hits and downloads analysis. Our main download and hits results are

comparable, but about 6% smaller, for this march-forward sample.



       Strikingly, adding this excellent proxy for quality does not change our conclusions that

being ranked first dramatically increases cites & downloads, and higher ranking reduces both.

The coefficient on hits is somewhat smaller than the comparable sample result without the

control, while the coefficient for downloads is noticeably smaller (but not significantly

different). The latter could arise because individuals repeat visit the website using the link from

the NTW list to view papers, and these views influence later downloads that do not come

directly from the NTW-link. Therefore, including the non-NTW list hits may absorb some of our

list ranking effect. In any case, what is most important is that our results still show very sizeable

ranking effects even when this measure of paper quality is included, providing further evidence

of randomization in list placement and that unobserved paper quality is not driving our findings.



                               Part VI: What Drives the Rank Effects?

          The effects uncovered thus far provide striking evidence that position in the NBER NTW

working paper list impacts attention paid to research papers that are otherwise similar. The

natural follow-on question is why that is. We consider three possible explanations for this

finding in Tables 6a-6c (one table for each of our dependent variables)

          First, we can assess whether the finding is due to a lack of attention among non-experts.

Perhaps non-academics who receive the NTW email list are not paying much attention to it and

so just click on the first paper, but academics who are paying attention don’t display such bias.

To address this point, we can restrict the analysis solely to those who have the higher education

based “.edu” extensions in their email addresses . This allows us to subset on a more “expert”

set of readers who should on average have more professional interest in the working paper

series.

          The first three columns of Tables 6a and 6b show the results for the .edu subsample, for

both hits and downloads, for the rank, rank1 and last rank measures (we are unable to refine



                                                 15
citations along this dimension in Table 6c). In every case, as with the larger sample, the effects

are highly significant and suggestive that higher ranking on the working paper list leads to more

attention. The results are slightly moderated relative to the baseline specifications of table 2

for the effect of rank1: being ranked first leads to a 25.9% increase in hits for the .edu hits, as

opposed to 32.8% for all hits; and 23.2% in downloads for the .edu downloads, as opposed to

29.5% for all downloads. For hits, an additional spot downward in the ranking leads to a 0.7%

decline for the .edu hits, as opposed to 1% for all hits. However, there is no difference for the

effect of rank on downloads; and the effect of being ranked last is actually higher for .edu hits

(14.5% versus 10%). Overall, we conclude that expert users of the NTW list do not show

meaningfully different responses to ranking of papers on NTW compared to non-experts.

           A second explanation is that inattention is driven by longer lists. If readers of the lists

have a fixed attention span, then they may be less willing to peruse a list that is longer than one

that is shorter; this implies that a NTW list that has a larger number of entries will deter search

throughout the list, and that the difference between the first rank and other placements will be

more pronounced.

           To address this point, we include in our regressions an interaction of our rank measures

with an indicator for whether the list is above median length (more than 20 papers).14 We

show the results for each of our three measures in columns (4)-(6) of Tables 6a-6c. We find

positive interactions between first rank and length of the list, although the effect is significant

only for downloads. The interactions between long list and rank, as well as those between long

list and last rank are not significant.


14
     Since all regressions have week fixed effects, the main effect of long list is absorbed into the week fixed effects.


                                                             16
        A third model is that limited attention is driven by the attractiveness of the first option.

That is, perhaps individuals have a stopping rule that is based on how interested they are in the

first paper on the list; if the first paper is particularly attractive, then they are more interested

in perusing other papers on the list. To test this alternative, we rate the “quality” of the first

option on the NTW list by whether it has a “star” author (as defined previously). We then ask:

does the favoritism of higher ranked papers weaken when the top paper is by a star author?

        We test this hypothesis in three ways in columns (7)-(9) of Tables 6a-6c. First, we

interact the dummy for being the second ranked paper with an indicator for a star author on

the first paper. Here we find that there is indeed a negative coefficient: the favoritism of the

second ranked paper that we saw earlier is mitigated when the first ranked paper has a star

author. Second, we interact linear rank with the dummy indicating whether the first paper has

a star author. Here, the results are mixed: the coefficient is positive for downloads (indicating

that the penalty for being a lower ranked paper is reduced), but it is negative for the other

measures. Finally, we interact the dummy for being ranked last with the first paper star

measure. The results here uniformly indicate that the favoritism of the last paper is reduced

when the first paper is by a star author. Thus, the evidence is suggestive that having a star

author of the first paper impacts search behavior, but unfortunately none of the interactions of

interest are significant.

        Overall, we find little support for the possibility that the results are driven by non-

experts. But we do find some evidence that inattention is driven by longer lists, and that the

quality of the first ranked paper impacts search behavior.

                                       Part VII: Conclusions

       The NBER New This Week email list represents a canonical example of choice from lists

of the type that is prevalent in on-line search. We find that search from this list shows strong

primacy effects, whereby papers displayed earlier on the list are viewed, downloaded and cited

more often than are other papers, as well as some recency effects, with the last paper also

being more frequently viewed and downloaded. We argue that this is completely independent

of paper quality, and employ a variety of tests to demonstrate this case. Both the primacy and

recency effects are present for more and less expert users of the email list, with some evidence

that both the length of the list and the quality of the first paper listed impacts search behavior.

       These findings confirm that presentation order can be a powerful determinant of choice

in a list-based environment – and that this can have strong downstream effects, such as

through paper citations in our sample. This suggests that those designing choice mechanisms in

a list-based environment consider mechanisms to counteract any such bias; for example,

presentation order to those considering goods online could be randomized. At a minimum,

decision support tools may want to incorporate this bias into their efforts to provide for the

best possible choice for individuals in these environments.
