                                         ABSTRACT

Choices in energy regulation, particularly whether and how to price externalities, can have widely
different distributional consequences both across and within income groups. Traditional welfare
theory focuses largely on effects across income groups; such “vertical equity” concerns can
typically be addressed by a progressive redistribution of emissions revenues. In this paper, we
review alternative economic perspectives that give rise to equity concerns within income groups,
or “horizontal equity,” and suggest operational measures. We then apply those measures to a
stylized model of pollution regulation in the electricity sector. In addition, we look for ways to
present the information behind those measures directly to stakeholders. We show how horizontal
equity concerns might overshadow efficiency concerns in this context.

Introduction

       Economists often give primacy to the efficiency or cost-effectiveness of regulatory

design, favoring Pigouvian pricing mechanisms for addressing environmental externalities.

Implicitly or explicitly, economists’ favoritism assumes equity concerns can be dealt with by

allocating the rents created by emissions pricing. For example, tax rate changes can redistribute

rents to achieve a desired level of progressivity with respect to impacts across income group,

often with particular attention to about outcomes for poor households.

       In this paper, we make three observations that together suggest favoritism for Pigouvian

policies may be misplaced because equity concerns are not so easily vanquished. First, the focus

on equity as a question of impacts across income group, and the poor as a collective group,

derives from traditional welfare theory. Traditional welfare theory places value on equalizing

household utility and bringing the poor and rich closer together. However, an alternative line of

thought, typically referred to as fair burden or horizontal equity (HE), places value on similar

households facing similar changes. The distribution of impacts across income groups still

matters, but so do impacts within income groups.

       Second, Pigouvian pricing policies can involve household-level costs and benefits that

are orders of magnitude larger than those arising under other, non-Pigouvian policies. This is true

even as positive and negative household-level impacts cancel out in the aggregate and Pigouvian

policies are less expensive for society. Finally, the redistribution created by Pigouvian pricing of

energy externalities can be substantially unrelated to income and other easily observable

variables. This makes it difficult if not impossible to neutralize large, unequal effects within

income groups.



                                                      2
       Taken together, these observations suggest that Pigouvian energy regulation may have

relatively large, unavoidable, horizontal equity impacts and that the economists’ favoritism may

be misplaced. It also raises a question: How can policy analysts present information about

horizontal equity in ways that facilitate stakeholder discussion and policymaker decisions?

       We note this is not always the case. Some Pigouvian energy regulation does not directly

affect households and equity impacts are manageable. Under the acid rain program, for example,

an agreement was made to cap sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from coal-fired power plants at a

specific level. With a general notion of how to allocate emissions rights, attention then shifted to

horse-trading among the companies to address the exact distribution of burden (Cohen 1995).

But, importantly, the price of electricity was largely unaffected (Burtraw et al. 2005). Natural gas

generators are often the marginal producers and do not emit SO2. Hence, power generation

companies were the ones who felt the effects of the regulation and allocation choices—and were

directly involved in those choices. Coasean bargaining at its best.

       Market-based CO2 programs, however, have the potential to raise electricity and other

energy prices significantly. Over a hundred million households, as well as businesses, will feel

the direct effect of regulation as well as the choices about allowance or revenue allocations.

Direct horse-trading to address equity is difficult if not impossible. Individual bargaining is

replaced by generic rules, perhaps based on income or other observable demographics. As we

show, it will be difficult to alleviate substantial inequity from energy price impacts based on

observable demographics.

       While our contribution ties energy regulation to policymaking concerns about horizontal

equity, we are not the first paper to remark on these additional distributional impacts of

Pigouvian energy pricing. Burtraw and Palmer (2008) find that a carbon pricing policy has net

                                                      3
social costs of roughly $0.5 billion annually, while consumers and producers lose more than $21

billion in pollution payments. With an eye towards fuel taxes, Poterba (1991) presents gasoline

expenditures by income decile but also reports the fraction of each decile both where

expenditures shares are above 0.1 and where they are equal to zero. He finds an average share of

0.039 for the lowest decile masks but 36 percent of this decile spend nothing on gasoline while

14 percent have an expenditure share exceeding 0.1. Among practitioners, analysis of tax reform

proposals regularly focus on the coefficient of variation of impacts within income groups

(Westort and Wagner 2002).

       Taking a more expansive approach, Rausch et al. (2011) use graphical figures to present

the distributional effects of carbon pricing associated with various rebate approaches. They

present box-and-whisker plots, similar to our preferred graphical figures, showing outcomes

across and within income deciles. They highlight that some amount of progressivity and

regressivity is certainly present, with the mean cost by decile ranging from 0 to 0.5 percent of

income. At the same time, a large number of households experience gains and losses of more

than 1 percent.

       None of these papers, however, suggests that there might be a welfare cost to substantial

variation in household effects within income groups. Only Burtraw and Palmer (2008) point out

that non-Pigouvian policies can lead to much smaller distributional effects. In this way, we

believe our paper offers a new perspective on efficiency-equity concerns.

       In order to make our points about horizontal equity and Pigouvian pricing, we first

review the various rationales for valuing horizontal equity as well as the controversies. We then

present two welfare measures to operationalize these ideas and explain how they relate to models

in the literature. In order to relate this to energy policy, we then turn to how energy regulation

                                                      4
affects energy prices and ultimately household welfare. We consider a stylized model of two

climate change policies. One policy is Pigouvian pricing, a mass-based cap and trade (CAT)

policy applied to the electric power sector with auction revenue used to provide an equal rebate

per household. The other is non-Pigouvian, a rate-based tradeable performance standard (TPS)

that is effectively a revenue-neutral combination of a tax on emissions and subsidy to output of

electricity. Thanks to the subsidy, the TPS does not raise electricity prices as much as does the

CAT.

       To complete the task, we simulate the distributional consequences of these policies using

a sample of observed consumer expenditures. Within this sample we see a large heterogeneity of

household electricity expenditures even within a single income group. The CAT therefore results

in much more horizontal, within-income-group redistribution than the TPS. We put these

outcomes into our welfare measure and show that this can translate into lower welfare under

CAT versus TPS. Finally, we consider ways that one might present this information to

stakeholders and policymakers without appealing to elaborate welfare theories, but while still

remaining consistent with those theories. And we revisit the degree to which horizontal equity

might be attenuated using other observable data, arguing that such efforts are unlikely to help.



Foundations of horizontal equity in economic thought

       Equity and justice have long been principles in public economics (Elkins 2006). Within

this rich intellectual history, we identify two threads that speak to the idea of treating similar

households similarly in public policy. There is an older literature that frames the discussion in

terms of equal sacrifice regarding the provision of public goods and a more recent, welfarist

approach that builds on the axiomatic treatment of welfare measures. The latter encompasses


                                                      5
both provision of public goods and redistribution from rich to poor. Beyond public economics,

one can interpret the behavioral work by Tversky, Kahneman, and others, as supporting

horizontal equity. Here, we review these ideas before turning to operationalizing our approach.


Equal Sacrifice


       The principle of equal sacrifice dates at least to the 19th century. For John Stuart Mill

(1871), “Equality of taxation ... means equality of sacrifice. It means apportioning the

contribution of each person toward the expenses of government so that he shall feel neither more

nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other person experiences from

his.” This principle of equal sacrifice in paying for public goods could be interpreted as

supporting progressive taxation, to ensure equal consequences in terms of utility and to ensure

that equally situated persons are treated equally. The 19th-century utilitarian philosopher and

economist Henry Sidgwick considered equal sacrifice the “obviously equitable principle—

assuming that the existing distribution of wealth is accepted as just or not unjust” (Weinzierl

2012). In other words, assuming society does not want to engage in additional income

redistribution, the burdens of financing government should be shared equally.

       The question of whether society does or does not want to engage in income redistribution

is an important distinction. This older literature tended to separate this question from the

question of how to fund public goods. Tracing back to the Greeks, Elkins (2006) argues that the

principal of equal treatment can be seen as an application of Aristotelian philosophy, in which a

just distribution is based on merit. If individuals “merit” their status quo ante distribution, then

they should merit equal shares in the post-intervention distribution. Of course, as the definition




                                                      6
of merit matters for evaluating the fairness of Aristotelian justice, “the moral basis of horizontal

equity depends upon the moral standing of the market distribution” (p. 73).

       A second distinction framed in the early literature is the fair treatment of similar

individuals versus the fair treatment of very different individuals. In a treatise on tax policy,

Simons (1938) states that “taxes should bear similarly upon persons similarly situated” (p. 106).

Pigou himself noted that “equal sacrifice among similar and similarly situated persons is an

entirely different thing from equal sacrifice among all persons” (Pigou 1928).


Welfarism


       While the distinction between vertical and horizontal equity came to prominence in the

early and mid-20th century, it was the welfarists in the latter part of the 20th century that

introduced these terms. In that context, mitigating social inequality became referred to as

“vertical equity,” while treating people in similar circumstances similarly became recognized as

“horizontal equity” (Elkins 2006, 43). Now, in addition to questions about taxes and the

provision of public good, social policy explicitly considered redistribution.

       Welfarism looks at the desirability of public policy in terms of whether the state of affairs

with the policy has a higher welfare measure than the state without (Sen 1979). A distinctive

feature of horizontal equity is the comparison to a reference point, rooted in the status quo ante.

Whereas vertical equity can be measured for any distribution of income or utility (such as with a

Gini coefficient, before or after a policy intervention), assessing horizontal equity requires a

change to evaluate. Similarly situated persons are so situated ex ante, and that reference point sits

within a pre-existing vertical distribution. Most traditional, axiomatic welfare measures (see




                                                       7
Chapter 23 of Mueller 2003) avoid reference points and fail to capture horizontal equity.

Moreover, it is inclusion of a reference point that has regularly led to controversy.

         Different approaches have been taken with respect to reference points. Early economic

applications of horizontal equity in public finance focused on rank as a reference point. The

Pigou-Dalton axiom holds that a social welfare function should prefer allocations that are more

(vertically) equitable, as long as redistribution does not change the ranking of individuals. Adler

(2013, p. 1) defends this “prioritarian” view, adjusting the measure of well-being according to

responsibility: “if one person is at a higher level of well-being than a second, and the worse-off

one is not responsible for being worse off, then distributive justice recommends a non-leaky,

non-rank-switching transfer of well-being from the first to the second, if no one else’s well-being

changes.”

         A later application by Auerbach and Hassett (2002) introduces reference points by

nesting groups with similar, pre-policy incomes into an aggregate welfare function. Separate

elasticity parameters penalize income inequality within the nested groups (horizontal equity) and

across nested groups (vertical equity). Otherwise, the aggregate function looks like a more

traditional welfare function of post-policy outcomes, not changes. In practice, this makes it

difficult to measure horizontal equity effects arising from a new policy when changes in income

are small relative to existing differences between individuals within each nested group.1 This is

often the case with energy regulation.

         In a series of articles, Louis Kaplow (1989, 1992, 2000) critiques both applications and

underlying principles of horizontal equity. He is particularly critical of operationalizing the early


         1 Auerbach and Hassett remark that the horizontal equity effects of income taxes are equivalent to an across
the board 0.2-0.4 percent tax increase—roughly 0.01 of total tax costs.

                                                              8
focus on rank, where large rank-preserving redistributions would have to be compared to

infinitesimal rank-inverting redistributions. The implied idea of large discontinuities in a welfare

measure is unappealing. But he is more generally critical of the notion of a valid refence point.

He argues it is counter to the idea of economic mobility. He suggests that the status quo as a

reference point arbitrarily treats policy outcomes as more significant than the “luck” leading to

status quo differences. Moreover, once a policy is implemented it becomes the status quo. If a

policy has negative HE consequences, so does reversing the policy. He points out that HE

implies a trade-off with the Pareto principal. Even if no one is worse off, there may be unequal

treatment of similar households (though we show this need not alter Pareto welfare rankings).

While it is beyond the scope of this paper to respond to all Kaplow’s criticisms—criticisms that

we view as pointing out logistical consequences but not being fatal to the idea of HE in any

case—there is certainly evidence that people think in terms of reference points.


Behavioral Economics


       Distinct from the philosophical origins of horizontal equity, behavioral economics

provides another motivation for believing reference points are important. In particular,

theoretical foundations for reference-based utility were offered by psychologists Kahneman and

Tversky (1979), who propose prospect theory as a way to incorporate observed behavioral biases

in decisionmaking. Central concepts are that people evaluate outcomes relative to a reference

point, and gains are evaluated differently from losses, expressed by “loss aversion.” Kahneman

and Tversky were not explicit about the origin of the reference point, but proposed candidates

have been the expected outcome (Kőszegi and Rabin 2006, 2007, 2009), the status quo (the

“endowment effect” in Thaler 1980), or the average outcome of others. Although prospect theory


                                                     9
was postulated for decisionmaking under uncertainty (and also includes concepts related to

biases in evaluating high-risk, low-probability events), Michaelson (2015, p. 202) argues that the

same biases also hold for resource distribution problems in the aggregate. His findings “suggest

that neither utilitarian nor Rawlsian objectives will properly describe what most people believe is

fair.” Thus, reference-point biases offer additional support for considering aspects of horizontal

equity in policymaking.


Applications to Energy and Environmental Policy


         There is reason to believe that horizontal equity issues can loom much larger than vertical

equity ones for environmental policy. First, broad-based tax policy is the government’s primary

tool for addressing vertical inequality; environmental policy is an indirect one at best. If one

believes that the overall tax system has evolved to address social inequality to the extent that the

existing distribution is “just,” then a reasonable equity principle for allocating the burden of

environmental policy is to avoid distortions to that distribution. That is, equal sacrifice relative

to the status quo. Second, environmental policy costs tend to be small compared to income and

other taxes but highly heterogeneous. In the application we consider, impacts are on the order of

tens or hundreds of dollars per household.2 Such changes are unlikely to impact vertical equity

in a meaningful way. Nonetheless, equity and fairness concerns remain in the same way that

overall cost-benefit concerns remain. And, while most households have options to change

behavior and reduce their energy consumption, some margins may be constrained by housing

and climate conditions, family size, landlord-tenant relationships, etc. These constraints may




         2The threshold for “significant regulatory action” requiring cost-benefit anlaysis is $100 million, or just $1
per household (US Government 1993).

                                                              10
need to be taken into account in assessing equity concerns (e.g., “responsibility” and “merit” in

the prioritarian and Aristotelian senses).

         In the next section, we propose a framework for considering horizontal equity impacts in

assessing the costs of a policy and explain its roots. We then show how this relates to the welfare

function in Slesnick (1989), which uses changes in utility relative to a reference point, as well as

an aggregate welfare function based on the value functions put forward by Tversky and

Kahneman (1992).



Operationalizing horizontal equity in welfare theory

         As previously discussed, operationalizing horizontal equity into a welfare function faces

the challenges of incorporating the referential nature of equal sacrifice while retaining sensible

notions regarding redistributions. In this section, we draw on work by Slesnick (1989) and

Kahneman and Tversky (1979) to motivate a particular welfare measure that includes horizontal

and vertical equity. To make concepts clear, we specify an initial distribution of incomes, {𝑦𝑖0 },

for a group of N households. These households are affected by a policy that leads to a

distribution of changes (consumption variation) given by{Δyi}. We thus focus on motivating a

welfare measure for a specific, policy-induced change in net income:3

                                             ̅̅̅̅ − 𝛾𝑁 −1 ∑𝑖 |Δ𝑦𝑖 − 𝑟𝑖 |
                                        𝑊0 = Δ𝑦                                                                    (1)

as well as a slight variant:




         3The purpose of the measures is to facilitate an evaluation of net benefits from a single policy or a choice
among policies. We intentionally refer to W as a “welfare measure for a specific, policy-induced change” without
suggesting the measure should be treated as changes in some welfare level that cumulates policy after policy. E.g.,
we do not refer to our expressions as ΔW.

                                                              11
                                                               y
                                     W1 = y −  N −1  i          ( yi − ri )2                                 (2)
                                                               yi0

        In both cases, W is scaled to household, monetary terms in the ballpark of the average

household net income change, Δ𝑦
                             ̅̅̅̅ = 𝑁 −1 ∑𝑖 Δ𝑦𝑖 . Here, ri is a reference point for household i,

where ri is constructed such that 𝑁 −1 ∑𝑖 𝑟𝑖 = Δ𝑦
                                               ̅̅̅̅. The measure W0 depends on the average

absolute deviations from 𝑟𝑖 while W1 depends on the squared (weighted) deviations from 𝑟𝑖 . The

parameter γ is a weight (1 ≥ γ ≥ 0) placed on the second term. We will go through the origins of

these welfare function momentarily—importantly, what might generate 𝑟𝑖 —but for a moment we

highlight a few features.

        First, we refer to the second term, after γ, as an “equity penalty” arising from deviations

from fair burden (when we want to refer to the term including γ, we will refer to the “weighted

equity penalty”). The first term (Δ𝑦
                                  ̅̅̅̅) measures non-equity costs or benefits, and simply depends

on average (or, multiplied by N, total) costs or benefits. This term is unaffected by how those

costs or benefits are distributed. The second term measures the effect of deviations from a

particular distribution of burden given by the ri’s. These ri’s are able to capture the idea of

vertical equity or fairness—the burden that households in different situations ought to bear to

achieve the fairest possible outcome. To the extent actual household costs match those defined

by the ri, the penalty is zero. To the extent household costs differ from r, in either vertical (across

initially different households) or horizontal (among initially similar households) ways, the

penalty is positive and subtracts from welfare.4




        4It is worth noting that this welfare measure is subject to the Kaplow criticism that enacting a policy and
then removing it can both involve adverse equity penalties. Imagine a policy that matches fair burden, but then adds
some random transfers among similarly situated individuals. The adverse equity penalty that would arise from both
implementing and reversing the policy could be viewed as friction.

                                                             12
        Second, the penalty is weighted by a scaling factor γ. This is a social choice about the

importance of equity concerns and is unavoidable to fully operationalize the welfare metric. As

we discuss below, it is natural to constrain γ. In particular, it might not be so large so that making

a single person better off, without harming any other, lowers welfare, at least from the status quo,

leading to our constraint that γ ≤ 1. That addresses one of Kaplow’s criticism, noted above, that

HE alone implies a violation of the Pareto principle.


        Third, and perhaps most usefully, notions of horizontal and vertical equity can be

decomposed. For example, suppose we define the reference point ri to be the average burden in

one’s own decile Δ𝑦
                 ̅̅̅̅𝑑(𝑖) where 𝑑(𝑖) maps individuals into deciles. (We do this formally in our

modeling application section). The penalty now approximates HE only. That is, the deciles as a

whole are not penalized for whatever burden they bear, on average. The only penalty is for

variation within the decile—whether similar individuals are treated similarly, or not.5 The

additional penalty associated with alternative definitions of ri comes from vertical inequity.

        The fourth and last feature, which we demonstrate in our application, is that our measures

allow quick and easy calculation of this HE component of the penalty term based on decile

summary statistics. We can construct the HE penalty in W0 from the average absolute deviation

of burden by decile. And the HE penalty in W1 is approximated based on the standard deviation

of burden by decile. That is, if we compute the average absolute deviation of Δyi and the

standard deviation of Δ𝑦𝑖 for each decile, the HE penalties in W0 and W1 are the simple and

(approximately) weighted quadratic average across deciles, respectively, of these two statistics.




        5 We could instead imagine a more complicated scheme that would define ri in terms of a more localized
mean of the Δ𝑦𝑖 ’s, rather than grouping households into deciles. This would be a more precise HE-only measure.

discuss below.

            We now turn to the literature to understand the underlying justification for (1) and (2).


Slesnick


            Slesnick (1989) provides the main motivation for our welfare measure. He uses a welfare

function based on deviations in household utility u from an initial reference point. Here, we have

simplified his model to match our notation, making utility u solely a function of income.

Specifically, the change in utility for individual i is given by ui = u ( yi0 + yi ) − u ( yi0 ).


            The welfare function begins with a weighted average of utility changes across

households, from which is subtracted a measure of deviations from this average. In this way,

variation across households in their utility change is costly in terms of welfare, and the welfare-

maximizing policy would generally involve an equal utility change across all households. This is

the equal sacrifice notion. Slesnick’s welfare function can be written as



                                                        ( a u − u )
                                                                          1
                                                                    1+  1+ 
                                          Ws = u −       i    i                                         (3)


where u =  i ai ui and      a i   i   = 1.


            We can already see that (3) is somewhat similar to (1) and (2) in functional form with one

term capturing the average utility effect and the second a penalty for unequal distribution. That

is, the welfare function is increasing in the average utility change but decreasing in a measure of


                                                               14
deviations of changes in individual utility from the average. This equity penalty includes

horizontal inequity, when individuals with similar incomes face different utility changes. But it

also includes vertical inequity, when, collectively, those individuals at a given income level

deviate from the income change implied by Δ𝑢
                                          ̅̅̅̅ at that income level.


         Without defining the weights in (3), rearranging costs to minimize deviations in utility

changes may affect average utility. However, by weighting the individual deviations by the

inverse of marginal utility, we can completely disentangle total costs and burden sharing. Let ai

                                                                  u( yi0 ) −1 6
represent normalized Negishi weights, so ai =                                     .
                                                                  j u( y 0j )−1

When these weights are used—and assuming income changes are small relative to total income,

so Δ𝑢𝑖 = 𝑢′ (𝑦𝑖0 )Δ𝑦𝑖 —the average utility change reduces to a rescaled average income change:

                                  ′   0 −1                       −1 ′ 0

                                                                     𝑢 (𝑦𝑖 )Δ𝑦𝑖
                                                                          −1
                                                                                    ̅ ∗ Δ𝑦

                                ′ 0
                                ∑𝑖 𝑢 (𝑦𝑖 )                   ∑𝑖 𝑢′ (𝑦𝑖0 )



where, as before, Δ𝑦                                                          ̅ =
                  ̅̅̅̅ = 𝑁 −1 ∑Δ𝑦𝑖 is the simple average change in income and 𝑢′

(𝑁 −1 ∑𝑖 𝑢′ (𝑦𝑖0 )−1 )−1 is the harmonic average of individual marginal utility. In this way, we see

that the first term in (3), ̅̅̅̅
                            Δ𝑢, only depends on the average income change, not the how income

changes are allocated. That is, we can reallocate dollar costs across households without affecting

the first term (or the basis of fair burden in the second term). The penalty is then minimized and




         6   Negishi (1960) formalized an insight for evaluating policies that do not have a primary goal of
manipulating the distribution of income. It involved weighting individual utilities by the inverse of the marginal
utility of income. With this weighting, the summed social welfare function replicates the market distribution and
marginal movements of income among individuals do not affect welfare.



                                                                      15

of income, this implies a specific notion of fair burden given by

                                                       ̅̅̅̅

                                    𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟(𝑦𝑖0 ) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 0 ) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 0 )                             (4)
                                                          𝑖           𝑖



        As shown in the appendix, we can use these values of ai in (3) and ri in (4) to produce

𝑢̅′ 𝑊 0 and 𝑢̅′ 𝑊1 in (1) and (2) through a bit of manipulation and parameter assumptions. Hence,

Slesnick provides one basis for choosing our welfare measures.

        How does this expression for fair burden, (𝑢̅′ /𝑢𝑖′ )Δ𝑦
                                                             ̅̅̅̅, vary across households with

different income levels? That depends on the shape of the utility function. Suppose we assume

iso-elastic utility, where

                                   𝑢𝑖 = 𝑢(𝑦𝑖 ) = (1 − 𝜏)−1 𝑦𝑖1−𝜏 ,                                   (5)


so u( yi ) = yi − . Consider two households, rich (R) and poor (P) where 𝑦𝑅0 > 𝑦𝑃0. Given the

above expression above for ri, we have 𝑟(𝑦𝑅0 )/𝑟(𝑦𝑃0 ) = (𝑢𝑅′ /𝑢𝑃′ )−1 = (𝑦𝑅0 /𝑦𝑃0 )𝜏 . When τ = 1

(i.e., log utility), the welfare-maximizing cost allocation is an equal percentage of income for all

households. When τ > 1, the rich household should pay a disproportionate share of income than

the poorest. That is, 𝑟(𝑦𝑅0 )/𝑟(𝑦𝑃0 ) > 𝑦𝑅 /𝑦𝑃 . When τ < 1, the rich household still pays more in

absolute terms but less than a proportionate share of income relative to the poorest.

        The Negishi weights have another important and related consequence for the Slesnick

welfare function. Imagine we are examining an outcome where 0 > Δ𝑢𝑖 (𝑦𝑖 ) − ̅̅̅̅
                                                                            Δ𝑢 > Δ𝑢𝑗 (𝑦𝑗 ) −

Δ𝑢. Both households are faring worse than the average burden, ̅̅̅̅
̅̅̅̅                                                          Δ𝑢. But household j is bearing a

more extreme adverse burden. Consider a small transfer of income to household i from j. Along

the lines of the Pigou-Dalton principle, we would want this transfer to improve welfare, since it


                                                         16
would reduce the more extreme deviation from the average utility change without affecting

individuals other than i and j. Based on the Negishi weights, this will be true so long as ρ > 0.

That is, the derivative of the second term in (2) for a reallocation dy from i to j would be

                                               𝜌

                                                                   Δ𝑢| − |Δ𝑢𝑖 − ̅̅̅̅
                                                                                Δ𝑢|𝜌 )𝑑𝑦,
                                         ∑𝑖 𝑢′ (𝑦𝑖0 )

which is positive so long as ρ > 0, given the larger deviation in utility for household j. If ρ = 0,

Pigou-Dalton holds only weakly. Welfare is not improved by such transfers, but neither is it

reduced. In that case, we do not care about more extreme burdens.

       This point highlights the importance of ρ in the Slesnick function. The form
                           1
              ̅̅̅̅ |1+𝜌 )1+𝜌 is an example of a power mean. This simplifies to an arithmetic mean
(∑𝑖 𝑎𝑖 |Δ𝑢𝑖 − Δ𝑢

of when ρ = 0 and standard deviation when ρ = 1, our two formulations of interest. More

generally, the expression converges to the maximum value of |Δ𝑢𝑖 − Δ𝑢
                                                                   ̅̅̅̅ | as 𝜌 → ∞.7 In other

words, ρ governs the degree of aversion to extremes of inequality in the Pigou-Dalton sense,

versus a general aversion to differences, however small or large. Larger values of ρ will imply

more concerns about extreme deviations, while ρ = 0 only cares about the average deviation.

       The only remaining parameter is γ. A value of γ ≥ 0 simply reflects the relative

importance of equity, measured by the second term, and overall cost, measured by the first. If γ is

zero, there is no concern for the distribution of costs. For large values of γ, we are increasingly

willing to accept a higher overall cost to society in order to achieve a more equitable burden.

Slesnick picks γ to be as large as possible while still satisfying the criterion that a Pareto


       7   See Chapter 3 of Bullen (2003)

                                                              17
improving policy raises welfare regardless of the distribution. As we show in the appendix, this

amounts to γ = 1 for W0. We require γ ≤ 1 to be consistent with the Pareto criterion but are

otherwise agnostic.


Prospect theory


        The welfare measure W0 in (1) can also be motivated by prospect theory. Kahneman and

Tversky (1979) argue that gains or losses are evaluated relative to a reference point and welfare

exhibits loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity. Consistent with prospect theory, Tversky and

Kahneman (1992) offer a value function for a gain or loss x with the power function form

v( x ) = x for x  0, and v( x ) = −(1 +  )( − x )  for x  0 , where   0,   0, and   0 implies

loss aversion.8

        Let us create an aggregate welfare function WPT reflecting the principles of prospect

theory, with underlying assumptions analogous to those in WS. Assume that     1 .9

Furthermore, the gain or loss is assessed relative to an individual reference point, ri , so x in the

value function is given by x = yi − ri where Δ𝑦𝑖 is again the income change for household i. We

write an aggregate welfare function, including individual reference points and loss aversion:




        8al-Nowaihi et al (2008) show that preference homogeneity in the presence of loss aversion then requires
𝛼 = 𝛽. Diminishing sensitivity would require 𝛼 ∈ (0,1), implying risk aversion over gains and risk seeking over
losses.
        9   This assumption implies that marginal utility is locally flat, allowing for straightforward aggregation.

where we have ordered individuals from greatest loss to greatest gain, i* is the last individual

order to simplify to the second line of (6), suppose the reference point is some notion of a fair

cost burden of a particular aggregate cost, ∑Δ𝑦𝑖 , so ∑𝑟𝑖 = ∑Δ𝑦𝑖 as before. With that assumption,

Replacing 𝛾 = 𝜆/2, this is the same expression as W0 in (1). Prospect theory leads to a more

generic notion of fair burden, ri, which is otherwise determined by equal utility change in the

Slesnick formulation. On the other hand, the Slesnick framework allows more easily the

incorporation of a more general notion of inequality aversion that can be sensitive to more

extreme deviations from the welfare-maximizing burden and motivates the alternative W1 in (2).

        Ultimately, using either the Slesnick or prospect theory approach requires assigning

values to what are at best subjective parameters of the social welfare function. These subjective

parameters include the degree of inequality aversion γ in (3) or loss aversion λ in (6), the notion

of utility curvature τ in (5) or fair burden 𝑟𝑖 in (6), and the aversion to extreme inequality ρ in (3).

        One approach is to assume values for some parameters in order to provide relatively

simple expressions, as we have done for ρ in (1) and (2) and partly for τ in (2). For others, such

as fair burden ri and inequality aversion γ, we leave them unspecified for the moment. We then

return to discuss these parameters as we present numerical welfare results and compare policies.

        A somewhat different approach is to use this discussion to recognize that the distribution

of Δ𝑦𝑖 by decile is generally what matters for welfare. We can then present this information

graphically and using summary statistics for various policy alternatives. The end user applies

their own judgement and values to draw conclusions, rather than trying to choose parameters.

        We now turn to a policy application to highlight these approaches.



Modeling household outcomes under different electricity sector policies

        To make our observations about horizontal equity applied to energy regulation concrete,

we consider a stylized example of alternative policies designed to achieve the same carbon

emission outcome in the electric power sector: cap-and-trade (CAT) and tradable performance

standards (TPS). This choice of policies is a particularly relevant question for stakeholders. Both

types of policies have been proposed for the electric power sector over the past decade (Waxman

2009; Bingaman 2012). The Clean Power Plan also provided states with options for both rate-


                                                      20
based and mass-based trading—in other words, tradable performance standards or cap-and-trade.

China is currently implementing a tradable performance standard in the power sector, even as

other countries have embraced cap-and- trade (Pizer and Zhang 2018).

       To construct our example, we first present a simple analytic model to highlight different

household outcomes under the two policies and to relate those outcomes to a small number of

parameters. We then use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and other sources to

quantify the household outcomes. Subsequently, we show how these effects look when viewed

through the lens of the welfare functions developed in the previous section.


Simple electricity sector model


       Our economic framework for comparing policies is a partial equilibrium model of the

power sector. On the demand side, we focus on the case of perfectly inelastic electricity demand

by each household. It may seem strange to abstract from notion of demand response, which

eliminates any aggregate cost advantage of CAT, the Pigouvian policy, over TPS in our simple

model. That is, the underlying point of the paper is that there is an equity-efficiency trade-off,

and here we assume there is no efficiency advantage of CAT.

       However, a necessary condition for an equity-efficiency trade-off is that equity effects

are large enough that TPS could be preferred. By focusing on the case of inelastic demand, we

focus on just how large the equity concern might be. Most importantly, fixing electricity demand

simplifies our exposition. Each household’s loss of real income equals its individual increase in

electricity costs minus its share of any allowance value rebated directly to households.

       On the supply side, we assume constant-returns-to-scale (CRS) technology with unit cost

determined by the carbon price. This allows us to capture the key features that concern us. On

                                                     21
the one hand, we want there to be an increase in the cost of electricity associated with a carbon

price under either TPS or CAT. On the other hand, we want to capture different electricity price

effects when the associated allowance value is either rebated in the electricity price under TPS or

assigned to households under CAT. These are the salient features of more complex models we

aspire to emulate, such as Burtraw and Palmer (2008).

       Formally, let pz be the electricity price, and pm be the allowance price. Let C0 be unit

production costs in the absence of regulation. Market-based regulation adds two components:

unit abatement costs (UAC) and unit emissions payments (UEP). If TAC is total abatement costs,

then UAC = TAC / Z , where Z is the (fixed) aggregate generation. Assuming cost minimization

over a CRS technology, marginal abatement costs (MAC) are equal to the price

( TAC / M = pm ). That is, we treat pollution like any other input that has to be purchased at

price pm and assume other input prices are fixed.

       Total emissions payments are TEP = pm M , where M is total emissions after responding

to the regulation. Similar to converting TAC to UAC, unit emissions payments are defined as

UEP = TEP / Z = pm ( M / Z ) . That is, UEP equal the emissions price multiplied by the average

emissions intensity per unit of generation. Since even freely allocated allowances have an

opportunity cost, this component of the unit cost increase occurs regardless of how permits are

allocated, and whether they arise under TPS or CAT. We refer to the emission payments

interchangeably as emission rents or allowance value.

       We see these cost components in Figure 1, where M0 is the emission level when pm = 0.

As the electricity sector begins to pay a positive price pm > 0 for their emissions, M, producers




                                                    22
will begin to reduce emissions by M0 – M. This incurs an abatement cost, the area under the

MAC schedule, highlighted by region TAC in the figure.

        Electricity producers also face a cost pm for emissions that occur, M, highlighted by

region TEP. We have drawn the figure for total generation, so we must scale the increase in total

production costs by 1/Z, the fixed total electricity demand, to relate to the change in unit costs of

electricity production.

        Notably, for all but very deep reduction targets, the size of the emissions rents is much

larger than the total abatement costs (TEP >> TAC). Thus, market-based policies create the

potential for large redistributions, based on the allocation of these rents.

        With CAT, the increase in electricity prices due to the regulation equals the sum of the

UAC and UEC:


                                                      23
                                        pzCAT = UAC + UEP


where the superscript CAT reflects the outcome under cap-and-trade. Allowance values are

allocated in lump-sum fashion, so their distribution does not affect behavior or electricity prices.

Let us assume that the total allowance value TEP is rebated to each household i based on an

assigned share si. That is, each household receives siTEP.

       A TPS sets a performance rate R (expressed in pollution / unit of electricity). Each unit of

generation is allocated allowances equal to this benchmark, R, and through trading an

equilibrium is reached where the overall average emissions intensity equals the performance rate,

or M / Z = R . Fixing total emissions to be the same under both policies, emission prices and

total emissions payments are as before (pm and TEP). However, under TPS this allowance value

is rebated as a subsidy to electricity production. At the unit level, this subsidy equals pmM/Z =

pmR = UEP. This subsidy is passed on to consumers and serves to mitigate the electricity price

increase:

                                     pzTPS = UAC + UEP − pm R
                                           = UAC

Here, the superscript TPS reflects the outcome under the tradable performance standard. That is,

the unit cost increase is driven only by the abatement cost, not the allowance rent.

       With this supply model, we can now turn to household outcomes. With households 𝑖 ∈

{1, … , 𝑁}, let Zi represent household i’s fixed electricity consumption such that Z =  i Z i . As

noted above, fixing this consumption implies that a household’s loss of real income equals the

increased cost of electricity minus any share of the allowance allocation. Under TPS this is given

by yiTPS = −UAC  Zi .


                                                     24
       Under a CAT, the real income change is given by yiCAT = − (UAC + UEP ) Z i + si  TEP ;

that is, the added cost of buying the fixed electricity demand Zi subtracted from the household’s

share of allowance value.

       The difference between the policy outcomes for household i thus depends on whether the

value of the household’s share of the allowance revenues exceeds its share of electricity

consumption: yiCAT − yiTPS = ( si  TEP − Zi  UEP) = ( si − Z i / Z )TEP. On net, both shares sum to

one, so ∑𝑖(𝑠𝑖 − 𝑍𝑖 /𝑍) = 0 and aggregate costs for both polices are given by

N y = i yi = −TAC .


       At this point, for expositional purposes, we fix si = 1/N; that is, equal per-household

rebates. This cap and dividend approach is consistently suggested in various carbon pricing

schemes (Inglis 2009; Larson 2015; Blumenauer 2017; Baker III et al. 2017). Nonetheless, we

return to this assumption at the very end of our analysis.

       Table 1 summarizes the household outcomes for each policy and how they relate to

summary cost parameters and data, with Z = Z / N as mean electricity consumption. Based on

our model and assumptions, the TPS distributes the abatement costs according to electricity

consumption shares, and the CAT policy adds a net emissions rent that is positive for households

with below-average electricity consumption. These are the key differences that we want to

capture. We now turn to the data that will allow us to quantify our earlier analytic results. In

particular, we need to approximate the distribution of 𝑍𝑖 /𝑍, which equals the household share of

total electricity expenditures in the population, and to choose the cost parameters TAC and TEP.


Household data and mitigation cost


       To provide a basis for likely variation in consumption of electricity and other

demographics necessary for the calculations in Table 1 and further discussion, we use US

consumer expenditure data. In particular, we turn to the 2014 Consumer Expenditure Survey, or

CEX (BLS 2014). This is a rolling, quarterly survey, where a representative sample of US

households enters each quarter and remains in the survey for five quarters. We compute the total

expenditure on electricity and total expenditures overall for the calendar year. We include only

survey respondents who participated for the entire year (1,086). That is, we first match

household respondents on their household identifier for each quarter of 2014 and keep only those

households observed for all four quarters. We sum reported expenditures on electricity over these

four quarters, as well as total expenditures.10 Table 2 summarizes the data. We also indicate the

notation we have been using that corresponds to each viable.

        From Table 1, we also need to specify the mitigation costs and rents, TAC and TEP.

Based on recent analysis (EIA 2009), a reasonable assumption is that cap-and-trade regulation on

carbon dioxide might raise electricity prices on the order of 10 percent. Based on other analysis

(Burtraw and Palmer 2008), a reasonable assumption is that the actual cost (without the

allowance revenue) is perhaps 10 percent of that (i.e., a 1 percent increase in electricity prices).

Thus we choose TAC = 0.01 times the electricity expenditure in the sample and TEP = 0.09

times total electricity expenditure. Given the summary statistics, where the mean electricity

expenditure (𝐶0 𝑍̅) was roughly $1,000 per household, we have TAC/N = $10 and TEP/N = $93.

With these data and parameters in hand, we now turn to our results.



Policy comparison and welfare measures

        We plug the CEX data on Zi and parameters TAC/N and TEP/N, all just discussed, into

the expressions in Table 1 for income effects by household. This yields distributions for Δ𝑦𝑖𝐶𝐴𝑇

and Δ𝑦𝑖𝑇𝑃𝑆 across households. Figure 2 presents these distributions graphically by decile using



        10  Total expenditures (TOTEXPPQ) include all outlays by households for goods and services as well as
contributions to pensions.

                                                           27
 Note: See Table 1. TAC/N = $10, TEP/N = $93, and the distribution of 𝑍𝑖 /𝑍̅ is as described in Table 2. Boxes

 Horizontal lines, or whiskers, show range of values outside the IQR, up to 1.5x the IQR. Dots indicate each
 individual values beyond whiskers. For normally distributed data, such dots should have a frequency of ~1%.

 (TPS), in dollars

box-and-whisker plots where CAT is red and TPS is blue and deciles are arranged from poorest

decile at the bottom to richest at the top. Two observations stand out. First, while the TPS

outcomes are all negative (consistent with Table 1), the CAT outcomes tend to be positive for

poorer households. Because poorer households have smaller electricity expenditures, the per

capita rebate under CAT leads to these positive welfare effects for the majority of households in

the lower half of the income distribution. Second, the range of outcomes is much larger within

each decile under CAT than TPS. For example, some households in even the poorest decile see

negative effects under CAT. Among the poorest four deciles roughly one-quarter remain worse

off.


                                                              28
        Note that most alternatives to a per capita rebate would vary the rebate by income. Such

policies would shift the box plots for each expenditure decile but not change the spread within

the decile—given the spread is unrelated to income. We return to the idea of alternative ways to

define the rebate later, but arguably none of these alternatives would fundamentally change the

distinction that CAT creates more within-decile variability than TPS.

        This observation reflects one of the key, practical points of this paper. While CAT

policies can generally achieve any desired cost distribution across income groups, including

positive outcomes, on average for the poorest, they cannot avoid significant variation. The range

of outcomes is inherently much larger under CAT than TPS because the rents TEP tend to be

much larger than the mitigation costs TAC, and because there is significant within-income-group

variation in household electricity use. Once rents enter electricity prices, this large, within-

income-group variation will be difficult to ameliorate.


Measuring welfare


        How might this variability translate into welfare considerations? We now turn to our

operational welfare measures, focusing mainly on the equity penalty term (recalling the first

welfare term equals TAC/N = –$10 for both policies). The equity penalty arises from the failure

of the actual distribution of household burden Δyi to match the notion of fair burden ri.

        Based on the welfare measures in (1) and (2), we first calculate a “total equity penalty.”

We focus on Slesnick’s definition (4) of fair burden 𝑟𝑖 = (𝑢̅′ /𝑢𝑖′ )Δ𝑦
                                                                     ̅̅̅̅. Using 𝑢′ (𝑦𝑖 ) = 𝑦𝑖−𝜏 as in

(5) leads to ri = ( yi0 / y ) y. As noted above, fair burden will rise as a share of income at higher
                          




income levels when τ > 1 (and the reverse when τ < 1).

Figure 3. Effect of varying power utility parameter τ on equity penalty.


        We noted that one of the useful features of our welfare definitions (1) and (2) is that they

allow a decomposition into horizontal and vertical equity effects. In addition to the total equity

penalty, we also compute the “HE penalty” that arises when we substitute a reference point equal

to the average burden in each household’s income decile 𝑟𝑖 = Δ𝑦
                                                             ̅̅̅̅𝑑(𝑖) , where d(i) identifies that

decile (e.g., d maps individuals {1,…, N} into deciles {1,…,10}).

        Figure 3 first looks at how the equity penalty varies with fair burden as defined by τ. The

solid lines in the figure show the total equity penalty and dashed lines show the HE penalty.

Values of the both penalties appear along the vertical axis for CAT (red) and TPS (blue) policies


                                                          30
with values of τ indicated along the horizontal axis. The left panel shows W0 and the right panel

W1. Note that the HE penalty does not vary with τ, having replaced the expression of ri that

depends on τ.

        We make three observations. First, the penalties are uniformly larger for W1 (right

panel) than W0 (left panel) As noted earlier, these two welfare measures can be derived as

specific cases (ρ = 0 and ρ = 1) of the Slesnick welfare function (3). The parameter ρ determines

defines the extent to which the penalty tends to the average absolute deviation versus the more

extreme absolute deviations, with higher values of ρ putting more weight on more extreme

values. Thus. it should not be surprising that, by assuming a larger ρ, W1 yields larger equity

penalties.

       Second, the total equity penalty varies with τ reaching a minimum in both the left and

right panels at τ ~ 0.5 for the TPS and τ ~ 2 for the CAT. The reflects the idea that there is a

value of τ where the fair burden over initial income levels, determined by τ, most closely

matches each policy’s actual distribution of average outcomes. At that value of τ the penalty is

minimized.

       Finally, the CAT penalty is much higher than the TPS penalty. The welfare difference,

~$50 per household for W0 and ~$80 for W1, is large compared to the average cost (ignoring

equity) of $10 given by TAC/N. This difference is clearly driven by the HE component, as the

dashed lines account for most of the difference between CAT and TPS.

       This is the other key, practical point of this paper. The variation of policy impacts within

income groups can be large under Pigouvian pricing. That variation translates into larger,

negative horizontal equity impacts for Pigouvian versus non-Pigouvian policies. Depending on



                                                     31
the weight given to these impacts (e.g., the parameter γ in (1) and (2)), it appears large enough to

overwhelm some differences in efficiency (e.g., differences in Δ𝑦
                                                               ̅̅̅̅).


       Despite its usefulness, missing from Figure 3 is an understanding of how different deciles

contribute to the equity penalty. Is the penalty, particularly the horizontal component, more

sensitive to variation in the rich or poor? We answer that question in Table 3. We present the

same information as in Figure 3 broken down by decile, for a single value of τ = 1 (log utility).

That is, eight columns (5-8 and 11-14) in Table 3 take the values reported by the 8 lines in Figure

3 for τ = 1, reproduces them in the last row, and then breaks them down by income decile in the

remainder of the table.

       The breakdown by deciles shows that poorer deciles contribute more to the equity penalty

under W1 versus W0. Looking at each policy-total equity and policy-HE combination, the

penalties uniformly decline moving from W0 to W1 for the richest decile but increase for the

poorest. E.g., horizontal equity for CAT declines from $83 to $59 for the richest decile and

increases from $27 to $84 for the poorest. This may seem counter-intuitive. The range of dollar

values is actually largest for the richest decile in Figure 2. Indeed, looking at the standard

deviation of burden by decile, reported in columns 4 and 10, we see the largest values for the

richest deciles. As discussed previously, the equity penalty in W1 is generally larger than the

penalty in W0 because it puts more weight on extreme deviations and the richest decile has the

largest deviations.

leads us to down-weight rich households (where shares have a larger denominator) and up-

weight poorer ones (where shares have a smaller denominator) based on (𝑦̅/𝑦𝑖0 ). Usefully, the

difference between the standard deviation by decile reported in columns 4 and 10 versus the

exact HE calculation in columns 9 and 14 is largely a factor of (𝑦̅/𝑦

A more general approach to horizontal equity


       We have discussed our results in terms of the welfare measures W0 and W1. However,

stakeholders may understandably be hesitant to embrace the ethical judgements of economists

embedded in W0 and W1. This includes the choice of ρ in (3) and τ in (5), as well as the general

“black box” nature of the calculations.

       Conveniently, all of the information necessary to make welfare judgements is contained

in Figure 2 and columns 3-4, 6, 9-10, and 12 in Table 3. Both provide information about

outcomes by decile, including the central tendency and measures of spread, for each policy.

Stakeholders can decide for themselves how much to weight deviations within deciles

(horizontal equity) as well as how to value the central tendency of each decile (vertical equity)

versus some objective. They need not buy into our particular assumptions embedded in W0 and

W1. At the same time, the information is arguably consistent with the use of a welfare approach.

       We view this approach as similar to the use of Lorenz curves. Lorenz curves represent

simple a simple summary of income inequality as well as defining a specific welfare measure.

However, stakeholders can use Lorenz curves to understand inequality within society, and to

                                                     34
make policy choices among alternatives, without necesssarily using the particular welfare

measure or adopting its particular ranking of outcomes.


Could CAT do better with more targeted rebates


         In our stylized comparison of CAT and TPS, we have suggested that CAT can have a

higher equity penalty when we consider horizontal inequality. This stems from the fact that there

is considerable within-income-group variation in electricity use, and CATs higher impact on the

electricity price. Lurking in this result is an assumption that we cannot fix these unequal effects

after the fact, with targeted rebates that address this heterogeneity.

         But could we? To what extent might we improve income-based redistribution and move

towards targeted, within-income-group rebates? We know that electricity expenditures vary with

household size and location, among other observed variables. How well can we predict

electricity expenditures, controlling for income?

         We explored this question by taking our data from the CEX and trying to predict logged

electricity expenditures. More precisely, we took all of the household characteristics contained in

the CEX interview survey, converting categorical variables to indicators, and replacing missing

geographic identifiers with zeros.11 This resulted in a set of 133 variables. With this enhanced

data set, we had 879 complete observations (of 1,036 original observations). We then used the

LASSO algorithm with cross-validation to choose the best predictive model that is robust to

concerns about multiple hypothesis tests (James et al. 2013). We found 35 variables, including



         11This includes all variables listed as “Consumer Unit (CU) Characteristics” in the data dictionary. For
many observations, geographic identifiers are omitted to protect confidentiality in the public-use data sets. For our
purposes, available identifiers (e.g., 0/1 variables for particular states or PSUs) can be useful predictors and missing
values simply become a reference group where we do not know the location.

                                                               35

total expenditures, useful in predicting electricity use.12 Most of these are geographic of family

composition indicators. However, all of these variables together predict about half of total

variation in electricity use (R-squared of 0.56), leaving considerable residual variation.13

         We present these results graphically in Figure 4. As in Figure 2, we use box-and-whisker

plots to show the variability within expenditure deciles but here the horizontal axis expenditure



         12  This includes 19 geographic identifiers (2 regional indicators, 9 state indicators, and 8 PSU indicators), 6
income variables (log expenditures, 2 rank variables, INC_RANK and ERANKHM, and 3 income category
indicators), 4 family size and age variables (family size, 1 indicator for all children >17 years, 2 family type
indicators), and 6 variables describing the housing location (2 population size indicators, a rural-urban indicator, and
2 indicators of housing tenure).
         13   Total expenditures alone predict 28%. These other 35 variables roughly double the predictive power.

                                                               36
share rather than dollar expenditures. Red boxes are the raw data and blue boxes are the residual

variation after using these 35 variables to predict electricity expenditures. Visually, considerable

variation remains (incrementally, income alone explains 28% of the variation).

        While suggestive, this is still not a complete picture. The government will have

considerable more information about individuals. For example, they may have more finely tuned

geographic identifiers.14 Such data may allow more precise targeting of rebates. However, we

suspect considerable variation will remain, based on variation in housing age, design, etc., unless

one is willing to turn to historic electricity use. And at some point, an increasingly complex

scheme may become impractical.



Conclusion

        Our principal motivation has been to highlight that Pigouvian policies in the energy

sector may have large and often overlooked distributional consequences. In particular, they tend

to raise energy prices and lead to greater variation in household-level effects within income

groups. These consequences are difficult to remedy through typical redistribution schemes. Other

policies to reduce pollution can have smaller effects on energy prices, and hence smaller

distributional consequences, even as they have higher aggregate costs to society.

        Should this variation in household costs within income groups matter? Traditional

welfare notions tend to focus on overall costs to society. Distributional effects matter to the

extent that they change the underlying income distribution and make it more or less equitable.

That is, transfers from rich to poor are welfare-improving given any level of overall costs. In this



        14  We observe state or primary sampling unit for 88% of our sample. Nonetheless, many states (e.g.,
California) have a wide range of climate zones.

paper, we have highlighted the notion of fair burden as an alternative to traditional welfare

notions. Fair burden emphasizes how the cost of a public good should be shared across

households, treating those with similar income (and other characteristics) similarly, without an

implicit welfare reward for redistribution from rich to poor. Generally, we would expect a

regulation to entail a non-negative burden for all households. As fair burden regards even-handed

changes, the approach does place special emphasis on the pre-regulation distribution of income

as the primary basis for assigning burden. We have shown how to operationalize this approach

by positing welfare measures based on Slesnick (1989) and prospect theory (Kahneman and

Tversky 1979). Both theories lead to a penalty based on how household income changes deviate

from fair burden or another reference point, incorporating both horizontal and vertical equity.

       We made these ideas concrete through the stylized comparison of two policy options that

have been proposed to address carbon dioxide emissions in the electricity sector—cap-and-trade

with equal per-household rebates (CAT) and tradable performance standards (TPS). CAT indeed

leads to much wider variation in income changes across all income groups. Applying our

welfare measure, we found that the associated CAT equity penalty is several times that of the

TPS and potentially larger than efficiency advantages (about which we only speculate). A

lingering question is whether more targeted rebates under CAT could ameliorate the otherwise

large variation in income changes that underlies the penalty. Turning to available data, the

answer appears to be no.

       Our welfare measure does not tell us how much to weight the equity penalty versus

concerns about efficiency, a question of ethical and societal preferences. Such measures can also

appear to be a “black box” to stakeholders, making them unappealing. For these reasons, we

also emphasize practical and intuitive ways to present the relevant data that drives our welfare


                                                    38
measures, including tables and figures describing the distribution of outcomes by decile. This

approach is analogous to the use of Lorenz curves to describe the income inequality associated

with traditional welfare notions. By making the relevant outcomes easy to understand,

stakeholders can draw their own conclusions directly, and largely consistent with our welfare

measures.

       Given the oft-apparent disconnect between economists promoting Pigouvian policies and

policymakers choosing non-Pigouvian alternatives, this paper raises an interesting possibility.

Perhaps horizontal equity and distributional effects are something that policymakers have

recognized for some time, and that only economic analysis has tended to overlook.

Appendix: Simplifying Slesnick to produce our welfare measures

        With our choice of ai to be Negishi weights, the result that Δ𝑢         ̅̅̅̅, and the local
                                                                     ̅̅̅̅ = 𝑢̅′ Δ𝑦

approximation Δ𝑢𝑖 = 𝑢𝑖′ Δ𝑦𝑖 , we can rewrite Equation (3) as

                                                                                          1
                                                    −1                                   1+𝜌
                                                𝑢𝑖′
                              ̅̅̅̅ −
                     𝑊𝑠 = 𝑢̅′ Δ𝑦       𝛾 (𝑁 ∑ ( ′ ) |𝑢𝑖′ Δ𝑦𝑖
                                           −1                               ̅̅̅̅|1+𝜌 )
                                                                      − 𝑢̅′ Δ𝑦
                                                𝑢̅
                                              𝑖


Rearranging slightly:

                                                                                           1
                                                 𝜌                                        1+𝜌
                                             𝑢𝑖′
                           ̅̅̅̅ −
                 𝑊𝑠 = 𝑢̅′ (Δ𝑦           −1
                                    𝛾 (𝑁 ∑ ( ′ )           |Δ𝑦𝑖 − (𝑢𝑖′ )−1 𝑢̅′ ̅̅̅̅
                                                                               Δ𝑦|1+𝜌 )         )
                                             𝑢̅
                                           𝑖



Defining 𝑟𝑖 = (𝑢𝑖′ )−1 𝑢̅′ ̅̅̅̅
                           Δ𝑦, for ρ = 0 we then have


                                     ̅̅̅̅ − 𝛾𝑁 −1 ∑|Δ𝑦𝑖 − 𝑟𝑖 |) = 𝑢̅′ 𝑊0
                           𝑊𝑠 = 𝑢̅′ (Δ𝑦
                                                       𝑖


Further, assuming 𝑢(𝑦𝑖0 ) = ln(𝑦𝑖0 ) and 𝑟𝑖 = (𝑢𝑖′ )−1 𝑢̅′ ̅̅̅̅          ̅̅̅̅ , for ρ = 1 we then have
                                                           Δ𝑦 = (𝑦𝑖0 /𝑦̅)Δ𝑦


                                                           𝑦̅
                                  ̅̅̅̅ − 𝛾√𝑁 −1 ∑
                        𝑊𝑠 = 𝑢̅′ (Δ𝑦                           (Δ𝑦𝑖 − 𝑟𝑖 )2 ) = 𝑢̅′ 𝑊1
                                                           𝑦𝑖0
                                                   𝑖



We note that

                                    𝑑𝑊0  1   1
                                        = − 𝛾 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(Δ𝑦𝑖 − 𝑟𝑖 )
                                    𝑑Δ𝑦𝑖 𝑁   𝑁

This will be non-negative so long as γ ≤ 1.
