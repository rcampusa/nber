Risk Preferences and The Macro Announcement Premium

                                         ABSTRACT

The paper develops a theory for equity premium around macroeconomic announcements. Stock
returns realized around pre-scheduled macroeconomic announcements, such as the employment
report and the FOMC statements, account for 55% of the market equity premium during the
1961-2014 period, and virtually 100% of it during the later period of 1997-2014, where more
announcement data are available. We provide a characterization theorem for the set of
intertemporal preferences that generate a positive announcement premium. Our theory establishes
that the announcement premium identifies a significant deviation from expected utility and
constitutes an asset market based evidence for a large class of non-expected models that features
aversion to ”Knightian uncertainty”, for example, Gilboa and Schmeidler [30]. We also present a
dynamic model to account for the evolution of equity premium around macroeconomic
announcements.

1    Introduction
In this paper, we develop a theory of equity premium for pre-scheduled macroeconomic
announcements. We demonstrate that the macro announcement premium provides an asset-
market-based evidence that highlights the importance of incorporating non-expected utility
analysis in quantitative macro and asset pricing models.
    Macro announcements, such as the publication of the employment report and the
FOMC statements, resolve uncertainty about the future course of economic growth, and
modern financial markets allow asset prices to react to these announcements instantaneously,
especially with high-frequency trading. Empirically, a large fraction of the market equity
premium in the United States is realized within a small number of trading days with
significant macroeconomic announcements. During the period of 1961-2014, for example,
the cumulative excess returns of the S&P 500 index on the thirty days per year with
significant macroeconomic news announcements averaged 3.36%, which accounts for 55%
of the total annual equity premium during this period (6.19%). The market return realized
on announcement days constitutes 100% of the equity premium during the later period of
1997-2014, which more announcements are available.
   To understand the above features of financial markets, we develop a theoretical model
that allows uncertainty to resolve before the realizations of macroeconomic shocks and
characterize the set of intermporal preferences for the representative consumer under which
an announcement premium arises.
   Our main result is that resolutions of uncertainty are associated with realizations of
equity premium if and only if the investor’s intertemporal preference can be represented
by a certainty equivalence functional that increases with respect to second-order stochastic
dominance, a property we define as generalized risk sensitivity. The above theorem has
two immediate implications. First, the intertemporal preference has an expected utility
representation if and only if the announcement premium is zero for all assets. Second,
announcement premia can only be compensation for generalized risk sensitivity and cannot
be compensation for the risk aversion of the Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function.
    Therefore, the macro announcement premium provides an asset-market-based evidence
that identifies a key aspect of investors’ preferences not captured by expected utility analysis:
generalized risk sensitivity. Many non-expected utility models in the literature satisfy this
property. For example, we show that the uncertainty aversion axiom of Gilboa and Schmeidler
[30] provides a sufficient condition for generalized risk sensitivity. Therefore, the large
magnitude of the announcement premium in the data can be interpreted as a strong empirical
evidence for a broad class of non-expected utility models.


                                               1
    From an asset pricing perspective, the stochastic discount factor under non-expected
utility generally has two components: the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution that
appears in standard expected utility models and an additional term that can be interpreted
as the density of a probability distortion. We demonstrate that the probability distortion is a
valid stochastic discount factor for announcement returns. In addition, under differentiability
conditions, generalized risk sensitivity is equivalent to the probability distortion being
pessimistic, that is, it assigns higher weights to states with low continuation utility and
lower weights to states with high continuation utility. Our results imply that the empirical
evidence on the announcement premium is informative about the relative importance of the
two components of the stochastic discount factor and therefore provides a strong discipline
for asset pricing models.
   We present a continuous-time model with learning to quantitatively account for the
evolution of the equity premium before, at, and after macroeconomic announcements. In
our model, investors update their beliefs about hidden state variables that govern the
dynamics of aggregate consumption based both on their observations of the realizations
of consumption and on pre-scheduled macroeconomic announcements. We establish two
results in this environment. First, as in Breeden [12], because consumption follows a
continuous-time diffusion process, the equity premium investors receive in periods without
news announcements is proportional to the length of the holding period of the asset. At
the same time, macro announcements result in non-trivial reductions of uncertainty, and are
associated with realizations of a substantial amount of equity premium in an infinitesimally
small window of time.
    Second, the equity premium typically increases before macro announcements, peaks at
the announcements, and drops sharply afterwards. The reduction in uncertainty right after
announcements implies a simultaneous decline in the equity premium going forward. At the
same time, after the current news announcement and before the next news announcement,
because investors do not observe the movement in the hidden state variable, uncertainty
slowly builds up over time, and so does the equity premium.


    Related literature Our paper builds on the literature that studies decision making
under non-expected utility. We adopt the general representation of dynamic preferences of
Strzalecki [65]. Our framework includes most of the non-expected utility models in the
literature as special cases. We show that examples of dynamic preferences that satisfy
generalized risk sensitivity include the maxmin expected utility of Gilboa and Schmeidler
[30], the dynamic version of which is studied by Chen and Epstein [16] and Epstein and
Schneider [25]; the recursive preference of Kreps and Porteus [48] and Epstein and Zin [27]; the
robust control preference of Hansen and Sargent [36, 37] and the related multiplier preference

                                               2
of Strzalecki [64]; the variational ambiguity-averse preference of Maccheroni, Marinacci, and
Rustichini [54, 55]; the smooth ambiguity model of Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji [46, 47];
and the disappointment aversion preference of Gul [31]. We also discuss the relationship
between our notion of generalized risk sensitivity and related decision theoretic concepts
studied in the above papers, for example, uncertainty aversion and preference for early
resolution of uncertainty.
    A vast literature applies the above non-expected utility models to the study of asset prices
and the equity premium. We refer the readers to Epstein and Schneider [26] for a review
of asset pricing studies with the maxmin expected utility model, Ju and Miao [40] for an
application of the smooth ambiguity-averse preference, Hansen and Sargent [34] for the robust
control preference, Routledge and Zin [62] for an asset pricing model with disappointment
aversion, and Bansal and Yaron [9] and Bansal [6] for the long-run risk models that build
on recursive preferences. The nonlinearity of the certainty equivalence functionals in the
above models typically gives rise to an additional equity premium. However, the existing
literature has not yet identified an asset-market-based evidence for the nonlinearity of the
certainty equivalence functionals in the above models. Our results imply that the macro
announcement premium provides such an evidence.
    Our findings are consistent with the literature that identifies large variations in marginal
utilities from the asset market data, for example, Hansen and Jagannathan [33], Bansal and
Lehmann [7], and Alvarez and Jermann [3, 4]. Our theory implies that quantitatively, most
of the variations in marginal utility must come from generalized risk sensitivity and not from
risk aversion in expected utility models.
    The above observation is likely to have sharp implications on the research on
macroeconomic policies. Several recent papers study optimal policy design problems in
non-expected utility models. For example, Farhi and Werning [29] and Karantounias [43]
analyze optimal fiscal policies with recursive preferences, and Woodford [68], Karantounias
[42], Hansen and Sargent [38], and Kwon and Miao [51, 50] focus on preferences that fear
model uncertainty. In the above studies, the nonlinearity in agents’ certainty equivalence
functionals implies a forward-looking component of variations in their marginal utilities
that affects policy makers’ objectives. Our results imply that the empirical evidence of the
announcement premium can be used to gauge the magnitude of this deviation from expected
utility, and to quantify the importance of robustness in the design of macroeconomic policies.
    Our empirical results are related to the previous research on stock market returns on
macroeconomic announcement days. The previous literature documents that stock market
returns and Sharpe ratios are significantly higher on days with macroeconomic news releases
in the United States (Savor and Wilson [63]) and internationally (Brusa, Savor, and Wilson


                                               3
[13]). Lucca and Moench [52] find similar patterns for equity returns on pre-scheduled FOMC
announcement days. Cieslak, Morse, and Vissing-Jorgensen [18] provide an extensive study
of the cyclical pattern of stock returns around FOMC announcements. Rosoiu [60] finds
similar patterns in high-frequency data.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We document some stylized facts for the
equity premium for macroeconomic announcements in Section 2. In Section 3, we present
two simple examples to illustrate how the announcement premium can arise in models that
deviate from expected utility. We present our theoretical results and discuss the notion of
generalized risk sensitivity in Section 4. We present a continuous-time model in Section 5 to
quantitatively account for the evolution of the equity premium around macroeconomic news
announcement days. Section 6 concludes.



2     Stylized facts
To demonstrate the significance of the equity premium for macro-announcements and to
highlight the difference between announcement days and non-announcement days, we focus
on a relatively small set of pre-scheduled macroeconomic announcements that is released at
the monthly or lower frequency. Within this category, we select the top five announcements
ranked by investor attention by Bloomberg users. This procedure yields on average fifty
announcement days per year in the 1997-2014 period, where data on all five announcements
are available, and thirty announcement days per year in the longer sample period of 1961-
2014. We summarize our main findings below and provide details of data construction in the
data appendix.

    1. A large fraction of the market equity premium are realized on a relatively small number
       of trading days with pre-scheduled macroeconomic news announcements (See also Savor
       and Wilson [63] and Lucca and Moench [52]).
      As shown in Table 1, during the 1961-2014 period, on average, thirty trading days
      per year have significant macroeconomic news announcements. The cumulative stock
      market excess return on the thirty news announcement days averages 3.36% per year,
      accounting for about 55% of the annual equity premium (6.19%) during this period.
      This pattern is even more pronounced if we focus on the later period of 1997-2014,
      where data on on all five announcements are available. In this period, the market
      equity premium is 7.44% per year, and the cumulative excess return of the S&P500
      index on the fifty announcement days averages 8.24% per year. The equity premium
      on the rest of the trading days is not statistically different from zero.

Figure 1 plots the average returns over 30 minute intervals around macro announcements, where time 0 is the
announcement time. The solid line is the average return for all five announcements and the dashed line plots
the average return for all announcements except the FOMC announcement. The sample period is 1997-2013.


   2. The equity premium increases before news announcements,                                                                                           peaks at the
      announcements, and immediately drops afterwards.
      In Table 2, we document the average daily excess stock market return on announcement
      days (t), that on the days right before announcements (t − 1) and that on the day right
      after announcements (t + 1). The average announcement day return is 11.21 basis
      points during the entire sample period (top panel) and 16.48 basis points during the
      later period of 1997-2014, when more announcement data are available. The daily
      equity premium before and after announcement days is not statistically different from
      zero. In Figure 1, we illustrate the pattern of the evolution of market excess return in
      thirty-minute intervals around macro announcements by using high-frequency data for
      S&P 500 futures contracts during the period of 1997-2014. This evidence highlights
      that most of the announcement premium is realized during a short time interval around
      announcements.

   3. The significance of the macro announcement premium is robust both intraday and
      overnight.
      Some announcements are pre-scheduled during financial market trading hours (e.g.,
      FOMC announcements) and others are pre-scheduled prior to the opening of financial
      markets (e.g., non-farm payrolls). We define intraday return (or open-to-close return) as
      the stock market return from the open to the close of a trading day and overnight return
      (or close-to-open return) as the return from the close of a trading day to the open of
      the next trading day. We compute intraday and overnight returns for periods with and
      without prescheduled announcements and report our findings in Table 3. The average


                                                                                          5
        overnight return during the 1997-2014 period averages about 3.52 basis points per day,
        and the average intraday return is close to zero1 . Remarkably, both intraday and
        overnight return are significantly larger on pre-scheduled announcements days than on
        non-announcements days. The average intraday return with announcement is 17.0 basis
        points, and the average overnight return with announcement is 9.32 basis points, while
        the average intraday and overnight return on non-announcement are not statistically
        different from zero. This new evidence reinforces the view that most of the equity
        premium realizes during periods of macroeconomic announcements.



3       Two illustrative examples
In this section, we set up a two-period model and discuss two simple examples to illustrate
conditions under which resolutions of uncertainty are associated with realizations of the
equity premium.


3.1      A two-period model

We consider a representative-agent economy with two periods (or dates), 0 and 1. There is no
uncertainty in period 0, and the period-0 aggregate endowment is a constant, C0 . Aggregate
endowment in period 1, denoted C1 , is a random variable. We assume a finite number of
states: n = 1, 2, · · · N , and denote the possible realizations of C1 as {C1 (n)}n=1,2,···N . The
probability of each state is π (n) > 0 for n = 1, 2, · · · , N.
    Period 0 is further divided into two subperiods. In period 0− , before any information
about about C1 is revealed, the pre-announcement asset market opens, and a full set of
Arrow-Debreu security is traded. The asset prices at this point are called pre-announcement
prices and are denoted as P − . Note that P − cannot depend on the realization of C1 , which
is not known at this point.
    In period 0+ , the agent receives a news announcement s that carries information about
C1 . Immediately after the arrival of s, the post-announcement asset market opens. Asset
prices at this point, which are called post-announcement prices, depend on s and are denoted
as P + (s). In period 1, the payoff of the Arrow-Debreu securities are realized and C1 is
consumed. In Figure 2, we illustrate the timing of information and consumption (top panel)
and that of the asset markets (panel) assuming that N = 2 and that the news announcement
s fully reveals C1 .
    1
    The previous literature (for example, Kelly and Clark [45] and Polk, Lou, and Skouras [58]) documents
that the overnight market return is on average higher than the intraday return in the United States.


                                                   6
            Figure 2: consumption and asset prices in the two-period model




    The announcement return of an asset, which we denote as RA (s), is defined as the
return of a strategy that buy the asset before the pre-scheduled announcement and sell
right afterwards:
                                                P + (s)
                                       RA (s) =         .                                  (1)
                                                  P−
We say that the asset requires a positive announcement premium if E [RA (s)] > 1. We also
define the post-announcement return conditioning on announcement s as: RP (X| s) = P +X(s) .
Clearly, the total return of asset from period 0− to period 1 is R (X) = RA (s) RP ( X| s) .
    We note two important properties of the news announcement in our model. First, it
affects the conditional distribution of future consumption, but rational expectations imply
that surprises in news must average to zero by the law of iterated expectation. Second, news
announcements do not impact the current-period consumption. Empirically, as we show in
Section 2, the stock market returns realized within the 30-minute intervals of announcements
account for almost all of the equity premium at the annual level. The instantaneous response
of consumption to news at this high frequency can hardly have any quantitative effect on the
total consumption of the year.2 Furthermore, our analysis remains valid in the continuous-
time model presented in Section 5, where the length of a period is infinitesimal.
  2
   Our assumption is broadly consistent with the empirical evidence that large movements in the stock
market is typically not associated with significant immediate adjustment in aggregate consumption, for
example, Bansal and Shaliastovich [8].




                                                  7
3.2    Expected utility

We first consider the case in which the representative agent has expected utility: u (C0 ) +
βE [u (C1 )], where u is strictly increasing and continuously differentiable. For simplicity, we
assume that s fully reveals C1 in this example and the one in the following section, although
our general result in Section 3.3 does not depend on this assumption. The pre-announcement
price of an asset with payoff X is given by:
                                                         
                                        −      βu′ (C1 )
                                    P       =E           X .                                        (2)
                                               u′ (C0 )

In period 0+ , because s full reveals the true state, the agent’s preference is represented by

                                     u (C0 ) + βu (C1 (s)) .                                        (3)

Therefore, for any s, the post-announcement price of the asset is

                                              βu′ (C1 (s))
                                 P + (s) =                 X (s) .                                  (4)
                                                u′ (C0 )

                                                                     E [P + (s)]
Clearly, the expected announcement return is E [RA (s)] =               P−
                                                                                   = 1. There can be no
announcement premium on any asset under expected utility.


3.3    An example with uncertainty aversion

Consider an agent with the constraint robust control preferences of Hansen and Sargent [35]:

                                  u (C0 ) + β min E [mu (C1 )]                                      (5)
                                                   m

                                 subject to : E [m ln m] ≤ η
                                                   E [m] = 1.

The above expression also can be interpreted as the maxmin expected utility of Gilboa and
Schmeidler [30]. The agent treats the reference probability measure, under which equity
premium is evaluated (by econometricians), as an approximation. As a result, the agent
takes into account a class of alternative probability measures, represented by the density m
close to the reference probability measure. The inequality E [m ln m] ≤ η requires that the
relative entropy of the alternative probability models to be less than η.




                                                   8
   In this case, the pre-announcement price of an asset with payoff X is:
                                                                   
                                       −              βu′ (C1 )
                                   P       =E       m∗ ′        X       ,                    (6)
                                                       u (C0 )

where m∗ is the density of the minimizing probability for (5) and can be expressed as a
function of s:                               u(C1 (s))
                                   ∗       e− θ
                                 m (s) = h u(C1 ) i .                               (7)
                                          E e− θ

The positive constant in the above expression, θ is determined by the binding relative entropy
constraint E [m∗ ln m∗ ] = η.
   In period 0+ , after the resolution of uncertainty, the agent’s utility reduces to (3). As a
result, the post-announcement price of the asset is the same as that in (4). Therefore, we
can write the pre-announcement price as:

                                   P − = E m∗ (s) P + (s) .
                                                        
                                                                                             (8)

Because m∗ is a decreasing function of date-1 utility u (C1 ), it is straightforward to prove the
following claim.

Claim 1. Suppose that the post-announcement price, P + (s), is a strictly increasing function
of C1 , then P − < E [P + (s)]. As a result, the announcement premium for the asset is strictly
positive.

   The intuition of the above result is clear. Because uncertainty is resolved after the
announcement, asset prices are discounted using marginal utilities. Under expected utility,
the pre-announcement price is computed using probability-weighted marginal utilities, and
therefore the pre-announcement price must equal the expected post-announcement prices
and there can be no announcement premium under rational expectation. Under the robust
control preference, the pre-announcement price is not computed by using the reference
probability, but rather by using the pessimistic probability that overweighs low-utility states
and underweighs high-utility states as shown in equation (7). As a result, uncertainty aversion
applies an extra discounting for payoffs positively correlated with utility, and therefore the
asset market requires a premium for such payoffs relative to risk-free returns.
   Because the probability distortion m∗ discounts announcement returns, we will call it
the announcement stochastic discount factor (SDF), or A-SDF to distinguish it from the
standard SDF in intertemporal asset pricing models which are derived from agents’ marginal
rate of intertemporal substitution of consumption. In our model, there is no intertemporal
consumption decision before and after the announcement. The term m∗ reflects investors’

                                                      9
uncertainty aversion and identifies the probability distortion relative to rational expectation.



4     Risk preferences and the announcement premium
The asset pricing equation (8) holds under much more general conditions. In this section, we
consider a very general class of intertemporal preferences that has the recursive representation

                                         Vt = u (Ct ) + βI [Vt+1 ] ,                                        (9)

where β ∈ (0, 1) and I is the certainty equivalence functional that maps the next-period
utility (which is a random variable) into its certainty equivalent (which is a real number).
We assume that I is normalized and weakly increasing in first-order stochastic dominance.3
As shown by Strzalecki [65], representation (9) includes most of the dynamic preferences
under uncertainty proposed in the literature.4 Our main focus is to characterize the set
of preferences under which the announcement premium is non-negative for payoffs that are
increasing functions of continuation utility.


4.1     The announcement SDF

We continue to focus on the two-period model assuming i) a finite state space, ii) fully
revealing announcements, and iii) equal probability of each state, that is, π (s) = N1 for
s = 1, 2, · · · , N. Although none of the above assumptions are neccessary for our main
theorem, they allow us to avoid cumbersome notations and illustrate the basic intuition for
our results. We present and prove our general theorems without the above assumptions in a
fully dynamic setup in Appendix C.
    In the two-period model, because the signal s fully reveals the state of the world, C1,s
is known at announcement. Because I is normalized and Vs is known after receiving
announcement s, the agent’s post-announcement utility can be written as: Vs = u (C0 ) +
βu (C1,s ). With a finite number of states, the certainty equivalence functional I can be viewed
   3
     A certainty equivalence functional I is normalized if I [k] = k whenever k is a constant. It is weakly
increasing in first-order stochastic dominance if I [X1 ] ≥ I [X2 ] whenever X1 first-order stochastic dominates
X2 . See Appendix C for details.
   4
     As Strzalecki [65] shows, this representation includes the maxmin expected utility of Gilboa and
Schmeidler [30], the second-order expected utility of Ergin and Gul [28], the smooth ambiguity preferences of
Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji [46], the variational preferences of Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Rustichini
[54], the multiplier preferences of Hansen and Sargent [34] and Strzalecki [64], and the confidence preferences
of Chateauneuf and Faro [15]. In addition, our setup is more general than that of Strzalecki [65], because we
do not require the function u (·) to be affine. In Appendix B, we provide expressions for the A-SDF for the
above-mentioned decision models.


                                                      10
as a function from RN to R. We use the vector notation and denote the agent’s utility at
time 0− as I [V ], where V = [V1 , V2 , · · · , VN ]. Assuming I is differentiable, from date 0−
perspective, the agent’s marginal utility with respect to C0 is

                                      ∂           XN ∂
                                         I [V ] =          I [V ] · u′ (C0 ) ,
                                     ∂C0           s=1 ∂Vs


and the marginal utility with respect to C1,s is

                                       ∂              ∂
                                            I [V ] =     I [V ] · βu′ (C1,s ) .
                                      ∂C1,s          ∂Vs

Because the pre-announcement price of an asset can be computed as the marginal utility
weighted payoffs, we can write

                                  N     ∂
                                  X   ∂C1,s

where
                                                            ∂

                                                                 s


At time 0+ , s fully reveals the state, and P + (s) is, again, given by equation (4). Clearly,
the asset pricing equation (8) holds with the A-SDF m∗ defined by (11). We summarize our
results for the existence of A-SDF as follows.

Theorem 1. (Existence of A-SDF)
    Assume that both u and I are continuously differentiable with strictly positive (partial)
derivatives. Assume also that I is normalized.5 Then in any competitive equilibrium, there
exists a strictly positive m∗ = {m∗ (s)}s=1,2,··· ,N such that

  1. m∗ is a density, that is, E [m∗ ] = 1, and

  2. for all announcement returns RA (s),

                                                 E [m∗ (s) RA (s)] = 1.                          (12)


    To provide a precise statement about the sign of the announcement premium, we
focus our attention on payoffs that are co-monotone with continuation utility. We
define an announcement-contingent payoff f to be co-monotone with continuation utility if
[f (s) − f (s′ )] [V (s) − V (s′ )] ≥ 0 for all s, s′ . Intuitively, co-monotonicity captures the idea
  5
      See Definition 5 in Appendix C.


                                                          11
that the payoff f is an increasing function of the continuation utility V . We are interested
in identifying properties of the certainty equivalence functional I such that the following
condition is true.

Condition 1. The announcement premium is non-negative for all payoffs that are co-
monotone with continuation utility V .
                                              PN
   In the case of expected utility, I [V ] =     s=1 π (s) Vs is linear, and m (s) = 1 for all
                                                                              ∗

s by equation (11). As a result, equation (12) reduces to E [RA (s)] = 1, and there can
be no premium for any announcement return. In general, assuming m∗ (s) is a decreasing
function of aggregate consumption, C1,s , or equivalently, a decreasing functions of Vs , then
by equation (12), the announcement premium E [RA (s)] − 1 = −cov [m∗ (s) , RA (s)] must
be positive for all returns RA (s) that are co-monotone with continuation utility Vs . The
converse of the above statement is also true. That is, suppose m∗ (s) is a not a decreasing
functions of Vs , then we can always find an return that is co-monotone with Vs , but requires
a negative announcement premium.
    As a result of the above observation, Condition 1 is equivalent to m∗ (s) being a decreasing
function of Vs , which is equivalent to ∂V∂ s I [V ] being a decreasing function of Vs by Equation
(11). Under the assumption of equal probability for all states, the latter property is known to
be equivalent to I being increasing in second-order stochastic dominance.6 We can summarize
our main results as follows.

Theorem 2. (Announcement Premium) Under the assumptions of Theorem 1,

   1. the announcement premium is zero for all assets if and only I is the expectation
      operator.

   2. Condition 1 is equivalent to the certainty equivalence functional I being non-decreasing
      with respect to second-order stochastic dominance.

   The above theorem holds under much more general conditions. In Appendix D, we show
that the conclusion of the above theorem remains true in a fully dynamic model without the
assumption of fully revealing signals or a finite number of states with equal probability.7
   6
      Under our assumptions, this property of I is also known as Schur concavity. See also Muller and Stoyan
[57] and Chew and Mao [17].
    7
      A stronger version of the above theorem is also true. That is, the announcement premium is positive for
all payoffs that are strictly co-monotone with continuation utility Vs if and only if the certainty equivalence
functional I is strictly increasing with respect to second-order stochastic dominance. A proof for this result
is available upon request.

4.2     Generalized risk-sensitive preferences

Theorem 2 motivates the following definition of generalized risk sensitivity.

Definition 1. (Generalized Risk Sensitivity)
    An intertemporal preference of the form (18) is said to satisfy (strictly) generalized risk
sensitivity, if the certainty equivalence functional I is (strictly) monotone with respect to
second-order stochastic dominance.

   Under our definition, generalized risk-sensitive preference is precisely the class of
preferences that requires a non-negative announcement premium for all assets with payoff
co-monotone with investors’ continuation utility.
                                                                                                ′
    The SDF for many non-expected utility models takes the form m∗ (s) β uu(C        1 (s))
                                                                                  ′ (C ) , as in
                                                                                       0

Equation (10).8 Theorem 2 has two important implications. First, generalized risk sensitivity
is precisely the class of preferences under which m∗ is a decreasing function of continuation
utility and therefore enhances risk compensation. Second, generalized risk sensitivty can
be identified from empirical evidence on announcement returns. In fact, as we show in
Section 4.3, the empirical evidence on the announcement premium can be used to gauge the
quantitative importance of the term m∗ .
   To clarify the notion of generalized risk sensitivity, we next discuss its relationship with
two other related properties of choice behavior under uncertainty that are known to be
associated with higher risk compensations, uncertainty aversion (Gilboa and Schmeidler [30]),
and the preference for early resolution of uncertainty (Kreps and Porteus [48]).


   Generalized risk sensitivity and uncertainty aversion Most of the dynamic
uncertainty-averse preferences studied in the literature can be viewed as a special case of
the general representation (9). In the special case in which u (·) is affine as in Strzalecki [65],
quasiconcavity is equivalent to the uncertainty aversion axiom of Gilboa and Schmeidler [30].
We make the following observations about the relationship between uncertainty aversion and
generalized risk sensitivity.

   1. Quasiconcavity of I is sufficient, but not neccessary, for generalized risk sensitivity.
       A direct implication of the above result is that all uncertainty-averse preferences can
       be viewed as different ways to formalize generalized risk sensitivity, and they all require
   8
    For example, Hansen and Sargent [34] use a risk-sensitive operator to motivate the term m∗ as a decreasing
function of continuation utility. In this sense, our notion of generalizes the risk-sensitive operator of Hansen
and Sargent [34].



                                                      13
     a non-negative announcement premium (for all assets with payoffs co-monotone with
     continuation utility). These preferences include the maxmin expected utility of Gilboa
     and Schmeidler [30], the second-order expected utility of Ergin and Gul [28], the
     smooth ambiguity preferences of Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji [46], the variational
     preferences of Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Rustichini [54], the multiplier preferences
     of Hansen and Sargent [34] and Strzalecki [64], and the confidence preferences of
     Chateauneuf and Faro [15].
     In Appendix D, we provide a proof for the sufficiency of quasiconcavity for generalized
     risk sensitivity. To illustrate that quasiconcavity is not neccessary, in the same
     appendix, we also provide an example that satisfies generalized risk sensitivity, but
     not quasiconcavity.

  2. If I is of the form I [V ] = φ−1 (E [φ (V )]), where φ is a strictly increasing function,
     then generalized risk sensitivity is equivalent to quasiconcavity, which is also equivalent
     to the concavity of φ.
     The certainty equivalence function of many intertemporal preferences takes the above
     form, for example the the second-order expected utility of Ergin and Gul [28] and the
     recursive preferences of Kreps and Porteus [48] and Epstein and Zin [27]. For these
     preferences, g-risk sensitivity is equivalent to the concavity of φ.

  3. Within the class of smooth ambiguity-averse preferences, uncertainty aversion is
     equivalent to generalized risk sensitivity.
     The smooth ambiguity-averse preference of Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji [46, 47]
     can be represented in the form of (9) with the following choice of the certainty
     equivalence functional:
                                                 Z                       
                                            −1                x
                               I [V ] = φ                 φ (E [V ]) dµ (x) .              (13)
                                                      ∆


     We use ∆ to denote a set of probability measures indexed by x, Px . The notation E x [·]
     stands for expectation under the probability Px , and µ (x) is a probability measure
     over x. In Appendix D, we show that generalized risk sensitivity is equivalent to the
     concavity of φ, which is also equivalent to uncertainty aversion.


    Generalized risk sensitivity and preference for early resolution of uncertainty
A well-known class of model that gives rise to an additional term m∗ in the SDF in (10)
is the recursive preference with constant relative risk aversion and constant intertemporal
elasticity of substitution (IES). It is also well-known that the resultant m∗ is decreasing in


                                                  14
continuation utility under preference for early resolution of uncertainty, that is, if the relative
risk aversion γ is greater than the reciprocal of IES, ψ1 . However, for the general representation
(9), generalized risk sensitivity is neither necessary nor sufficient for preference for early
resolution of uncertainty. A simple example of a preference with indifference toward the
timing of resolution of uncertainty, but requires a strictly positive announcement premium,
is the constraint robust control preference in Section 3.3.9 We summarize our main results
below.

   1. Concavity of the certainty equivalence functional I is sufficient for both generalized risk
      sensitivity and preference for early resolution of uncertainty.
       Note that concavity implies quasiconcavity and therefore generalized risk sensitivity.
       Theorem 2 of Strzalecki [65] also implies that these preferences satisfy preference for
       early resolution of uncertainty. As a result, Theorems 2 and 3 of Strzalecki [65] imply
       that the variational preference of Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Rustichini [54] is both
       risk sensitive and prefers early resolution of uncertainty.

   2. If I of the form I [V ] = φ−1 (E [φ (V )]) or is the smooth ambiguity preference,
                 R
      I [V ] = ∆ φ (E x [V ]) dµ (x), where φ is strictly increasing and twice continuously
      differentiable, then generalized risk sensitivity implies preference for early resolution
      of uncertainty if either of the following two conditions hold.
                                                      ′′
                                                (a)
        (a) There exists A ≥ 0 such that − φφ′ (a)  ∈ [βA, A] for all a ∈ R.
                                      h ′′          i       ′′
                                             (k+βa)            (a)
        (b) u (C) ≥ 0 for all C, and β − φφ′ (k+βa)   ≤ − φφ′ (a)  for all a, k ≥ 0.

       The above two conditions are the same as Conditions 1 and 2 in Strzalecki [65].
       Intuitively, they require that the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of the function φ does not
       vary too much. In both cases, generalized risk sensitivity implies the concavity of φ.
       By Theorem 4 of Strzalecki [65], either of the above conditions implies preference for
       early resolution of uncertainty.
       Because the recursive utility with constant relative risk aversion and constant IES can
                                                                 1
       be represented in the form of (9) with u (C) = 1−1 1 C 1− ψ , and I [V ] = φ−1 (E [φ (V )]),
                                                                    ψ

    To verify that this preference is indifferent toward the timing of resolution of uncertainty, note that the
time 0− utility of the agent is
                                     V E = min E [m {u (C0 ) + βu (C1 )}] ,
if uncertainty is resolved at 0+ , and the utility at time 0− is

                                     V L = u (C0 ) + β min E [m {u (C1 )}] ,

if uncertainty is resolved at time 1. Clearly, V E = V L .

      where φ (x) = 1 − ψ x         . It follows from Condition b that I is quasi-concave
      and therefore requires a positive announcement premium if and only if γ ≥ ψ1 . That is,
      for this class of preferences, preference for early resolution of uncertainty and generalized
      risk sensitivity are equivalent. Therefore, assuming a recursive utility with constant
      relative risk aversion and constant IES, the empirical evidence for announcement
      premium can be also interpreted as evidence for preference for early resolution of
      uncertainty.

  3. In general, preference for early resolution of uncertainty is neither sufficient nor
     necessary for a positive announcement premium.
      In Appendix D, we provide an example of a generalized risk-sensitive preference that
      violates preference for early resolution of uncertainty, as well as an example of an utility
      function that prefers early resolution of uncertainty, but does not satisfy generalized
      risk sensitivity.

  4. The only class of preferences that requires a positive announcement premium and is
     indifferent toward the timing of resolution of uncertainty is the maxmin expected utility
     of Gilboa and Schmeidler [30].
      The maxmin expected utility of Gilboa and Schmeidler [30] is the only class of preference
      of the form (9) that is indifferent toward the timing of resolution of uncertainty
      (Strzalecki [65]). As the example in Section 2.3 shows, this class of preference exhibits
      generalized risk sensitivity.


4.3    Asset pricing implications

    Decomposition of returns by the timing of its realizations In general, equity
returns can be decomposed into an announcement return and a post-announcement return.
Using the notations we setup in Section 3 of the paper, the return of an asset can be computed
as:
                                        X
                              R (X) = − = RP ( X| s) RA (s) ,
                                       P
where RA (s) is the announcement return defined in (1), and RP ( X| s) = P +X(s) is the post-
announcement return (conditioning on s). The optimal portfolio choice problem on the
post-announcement asset market implies that for each s, there exists y ∗ ( C1 | s), which is a
function of C1 , such that
                             E [ y ∗ ( C1 | s) RP (X| s)| s] = 1,                        (14)




                                                16
for all post-announcement returns. In our simple model in which s fully reveals C1 ,
          ′ (C )
y ∗ = βu
       u (C0 )
        ′
              1
                 . In general, y ∗ depends on agents’ intertemporal marginal rate of substitution
on the post-announcement asset market. Combining Equations (12) and (14), and applying
the law of iterated expectation, we have

                                        E [m∗ y ∗ · R (X)] = 1.10                                   (15)


   Equation (15) appears in many intertemporal asset pricing models. Equations (12)
and (14) provide a decomposition of intertemporal returns into an announcement return
and a post-announcement return and a decomposition of the SDF. We make the following
comments.

  1. Theorem 2 implies that the announcement premium must be compensation for
     generalized risk sensitivity and cannot be compensation for risk aversion associated
     with the Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function u, because the A-SDF, m∗ ,
     depends only on the curvature of the certainty equivalence functional I [·], and not
     on u. The announcement premium is determined by the properties of I [·], whereas the
     post-announcement premium, which is not realized until the action of consumption is
     completed, refects the curvature of u.

  2. The large magnitude of announcement return in the data implies that the probability
     distortion in m∗ must be significant. Just as intertemporal asset returns provide
     restrictions on the SDF that prices these returns, announcement returns provide
     restrictions on the magnitude of the probability distortions. For example, we can bound
     the entropy of the A-SDF as in Bansal and Lehmann [7] and Backus, Chernov, and
     Zin [5]: −E [ln (m∗ y ∗ )] = −E [ln m∗ ] − E [ln y ∗] ≥ E [ln R]. Using the average market
     return during the 1997-2014 period, we have −E [ln (m∗ y ∗ )] ≥ E [ln R] = 7.44%. The
     entropy bound on the probability distortion component provides a tighter restriction:
     −E [ln m∗ ] ≥ E [ln RA ] = 8.24% using the average announcement return during the
     same period. These bounds imply that the volatility of the SDF y ∗ is likely to be small.

  3. The Hansen-Jaganathan bound (Hansen and Jagannathan [33]) for the SDF’s leads to
     a similar conclusion. Equation (12) implies that for any announcement return, RA ,
     σ [m∗ ] ≥ E[RA −1]
                σ[RA ]
                        . The Sharpe ratio for announcement returns reported in Table 1 can
     be used to compute the Hansen-Jaganathan bound for A-SDF: σ [m∗ ] ≥ 55% for the
     1961-2014 period, and σ [m∗ ] ≥ 88% if we focus on the later period of 1997-2014, where
     more announcement data are available.
 10
      We show in Appendix C that this decomposition holds in the fully dynamic model. See equation (43).



                                                    17
  In contrast, the moments of the total stock market return in the same period in fact
  implies a weaker bound on SDF that prices the overall return, m∗ y ∗. Using equation
  (15), we have
                                             E [R (X) − 1]
                               σ [m∗ y ∗ ] ≥               .                      (16)
                                               σ [R (X)]
  Inequality (16) implies σ [m∗ y ∗ ] ≥ 40% if we focus on the period of 1961-2014 in Table
  1, and σ [m∗ y ∗ ] ≥ 37% for the latter period of 1997-2014.

4. Assuming log-normality, equation (12) implies ln E [RA ] = −Cov [ln RA , ln m∗ ], and
   equation (15) implies

                ln E [R] − ln Rf = −Cov [ln R, ln m∗ + ln y ∗ ]                            (17)
                                    = −Cov [ln R, ln m∗ ] − Cov [ln R, ln y ∗ ] .

  Because ln R = ln RA (s) + ln RP and −Cov [ln RA , ln m∗ ] = ln E [RA ] by equation (12),
  we have:

            ln E [R] − ln Rf = ln E [RA ] − Cov [ln m∗ , ln RP ] − Cov [ln y ∗ , ln R] .   (18)

  As we explained earlier, most of the equity premium in the data is announcement
  premium. Therefore, the term −Cov [ln m∗ , ln RP ] − Cov [ln y ∗, ln R] must be close to
  zero. Note that m∗ (s) is a function of the announcement, while RP (X|s) is the post-
  announcement return; therefore, the term Cov [ln m∗ , ln RP ] is likely to be close to zero.
  This implies that the compensation for the curvature of the Von Neumann–Morgenstern
  utility function u as captured by the term −Cov [ln y ∗, ln R] must be close to zero.

5. The external habit preference does not generate an announcement premium, and the
   internal habit model produces a negative announcement premium.
  The external habit preference (for example,
                                       hP       Constantinides i[20] and Campbell and
                                           T    1             1−γ
  Cochrane [14]) can be written as: E      t=0 1−γ (Ct − Ht )     , where {Ht }∞
                                                                               t=0 is the
  habit process. Consider the date-0 market for announcements. The pre-announcement
  price of any payoff {Xt }∞
                           t=1 is

                                        " T                      #
                                         X Ct − Ht −γ
                              P− = E                           Xt ,
                                          t=0
                                                  C0 − H0




                                             18
      and the post-announcement price (after s0 is announced) is
                                           "   T          −γ       #
                                               X   Ct − Ht
                             P + (s) = E                         Xt s .
                                               t=0
                                                      C0 − H0

      Clearly, like in the case of expected utility, P0− = E P0+ (s) , and there can be
                                                                       

      no announcement premium. The external habit model is similar to expected utility
      because the habit process is exogenous, and agents do not take into account of the
      effect of current consumption choices on future habits when making consumption and
      investment decisions. We further show in Appendix D that the internal habit model
      (for example, Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher [11]) generates a negative announcement
      premium.



5     A quantitative model of announcement premium
In this section, we present a continuous-time model with the Kreps-Porteus utility and show
that our model can quantitatively account for the dynamic pattern of the announcement
premium in the data. In our model, shocks to aggregate consumption are modeled as
Brownian motions and arrive gradually over time. This setup allows us to distinguish the
announcement premium that is instantaneously realized upon news announcements and the
risk premium that investors receive incrementally as shocks to consumption materialize slowly
over time.


5.1    Model setup

    The dynamics of consumption and dividends We consider a continuous-time
representative agent economy. The growth rate of aggregate consumption during an
infinitesimal interval ∆ is specified as:

                        ln Ct+∆ − ln Ct = xt ∆ + σ (BC,t+∆ − BC,t ) ,

where xt is a continuous time AR(1) process not observable to the agents of the economy.
The law of motion of xt is

                     xt+∆ = ax ∆x̄ + (1 − a∆) xt + σ x (Bx,t+∆ − Bx,t ) ,




                                                 19
where x̄ is the long-run average growth rate of the economy, and BC,t+∆ + BC,t and
Bx,t+∆ − Bx,t are normally distributed innovations (increments of Brownian motions). We
assume that BC,t and Bx,t are independent. In the continuous-time notation,

                                     dCt
                                         = xt dt + σdBC,t ,
                                      Ct
                                     dxt = ax (x̄ − xt ) dt + σ x dBx,t                                          (19)

Our benchmark asset is a claim to the following dividend process:

                                   dDt
                                       = [x̄ + φ (xt − x̄)] dt + φσdBC,t ,                                       (20)
                                   Dt

where we assume that the long-run average growth rate of consumption and dividend are
the same, and we allow the leverage parameter φ > 1 so that dividends are more risky than
consumption, as in Bansal and Yaron [9].


      Timing of information and Bayesian learning The representative agent in the
economy can use two sources of information to update beliefs about xt . First, the realized
consumption path contains information about xt , and second, an additional signal about xt is
revealed at pre-scheduled discrete time points T, 2T, 3T, · · · . For n = 1, 2, 3, · · · , we denote sn
as the signal observed at time nT and assume sn = xnT + εn , where εn is normally distributed
with mean zero and variance σ 2S . Note that announcements of the signals at t = T , 2T , 3T ,
· · · are not associated with the realization of any consumption shocks.
    In the interior of (0, T ), the agent does not observe the true value of xt and updates belief
about xt based on the observed consumption process according to Bayes’ rule. We define
x̂t = E ( xt | C t ) as the posterior mean of xt and time t, and define qt = E (xt − x̂t )2 C t as
                                                                                              

                                                                   q (t)
                                      dx̂t = a [x̄ − x̂t ] dt +          dB̃C,t ,                                (21)

3 with the assumption that announcements are made every thirty days and they completely
reveal the information about xt , that is, σ 2S = 0. At announcements, the posterior variance
drops immediately to zero, as indicated by the circles. After announcement, information
slowly arrives and as a result, the posterior variance gradually increases over time before the
next announcement.

    Preferences and the stochastic discount factor We assume that the representative
agent has a Kreps-Porteus utility with preference for early resolution of uncertainty, γ > ψ1 .
In continuous time, this preference is represented by the stochastic differential utility of Duffie
and Epstein [22] that can be interpreted as the limit of the recursive relationship (9) over a
small time interval ∆ as ∆ → 0:

where ρ is the time discount rate, and I [ ·| x̂t , qt ] is the                                                      certainty equivalence functional

Consistent with our earlier notation, we define the A-SDF m∗t+∆ = E e e(1−γ)Vt+∆ , and the

represents the probability distortion under the robust control interpretation of the model.
With the above specification of preferences and consumption, the value function has a closed-
form solution, which we denote Vt = V (x̂t , t, Ct ), and

our model to be consistent with standard long-run risk calibrations and list them in Table 4.
We now turn to the quantitative implications of the model on the announcement premium.


5.2     The announcement premium

    Equity premium on non-announcement days In the interior of (nT, (n + 1) T ), the
equity premium can be calculated using the SDF (25) like in standard learning models (for
example, Veronesi [66] and Ai [2]). Let pt denote the price-to-dividend ratio of the benchmark
asset, and let rt denote the risk-free interest rate at time t. Using a log-linear approximation
of pt , the equity premium for the benchmark asset over a small time interval (t, t + ∆) can
be written as:12
                                                                               
                 pt+∆ Dt+∆ + Dt+∆ ∆      rt ∆            γ − 1 qt          φ − 1 qt
            Et                       −e        ≈ γσ +                φσ +             ∆.    (27)

   12
      In general, the equity premium depends on the state variable x̂. The log-linear approximation does not
capture this dependence. We use the log-linear approximation to illustrate the intuition of the model. All
figures and calibration results are obtained based on the global solution of the PDE obtained by the Markov
chain approximation method.

The above expression has intuitive interpretations. The term γσ + ax +ρ σ is the sensitivity
of the SDF with respect to consumption shocks, where γσ is market price of risk due to risk
aversion, and the term aγ−1     qt
                                    is associated with recursive utility and aversion to long-run
                          hx +ρ σ          i
risks. The second term σ + aφ−1         qt
                                   x +ρ σ
                                             is the elasticity of asset return with respect to shocks
in consumption, where φσ is the sensitivity of dividend growth with respect to consumption
growth, and aφ−1   qt
              x +ρ σ
                      is the response of price-dividend ratio to investors’ belief about future
consumption growth.
    As we show in Figure 3, after the previous announcement and before the next
announcement, because investors do not observe the true value of xt , the posterior variance qt
increases over time. By equation (27), the
                                         h equity premium

plot the instantaneous equity premium γσ + ax +ρ σ φσ + aφ−1

days. Clearly, the equity premium increases over time. This feature of our model captures
the ”pre-announcement drift” documented in empirical work.

Figure 4 plots the annualized equity premium on non-announcement days in our model with recursive utility.


    As in typical continuous-time models, the amount of equity premium is proportional to the
length of holding period, ∆ by equation (27). In fact, SDFt,t+∆ → 1 as ∆ → 0. Intuitively,
the amount of risk diminishes to zero in an infinitesimally small time interval, and so does
risk premium. The situation is very different on macroeconomic announcement days, which
we turn to next.

We make the following observations.

   1. In contrast to non-announcement periods, the equity premium does not disappear as
      ∆ → 0. As long as φ > 1 and the agent prefers early resolution of uncertainty (γ > 1),
      the announcement premium is positive.
      In Figure 5, we plot the daily equity premium implied by our model with recursive
      utility (top panel) and that in a model with expected utility (bottom panel). Because
      we are calculate equity premium over a short time interval, the equity premium in
      non-announcement periods is negligible compared with announcement returns. The
      announcement premium is about 17 basis points in the top panel, and the equity
      premium is close to zero on announcement days. The quantitative magnitude of these
      returns is quite similar to their empirical counterpart in Table 1. Consistent with
      our theoretical results in Section 2, the announcement premium for expected utility is
      zero. The premium on the announcement days for expected utility is 0.028 basis point,

Figure 5 plots daily equity premium for recursive utility (top panel) and that for expected utility (bottom
panel). Equity premium is measured in basis points. The dotted line is the equity premium on non-
announcement days, and the circles indicate the equity premium on announcement days.


   2. The announcement premium identifies the probability distortion component of the SDF.
                                                                       −1
      The SDF in equation (25) has two components, the term e−ρ∆ CCt+∆t
                                                                            that arises from
                                                                                                                             e(1−γ)Vt+∆
       standard log utility, and the A-SDF                                                                                 Et [e(1−γ)Vt+∆ ]
                                                                                                                                                    that can be interpreted as probability
       distortion. As we take the limit ∆ → 0, the intertemporal substitution of consumption
       term vanishes, and the A-SDF, (28), only depends on probability distortion. In the
       log-linear approximation (30), the term aγ−1
                                                  x +ρ
                                                       is due to investors’ probability distortion
                         +                   φ−1
       with respect to xT , and the term ax +ρ measures the sensitivity of price-to-dividend
       ratio with respect to probability distortions.

   3. The magnitude of announcement premium is proportional to the variance reduction
      in the posterior belief of the hidden state variable xt upon the news announcement,
      qT− − qT+ . The higher is the information content in news, the larger is the announcement
      premium. In addition, the announcement premium also increases with the persistence
      of the shocks. As the mean-reversion parameter ax becomes smaller, the half life of the
      impact of xt on consumption increases, and so does the announcement premium.

  13
    The equity premium on announcement days in the expected utility model is not literally zero because
                                                                                                    1
even though announcement premium is zero, compensation for consumption risks is positive with ∆ = 360 .

Figure 6 plots the evolution of log price-to-dividend ratio over the announcement cycles. The dotted line is
the price-to-dividend ratio evaluated at the steady-state level of expected consumption growth rate, x̄. The
dash-dotted line is the price-to-dividend ratio for xt one standard deviation above and below its steady-state
                                                                                1
level. The standard deviation is calculated at the monthly level, that is, h = 12 .


    To better understand the nature of the announcement premium, in Figure 6, we plot the
price-dividend ratio in the model as a function of time under different assumptions of the
posterior belief, x̂t . The dotted line is the price-to-dividend ratio assuming x̂t = x̄, and the
dash-dotted lines are plotted under values of x̂t one standard deviation above and below x̄,
where standard deviation is calculated as the monthly standard deviation of the Brownian
motion shock dBt . Note that on average, announcements are associated with an immediately
increase in the valuation ratio. After announcements, as the discount rate increases, the
price-to-dividend ratio drops gradually until the next announcement. Because φ > 1, the
price-to-dividend ratio is increasing in the posterior belief x̂t , and therefore the market equity
requires a positive announcement premium by equation (30).


    Comparison with alternative model specifications In Table 5, we present the
model-implied equity premium and announcement premium for our model with learning (left
panel). For comparison, we also present under the column ”Observable” the same moments
for an otherwise identical model, except that xt is assumed to be fully observable. Under
the column ”Expected Utility”, we report the moments of a model with expected utility by
setting γ = 1 and keeping all other features identical to our benchmark learning model. Note
that our model with learning produces a higher equity premium than the model with xt
fully observable. The average equity premium in the learning model is 5.4% per year, while
the same moment is 4.58% in the model without learning. More importantly, in the model
with learning, a large fraction of the equity premium are realized on the twelve scheduled

                                                                                           26
announcement days: the total returns on announcement days averages 2.53% per year. In the
model in which xt is fully observable, announcements are not associated with any premium
because their information content is fully anticipated.
    As we have discussed before, the announcement premium is zero under expected utility,
and therefore the magnitude of the equity premium on announcement days and that on
non-announcement days is the same. In addition, under expected utility, risks in xt are not
priced, and therefore the overall equity premium is a lot lower than that in economies with
recursive utility.


5.3       Preference for early resolution of uncertainty

As we have shown in the previous section, within the class of recursive utility with constant
relative risk aversion and constant IES, a positive announcement premium is equivalent to
preference for early resolution of uncertainty. In this section, we discuss the relationship
between the announcement premium and timing premium, defined as the welfare gain of
early resolution of uncertainty, in the context of our continuous-time model.
   We define timing premium as in Epstein, Farhi, and Strzalecki [24].14 Consider a
macroeconomic announcement at time 0+ that resolves all uncertainty in the economy from
time 0+ to ∞. Let W + be the agent’s utility at time 0+ when all uncertainty is resolved,
that is,                               Z                ∞
                                      W0+ (τ ) =            e−ρt ρ ln Ct dt.                              (31)
                                                    0

Let W − be the certainty equivalent of W + :

                                        −      1      −
                                                        h
                                                          (1−γ)W +
                                                                   i
                                    W       =     ln E e             .                                    (32)
                                              1−γ

That is, W − is the utility of the representative agent who does not know any information
about the future, but anticipates that all uncertainty from time 0 to ∞ will be resolved
immediately at 0+ . Preference for early resolution implies that V0 < W0− (τ ), where
V0 = V (x0 , 0, C0) is the utility of the agent in the economy without advanced information as
we defined in (24).
       The timing premium λ is defined as the maximum fraction of life-time consumption that

    See also Ai [1] for a decomposition of the welfare of gain of early resolution of uncertainty in production
economies.

the representative agent is willing to pay for the announcement:

                                           −
                                               (τ )                eV0

    Now consider an asset market for the announcement at time 0+ . Let p+ as the price-to-
dividend ratio of the equity claim at time 0+ upon the announcement. The pre-announcement
price-to-dividend ratio is given by
                                                      h            i
                                                        (1−γ)W + +
                                           E0−         e        p
                                    p− =                               ,                    (34)
                                                E0− [e(1−γ)W + ]

where W + is the agent’s continuation utility after announcement as defined in equation (31).
The expected return associated with the announcement can be calculated as

                                          −
                                             +  − h (1−γ)W + i
                                        E0 p0 E0 e
                                  +
                             E0−  p0
                                      =                          .
                                p−          E0− [e(1−γ)W + p+ ]

                                      E − [p + ]
It is not hard to show that λ = ln 0p− 0 = 0 for γ = 1. That is, the timing premium
and announcement premium are both zero for expected utility. In addition, as long as
                                         +
p+ is positively correlated with e(1−γ)W , both the timing premium and the announcement
premium increase with the measure of preference for early resolution of uncertainty, γ − 1.
    As shown earlier in the paper, generalized risk sensitivity is necessary to account for
the large observed announcement premium. Within the class of Kreps-Porteus preferences,
the empirical evidence on the large announcement premium ipso facto implies a significant
preference for early resolution of uncertainty. As there is no direct measurement on what
investors are willing to pay for early resolution, it is hard to evaluate the model along this
dimension. In addition to the announcement premium, previous literature has demonstrated
that recursive preferences with a strong generalized risk sensitivity is important to account for
risk premia across different assets classes (see Bansal and Yaron [9], Hansen, Heaton, and Li
[32], Colacito and Croce [19], and Barro [10]) and other macro-economic facts (for example,
Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer [41] and Croce [21]). The announcement premium evidence
along with this earlier papers underscore the importance of generalized risk sensitivity within
this class of recursive preferences.

6    Conclusion
Motivated by the fact that a large fraction of the market equity premium are realized on a
small number of trading days with significant macroeconomic news announcement, in this
paper, we provide a theory and a quantitative analysis for premium for macroeconomic
announcements. We show that a positive announcement premium is equivalent to generalized
risk sensitivity, that is, investors’ certainty equivalence functional increases with respect
to second order stochastic dominance. We demonstrate that generalized risk sensitivity is
precisely the class of preferences in which deviations from expected utility enhances the
volatility of the stochastic discount factor. As a result, our theoretical framework implies
that the announcement premium can be interpreted as an asset-market-based evidence for a
broad class of non-expected utility models that feature aversion to ”Knightian uncertainty”.
We also present a dynamic model to quantitatively account for the pattern of equity premium
around news announcement days.

A      Details of the Empirical Evidence

Here, we describe the details of our empirical evidence on the macroeconomic announcement premium.


    Data description We focus on the top five macroeconomic news ranked by investor attention
among all macroeconomic announcements at the monthly or lower frequency. They are unemployment/non-
farm payroll (EMPL/NFP) and producer price index (PPI) published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS), the FOMC statements, the gross domestic product (GDP) reported by U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, and the Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Report (ISM) released by Bloomberg.15
     The EMPL/NFL and PPI are both published at a monthly frequency and their announcement dates
come from the BLS website. The BLS began announcing its scheduled release dates in advance in 1961
which is also the start date for our EMPL/NFL announcements sample. The PPI data series start in 1971.16
There are a total of eight FOMC meetings each calendar year and the dates of FOMC meetings are taken
from the Federal Reserve’s web site. The FOMC statements begin in 1994 when the Committee started
announcing its decision to the markets by releasing a statement at the end of each meeting. For meetings
lasting two calendar days we consider the second day (the day the statement is released) as the event date.
GDP is released quarterly beginning from 1997, which is the first year that full data are available, and the
dates come from the BEA’s website.17 Finally, ISM is a monthly announcement with dates coming from
Bloomberg starting from 1997. The last year for which we collect data on all announcements is 2014.


    Equity return on announcement days Table 1 reports the mean, standard deviation, and
Sharpe ratio of the annual return of the market, and the same moments for the return on announcement
days. The announcement returns are calculated as the culmulative market returns on announcement days
within a year. This is equivalent to the return of a strategy that long the market before the day of the pre-
scheduled news announcements, hold it on the trading day with the news announcement, and sell immediately
afterwards.
    In Table 2, we compare the average daily stock market return on news announcement days, which we
denote as t, that on the day before the news announcement (t − 1), and that after the news announcement
(t + 1). We present our results separately for each of the five news announcement and for all news, where
standard errors are shown in parentheses.18 Excess market returns are taken from Kenneth French’s web
   15
      Both unemployment and non-farm payroll information are released as part of the Employment Situation
Report published by the BLS. We treat them as one announcement.
   16
      While the CPI data is also available from the BLS back to 1961, once the PPI starts being published
it typically precedes the CPI announcement. Given the large overlap in information between the two macro
releases much of the ”news” content in the CPI announcement will already be known to the market at the
time of its release. For this reason we opt in favor of using PPI.
   17
      GDP growth announcements are made monthly according to the following pattern: in April the advance
estimate for Q1 GDP growth is released, followed by a preliminary estimate of the same Q1 GDP growth in
May and a final estimate given in the June announcement. Arguably most uncertainty about Q1 growth is
resolved once the advance estimate is published and most learning by the markets will occur prior to this
release. For this reason we will focus only on the 4 advance estimate release dates every year.
   18
      They are Newey-West standard errors (5-lags) of an OLS regression of excess returns on event dummies.

site. The vast majority of announcements are made on trading days. When this is not the case we assign the
news release to the first trading day that follows the announcement.


       High frequency returns In Figure 1, we plot the average stock market returns over 30-minute
intervals before and after news announcements. Here we use high frequency data for the S&P 500 SPDR that
runs from 1997 to 2013 and comes from the TAQ database. Each second the median price of all transactions
occurring that second is computed9. The price at lower frequency intervals (for example 30-min) is then
constructed as the price for the last (most recent) second in that interval when transactions were observed.
The exact time at which the news are released are reported by Bloomberg. In Figure 1, the return at time 0
is the 30-minute news event return. Employment/Non-farm payroll, GDP and PPI announcements are made
at 8:30 AM before the market begins. In these cases we will consider the 30-minute news event return to
be the return between 4:00 PM (close of trading) of the previous day and 9:30 AM when the market opens
on the day of the announcement. The 30-minute event return for ISM announcements, which are made at
10:00AM, covers the interval between 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM of the announcement day. Finally, the timing
of the FOMC news release varies. We add 30 minutes to the announcement time to account for the press
conference after the FOMC meeting.19


B         Examples of Dynamic Preferences and A-SDF

In this section, we show that most of the non-expected utility proposed in the literature can be represented
in the form of (9).

       • The recursive utility of Kreps and Porteus [48] and Epstein and Zin [27]. The recursive preference be
         generally represented as:

                                   Ut = u−1 (1 − β) u (Ct ) + βφ ◦ h−1 E [h (Ut+1 )] .
                                           
                                                                                                          (35)

         For example, the well-known recursive preference with constant IES and constant risk aversion is the
                                         1                         1
         special case in which u (C) = 1−1/ψ C 1−1/ψ and h (U ) = 1−γ C 1−γ . With a monotonic transformation,

                                                      V = u (U ) ,                                        (36)

         then the recursive relationship for V can be written in the form of (9) with the same u function in
         equation (35) and the certainty equivalence functional:
                                                            Z                     
                                         I (V ) = φ ◦ h−1        h ◦ φ−1 (V ) dP       .


         Denoting f = h ◦ u−1 , the A-SDF can be written as:

                                                   m∗ (V ) ∝ f ′ (V ) ,                                   (37)

         where we suppress the normalizing constant, which is chosen so that m∗ (V ) integrates to one.
  19
     For example if a statement is released at 14:15 PM, we add 30 minutes for the press conference that
follows and then we round the event time to 15:00 PM.



                                                       31
• The maxmin expected utility of Gilboa and Schmeidler [30]. The dynamic version of this preference is
  studied in Epstein and Schneider [25] and Chen and Epstein [16]. This preference can be represented
  as the special case of (9) where the certainty equivalence functional is of the form:
                                                                 Z
                                          I (V ) = min               mV dP,
                                                        m∈M


  where M is a family of probability densities that is assumed to be closed in the weak∗ topology. As
  we show in Section 3.3 of the paper, the A-SDF for this class of preference is the Radon-Nikodym
  derivative of the minimizing probability measure with respect to P .
• The variational preferences of Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Rustichini [54], the dynamic version of which
  is studied in Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Rustichini [55], features a certainty equivalence functional of
  the form:                                        Z
                                    I (V ) = min      mV dP + c (m) ,
                                                  E[m]=1

  where c (π) is a convex and weak∗ −lower semi-continuous function. Similar to the maxmin expected
  utility, the A-SDF for this class of preference is minimizing probability density.
• The multiplier preferences of Hansen and Sargent [34] and Strzalecki [64] is represented by the certainty
  equivalence functional:                         Z
                                    I (V ) = min             mV dP + θR (m) ,
                                              E[m]=1

  where R (m) denote the relative entropy of the density m with respect to the reference probability
  measure P , and θ > 0 is a parameter. In this case, the A-SDF is also the minimizing probability that
                                                                         1
  can be written as a function of the continuation utility: m∗ (V ) ∝ e− θ V .
• The second order expected utility of Ergin and Gul [28] can be written as (9) with the following choice
  of I:                                           Z            
                                        I (V ) = φ−1              φ (V ) dP    ,

  where φ is a concave function. In this case, the A-SDF can be written as a function of continuation
  utility:
                                            m∗ (V ) ∝ φ′ (V ) .

• The smooth ambiguity preferences of Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji [46] and Klibanoff, Marinacci,
  and Mukerji [47] can be represented as:
                                                  Z        Z                     
                                             −1
                                I (V ) = φ              φ         mV dP       dµ (m) ,                (38)
                                                    M         Ω

  where µ is a probability measure on a set of probabilities densities M . The A-SDF can be written as
  a function of V :                     Z       Z         
                                    ∗         ′
                                  m ∝        φ     mV dP mdµ (m) .                                (39)
                                              M

• The disappointment aversion preference can be represented as a concave utility function u, and the
  certainty equivalence functional I implicitly defined as follows: µ = I [V ], where µ is the unique
  solution to the following equation:
                                      Z              Z
                              φ (µ) = φ (V ) dP − θ       [φ (µ) − φ (V )] dP,
                                                             µ≥V


                                                       32
         where φ is a strictly increasing and concave function.


C         The Announcement SDF

In this section, we provide a formal statement of Theorem 1 and 2 in a fully dynamic model with a continuum
state space. We first setup some notations and definitions.


C.1         Definitions and Notations

We use R to denote the real line and Rn to denote the n−dimensional Euclidean space. Let (Ω, F , P ) be a
non-atomic probability space, where F is the associated Borel σ−algebra. A certainty equivalence functional
I [·] is a mapping I : L2 (Ω, F , P ) → R, where L2 (Ω, F , P ) is the set of square integrable random variables
defined on (Ω, F , P ). We first state a definition of first order stochastic dominance (FSD) and second order
stochastic dominance (SSD).

Definition 2. First order stochastic dominance: X1 first order stochastic dominates X2 , or X1 ≥F SD X2
if there exist a random variable Y ≥ 0 a.s. such that X1 has the same distribution as X2 + Y . Strict
monotonicity, X1 >F SD X2 holds if P (Y > 0) > 0 in the above definition.

Definition 3. Second order stochastic dominance: X1 second order stochastic dominates X2 , or X1 ≥SSD X2
if there exist a random variable Y such that E [ Y | X1 ] = 0 and X2 has the same distribution as X1 + Y .
Strict monotonicity, X1 >SSD X2 holds if P (Y 6= 0) > 0 in the above definition.20

       Monotonicity with respect to FSD and SSD are defined as:

Definition 4. Monotonicity with respect to FSD (SSD): The certainty equivalence functional I is said to be
monotone with respect to FSD (SSD) if I [X1 ] ≥ I [X2 ] whenever X1 ≥F SD X2 (X1 ≥SSD X2 ). I is strictly
monotone with respect to FSD (SSD) if I [X1 ] > I [X2 ] whenever X1 >F SD X2 (X1 >SSD X2 ).

       We also assume that the certainty equivalence functional I is normalized as in Strzalecki [65]:

Definition 5. Normalized: I is normalized if I [k] = k whenever k is a constant.

     To construct the A-SDF from marginal utilities, we need some concepts from standard functional analysis
(see for example, Luenberger [53] and Rall [59]) to impose a differentiability condition on the certainty
equivalence functional. We use k·k to denote the L2 norm on L2 (Ω, F , P ) and assume that I satisfy the
following differentiability condition.

Definition 6. (Fréchet Differentiable with Lipschitz Derivatives) The certainty equivalence functional I is
Fréchet Differentiable if ∀X ∈ L2 (Ω, F , P ), there exist a unique continuous linear functional, DI [X] ∈
L2 (Ω, F , P ) such that for all ∆X ∈ L2 (Ω, F , P )
                                                          R
                                      I [X + ∆X] − I [X] − DI [X] · ∆XdP
                               lim                                       = 0.
                             k∆Xk→0                   k∆Xk
  20
     Our definition of SSD is the same as the standard concept of increasing risk (see Rothschild and Stiglitz
[61] and Werner [67]). However, it is important to note that in our model, the certainty equivalence function
I is defined on the space of continuation utilities rather than consumption.


                                                        33
   A Fréchet differentiable certainty equivalence functional I is said to have a Lipschitz derivatives if
∀X, Y ∈ L2 (Ω, F , P ), kDI [X] − DI [Y ]k ≤ K kX − Y k for some constant K.21

     The above assumption is made for two purposes. First it allows us to apply the envelope theorems
in Milgrom and Segal [56] to establish differentiability of the value functions. Second, it allows us to
compute the derivatives of I to construct the A-SDF and use derivatives of I to integrate back to recover
the certainty equivalence functional.22 Intuitively, we use the following operation to relate the certainty
equivalence function I and its derivatives. ∀ X,Y ∈ L2 (Ω, F , P ), we can define g (t) = I [X + t (Y − X)] for
t ∈ [0, 1] and compute I (Y ) − I (X) as

                          I [Y ] − I [X] =        g (1) − g (0)
                                                  Z 1
                                              =       g ′ (t) dt
                                                   0
                                                  Z    1   Z
                                              =                DI [X + t (Y − X)] (Y − X) dP dt.               (40)
                                                   0       Ω


    We note that Fréchet Differentiability with Lipschitz Derivatives guarantees that the function g (t) is
continuously differentiable. The differentiability of g is straightforward (see for example, Luenberger [53]).
To see that g ′ (t) is continuous, note that
                                       Z
             g ′ (t1 ) − g ′ (t2 ) =        {DI [X + t1 (Y − X)] − DI [X + t2 (Y − X)]} (Y − X) dP
                                        Ω
                                 ≤     kDI [X + t1 (Y − X)] − DI [X + t2 (Y − X)]k · kY − Xk .

The Lipschitz continuity DI implies that

                    kDI [X + t1 (Y − X)] − DI [X + t2 (Y − X)]k ≤ (t1 − t2 ) k(Y − X)k ,

and the latter vanishes as t2 → t1 . This proves the validity of (40).
   For later reference, it is useful to note that we can apply the mean value theorem on g, and write for
some t̂ ∈ (0, 1),                             Z
                                                                 
                             I [Y ] − I [X] =   DI X + t̂ (Y − X) (Y − X) dP.                        (41)
                                                       Ω



C.2      A Dynamic Model with Announcements

In this section, we describe a fully dynamic model with announcements. Consider a representative agent,
pure-exchange economy where time is finite and indexed by t = 1, 2, · · · , T . The endowment process is
              T
denoted {Yt }t=1 , where Yt ≥ 0 for all t. In period t after Yt is realized, agents receive a public announcement
                                                             T
st that carries information about the future path of {Ys }s=t+1 but do not affect current-period endowment.
We define a filtration F1 = σ (Y1 ), F1 = σ (Y1 , s1 ), F2 = F1+ ∨ σ (Y2 ), F2+ = F1+ ∨ σ (Y2 , s2 ), · · · .
                         −              +                  −


  21
      The standard definition of Fréchet Differentiability requires the existence of the derivative as a continuous
linear functional. Because we focus on functions defined on L2 (Ω, F , P ), we apply the Riesz representation
theorem and denote DI [X] as the representation of the derivative in L2 (Ω, F , P ).
   22
      A weaker notion of differentiability, Gâtteaux differentiability is enough to gurantee the existence of
A-SDF. However, the converse of Theorem 1 requires a stronger condition for differentiability, which is what
we assume here.


                                                                 34
    In a every period t, after the realization of Yt but before the announcement of st , the time t− asset
market opens where a vector of J + 1 returns are traded: {RA (j, t) (st )}j=0,1,··· ,J . Here, RA (j, t) (st ) are
announcement returns that require one unit of investment at time t− and provide a signal-contingent payoff
at time t+ after st is announced. At time t+ , after st is revealed, the post announcement asset market
opens and the agents trade a vector of J + 1 returns with payoff contingent on the realization of next period
endowment: {RP (j, t) (Yt+1 )}j=0,1,··· ,J . That is, the returns, RA (j, t) (st ) require one unit of investment at
time t+ after st is revealed and provide payoff at time t + 1− that is a function of Yt+1 , To save notation, we
suppress the dependence of RA (j, t) (st ) on st and the dependence of RP (j, t) (Yt+1 ) on Yt+1 in the rest of
this section. We also adopt the convention that RA (0, t) and RP (0, t) are risk-free returns.
    We use Vt+ to denote the value function of the representative agent’s life-time utility at time t+ after
the signal st is announced, and Vt− to denote the agent’s value function at time t− before st is known. The
optimal consumption-portfolio choice problem of the agent can be solved by backward induction. In the
last period T , agents simply consume their total wealth, and therefore VT− (W ) = VT+ (W ) = u (W ). For
t = 1, 2, · · · , T − 1,we denote ξ = [ξ 0 , ξ 1 , ξ 2 , · · · ξ J ] as the vector of investment in the post-announcement
asset market and write the corresponding consumption-portfolio choice problem as:

                                      Vt+ (W ) = max u (C) + βI Vt+1
                                                                −

                                                                          

Similarly, the optimal portfolio choice problem on the pre-announcement market is

where ζ = [ζ 0 , ζ 1 , ζ 2 , · · · ζ J ] is a vector of investment in announcement returns.
   We        assume      nthat          for        some o                     initial         wealth       level,          W0

the property of the certainty equivalence functional I [·].


C.3       Existence of A-SDF

We first state and prove our result on the existence of A-SDF. Below, we state a generalization of Theorem
1 in a fully dynamic model with a non-atomic probability space.

Theorem 3. (Existence of A-SDF)
    Suppose both u and I are Lipschitz continuous, Fréchet differentiable with Lipschitz continuous
derivatives. Suppose that I is strictly monotone with respect to first order stochastic dominance, then in any
interior competitive equilibrium with sequential trading, ∀t, the risk-free announcement return RA (0, t) = 1.
In addition, there exists a non-negative measurable function m∗t : R → R such that

                          E m∗t Vt+ {RA (j, t) − 1} Ft− = 1 f or all
                                                     
                                                                                         j = 1, 2, · · · J.              (42)


                                                                 35
Under the regularity condition (54) below, E m∗t Vt+ Ft− = 1 and (42) can be written as:
                                                      


                          E m∗t Vt+ RA (j, t) Ft− = 1 f or all
                                               
                                                                          j = 0, 1, 2, · · · J.                      (43)


    Differentiability of value function To prove Theorem 3, we first establish the differentiability of
the value functions recursively. In particular, we show that the value functions are elements of D, where D
is defined as
Definition 7. D is the set of differentiable functions on the real line such that ∀f ∈ D, i) f is Lipschitz
continuous; ii) ∀x ∈ R, h1 [f (x + h − a) − f (x − a)] converges uniformly to f ′ (x − a) in a. That is, ∀ε > 0,
there exists δ > 0 such that |h| < δ implies that h1 [f (x + h − a) − f (x − a)] − f ′ (x − a) < ε for all a ∈ R.

   We first establish that Vt+ , Vt− ∈ D for all t. For any v ∈ D, we define fv and gv as functions of (W, ξ),
where W is the wealth level, and ξ ∈ RJ+1 is a portfolio strategy:

are both square integrable and equations (44) and (45) are well-defined. To apply the envelope theorem
in Milgrom and Segal [56], we first need to establish the equi-differentiability of the family of functions
{fv (W, ξ)}ξ and {gv (W, ξ)}ξ :
                                                    1                                      1
Lemma 1. Suppose u, v ∈ D, as h → 0, both           h   [fv (W + h, ξ) − fv (W, ξ)] and    h   [gv (W + h, ξ) − gv (W, ξ)]
converge uniformly for all ξ.

  h (v̄ (1) − v̄ (0)) − v̄ (0) ≤ ε. Also, because DI is Lipschitz continuous, DI v̄ t̂ − DI [v̄ (0)] ≤
K kv̄ (1) − v̄ (0)k ≤ K 2 h, where the second inequality is due to the Lipschitz continuity of v. This proves
the uniform convergence of (47).

Lemma 2. Suppose u ∈ D, then both T + and T − map D into D.
    Proof: Note that T + v (W ) = supξ fv (W, ξ) and T − v (W ) = supξ gv (W, ξ), where fv (W, ξ) and gv (W, ξ)
are defined in (44) and (45). It then follows from Lemma 1 that Theorem 3 in Milgrom and Segal [56] applies.
Therefore, both T + v and T − v are differentiable, and

    fv (W1 , ξ (W2 )) − fv (W2 , ξ (W2 )) ≤ T + v (W1 ) − T + v (W2 ) ≤ fv (W1 , ξ (W1 )) − fv (W2 , ξ (W1 )) .    (48)

Because ∀ξ, |f (W1 , ξ) − f (W2 , ξ)| = u W1 − Jj=0 ξ j − u W2 − Jj=0 ξ j ≤ K |W1 − W2 |, where K is

a Lipschitz constant for u, |T v (W1 ) − T v (W2 )| ≤ K |W1 − W2 |. We can prove that T − v (W ) is Lipschitz

    Finally, equations (48) and (49) can be used to show that the family of functions {T + v (W − a)}a and

{T − v (W − a)}a are equi-differentiable. For example, let W1 → W2 ,

                                                     1

                                                                             1
converges uniformly by Lemma 1, and by equation (48),                     W1 −W2   [T + v (W1 ) − T + v (W2 )] must also converge
uniformly.

    Given that u ∈ D, Lemma 2 can be used to establish the differentiability of Vt+ (W ) and Vt− (W )
recursively. Finally, we note that if u′ (x) > 0 for all x ∈ R, then Vt+ (W ) and Vt− (W ) must satisfy the same
property by the envelope theorem.


    Existence of A-SDF In this section, we establish the existence of SDF as stated in Theorem 3. We

where the last equality uses the market clearing condition because period-t consumption must equal to total
endowment. Note that u′ (Yt ) > 0 and is Ft− measurable; therefore, (52) implies:

                                           E DI Vt+ (W ) (RA (j, t) − 1) Ft− = 0.

As we show in the next section, monotonicity of I guarantees that DI ≥ 0 with probability one. To derive
equation (43), we need to assume a slightly stronger condition:

                            DI [X] > 0 with strictly positive probability for all X.24                                      (54)
  23
       See for example Proposition 1 in Chapter 7 of Luenberger [53].
  24
       Note that monotonicity with respect to FSD implies that DI [X] ≥ 0 with probability one for all X. If


                                                                  38
In this case, the SDF in (43) can be constructed as:

                                                   DI Vt+ (W )
                                                              

    Now we constructed the A-SDF as the Fréchet Derivative of the certainty equivalence functional. Because
DI Vt (W ) is a linear functional on L2 Ω, Ft+ , P , it has a representation as an element in L2 Ω, Ft+ , P

by the Riesz representation theorem. To complete the proof of Theorem 3, we only need to show that m∗t can
be represented as a measurable function of continuation utility: m∗t = m∗t Vt+ for some measurable function
                                                                              

m∗t : R, → R. That is, m∗t depends on st only through the continuation utility. Note that our definition
of monotonicity with respect to FSD implies invariance with respect to distribution, that is, I [X] = I [Y ]
whenever X and Y have the same distribution (If X has the same distribution of Y then both X ≤F SD Y and
Y ≥F SD X are true). The following lemma establishes that invariance with respect to distribution implies
the measurability of m∗t with repect to Vt+ .

Lemma 3. If I is invariant with respect to distribution, then DI [X] can be represented by a measurable
function of X.
     Proof: Take any X ∈ L2 Ω, Ft+ , P , let T be a measure-preserving transformation such that the
                                             

invariant σ−field of T differ from the σ−field generated by X (which we denote as σ (X)) only by measure zero
sets (For the existence of such measure-preserving transformations, see exercise 17.43 in Kechris [44]). Let
DI [X] be the L2 Ω, Ft+ , P representation of the Fréchet Derivative of the certainty equivalence functional
                             

I at X. Below, we first show that DI [X] ◦ T must also be a Fréchet Derivative of I at X. Because the
Fréchet Derivative is unique, we must have DI [X] = DI [X] ◦ T with probability one; therefore, DI [X] must
be measurable with respect to the invariant σ-field of T and therefore, also measurable with respect to σ (X).
    Because I [·] is Fréchet differentiable, to show DI [X]◦ T is the Fréchet Derivative of I at X, it is enough
to verify that DI [X] ◦ T is a Gâteaux derivative, that is,

                                  1
                                                              Z
                              lim   [V (X + αY ) − V (X)] =       (DI [X] ◦ T ) · Y dP                       (56)
                              α→0 α


for all Y ∈ L2 Ω, Ft+ , P .
                         

    Because T is measure preserving and X is measurable with respect to the invariance σ−field of T ,
X = X ◦ T with probability one. Therefore, V (X + αY ) = V (X ◦ T + αY ) = V X + αY ◦ T −1 , where the
                                                                                                 

second equality is due to the fact that T −1 is measure preserving, and [X ◦ T + αY ] ◦ T −1 = X + αY ◦ T −1
has the same distribution with X ◦ T + αY . As a result,

                                               =   DI [X] ◦ T · Y dP,


where the last equality uses the fact that DI [X] · Y ◦ T −1 ◦ T = DI [X] ◦ T · Y have the same distribution

condition (54) does not hold, we must have DI [X] = 0 with probability one. If I is strictly monotone with
respect to FSD, then this cannot happen on an open set in L2 . Therefore, even without assuming (54), our
result implies that the A-SDF exists generically.

C.4        Generalized Risk Sensitivity and the Announcement Premium

In this section, we establish the link between generalized risk sensitivity and the existence of announcement
premium. We first state a generalization of Theorem 2.

Theorem 4. (Announcement Premium) Under the assumptions of Theorem 3,

      1. m∗t Vt+ = 1 for all Vt+ if and only I is the expectation operator.
                

      2. The following conditions are equivalent:

          (a) The certainty equivalence functional I satisfies generalized risk sensitivity.
          (b) The A-SDF m∗t Vt+ is a non-increasing function of continuation utility Vt+ .
                                  

          (c) The announcement premium is non-negative for all payoffs of the form f (Vs ), where f ≥ 0 and
              is strictly increasing at non-zero points.

    Because the A-SDF, m∗t is constructed from the derivative of the certainty equivalence functional, it is
clear from equation (55) that if I is expected utility, then m∗t must be a constant. Conversely, if m∗t is a
constant, then I is linear and represents expected utility.
    We first prove the equivalence between (a) and (b) by the following lemmas. Lemma 4 establishes that
m∗t Vt+ is non-negative if and only if I is monotone with respect to FSD. Lemma 5 and 6 jointly establish
        

that generalized risk sensitivity of I is equivalent to m∗t Vt+ being a non-increasing function of Vt+ .
                                                               


Lemma 4. I is monotone with respect FSD if and only if DI [X] ≥ 0 a.s.
      Proof: Suppose DI [X] ≥ 0 a.s. for all X ∈ L2 (Ω, F , P ). Take any Y such that Y ≥ 0 a.s., we have:
                                                     Z       1   Z
                              I [X + Y ] − I [X] =                    DI [X + tY ] Y dP dt ≥ 0.
                                                         0       Ω

Conversely, suppose I is monotone with respect to FSD, we can prove DI [X] ≥ 0 a.s. by contradiction.
Suppose the latter is not true and there exist an A ∈ F with P (A) > 0 and DI [X] < 0 on A. Because DI
is continuous, we can assume that DI [X + tχA ] < 0 on A for all t ∈ (0, ε) for ε small enough, where χA is
the indicator function of A. Therefore,
                                                     Z   1   Z
                            I [X + χA ] − I [X] =                    DI [X + tχA ] χA dP dt < 0,
                                                     0           Ω

contradicting monotonicity with respect to FSD.

   Next, we show that I is monotone with respect to SSD if and only if m∗t Vt+ is non-increasing in Vt+ .
                                                                              

We first prove the following lemma.

Lemma 5. I is monotone with respect SSD if and only if ∀X ∈ L2 (Ω, F , P ), for any σ−field G ⊆ F ,
                                       Z
                                           DI [X] · (X − E [ X| G]) dP ≤ 0.                             (57)

   Proof: Suppose condition (57) is true, by the definition of SSD, for any X and Y such that E [ Y | X] = 0,
we need to prove
                                   ∀λ ∈ (0, 1) , I (X) ≥ I (X + Y ) .

Using (40),

                                ≤ 0,

where the last inequality uses (57).
    Conversely, assuming I is increasing in SSD, we prove (57) by contradiction. if (57) is not true, then
by the continuity of DI [X], for some ε > 0, ∀t ∈ (0, ε),
                            Z
                                DI [(1 − t) X + tE [ X| G]] · (X − E [ X| G]) dP > 0.

Therefore,
                                                       Z   ε   Z
       I [(1 − ε) X + εE [ X| G]] − I [X] =                            DI [(1 − t) X + tE [ X| G]] {E [ X| G] − X} dP dt < 0.
                                                       0


However, (1 − ε) X + εE [ X| G] ≥SSD X, a contradiction.25

    Due to Lemma 3, DI [X] can be represented by a function of X, we denote DI [X] = η (X). To establish
the equivalence between monotonicity with respect to SSD and the (negative) monotonicity of m∗t Vt+ , we
                                                                                                          

only need to prove that condition (57) is equivalent to η (·) being a non-increasing function, which is Lemma
6 below.

Lemma 6. Condition (57) is equivalent to η (X) being a non-increasing function of X.
    Proof: First, we assume η (X) is non-increasing. To prove (57), note that E [ X| G] is measurable with
respect to σ (X), and we can the Law of Iterated Expectation to write:
                    Z
                        DI [X] · (X − E [ X| G]) dP                       =    E [η (X) · (X − E [ X| G])]

                                                                          ≤    E [η (E [ X| G]) · (X − E [ X| G])]
                                                                          =    0,

where the inequality follows from the fact that η (X) ≤ η (E [ X| G]) when X ≥ E [ X| G] and η (X) ≥
η (E [ X| G]) when X ≤ E [ X| G].
  25
    An easy way to prove the statement, (1 − ε) X + εE [ X| G] ≥SSD X is to observe that an equivalent
definition of SSD is X1 ≥SSD X2 if E [φ (X1 )] ≥ E [φ (X2 )] for all concave functions φ (see Rothschild
and Stiglitz [61] and Werner [67]). If E [ Z| V1 ] = 0, then for any concave function φ, φ (V1 + λZ1 ) ≥
λφ (V1 + Z) + (1 − λ) φ (V1 ). Therefore, E [φ (V1 + λZ1 )] ≥ λE [φ (V1 + Z)] + (1 − λ) E [φ (V1 )]
  ≥ E [φ (V1 + Z)], where the last inequality is true because E [φ (V1 )] ≥ E [φ (V1 + Z1 )].


                                                                          41
    Second, to prove the converse of the above statement by contradiction, we assume (57) is true, but there
exist x1 < x2 , both occur with positive probability such that η (x1 ) < η (x2 ). We a random variable Y :
                                                (
                                                    0   X = x1 or x2
                                          Y =                        .
                                                    X     otherwise

and denote P1 = P (X = x1 ), P2 = P (X = x2 ). Note that
                            Z
                                DI [X] · (X − E [ X| Y ]) dP
                            Z
                        =    η (X) · (X − E [ X| Y ]) dP
                                                                                       
                                          P1 x1 + P2 x2                     P1 x1 + P2 x2
                        = P1 η (x1 ) x1 −                 + P2 η (x2 ) x2 −
                                            P1 + P2                           P1 + P2
                        > 0

because η (x1 ) < η (x2 ), a contradiction.

    The following lemma establishes the equivalence between (b) and (c).

D       Generalized Risk-Sensitive Preferences

D.1       Generalized risk sensitivity and uncertainty aversion

    Quasi-concavity is sufficient but not necessary for generalized risk sensitivity We first present
a lemma establishes that quasiconcavity implies generalized risk sensitivity.

Lemma 8. Suppose I : L2 (Ω, F , P ) → R is continuous invariant with respect to distribution, then
quasiconcavity implies generalized risk sensitivity.
    Proof: Suppose I is continuous, invariant with respect to distribution, and quasiconcave. Let X1 ≥SSD
X2 , we need to show that I [X1 ] ≥ I [X2 ]. By the definition of second order stochastic dominance, there
exist a random variable Y such that E [ Y | X1 ] = 0 and X2 has the same distribution as X1 + Y . Because
I is invariant with respect to distribution, I [X1 + Y ] = I [X2 ]. Let T : Ω → Ω be any measure preserving


                                                            42
transformation such that the invariant σ−field of T differs from the σ−field generated by X only by sets of
measure zero (see exercise 17.43 in Kechris [44]), then quasiconcavity implies that
                                                      
                            1            1
                    I         (X1 + Y ) + (X1 + Y ) ◦ T ≥ min {I [X1 + Y ] , I [(X1 + Y ) ◦ T ]} .
                            2            2

Note that because T is measure preserving and I is distribution invariant, we have I [X1 + Y ] =
I [(X1 + Y ) ◦ Th ] . Therefore, I 12 (X1 +        1
                                                                   

to show that I N j=0 (X1 + Y ) ◦ T ≥ I [X1 + Y ] for all N by induction. Note that N1

                                                                                                     j=0 (X1 + Y ) ◦
T j → E [ X1 + Y | X1 ] = X1 by Birkhoff ’s ergodic theorem (note that the invariance σ−field of T is σ (X) by
construction). Continuity of I then implies I [X1 ] ≥ I [X1 + Y ] = I [X2 ], that is, I satisfies generalized risk
sensitivity.

    It is clear from Lemma 8 that under continuity, the following condition is sufficient for generalized risk
sensitivty:

          I [λX + (1 − λ) Y ] ≥ I [X] f or all λ ∈ [0, 1] if X and Y have the same distribution.                      (58)

Clearly, this condition is weaker than quasiconcavity.26
    Next, we provide a counterexample of I that satisfies generalized risk sensitivity but is not quasiconcave.
We continue to use the two-period example in Section 3, where we assume π (H) = π (L) = 21 . Given there
are two states, random variables can be represented as vectors. We denote X = {(xH , xL ) : 0 ≤ xH , xL ≤ B}
to be the set of random variables bounded by B. Let I be the certainty equivalence functional defined on X
such that                                                      

meausres and the parameter η ≥ e . Note that I defined in (59) is not concave because φ (x) is a strictly
convex function. Below we show that I satisfy generalized risk sensitivity, but is not quasiconcavity.
    Using (58), to establish generalized risk sensitivity, we need to show that for any X, Y ∈ X such that
X and X have the same distribution, I [λX + (1 − λ) Y ] ≥ I [X]. Without loss of generality, we assume
X = [xH , xL ] with xH > xL . Because Y has the same distribution with X, Y = [xL , xH ]. We first show that
for all λ ≥ 12 ,
                                           I [λX + (1 − λ) Y ] ≥ I [X] .

Because φ is strictly increasing, it is enough to prove that for all λ ∈ 12 , 1 ,
                                                                              

Because xH > xL , for all λ ≥ 21 , λxH + (1 − λ) xL ≥ λxL + (1 − λ) xH and

    Lemma 8 requires the underlying probability space to be non-atomic. The statement in (58) remains
true if we assume that the underlying probability space is finite with equality probility for all states as in the

This proves (60). Similarly, one can prove I [λX + (1 − λ) Y ] ≥ I [Y ] for all λ ∈ 0, 21 . This established

    Second order expected utility Certainty equivalence functionals of the form I [V ] = φ−1 (E [φ (V )]),
where φ is strictly increasing is called second order expected utility in Ergin and Gul [28]. For this class
of preferences, generalized risk sensitivity is equivalent to quasiconcavity, which is also equivalent to the
concavity of φ. To see this, suppose φ is concave, it is straightforward to show that I [·] quasiconcave and
satisfies generalized risk sensitivity by Lemma 8. Conversely, suppose I [·] satisfies generalized risk sensitivity
then E [φ (X)] ≥ E [φ (Y )] whenever X ≥SSD Y . By remark B on page 240 of Rothschild and Stiglitz [61],
φ is concave.


    Generalized sensitivity is equivalent to quasiconcavity for smooth ambiguity preferences
Using the results in Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji [46, 47], it straightforward to show that for the
class of smooth ambiguity preference, concavity of φ is equivalent to the quasiconcavity of I. As a result,
quasiconcavity implies generalized risk sensitivity by Lemma 8. The nontrivial part of the above claim is that
generalized risk sensitivity implies the concavity of φ. To see this is true, note that invariance with respect
to distribution implies that the probability measure µ (x) must satisfy the following property: for all A ∈ F ,
                                              Z Z
                                                       dPx dµ (x) = P (A) .
                                                   A


Clearly, generalized risk sensitivity implies that I [E [V ]] ≥ I [V ], for all V ∈ L2 (Ω, F , P ). That is,
                                          Z
                                              φ (E x [V ]) dµ (x) ≤ φ (E [V ]) .

                                                                                   E x [V ] dµ (x) implies that φ must be
                                                                               R
The fact that the above inequality has to hold for all V and E [V ] =
concave.


D.2       Generalized risk sensitivity and preference for early resolution of uncertainty

Below, we provide details of Remark 3 in the discussion of preference for early resolution of uncertainty in
Section 4.2. In order to show that generalized risk sensitivity is neither necessary nor sufficient for preference
for early resolution of uncertainty, we provide two examples. The first example is a preference that satisfies
generalized risk sensitivity but strictly prefers later resolution of uncertainty and the second example is a


                                                            44
certainty equivalence functional that prefers early resolution of uncertainty but is strictly decreasing in second
order stochastic dominance.

Example 1. Consider the following utility function in the two period example:
                                                                           √ 2
                             u (C) = C − b,     where b = 2;       I (X) = E X .

It straight forward to check that I is quasi-concave therefore satisfy generalized risk sensitivity. Below
we verify that this utility function prefers late resolution of uncertainty when the following consumption
plan is presented: C0 = 1, CH = 3.21, and CL = 3, where the distribution of consumption is given by
π (H) = π (L) = 12 .
    The utility with early resolution of uncertainty is given by:

                                           WEarly = I [u (C0 ) + u (C1 )] .

It is straightforward to show that:

                                 u (C0 ) + u (CH ) = 0.21;    u (C0 ) + u (CL ) = 0

Therefore,
                                         h     √            √ i2
                                 WEarly = 0.5 × 0.21 + 0.5 × 0 = 0.0525

The utility for late resolution of uncertainty is given by:

                                      WLate = u (C0 ) + I [u (C1 )] = 0.1025.

Example 2. Consider the following preference:
                                                                     p
                         u (C) = C − b with b = 2,       I (X) =      E [X 2 ], and β = 1.

Because X 2 is a strictly convex function, the certainty equivalence functional I is strictly decreasing in second
order stochastic dominance. To see that the agent prefers early resolution of uncertainty, we consider the
same numerical example as in Example 1. It is straightforward to verify that the utility for early resolution
of uncertainty is
                                    WEarly = I [u (C0 ) + u (C1 )] = 0.1485,

and the utility for later resolution is:

                                       WLate = u (C0 ) + I [u (C1 )] = 0.11.


D.3       Asset Pricing Implications

In this section, we provide more examples of time non-separable preferences. For simplicity, we focus on a
two-period setup and consider utility functions of the following form:

                                    u (C0 ) + βE [u (C1 + αC0 )] ,     α ∈ (0, 1) .                          (61)




                                                         45
With α < 0, this is the internal habit model (for example, Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher [11]). We show in
this case the announcement premium is negative. The class of preferences with α > 0 is discussed in Dunn
and Singleton [23] and Heaton [39]. In general, the announcement premium can be positive or negative with
α > 0.
   If the representative agent’s preference is given by (61), the pre-announcement price and post-
announcement price can be represented by

                               βu′ (C1 + αC0 ) X                           βu′ (C1 + αC0 ) X

              P       =E ′                                , and P   =                             ,
                         u (C0 ) + αβE [u′ (C1 + αC0 )]               u′ (C0 ) + αβu′ (C1 + αC0 )

repectively. Therefore, the expected announcement return is
                                                        h                                  i

We make the following observations.

   1. The internal habit model: First, assume α < 0. This is the internal habit case. Because
                 1                                                               +
      u′ (C0 )+αβu′ (C1 +αC0 ) decreases with C1 for α < 0, the fact that that P (X) is an increasing
                                          ′
      function of C1 implies that βu (C1 + αC0 ) X must be increasing in C1 . Under the assumption
      α < 0 and that u is strictly concave, u′ (C0 )+αβu1′ (C1 +αC0 ) decreases with C1 . As a result,
                                                              E [P + (X)]
            n                                         o
      Cov βu′ (C1 + αC0 ) X, u′ (C0 )+αβu1′ (C1 +αC0 ) < 0 and P − (X) < 1. That is, the announcement
      premium is negative.

   2. Durable consumption goods: with α > 0, (61) is a special case of the durable consumption goods
      model of Dunn and Singleton [23]. In this case, u′ (C0 )+αβu1 ′ (C1 +αC0 ) is an increasing function of C1 .
      Here the assumption that P + (X) is an increasing function of C1 is not sufficient for the monotonicity
      of βu′ (C1 + αC0 ) X with respect to C1 . We have two cases.
      Case            1:      The       term         βu′ (C1 + αC0 ) X      increases      with   C1 .
                                                                             E [ P +
                                                                                     (X) ]
                          n                                        o
                                                      1
      In this case, Cov βu′ (C1 + αC0 ) X, u′ (C0 )+αβu′ (C1 +αC0 ) > 0, and P − (X) > 1. This implies
      that the announcement premium is positive. An example of payoff that satisfies this condition is
      X = u′ (C1C+αC
                 1
                     0)
                        .
      Case 2: The term βu′ (C1 + αC0 ) X decreases with date-1 consumption, C1 .      In this case
                                                                        E [P + (X)]
          n                                          o
               ′                       1
      Cov βu (C1 + αC0 ) X, u′ (C0 )+αβu′ (C1 +αC0 )   < 0, and we have P − (X) < 1. That is, a
      negative
      √          announcement premium. An example of payoff that satisfies this condition is X =
        u′ (C0 )+αβu′ (C1 +αC0 )
             u′ (C1 +αC0 )       .

    Using the results from Duffie and Epstein [22], the representative consumer’s preference is specified by
a pair of aggregators (f, A) such that the utility of the representative agent is the solution to the following
stochastic differential equation (SDU):

for some square-integrable process σ V (t). We adopt the convenient normalization A(v) = 0 (Duffie and
Epstein [22]), and denote f¯ the normalized aggregator. Under this normalization, f¯(C, V ) is:

                                 f¯(C, V̄ ) = ρ (1 − γ) V̄ ln C − V̄ ln (1 − γ) V̄ .

   One can verify that as dx → 0, the above Markov chain converges to the diffusion process (72) (In
   the language of Kushner and Dupuis [49], this is a Markov chain that is locally consistent with the
   diffusion process (72)).

3. With the initial guess of p (xT , T ), for t = T − ∆, T − 2∆, etc, we use the Markov chain approximation
   to compute the discounted problem in (71) recursively:

                                   p (xt , t) = ∆ + e−̟(x,t)∆ E [p (xt+∆ , t + ∆)] ,

   until we obtain p (x, 0).

4. Compute an updated pre-announcement price to dividend ratio function, p (xT , T ) using (70):
                                                        h 1−γ +                 − −i

                                                                         T , 0  x̂T , qT

   Go back to step 1 and iterate until the function p (xT , T ) converges.

 This table documents the mean excess return of the market, its standard deviation
and Sharpe ratio on announcement and non-announcement days. The mean excess
return is computed as the average daily market excess return on event days multiplied
by the average number of events per year. The first column is the average number of
events per year during the sample period. The release dates for unemployment/non-
farm payroll (EMPL/NFP) and producer price index (PPI) come from the BLS
with data starting in 1961 and 1971 respectively. The dates of Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) meetings are taken from the Federal Reserve’s website
and begin in 1994. Gross domestic product (GDP) release dates come from the
BEA’s website and Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Report (ISM)
announcement dates come from Bloomberg. Both are available after 1997.

 This Table documents the average daily return on the trading before announcements (t-1), at
announcements (t), and after announcements (t+1). Returns are measured in basis points and T-
stats based on Newey-West (5 lags) standard errors are included in parenthesis. The first column is
the total number of events during the sample period. The release dates for unemployment/non-farm
payroll (EMPL/NFP) and producer price index (PPI) come from the BLS with data starting in 1961
and 1971 respectively. The dates of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings are taken
from the Federal Reserve’s website and begin in 1994. Gross domestic product (GDP) release dates
come from the BEA’s website and Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Report (ISM)
announcement dates come from Bloomberg. Both are available after 1997.

  This table decomposes intraday and overnight returns into announcement
 day returns and non-announcement day returns. The first column is the total
 number of events during the sample period of 1997-2014. The mean return
 on event days is measured in basis points with standard error of the point
 estimate in parenthesis.

Table 5 reports the total return on equity, return on announcement days, and the risk-free interest rate in
the model with learning (left panel), those in a model where xt is fully observable (middle panel), and those
in model with learning and with expected utility (right panel). We simulate the model for 160 years and
drop the first 100 years to grantee convergence to steady-state. We run 100 such simulations and report the
sample average of the moments computed from these simulations.
