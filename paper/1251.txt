        Life—Cycle Labor Force Participation of Married Women:
                 Historical Evidence and Implications



                               ABSTRACT



The five-fold increase in the labor force participation rate of married
women over the last half century was not accompanied by a substantial
increase in the average job market experience of working women. Two
data sets giving life—cycle labor force histories for cohorts of women
born from the 1880s to 1910s indicate substantial (unconditional)
heterogeneity in labor force participation. Married women in the
labor force had a high degree of attachment to it; increased participa-
tion rates brought in women with little prior job experience and re-
duced cumulated years experience. According to extant schedules from
a 1939 Women's Bureau Bulletin, 86% of married women born around 1895
and working in 1939 had been employed 50% of the years since beginning
work, and 47% had worked 88% of those years. Average years of experi-
ence for cross sections of working married women hardly increased
from 1920 to 1950, rising from 9 to 10.5 years. Because wages are
calculated only for currently employed individuals, the steadiness
in relative wages of women to men over this period may result from
stable experience ratings for employed married women. An exploration
of the determinants of labor force persistence points to the impor
tanceof occupational choice early in the work history of a woman and
to the rise in clerical and professional occupations in extending
life—cycle labor force participation.

1 .0 Introduction:   Life-Cycle Labor Force Participation

     The   five—fold increase over the last half century in the labor
force participation rate of married women might be expected to have
been accompanied by a substantial increase in the average job market
experience of working women. Surprising as it may seem, the data

assembled here suggest that cumulated work experience for employed

married women barely increased over most of this period. Life—cycle

labor force participation provides the link between changes in static

labor force participation rates and the experience rating of the work-

ing population.i

     A   longitudinal or life—cycle dimension to the participation rate
is added here through the use of two sources containing retrospective
information on cohorts considerably older than those covered by the
two panel studies, the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) and the

Panel Study on Ircome Dynamics (PSID). The first of these sources

is a 1939 Women's Bureau Bulletin, which contains what I believe to

be the earliest retrospective information on life—cycle labor force

participation for a large sample of married women.2 The second is

a more familiar source, the Social Security records linked to the

Retirement History Survey.

     These two sources confirm for an older group of female cohorts

what has been found among more recent ones: Married women who are



1The labor force participation rate is a static measure, giving the
percentage of individuals working or seeking a job sometime in the
week preceding the census, or, prior to 1940, the percentage who stated
that they had an occupation during the census year.

Labor.

in the labor force have a high degree of attachment to it. Extant

schedules from the 1939 Women's Bureau Bulletin indicate that among

married women in the cohort born between 1891 and 1900 and in the

labor force in 1939, 86 percent had worked 50 percent of the years

since beginning work and 47 percent had worked 88 percent of the years

since beginning work. Among women not in the labor force in 1939

only 19 percent had worked 50 percent of the years since beginning

work and merely 2 percent had worked 88 percent of the years. The

determinants of labor force commitment are also explored with this

data set. The Social Security Administration records tell a simil-

ar story: Among white married women in the cohort born 1906 to 1910

and in the labor force in 1953, 48 percent would eventually participate

in the labor force almost 90 percent of the years covered in the data,

those from 1951 to 1969.

     Estimates of the experience rating of women employed within the

years 1910 to 1980 and born between 1875 to 1925, are generated from

these two sources. According to these estimates, the average years

of experience for a cross section of working married women hardly

increased from 1920 to 1950 (rising from about 9 years to 10.5 years)

despite substantial increases in the labor force participation rate

of this group. The estimates of labor force experience generated

from these data are consistent with those produced for the period

1940 to 1980 (Smith and Ward 1983), although by a different technique.

    The apparently anomalous findings concerning changes in labor

force participation and cumulated experience owe to the substantial

fraction of married women who stay in their present working state
                                   —3—


from   year to year. Increases in the labor force participation rate
increase   the pool of working women and thus raise the experience rating

of the entire population of women. But the experience rating of the

working population will remain relatively constant, because those

drawn into the labor force will have far lower experience ratings

than those already working.

       Because wages are calculated only for individuals who are current-

ly employed, the steadiness in relative wages of women to men over

this time period may result, at least in part, from rising labor force

participation rates and thus stable experience ratings for employed

married women. The absence of a positive relationship between relative

wages and female labor force participation has puzzled many observers.

       The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 derives

analytical expressions for experience ratings under two extreme assump-

tions, "perfect homogeneity" and "perfect heterogeneity." Section

3 examines the life—cycle labor force participation data in the two

surveys that span the half decade from 1920 to 1970 and analyzes some

of the determinants of life—cycle labor force participation. Section

4 uses these data and the analytical expressions of Section 2 to derive

estimates of experience ratings of the working female population from

1920 to 1950.

2.0 Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity of Female Labor Supply

       If the labor force participation rate of married women is, say,

40 percent, does it mean that 40 percent of all married women are

always in the labor force, with the other 60 percent permanently out?

Or does it mean that each woman is employed 40 percent of her life-
                                 -4-
time?    The truth will certainly lie somewhere between these extremes,

of homogeneity and heterogeneity, but the degree to tends to to one

or the other will determine the accumulated labor force experience

of working women and thus the wages women relative to those of men.3

     A population of women who are "perfectly homogeneous" with respect

to labor supply will be defined as having identical probabilities

of being in the labor force. If homogeneity is conditional on various

characteristics, such as education and husband's income, women within

these groups would have identical lifetime labor supply, except for

the ex post realization of a draw from an identical distribution deter-

mining   when employment will occur.4 If the labor force participation
rate (L) is interpreted as the probability a woman will be in                the

labor force that year and if it is unchanging with age, the average

employment spell is the sum of the series {1/Lt}, t =   0,   .   .   . ,n.
     At the other extreme is the notion of heterogeneous labor supply.

If the labor supply function is unchanging with age, women who are

"perfectly heterogeneous" are "stayers," being either in or out of

the labor force. In general, "perfectly heterogeneous" women remain

in or out of the labor force consistent with the aggregate labor supply



3Ben—Porath (1973) and Heckman and Willis (1977) posed the same ques-
tions.
4mroughout this discussion the notions of heterogeneity and homogeneity
will be made with reference to the unconditional probabilities of
being in the labor force. See Heckman and Willis (1977) for a discus-
sion of the conditional probabilities with reference to these concepts
and their reply to Mincer and Ofek (1979), (Heckman and Willis, 1979),
in which they discuss these concepts in unconditional terms. The
conditional probabilities are relevant to interpreting the parameters
from labor supply equations used to estimate income and substitution
effects. The unconditional probabilities are relevant here to estimat-
ing experience ratings for the working population of women.

data.5 If labor force participation increases over time, entrants

are drawn into the labor force from the pool of women who have rarely

or never yet been employed. When cohort participation rises with

age, as it   has   in the United States, "perfect heterogeneity" implies

that  the highest labor force participation rate achieved by a cohort
will be the maximum percentage of this cohort ever to be in the labor
force, LMAX. Likewise [1—LMAX] is the percentage who will never be
in the labor force over the life-cycle.
     Mincer (1962, 1966) had assumed that the average female labor
force   participation rate for a cohort was the percentage of time a

randomly selected woman in that cohort would work over her lifetime.

Her life—cycle decisions, therefore, were to choose this percentage

and then allocate it over time. Ben—Porath (1973) had questioned

this logic in light of data in the 1960 Census suggesting that women

who    were not in the labor market in 1960 had worked very little during
the    decade before. "That is, even though these data do not refer

to experience under static conditions, they indicate that a fair amount

of current nonparticipation in the labor force represents permanent'

nonparticipation" (p. 701).

        The evidence that first prompted Ben-Porath to question the pre-

sumed notion   of homogeneity was suggestive but weak. Considerably
better    data are now available, in both the NLS and the PSID. Heckman


5mat is, if labor force participation for each cohort were an increas-
ing function of age, then those in the labor force at the start of
their lives would remain in and be joined later by others with no
labor market experience. If, on the other hand, labor force participa-
tion were a decreasing function of age, women would exit from the
labor force. A bimodal configuration would require first an exit
and then an entrance of those exiting most recently.
                                    —6—

and Willis (1977), among others, have made extensive use of these

panel data to analyze the nature and determinants of life—cycle labor

force participation. While the determinants of life—cycle labor force

participation continue to be elusive, its nature has become decided-

ly clearer.6 The two panel studies (NLS and PSID) have provided distri-

butions of the actual percentage of a woman's married life—time spent

in the labor force. For cohorts born from 1922 to 1932 this distribu-

tion is not center weighted, as would be impied by the homogeneity

assumption, but is vaguely U-shaped, having a larger mass in the high-

est than in the preceding decile.

     Because these data span a period of rapidly rising labor force

participation rates, any distribution of years worked would tend toward

the uniform or the fat—tailed unimodal, even if there was considerable

underlying heterogeneity.7 Such heterogeneity would, under stable

conditions, result in a U—shaped distribution. The increase in partici—


6See Heckman and Willis (1979) for a criticism of their "beta—logistic"
procedure which assumes constant (conditional) participation probabili-
ties over time. The data indicate, however, that these probabilities
change with time, due to true state dependence, to unmeasured variables
such as fixed entry costs, or to a changed impact of certain variables,
such as number of children, which they treat as constant over time.
71f women are homogeneous, all have an identical value for the percent-
age of their lifetime in the labor force, and the density function
will have the entire mass at that percentage, generally somQwhere
between 0 and 1. If, instead, the population of women is heterogeneous
and the labor supply function for the cohort is neither rising nor
falling with age, the distribution of years in the labor force for
a cohort will have one mass at 0 and another 1. The distribution
of individuals between these two masses would depend entirely on the
participation  rate. If the labor force participation rate is rising
with age for the cohort, the density function would have a mass at
0 and then decrease. Therefore even if there was considerably under-
lying heterogeneity, rising cohort participation rates with age would
cause the distribution of years worked to be vaguely uniform. If
some of the population had homogeneous labor supply, a mixture of
these two distributions would be unimodal and fat-tailed.
                                 -7—

pation arises in part because prior nonparticipants are drawn into

the labor market. The greater is this increase in participation,

the smaller will be the mass at zero years of experience.    The degree

to which the population of women is heterogeneous or homogeneous with

respect to labor force participation is critical to understanding

occupational segregation by sex, wage differentials between men and

women, and the responsiveness of women's labor supply to changes in

their wage rates.

     If women are identical, but there is random variation in the

timing of children, then all would be in the labor force the same

percentage of their lifetimes, but each would vary   labor   market entry

and exit accordingly. Within such a world, women would have relatively

high turnover and would not amass much job-related human capital.

Consider instead a world in which women are heterogeneous with respect

to labor supply. Women in this labor force would be "stayers" and

remain in for rather long durations. A woman who joined the labor

force early in life should, if unconstrained, have choosen an occupa-

tion and a training path more like that of a man, whose life—cycle

labor force participation is generally uninterrupted. If the aggregate

female labor force participation rate is increasing over time, women

just entering the labor force would come from the pooi of previous

nonparticipants, and their choice of occupation would depend upon

the amount of time they would remain in the labor force.

     Thus even with identical participation rates by age, extreme

differences in the accumulated experience of women could arise between

these two worlds, one of "perfectly homogeneous" and one of "perfectly
                                 -8-

heterogeneous" women. In general the world of heterogeneous women

would have the greatest degree of accumulated labor force experience

of working women, a higher average wage for currently working women,

and an occupational distribution most resembling that for men, ceteris

paribus. Analytic ii expressions for the average labor market exper-

ience of working women in homogeneous and heterogeneous populations

will show how experience ratings respond to changes in labor force

participation rates.

     Two functions are needed in the analysis that follows: a labor

force participation rate function that varies with age for each cohort,

L(A), and an age structure of the population, f(A). It will be assumed

for simplicity that these two functions are stable over time, and

therefore that the cross—section and cohort functions are the same.

The empirical work of Section 4 relaxes this assumption.

     The relationship between labor force participation and age must

first be examined. Participation rates for cohorts of married white

women in the United States born from 1855 to 1955 have risen with

age, as can be seen from the solid lines in Figure 1.8 In cross sec-

tion, however, the participation rate for married white women has

declined with age before 1950 and has had a bimodal shape for the

period after (the dotted line in Figure 1 gives 1970 data).

     Assume therefore that participation rises with age, as has been

the case for white, married cohorts, such that

     L                                                           (i)
8These results are virtually unaffected by adjustments for urbanization
and reflect the extraordinary increases over time in the participation
rates of adult women. See Goldin 1983.

is   the labor force participation rate (0 < L < 1), a linear and posi-

tive function of age (A), 3 > 0. If AB is the age at which work begins

and AM is the age at which work terminates for the cohort (the age

at retirement or the present age of the cohort if prior to retirement

age), then the following expression gives year's experience (EXP)

for a working woman of age A in the homogeneous case


      EXP =      f AM ( + A)    dA                                      (2)
                AB

      Mean experience for a cross section of such cohorts (EXP*) can

be derived in two ways. The first involves multiplying each participa-

tion rate by the number of years it is experienced by participants,

(AN —   A), and then weighting this quantity by the age distribution
of te working population of women. Let the population density func-

tion be f(A),9 such that

             AM
             f f(A) dA =   1

        AB

an the global female labor force participation rate be


      X =        IAN ( e4- A)   f(A) dA


Then the age distribution of the          working population is: {f(A)(+A)}/X.
The average experience of a cross section of working women will be

given bylO

       EXP* =        fAM ( + A)   (AM_A) {f(A) (+ A)/x' dA              (2')
                 AB


9The age distributions of the various cohorts and cross sectLons will
differ if the population is not stable.
101n the homogeneous case if all women die after AM and the population
is stationary, i.e. f(A) is uniform, EXP* = (EXP/2).
                                              -10-

Alternatively, one can weight each of the cohort experience ratings,


EXP(AN) =     I AN ( c+ A) dA, by the age distribution of the working
             AB

population to get


     EXP* =        I AMEXP(AN)         {f(AN) (   O+ A)/X}      dAN                (2' ' )
                  AB

Intuitively one wants the experience of all cohorts in the cross sec-

tion weighted by each cohort's contribution to the working population.

The weight of each cohort depends on both its proportion in the popula-

tion and its participation rate, namely f(AN)(a÷AN), for a cohort

at age AN.

     In the heterogeneous case, year's experience (ExP') of a working

woman at age AM is given by


     EXP' =       f AM ( c+ A) dA/( c-- SAM)                                       (3)
              AB

Thus EXP' EXP/LMAX, where LMAX =                  (c--AM),   because in the heterogeneous

case only LMAX fraction of the female population is ever employed,

and L1-LMAX] is never employed over the life-cycle.

     Mean experience for the cross section is again obtained by inte-

grating over the working population, and weighting by the age distribu-

tion of the working population.

     The mean experience of a cross section of heterogeneous women

who are currently working is given by

                           AM
      EXP* =           f        EXP(AN) {f(AN)/X} dAN                              (3')
                  AB

where EXP(AN) is the experience of a homogeneous cohort of age AN,
                                    -11 -


because the L(AN) terms in the numerator and denominator cancel each—

other.

       The following propositions hold even when labor force

pation rates are identical in these two worlds of "perfectly

ous" and "perfectly heterogeneous" women:

       (i) EXP' > EXF and EXP* > EXP: the mean experience of both

cohorts and cross sections of working women will be greater in the

heterogeneous case;

       (2) Exp/ B13 > 0 but EXP'/ 3 < 0: increasing the gradient of

the labor force participation schedule with respect to age will always

increase experience of the cohort in the homogeneous case, but will

reduce average experience in the heterogeneous case; and

       (3)   EXP/o. >   0 and BEXP'/c> 0: increasing the intercept will

increase experience for the cohort except in the heterogeneous case

with         0.

       The intuition behind these results can be seen more clearly with
reference to Figure 2, which gives a linear, upward sloping labor
force participation rate schedule. In an extreme version of the homo-
geneous case, women at each age spend L(A) fraction of that year in

the labor force and all are present in the labor force at some time

each year. An increase in the tilt of this function will increase

the average experience of this population. In the heterogeneous case,

however, point LMAX gives the maximum fraction of women in the cohort

who are ever in the labor force over the life-cycle. Thus [1-LMAX]

gives the fraction whose labor market experience is zero. The steeper

is this function, given LMIN or , the greater is the area underneath
                                    —12—


the   curve. At the same time, however, the greater is the fraction

of   individuels with rele bive y   brief experence a the         snalle r is
the   fraction   with rio experie1ce, who are excluded fom the bXP' mean.

In an extreme example, if 13     = 0,   then EXP'   [AM -   AB,   the maximum

possible number of years, and any increase in 3 must reduce EXP'.

      The implications of these results for relative wages of women

to men are straightforward, if productivity and occupational choice

are determined solely on the basis of expected number of years in

the labor force.11 For the same configuration of labor force participa-

tion rates by age, wages should be higher in the heterogeneous case,

because EXP' > EXP. If, however, labor force participation rates

are increasing over time, particularly with 313 / 3t > 0, although pos-

sibly even with 3ci/3t > 0, wages can decrease in the heterogeneous

case while rising in the homogeneous case.

      Further complications can be added if the length of breaks in

participation also determines wages and occupations. The implication

regarding wages is then ambiguous and would depend on the degree to

which labor market training depreciated with time away from the labor

force. If depreciation were exponential in time, women in the homogen-

eous case who enter and exit with much frequency would retain more

human capital than would those in the heterogeneous case whose gaps

in participation were much greater.

      Concern in this paper centers primarily around measuring the



The simplest way to view the relationship between experience ratings
and relative wages is to assume, as a first approximation, that the
wage equations for both men and women are linear in the logs of experi-
ence and other variables, such as schooling.

extent to which women who work in the labor market differ from those

who do not work at some particular time. Distributions will be sought

for the percentage of time that women have work?d in the labor market

since marriage or since the time work experience began, both for those

currently at work and for those not at work.

3.0 Quantitative Evidence on Life-Cycle Labor Force Participation
of White Married Women

    3.1 Data Sources

     Two types of data provide useful evidence on life—cycle labor

force participation: longitudinal or panel studies, in which indivi-

duals are reinterviewed over a considerable period of time, and retro-

spective surveys of work experience gathered at one point in time.

The longitudinal data, whose collection was initiated with the NLS

and the PSID around 1967, are the most reliable and accurate. The

drawbacks of these two longitudinal data files are that they cover

only the period since 1967 longitudinally (although that before 1967

is covered retrospectively) and only women born since about 1923,

those 30 to 44 years old in 1967, are included.

     Also of the panel form are the rich data files of the Social

Security Administration (see Ruggles and Ruggles 1977) that have been

linked to three data sets: the Current Population Survey, 1973; the

Retirement History Survey, 1969 to 1974; and the Internal Revenue

Data.i2 All of these data sets have the one drawback that certain

occupations and various employers were not covered by Social Security



12These three files are also known as the Exact Match samples because
individuals in these data sets have been precisely matched by Social
Security number.
                                 —14—

during the entire period under consideration. Domestic service and

agricultural workers were covered by Social Security beginning only

in 1954, although restricting the analysis to white women makes these

two occupations less troublesome.13

     Retrospective answers to questions on work experience are a second

type of data giving information on life—cycle labor force participa-

tion and can be particularly revealing if they include the work histor—

ies of those currently at work and those not currently working. A

thorough investigation of various data sets indicates that the earliest

micro—level evidence on life—cycle female labor force participation

is contained in a somewhat obscure document, Women's Bureau Bulletin

#183, "Women Workers in Their Family Environment" (1941).

     The original data in this bulletin pertained to working and non—

working women interviewed in Cleveland in 1939.14    The Women's Bureau

attempted to ensure that these were probability samples of working

women, as regarded occupation, age, and industry, and Cleveland was

a fairly representative city with regard to the proportion of its

married female population employed in 1940, nearing 20 percent at

the lower age brackets and just below 15 percent above age 35. Because



13A more severe problem arises in the case of government employees,
particularly teachers. Various state governments joined the Federal
Social Security program in 1951 when amendments to the original Social
Security Act made public employees eligible for coverage, and other
state and local governments joined when the act was changed again
in 1954 and 1956. Approximately 75 percent of all teachers were cover-
ed by Social Security in 1979, but it cannot be determined how coverage
of all public employees has changed over time with regard to sex and
occupation.

14Various Utah cities were also included in the survey but have not
been sampled because of their atypicality.

these data contain unique information and the printed tabulations
have contain numerous ambiguities, the originals were located in the

National Archives and put in machine readable form.l5 The discussion

below is based on this data file.

     3.2 Evidence on Life—Cycle Labor Force Participation from Women's
Bureau Bulletin #183

     The original schedules located in the archives contained the

data for women who were working in 1939 and those for women who were

not working, in two separate forms. Information for working women

had been coded and tabulated by the Women's Bureau in 1940, and the

original schedules were then destroyed. Index cards containing the

codes were fortunately preserved, as were their definitions. Because

the Women's Bureau was primarily interested in working women, the

data for nonworking women were not coded and the original schedules

for this group exist. A somewhat more detailed set of variables can

therefore be obtained for the women not currently working in 1939.

Complicating the analysis a bit further is that the Women's Bureau

had coded work time for the currently working women in 5 year intervals

(e.g., 5 to 10 years of employment in the same occupation, 10 to 15

years in two   similar   occupations), and therefore precise gaps in employ-

ment cannot be located for these women.

     The distributions of the percentage of years that women have




1 5The bulletin did not distinguish between tabulations of the entire
population and those of currently working women; women with continuous
work experience were not included in the tabulation of work breaks;
and the number of married women in the sample changes from table to
table. In short, it is not possible to infer from the tables alone
what the population at risk of a particular event was.

spent   in the labor force since beginning work are given in Table 1 .1 6
These   data   are arrayed by birth cohort, and the focus will be primarily

on the older women, whose life—cycles were already near or at comple-

tion in 1939. The sample contains 96 women 50—59 years old, 234 women

40-49 years old, and 467 women 30—39 years old, and is already from

a relatively homogeneous group of urban, married women whose spouses

were present in 1939.

     The substantive finding of Table 1 is that married women currently

at work in 1939 had considerably different previous labor market

iences than had those not at work in 1939. For women 40—49 years

old in 1939, fully 47      percent had participated in the labor force
for over 87.5 percent of the time since they had first worked. Al-

though this number drops to about 26 percent for the oldest age group

(50—59 years old), fully 44 percent of them had been in the labor

force for 75 percent of the time since they had begun work.

     The data for women not currently working (in 1939) are in stark

contrast (see Table 1, Part B). The distributions of lifetime work

are exact opposites of those for currently working women. Among women

40—49 years old in 1939, 49 percent had worked less than 25 percent

of the time since they had their first job and only 1.8 percent had

worked over 87.5 percent of the time. For those 50—59 years old the



16The experience variable for those currently working differs somewhat
from that for those not currently working. For those working in 1939,
the original surveys were destroyed and the codes, constructed by
the Women's Bureau to summarize these schedules, were used. These
codes grouped work experience by years and by job continuity. The
midpoints of these groups were used, e.g. 7.5 years for 5 to 10 years.
For the sample of nonworkers, a precise measure of years of employment
was available from the original schedules.

percentage who worked less than 25 percent of the time is even higher,
65 percent. It seems clear in using this particular measure of life—
cycle labor force participation that women currently in the labor
force had worked a substantial percentage of their years since their
first   employment, but that those who were not currently in the labor

market had been infrequent participants all of their lives. These

findings are similar to those noted first by Ben-Porath (1973) and

later by Heckman and Willis (1977, 1979), but span a far earlier group

of cohorts.

     Some of this heterogeneity may have been the product of the De-

pression and may provide the exception and not the rule. Women who

had jobs in the 1930s often maintained them, and those who entered

the Depression without jobs stood a poor chance of becoming employed.

Despite the peculiarities of the decade preceding the survey, the

oldest cohorts in the sample were recounting labor market experiences

which extended well before this period, and their life—cycles were

only in part affected by the Depression years. But what ever the

underlying reasons for this heterogeneity in labor force involvement,

measured life—cycle labor force participation is nonetheless relevant

to understanding changes in work experience over time.

     The lifetime participation measure used in Table 1 ,   the percentage

of years worked since beginning work, had been dictated by the surviv-

ing information in the records. A better measure would be the extent

of participation since the time of marriage. Such information does

exist for many of the nonparticipants, but not for those currently

working. All of the current nonparticipants in the sample had once
                                 -18-

worked in the labor force, generally before marriage, and Table 2,

Part A summarizes their work histories by age. Most, somewhere be-

tween 50 and 60 percent, exited with marriage, and only about 25 per-

cent worked both before and after marriage. A small percentage indi-

cated that they had worked only after marriage, however some, particul-

arly in the older age groups, probably worked before marriage but

failed to recall such distant events.l7 About 10 percent did not

indicate when they had married, and therefore the relationship between

marital status transitions and the timing of labor force exit could

not be ascertained.

     Gaps in work experience for those currently working cannot be

precisely located and analyzed. Part B of Table 2 summarizes the

information that does exist on the continuity of labor force involve-

ment for this group. About one-third, independent of age, had remained

in a similar jo without a break in labor force participation since

beginning work. Another third had some break in experience but had

remained in a similar occupation, and the remaining third experienced

both a break in experience and a change in occupation.

     Labor market work began not long after school completion for

most of the age groups, but for the oldest age group, initial labor

market contact was reported to have occurred at a fairly late age,

indicating that work must have begun after marriage for many of these

women. Alternatively, and as mentioned above, the first instance


17The Women's Bureau apparently believed the data on the age at which
work began. "In Cleveland, where 8 percent of today's women workers
were not even graduated from the grammar grades, not far from half
(43 percent) of these women did not go to work until 18 years of age
or older, and a noticeable proportion not until after 25 years" (p. 3).

of labor market contact may have been forgotten. To correct for pos-

sible biases due to misreporting the year at which work began, distri-

butions (not included) similar to those in Table 1 were constructed

only for women whose reported age at first work was below 30 years.

The results do not change substantially for women under 50 years old.

But women in the oldest age group showed a far lower percentage working

over 87.5 percent of their years since beginning work, although 54

percent had still worked over 62.5 percent of these years. Thus misre-

porting and poor recall may overstate the percentage of time worked

since the first job for older women.

     The measure actually being sought for lifetime labor force partic-

ipation is the percentage of time worked since marriage. This measure

is the statistic most commonly employed to explore the life—cycle

labor force participation of married women, presumably because women

spend most of their adult unmarried years in the labor force. Includ-

ing years before marriage flattens out the total distributions, causing

them to be more uniform. The rather non—uniform distributions in

Table 1, Parts A and B for life—cycle labor force participation imply

an even stronger degree of heterogeneity within the married years.

     What accounts for the different life—cycles of the participants

and the nonparticipants? A detailed analysis of the determinants

of these persistent differences is constrained by the variables in

the survey. While these are a limited set of variables, they concern

predetermined characteristics, such as education and first occupation.

     Pooling the two sets of data, those of the workers and the non—

workers, allows estimating equations to explain current work status
                                    -20-

and the percentage of years worked since work began. Table 3        gives
two logit equations, one for WORK (1=in the labor force in 1939) and

another     for PERCENT, (experience/age -    age at which work began).

Cross—tabulations indicate that workers had more education than non—

workers, were younger, began work at an older age, and were less likely

to have begun work in a manufacturing job. The regression on WORK

adds important new results: A woman's first occupation affects later

work experience independent of years schooling and the age at work

entry, and beginning in a manufacturing job reduces the probability

of later work by about 13 percentage points. Because the omitted

occupation    is "unskilled," it    appears that women who persisted in
the   labor market the   greatest fraction of years since work began were

both   those who were initially in highly paid jobs and those who began
in low paying jobs. The absence of information    on husband's and other

family   members' income, as well as non—labor income, prevents a com-
plete understanding of the role of first occupation.
       The regression explaining PERCENT, the percentage of time worked
since work began, was run across two samples,       the original pooled

sample   and a subsample of women whose first work experience occurred
prior to age 31. The results do not differ markedly, and only those
from the full sample are given. The important findings again concern
the role of first occupation, independent of education and the age
at   which work began. Beginning in a sales or manufacturing job reduced
time spent in the workforce by about 11 percentage points below     that

in professional and clerical jobs as       well as those categorized as
unskilled (the omitted group).

     The role of first occupation is important in understanding trends

over time in the labor force participation of women. Early in this

century the economy's jobs were dominated by those in the agricultural

and manufacturing secors, and women were frequently employed as domes-

tics and operatives. The swift growth of the clerical sector in the

mid—twentieth century changed the type of jobs employing women. These

occupations differed in fundamental ways: Manufacturing jobs had

earnings—experience functions that rose rapidly with time on the job;

increased little with education, and reached an early plateau. There

is evidence to suggest that earnings fell both with time away from

the job and with age itself. The earnings function for clerical work

was quite different, rising less rapidly, rewarding formal training,

and depreciating little with time away from the job and not at all

with age.18 Thus it is not surprising that the women in this sample

who began in manufacturing positions exited from the labor force at

an early age and those who began in professional and clerical jobs

(but not sales which put a premium on youth) persisted. These results

provide further evidence that the evolution of work for married women

required particular types of occupations or earnings functions.

     The data included in this Women's Bureau survey span primarily

the 1920s and 1930s, and while the labor force participation rate

of married women was expanding at that time, these decades were not

ones of remarkable change. The 1950s and 1960s, however, witnessed

more rapid increases in participation rates particularly for women

      3.3 Social   Security-Retirement History Survey Exact Match Data

      The records of the Social Security Administration are a further

data source for information on life—cycle labor force participation

 for cohorts born before those covered by the NSL and the PSID. Of

the several data sets that have been linked to them, the Retirement

History Survey (RHs) contains the largest number of older women (Hen—

retta and O'Rand, 1980; Irelan 1972; and Mallen, 1974). it is import-

ant to bear in mind that this survey was not meant to be a probability

sample and that only the wives of survey respondents will be used.19

      Furthermore, and as mentioned previously, Social Security coverage

varied over time and for certain jobs. Despite these complications,

the results of the analyses below will indicate conclusively that
female   life—cycle labor force participation was characteristically
heterogeneous during the 1950s and 1960s. Because these were times
of   rather large increases in the participation rate of married women,

this finding implies that the labor market experience rating of the

working population may have fallen over these years, even though the

experience of the entire female population must have risen.

      The distribution of years worked since 1951 given in Table 4,

Part A covers women who were between 54 and 63 years old in 1969,

that is 36 to 45 years old in 1951. Labor market work for a year

is defined as working for at least two quarters, a definition, differing



19Certain restrictions were placed on the sample for comparability with
other data sets. Only white, married women between the ages of 54
and 63 in 1969 who were the first wives of the male respondents in
the sample were selected.

from that used above but similar to that used in analyses of the NLS

and PSID retrospective portions.20 The distribution of years worked

is similar to both the NLS sample (Heckman and Willis 1979) and a

labor force weighted average of the 1939 data in Table 1. A substan-

tial mass forms around 0 years, and a sudden upturn occurs at the

maximum possible, 19 years.

     Distinctions between current workers and nonworkers become more

obvious by conditioning the distribution on prior work experience

in a particular year,. Working in any either 1953, 1960, or 1965

radically alters the distribution, as can be seen in Part B. Among

the women in the younger age cohort who worked in 1960, about 70 per-

cent would eventually work over 13 of the total 19 years, that is

they would work 70 percent of the period 1951 to 1969. Fully 48.3

percent of those in the older cohort who worked in 1953 would eventual-

ly work 90 percent of the years from 1951 to 1969; 40.9 percent of

those working in 1965 would work 90 percent of these 19 years. But

of those not working in 1960, 84.7 percent would eventually work fewer

than 5 years; 64.3 percent would not participate at all (defined as

never working two quarters in any one year).




20Labor force participation rates from 1951 to 1969 calculated in this
way for the cohort born 1906—1915 are surprisingly similar to the
actual rates achieved by this group, although those computed from
the Social Security data have sharp breaks reflecting the amendments
to the Social Security Act in 1951 and 1956. The computed rates should
be somewhat lower than the official participation rates because Social
Security coverage is incomplete. The definition of participation
imposed on the SSA data must inflate participation somewhat.

4.0 Implications of Life—Cycle Labor Force Participation Data

     Labor market experience of working and nonworking married women

can be computed directly from the labor force histories in the 1939

sample. Women 40-49 years old and in the 1939 work force had worked

15.71 years since beginning work, while those not in the labor force

in 1939 had worked 7.44 years, less than half that time. The figures

for the 30—39 year aids are absolutely lower, but are higher as a

percentage of years since beginning work, 12.35 years for those working

in 1939 and 5.62 years for those not.

     Cohort labor force participation rates for women who were born

around 1895,and thus were 40-49 years old in 1939, imply from Figure

1 an a of about 0.02 and a    of about 0.0027, the two parameters of

equation (i). Equations (2) and (3), functions of these two para-

meters alone, yield values of EXP =   2.7 years and EXP' = 19.0   years,

for the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases respectively (AB = 20

and AM =   45).   The actual values of experience for this cohort are

considerably closer to the perfectly heterogeneous than the perfect-

ly homogeneous case, which is consistent with the life—cycle labor

force participation of current participants in Table 1.

    The construction of aggregate experience ratings requires an

assumption about the distribution within the working population of

the two types of individuals, heterogeneous and homogeneous. Define

a heterogeneous individual as one who has spent mare than 62.5 percent

of her years since beginning work ii the labor force. Using this

definition, the data in Table 1 indicate that 72 percent of the women

40—49 years old were heterogeneous. A weighted average of the two
                                    -25-

experience ratings for this cohort is 14.5 years, reasonably close

to the actual one of 15.71, which includes years worked before marri-

age. The homogeneous and heterogeneous experience ratings for the

30—39 year old cohort are 2.7 and 14.2 respectively, given c =       0.02
and    =   0.0049.   The weighted average, once again using the definition

of heterogeneity as more than 62.5 percent, is 10.2, roughly comparable

to the actual figure of 12.35, again considering the average number

of years worked before marriage.

      Labor market experience for all cohorts of women born from 1875

to 1925 can be estimated using this technique across the years 1900

to 1980, as has been done in Table 5. The two parameters of the labor

force equation (c and ) have been approximated from the data under-

lying Figure 1 ; the heterogeneous proportion of the current labor

force at each age, assumed to be stable over time, is given by the

1939 data (which are consistent with the Social Security data).

      The experience ratings simulated in this manner for the currently

working population increase little over this long time period, despite

substantial gains in labor force participation (see Table 1). For

40—49 year olds, years of work experience accumulate at 0.43 percent

per year from 1920 to 1940 and at only 0.20 percent per year from

1940 to 1970. Across the entire 50 year period the increase for this

age group is from 13.3 years to just 15.4 years, and increases for

the other age groups are comparable. In the 1950s, when female labor

force participation expanded rapidly, experience ratings increased

by the smallest percentage, because of the increase in      and the sub-

stantial proportion of women with heterogeneous labor supply. The

    These two numbers, below the line, give the homogeneous and hetero-
geneous experience ratings for the 40-49 year old age group.

Notes: The homogeneous and heterogeneous cases have been computed
with equations (2) and (3), assuming AB = 20 years, (that is the mean
age at first marriage is assumed to be 20 years), and AM =            the   average
of the age group:
     eq.(2) EXP = a(AM - AB) + (/2)(AMAM - ABAB), and
       eq.(3) EXP'= EXP/( a± I3AM).

The parameters a and   have been derived from the data underlying
Figure 1. The computation of the total experience rating assumes
that the percentage of women who are "perfectly heterogeneous" by
age is:
          20—29   years   80%,
          30-39   years   80%,
          40—49   years   72%, and
          50—59   years   66%, as derived from the data in Table 1.
                                  —26—

experience rating of the heterogeneous component alone frequently

decreased during the decades when    increased, (it would have to if

 a were constant). The average experience rating for 40—49 year olds

increased over the thirty year period 1940 to 1970, but only because

the homogeneous component did (see the disaggregated results).

     The aggregate experience rating for the entire population of

working women can be obtained by weighting by the age distribution

of the female labor force, as in equations (2') or (2'') and (3').

The aging of the female labor force over this period caused the aggre-

gate experience rating to increase slightly more than the separate

entries do by age, and it rose from 9.06 in 1930, to 9.78 in 1940,

and reached 10.52 in 1950, the last year for which all four age groups

appear in Table 5.

     These results are consistent with those of Smith and Ward (1983)

who estimate life—cycle labor force participation by a different in-

direct procedure. According to their estimates the labor market experi-

ence of working women aged 40 remained roughly constant at 13.5 years

from 1940 to 1980, while at same time the work experience of the entire

population of women aged 40 rose by over 4 years.21

     In sum, the two data sets giving life—cycle labor force histories

for cohorts of women born from the 1880s to 1910s indicate substantial

(unconditional) heterogeneity in labor force participation. Women

who were in the labor force when married tended to remain in and were


21A simple average of the columns in Table 8 for the 30-39 and 40-49
age group yields average experience ratings of the working population
of 40 year old women that begins at 12.82 years in 1915, increases
to 14.03 years by 1935 and then increases gradually to 14.53 across
the thirty year period to 1965.
                                 -27-

joined by others whose entry expanded the labor force participation

rate. An exploration of the determinants of labor force persistence

points to the importance of early occupational choice, with women

who began in   manufacturing jobs tending to exit from the labor force
upon marriage. The substantial heterogeneity of labor force participa-

tion meant that the accumulated work experience of the currently em-

ployed population of married women barely increased during periods

of rising labor force participation.

     These results have important implications for the relative con-

stancy in the ratio of female to male wages. The relative stability

of the experience ratings for the working population of married women

suggests that the steadiness of the ratio of female to male wages

over much of this century is consistent with the increase in labor

force participation during that time period.22




22The constancy of the experience rating of working married women cannot
explain the absolute level of the ratio of female to male earnings,
but can, at least in part, explain the constancy of the ratio over
time. Furthermore the simultaneity of labor force participation and
wage rates has not been explored here.
