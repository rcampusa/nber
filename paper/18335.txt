Which Financial Frictions? Parsing the Evidence from the Financial Crisis of 2007-9

The financial crisis of 2007-9 has sparked keen interest in models of financial frictions and their impact
on macro activity. Most models share the feature that borrowers suffer a contraction in the quantity
of credit. However, the evidence suggests that although bank lending to firms declines during the
crisis, bond financing actually increases to make up much of the gap. This paper reviews both aggregate
and micro level data and highlights the shift in the composition of credit between loans and bonds.
 Motivated by the evidence, we formulate a model of direct and intermediated credit that captures
the key stylized facts. In our model, the impact on real activity comes from the spike in risk premiums,
rather than contraction in the total quantity of credit.

1     Introduction
The financial crisis of 2007-9 has given renewed impetus to the study of financial frictions
and their impact on macroeconomic activity. Economists have refined existing models
of financial frictions to construct narratives of the recent crisis.   Although the recent
innovations to the modeling of financial frictions share many common elements, they also
diﬀer along some key dimensions. These diﬀerences may not matter so much for story-
telling exercises that focus on constructing logically consistent narratives that highlight
particular aspects of the crisis. However, the diﬀerences begin to take on more significance
when economists turn their attention to empirical or policy-related questions that bear on
the costs of financial crises. Since policy questions must make judgments on the relative
weight given to specific features of the models, the underpinnings of the models matter
for the debates.
    A long-running debate in macroeconomics is whether financial frictions manifest them-
selves mainly through shocks to the demand for credit or to its supply. Frictions operating
through shocks to demand may be the result of the deterioration of the creditworthiness
of borrowers, perhaps through tightening collateral constraints or to declines in the net
present value of the borrowers’ projects.    Shocks to supply arise from tighter lending
criteria applied by the lender, especially by the banking sector.      The outcome of this
debate has consequences not only for the way that economists approach the theory but
also for the conduct of financial regulation and macro stabilization policy.
    Our paper has two main objectives. The first is to revisit the debate on the demand
and supply of credit to firms in the light of the evidence from the recent crisis.      We
argue that the evidence points overwhelmingly to a shock in the supply of intermediated
credit by banks and other financial intermediaries. Firms that had access to direct credit
through the bond market took advantage of their access and tapped the bond market
in large quantities.   For such firms, the decline in bank lending was largely made up
through increased borrowing in the bond market. However, the cost of credit rose steeply,
whether for direct or intermediated credit, suggesting that the demand curve for bond
financing shifted out as a response to the inward shift in the bank credit supply curve.
Our finding echoes the earlier study by Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1993), who pointed to
the importance of shocks to the supply of intermediated credit as a key driver of financial
frictions.


                                             1
   The evidence suggests a number of follow-up questions. Our second objective in this
paper is to enumerate these questions and explore possible routes to answering them.
What is so special about the banking sector? Why did the recent economic downturn
aﬀect the banking sector so diﬀerently from the bond investors?        Kashyap, Stein and
Wilcox (1993) envisaged a specific shock to the banking sector through tighter reserve
constraints coming from monetary policy tightening, thereby squeezing bank lending.
However, the downturn in 2007-9 was more widespread, hitting not only the banking
sector but the broader economy.     We still face the question of why the banking sector
behaves in such a diﬀerent way from the rest of the economy.
   If banks were simply a veil, and merely reflected the preferences of the depositors who
provide funding to the banks for on-lending, then banks would be irrelevant for financial
conditions.   A challenge for any macro model with a banking sector is to explain how
one dollar that goes through the banking system is diﬀerent from one dollar that goes
directly to borrowers from savers. Holding savers’ wealth fixed, when the banking sector
contracts in a deleveraging episode, money that used to flow to borrowers through the
banking sector now flows to borrowers directly through the bond market. Thus, showing
that the banking sector “matters” in a macro context entails showing that the relative size
of the direct and intermediated finance in an economy matters for financial conditions.
   We begin in Section 2 by laying out some aggregate evidence from the Flow of Funds
and highlight the points of contact with the theoretical literature on financial frictions.
In Section 3, we delve deeper into the micro evidence on firm-level financing decisions and
find that it corroborates the evidence in the aggregate data. Based on the evidence, we
draw up a checklist for a theory of financial frictions, and sketch a simple static model of
direct and intermediated credit that attempts to address the checklist.
   Along the way, we review the theoretical literature in the light of the evidence. Al-
though many of the recent modeling innovations bring us closer to addressing the full set
of facts, there are a number of areas where modeling innovations are still needed. We
hope that our paper may be a spur to further eﬀorts at closing these gaps.

tables L103, L104)


2     Preliminaries
2.1    Aggregate Evidence
Most models of financial frictions share the feature that the total quantity of credit to
the non-financial corporate sector decreases in a downturn, whether it is due to a decline
in the demand for credit or its supply. However, even this basic proposition needs some
qualification when we examine the evidence in any detail.
    Figure 1 shows the total credit to the US non-financial non-corporate business sector
from 1990 (both farm and non-farm). Mortgages of various types figure prominently in the
composition of total credit and suggest that the availability of collateral is an important
determinant of credit to the non-corporate business sector. The trough in total credit
comes in the second quarter of 2011, and the peak to trough (Q4:2008 - Q2:2011) decline
in total credit is roughly 8%.
    Figure 2 examines the evolution of credit to the corporate business sector in the United
States (the non-farm, non-financial corporate business sector). The left hand panel is in
levels, taken from Table L.102 of the US Flow of Funds, while the right hand panel plots
the quarterly changes, taken from Table F.102 of the Flow of Funds.
    The plots reveal some distinctive divergent patterns in the various components of
credit. In the left hand panel, the lower three components are (broadly speaking) credit
that is provided by banks and other intermediaries, while the top series is the total credit

obtained in the form of corporate bonds. The narrow strip between the bond and bank
financing is the amount of commercial paper.
   While the loan series show the typical procyclical pattern of rising during the boom
and then contracting sharply in the downturn, bond financing behaves very diﬀerently.
On the right hand panel, we see that bond financing surges during the crisis period,
making up most of the lost credit due to the contraction of loans.
   The substitution away from intermediated credit toward the bond market is remi-
niscent of the finding in Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1993) who documented that firms
reacted to a tightening of credit by banks by issuing commercial paper. While commercial
paper plays a relatively small role in the total quantity of credit in Figure 2, the principle
that firms switch to alternatives to bank financing is very much in evidence.
   Nevertheless, the aggregate nature of the data from the Flow of Funds means that
some caution is needed in drawing any firm conclusions.                                                                                                                                                         Several questions spring to
mind. The Flow of Funds data are snapshots of the total amounts outstanding, rather
than actual flows associated with new credit. Ideally, the evidence should be on the flow
of new credit.
   Second, to tell us whether the shock is demand or supply-driven, information on the
price of the new credit is crucial, but the Flow of Funds is silent on prices. A demand-
driven fall in credit would exert less upward pressure on rates than a supply-driven shock.
A simultaneous analysis of quantities and prices may enable to disentangle shocks to

                                                                                                                                                                                  4
demand from shocks to supply.
   Third, the aggregate nature of the Flow of Funds data masks diﬀerences in the compo-
sition of firms, both over time and in cross-section. The variation over time may simply
reflect changes in the number of firms operating in the market.         In cross-section, we
should take account of corporate financing decisions (loan versus bond financing) that are
related to firm characteristics.
   To address these justified concerns, we construct a micro-level dataset on new loans
and bonds issued by non-financial US corporations between 1998 and 2010. Our dataset
includes information about quantities and prices of new credit, which give us insights on
whether the quantity changes are due to demand or supply shocks. Second, our dataset
contains information on firm characteristics (asset size, Tobin’s Q, tangibility, ratings,
profitability, leverage, etc.) that previous studies have identified as drivers of the mix of
loan and bond financing. The cross-section information gives us another perspective on
how credit supply aﬀects firms’ corporate choices since we can control for demand-side
proxies.   Finally, we make use of the reported purpose of loan and bond issuances to
single out new credit for “real investment” – i.e. general corporate purposes, including
capital expenditure, and liquidity management– which allows us to focus on corporate
real activities (see Ivashina and Scharfstein, 2010). By doing so, we exclude new debt
that is issued for acquisitions (acquisition, takeover, and LBO/MBO), capital structure
management (debt repayment, recapitalization, and stock repurchase), as well as credit
lines used as commercial paper backup.
   We examine new issuances across all firms in our sample and ask whether the features
we observe in the aggregate also hold at the micro level. We find that they do. During
the economic downturn of 2007-9, the total amount of new issuances decreased by 50%.
When we look at loans and bonds separately, we uncover a 75% decrease in loans but a
two-fold increase in bonds. However, the cost of both types of financing show a steep
increase (four-fold increase for new loans, and three-fold increase for bonds). We take this
as evidence of an increase in demand of bond financing and a simultaneous contraction
in banks’ supply of loan financing.
   To shed further light on firm-level substitution between loan and bond financing, we
conduct further disaggregated tests to be detailed later. Our tests are for firms that
have access to the bond market – proxied by being rated – so that we can allow the
demand and supply factors to play out in the open. We find that loan amounts decline

                                             5
but bond amounts increase leaving total financing unchanged, while the cost of both loan
and bond financing increases. Thus, the evidence points to a contraction in the supply of
bank credit that pushes firms into the bond market, which raises the price of both types
of credit.   The micro evidence therefore corroborates the aggregate evidence from the
Flow of Funds. We conclude that the decline in the supply of bank financing trains the
spotlight on those firms that do not have access to the bond market (such as the non-
corporate businesses in Figure 1).   It would be reasonable to conjecture that financial
conditions tightened sharply for such firms.
   To understand the substitution between loan and bond financing better, we follow De-
nis and Mihov (2003) and Becker and Ivashina (2011) to examine the choice of bond versus
loan issuance in a discrete choice framework. Becker and Ivashina (2011) find evidence
of substitution from loans to bonds during times of tight monetary policy, tight lending
standards, high levels of non-performing loans, and low bank equity prices. Controlling for
demand factors, we find that the 2007-9 crisis reduced the probability of obtaining a loan
by 14%. We further corroborate the evidence in Becker and Ivashina (2011) by using two
proxies for the financial sector risk-bearing capacity (the growth in broker-dealer lever-
age, see Adrian, Moench and Shin 2011, and the excess bond premium, see Gilchrist and
Zakrajšek 2011) and document that a contraction in intermediaries’ risk-bearing capacity
reduces the probability of loan issuance between 18% and 24% depending on the proxy
employed. Finally, we investigate which firm characteristics insulate borrowers from the
eﬀect of bank credit supply shocks in the 2007-2009 crisis. Our analysis highlights that
firms that are larger or have more tangible assets, higher credit ratings, better project
quality, less growth opportunities, and lower leverage, were better equipped to withstand
the contraction of bank credit during the crisis.

2.2    Modeling Financial Frictions
The evidence gives insights on how we should approach modeling financial frictions if we
are to capture the observed features. Perhaps the three best-known workhorse models of
financial frictions used in macroeconomics are Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Kiyotaki and
Moore (1997) and Holmström and Tirole (1997). However, in the benchmark versions
of these models, the lending sector is competitive and the focus of the attention is on
the borrower’s net worth instead.     The results from the benchmark versions of these
models should be contrasted with the approach that places the borrowing constraints on

                                               6
the lender (i.e. the bank) as in Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010).
   Bernanke and Gertler (1989) use the costly state verification (CSV) approach to de-
rive the feature that the borrower’s net worth determines the cost of outside financing.
The collateral constraint in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) introduces a similar role for the
borrower’s net worth through the market value of collateral assets whereby an increase in
borrower net worth due to an increase in collateral value serves to increase borrower debt
capacity. But in both cases, the lenders are treated as being competitive and no meaning-
ful comparisons are possible between bank and bond financing. In contrast, the evidence
from Figure 2 points to the importance of understanding the heterogeneity across lenders
and the composition of credit. The role of the banking sector in the cyclical variation of
credit emerges as being particularly important.
   A bank is simultaneously both a borrower and a lender – it borrows in order to lend.
As such, when the bank itself becomes credit-constrained, the supply of credit to the
ultimate end-users of credit (non-financial businesses and households) will be impaired.
In the version of the Holmström and Tirole (1997) model with banks, credit can flow
either directly from savers to borrowers or indirectly through the banking sector. The
ultimate borrowers face a borrowing constraint due to moral hazard, and must have a
large enough equity stake in the project to receive funding. Banks also face a borrowing
constraint imposed by depositors, but banks have the useful purpose of mitigating the
moral hazard of ultimate borrowers through their monitoring. In Holmström and Tirole
(1997), the greater monitoring capacity of banks eases the credit constraint for borrowers
who would otherwise be shut out of the credit market altogether. Firms follow a pecking
order of financing choices where low net worth firms can only obtain financing from banks
and are shut out of the bond market, while firms with high net worth have access to both,
but use the cheaper bond financing.
   Repullo and Suarez’s (2000) model is in a similar spirit. Bolton and Freixas (2000)
focus instead on the greater flexibility of bank credit in the face of shocks, as discussed by
Berlin and Mester (1992), with the implication that firms with higher default probability
favor bank finance relative to bonds.       De Fiore and Uhlig (2011, 2012) explore the
implications of the greater adaptability of bank financing to informational shocks in the
spirit of Berlin and Mester (1992) and examine the shift toward greater reliance on bond
financing in the Eurozone during the recent crisis.
   Our empirical results reported below suggest that the interaction between direct and

                                              7
intermediated finance should be high on the agenda for researchers. We review the new
theoretical literature on banking and intermediation in a later section.

2.3       Focus on Banking Sector
We are still left with a broader theoretical question of what makes the banking sector
so special. In Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1993), the shock envisaged was a monetary
tightening that hit the banking sector specifically through tighter reserve requirements
that led to a shrinking of bank balance sheets.           However, the downturn in 2007-9 was
more widespread, hitting not only the banking sector but the broader economy.
       A clue lies in the way that banks manage their balance sheets.                Figure 3 is the
scatter plot of the quarterly change in total assets of the sector consisting of the five
US investment banks examined in Adrian and Shin (2008, 2010) where we plot both the
changes in assets against equity, as well as changes in assets against debt. More precisely,
it plots {(∆  ∆ )} and {(∆  ∆ )} where ∆ is the change in total assets of the
investment bank sector at quarter , and where ∆ and ∆ are the change in equity
and change in debt of the sector, respectively.
       The fitted line through {(∆  ∆ )} has slope very close to 1, meaning that the
change in assets in any one quarter is almost all accounted for by the change in debt,
while equity is virtually unchanged.          The slope of the fitted line through the points
{(∆  ∆ )} is close to zero.1
       Commercial banks show a similar pattern to investment banks.                  Figure 4 is the
analogous scatter plot of the quarterly change in total assets of the US commercial bank
sector which plots {(∆  ∆ )} and {(∆  ∆ )} using the FDIC Call Reports. The
sample period is between Q1:1984 and Q2:2010. We see essentially the same pattern as
for investment banks, where every dollar of new assets is matched by a dollar in debt,
with equity remaining virtually unchanged. Although we do not show here the scatter
charts for individual banks, the charts for individual banks reveal the same pattern.
Banks adjust their assets dollar for dollar through a change in debt with equity remaining
“sticky”.
       The fact that banks tend to reduce debt during downturns could be explained by
standard theories of debt overhang or adverse selection in equity issuance.                  However,
   1
    Notice that the slopes of the two fitted lines add up to 1 in Figure 3. This is a consequence of the
balance sheet identity: ∆ = ∆ + ∆ , and the additivity of covariance.

what is notable in Figures 3 and 4 is the fact that banks do not issue equity even when
assets are increasing. The fitted line through the debt issuance curve holds just as well
when assets are increasing as it does when assets are decreasing. This feature presents
challenges to an approach where the bank capital constraint binds only in downturns, or
to models where the banking sector is a portfolio maximizer.
   Figures 3 and 4 show that banks’ equity is little changed from one quarter to next, im-
plying that total lending is closely mirrored by the bank’s leverage decision. Bank lending
expands when its leverage increases, while a sharp reduction in leverage (“deleveraging”)
results in a sharp contraction of lending. Adrian and Shin (2008, 2010) showed that US
investment banks have procyclical leverage where leverage and total assets are positively
related.

leverage taking place in Q1:2009. Even up to the end of 2008, assets and leverage were
increasing, possibly reflecting the drawing down of credit lines that had been granted to
borrowers prior to the crisis.
   The equity series in the scatter charts in Figures 3, 4 and 5 are of book equity, giving
us the diﬀerence between the value of the bank’s portfolio of claims and its liabilities. An
alternative measure of equity would have been the bank’s market capitalization, which
gives the market price of its traded shares. Since our interest is in the supply of credit,
which has to do with the portfolio decision of the banks, book equity is the appropriate
notion. Market capitalization would have been more appropriate if we were interested in
new share issuance or mergers and acquisitions decisions.
   Crucially, it should be borne in mind that market capitalization is not the same thing
as the marked-to-market value of the book equity, which is the diﬀerence between the
market value of the bank’s portfolio of claims and the market value of its liabilities. Take
the example of a securities firm holding only marketable securities that finances those
securities with repurchase agreements.                                                           Then, the book equity of the securities firm

Reports).


reflects the haircut on the repos, and the haircut will have to be financed with the firm’s
own book equity. This book equity is the archetypal example of the marked-to-market
value of book equity.
   In contrast, market capitalization is the discounted value of the future free cash flows
of the securities firm, and will depend on cash flows such as fee income that do not depend
directly on the portfolio held by the bank.
   Since we are interested in lending decisions of intermediaries, it is the portfolio choice
of the banks that is our main concern. As such, book value of equity is the appropriate
concept when measuring leverage.                            Consistent with our choice of book equity as the
appropriate notion of equity for lending decisions, Adrian, Moench and Shin (2011) find
that market risk premiums depend on book leverage, rather than leverage defined in terms
of market capitalization.
   The scatter charts in Figures 3, 4 and 5 also suggest another important conceptual
distinction.             They suggest that we should be distinguishing between two diﬀerent hy-
potheses for the determination of risk premiums.                                In particular, consider the following


                                                                  11
pair of hypotheses.

Hypothesis 1. Risk premium depends on the net worth of the banking sector.

Hypothesis 2. Risk premium depends on the net worth of the banking sector and the
     leverage of the banking sector.

   In most existing models of financial frictions, net worth is the state variable of interest.
This is true even of those models that focus on the net worth of banking sector, such as
Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010). However, the scatter charts in Figures 3, 4 and 5 suggest
that the leverage of the banks may be an important, separate factor in determining market
conditions. Evidence from Adrian, Moench and Shin (2011) suggests that book leverage is
indeed the measure that has stronger explanatory power for risk premiums in comparison
to the level of net worth as such.
   The explicit recognition of the role of financial intermediaries holds some promise in
explaining the economic impact of financial frictions. When intermediaries curtail lend-
ing, directly granted credit (such as bond financing) must substitute for bank credit, and
market risk premiums must rise in order to induce non-bank investors to enter the market
for risky corporate debt and take on a larger exposure to the credit risk of non-financial
firms. The sharp increase in spreads during financial crises would be consistent with such
a mechanism. The recent work of Gilchrist, Yankov and Zakrajšek (2009) and Gilchrist
and Zakrajšek (2011) point to the importance of the credit risk premium as measured
by the “excess bond spreads” (EBP) (i.e. spreads in excess of firm fundamentals) as an
important predictor of subsequent economic activity as measured by industrial produc-
tion or employment. Adrian, Moench, and Shin (2010, 2011) link credit risk premiums
directly to financial intermediary balance sheet management, and real economic activity.
   Motivated by the initial evidence, we turn to an empirical study that uses micro-level
data in Section 3. We will see that the aggregate evidence is confirmed in the micro-level
data. After sifting through the evidence, we turn our attention to sketching out a possible
model of direct and intermediated credit.      Our model represents a departure from the
standard practice of modeling financial frictions in two key respects.       First, it departs
from the practice of imposing a bank capital constraint that binds only in the downturn.
Instead, the capital constraint in the model will bind all the time – both in good times
and bad. Second, our model is aimed at replicating the procyclicality of leverage where


                                             12
banks adjust their assets dollar for dollar through a change in debt, as revealed in the
scatter plots above.    Procyclicality of leverage runs counter to the common modeling
assumption that banks are portfolio optimizers with log utility, implying that leverage
is high in downturns (we review the literature in a later section).      To the extent that
banking sector behavior is a key driver of the observed outcomes, our focus will be on
capturing the cyclical features of financial frictions as faithfully as we can.
    One feature of our model is that as bank lending contracts sharply through delever-
aging, the direct credit from bond investors must expand to take up the slack. However,
for this to happen, prices must adjust in order that the risk premium rises suﬃciently to
induce risk-averse bond investors to make up for the lost banking sector credit. Thus, a
fall in the relative credit supplied by the banking sector is associated with a rise in risk
premiums. Financial frictions during the crisis of 2007-9 appear to have worked through
the spike in spreads as well as through any contraction in the total quantity of credit.
Having studied the microevidence in detail and the theory, we turn to a discussion of the
recent macroeconomic modeling in section 5. We argue that the evidence presented in
this paper presents a challenge for many of the post-crisis general equilibrium models.
Section 6 concludes.


3     Evidence from Micro Data
3.1    Sample
We use micro level data to investigate the fluctuations in financing received by US listed
firms during the period 1998-2010, with special focus on the 2007-09 financial crisis. In
our data analysis below, we will identify the eight quarters from Q3:2007 to Q2:2009 as
the crisis period.
    Our sample consists of non-financial (SIC codes 6000-6999) firms incorporated in the
US that lie in the intersection of the Compustat quarterly database, the Loan Pricing
Corporation’s Dealscan database of new loan issuances (LPC), and the Securities Data
Corporation’s New Bond Issuances database (SDC). For a firm to be included in our
analysis, we require the firm-quarter observation in Compustat to have positive total assets
(henceforth, Compustat sample), and have data available for its incremental financing
from LPC and SDC. Our sample construction procedure, described below, identifies
3,896 firms (out of the 11,538 in the Compustat sample) with new financing between 1998

                                             13
and 2010. Firm-quarter observations with new financing amount to 4% of the Compustat
sample, and represent 13% of their total assets (see Table 1).

Table 1: Frequency of new debt issuances. Compustat sample refers to all US in-
corporated non-financial (SIC codes 6000-6999) firm-quarters in the Compustat quarterly
database with positive total assets. We merge the Compustat sample with loan issuances
from the Loan Pricing Corporation’s Dealscan database (LPC) and bond issuances from
the Securities Data Corporation’s New Bond Issuances database (SDC). Percentages of
the Compustat sample are reported in square brackets. Total assets are expressed in
January 1998 constant $bln.

       Loan information comes from the June 2011 extract of LPC, and includes information
on loan issuances (from the facility file: amount, issue date, type, purpose, maturity
and cost2 ) and borrowers (from the borrower file: identity, country, type, and public
status). We apply the following filters: 1) the issue date is between January 1998 and
December 2010 (172,243 loans); 2) the loan amount, maturity, and cost are non-missing,
and the loan type and purpose are disclosed (90,131 loans); 3) the loan is extended for real
investment purposes3 (42,979 loans). We then use the Compustat-LPC link provided by
   2
     We measure the cost of loans with the all-in-drawn spread, which is defined as total (recurring fees
plus interest) spread paid over 6 month LIBOR for each dollar drawn down. On occasions, we also make
use of the all-in undrawn spread as a measure of the cost a borrower pays for each dollar available (but
not drawn down) under a credit line. Bradley and Roberts (2004) and Strahan (1999) contain further
details on how LPC computes spreads.

     Loan financing may be intended for a variety of purposes. Stated purposes (based on the LPC field
“primary purpose”) can be broadly grouped into M&A (acquisition, takeover, LBO/MBO), refinanc-
ing/capital structure management (debt repayment, recapitalization, and stock repurchase), liquidity
management (working capital and trade finance), and general corporate purposes (corporate purposes
and capital expenditure); credit lines may also serve as commercial paper backup (see, among others,
Drucker and Puri (2009) for a classification of loan purposes). Following Ivashina and Scharfstein (2010)
we consider as real investment loans those used for general corporate purposes and liquidity management.

Michael Roberts (Chava and Roberts 2008) to match loan information with the Compustat
sample, and end up with 12,373 loans issued by 3,791 unique firms.4
    Our screening of bond issuances follows similar steps to the ones we use for loan
issuances.    We retrieve from SDC information on non-financial firms’ bond issuances
(amount, issue date, cost5 , purpose, and maturity) and apply the following filters: 1) the
issue date is between January 1998 and December 2010, and the borrower is a non-financial
US firm (38,953 bonds); 2) the bond amount, maturity, purpose and cost are non-missing
(9,706 bonds); 3) the bond is issued for real investment purposes6 (7,480 bonds).                    We
then merge bond information with the Compustat sample using issuer CUSIPs, and obtain
3,222 bonds issued by 902 unique firms.
    The summary statistics in Table 2 compare our restricted sample to the full sample of
loans and bonds issued for real investment purposes. In particular, our sample includes
79% of loans issued by non-private US corporations, and represents 87% in terms of
dollar amount. Moreover, our sample captures 50% of US non-financial public firms and
subsidiaries’ bond issuances (about 57% in terms of dollar amount). On average, loans
in our sample are issued for $239 mln, have maturity of 43 months, and are priced at 217
bps (32 bps for credit lines, using the all-in-undrawn spread). These are economically
very similar to the average values in the full LPC sample.                 Relative to loans, bonds
in our sample are on average issued for larger amounts ($326 mln), longer maturities
(100 months), and are more expensive (266 bps). Again, these values are very similar to
their counterpart in the full SDC sample. The t-test for the diﬀerence in means detects
significant diﬀerences between our sample and full LPC and SDC samples for the average
issuance amount only.
Specifically, we define as real investment loans those with LPC primary purpose ‘Capital expenditure’,
‘Corporate purposes’, ‘Equipment purchase’, ‘Infrastructure’, ‘Real estate’, ‘Trade finance’, or ‘Working
capital’. After merging LPC with Compustat the vast majority of loan facilities in our final sample are
extended for corporate purposes (7,029 issuances, corresponding to 56.81% of our sample) or working
capital (4,971 issuances, 40.18% of our sample).
   4
     The May 2010 linking table provided by Michael Roberts enables us to match 11,765 loans with our
Compustat sample; we further link 608 loans issued in 2010. We match a loan (and a bond) issued in a
given quarter with Compustat data for the same quarter.
   5
     We measure the cost of bonds with the spread to benchmark, which is defined by SDC as the number
of basis points over the comparable maturity treasury. Our results are qualitatively unchanged if we
measure the cost of bonds subtracting the 6 month LIBOR from the yield to maturity (see the online
appendix).
   6
     Mirroring our classification of loans, we define a real investment bond as having primary purpose
(based on the SDC field “primary use of proceeds”) ‘Buildings’, ‘Capital expenditures’, ‘Construction’,
‘General corporate purpose’, ‘Property development’, ‘Railways’, ‘Working capital’.

Table 2: Characteristics of new issuances. This table presents means aggregated
across all firms for our sample of new debt issuances. Full LPC sample includes tranches
with valid amount, maturity, purpose and spread issued by non-private U.S. corporations
for investment purposes. Full SDC sample includes tranches with valid amount, matu-

amounts, maturities, and spreads between our sample and the full samples. For loan
issuances, "Cost" is the all-in-drawn spread and "Cost (undrawn)" is the all-in-undrawn
spread (available for credit lines only). There are 7,782 (resp. 8,817) issuances with
non-missing all-in-undrawn spread in our sample (resp. Full LPC sample). Amount is ex-
pressed in January 1998 constant $bln, cost is expressed in bps, and maturity is expressed
in months.

3.2     Patterns of new issuances
The pattern of total new credit that includes both loan and bond financing shows a marked
decline in new debt issuances and a simultaneous increase in their cost during the recent
financial crisis.

3.2.1    Total financing

The evolution of total credit (both loans and bonds) presented in Figure 6 shows a marked
decrease in total amount and number of issuances from peak to trough. This can be seen
from Panel A, which graphs the quarterly total amount of new debt (loans plus bonds)
issued expressed in billions of January 1998 dollars, with Panel C showing the averages.
Panel E graphs the total number of new debt issuances.
   Due to seasonality in new debt financing activity, we include the smoothed version of
all series (solid line) as a moving average straddling the current term with two lagged and
two forward terms. Figure 6 highlights the steep reduction in total financing as the crisis


                                               16
unfolds; total credit halved from $182.25 billions in Q2:2007, the peak of the credit boom,
to $90.65 billions during Q2:2009, the trough of the crisis. During the same period, the
number of new issuances decreases by about 30%.
       We turn to the cost of credit and its maturity. For every quarter, we use a weighted
average of the cost (in bps) and the maturity (in months) of individual facilities, where
the weights are given by the amount of each facility relative to the amount of issuances
in that quarter. Figure 6-Panel B shows that the cost of new debt quadrupled during
the crisis, from 99bps in Q2:2007 to 403bps in Q2:2009.7

3.2.2      Loan financing

Bank financing was drastically reduced during the crisis; loan issuance at the trough of
the cycle totaled $40 billion, about one quarter of loan issuance at the peak of the credit
boom ($155.69 billions during Q2:2007). The number of new loans more than halved from
318 issuances during Q2:2007 to 141 issuances during Q2:2009. This reduction in bank
lending can be seen in Figure 7, which presents the quarterly evolution of loan issuances.
The total amount of loans are in Panel A; the average amount of loans are in Panel C;
and the total number of loans issued are in Panel E.
       In parallel with the decline in loan financing activity, the cost of loans rose steeply.
Loan spreads more than quadrupled during the financial crisis, from 90bps in Q2:2007 to a
peak of 362bps in Q2:2009.8 The 2001 recession did not show such a substantial increase in
loan spreads; spreads oscillated between 128bps (Q2:2001) and 152bps (Q4:2001). Figure
7-Panel B graphs these results for the cost of loan financing.
       Maturities of newly issued loans tend to shorten during recessions, and increase during
booms, as can be seen from Panel D in Figure 7. Finally, in Figure 7-Panel F we graph
the quarterly total amount of loans by type9 (credit lines or term loans). In the aftermath
of the credit boom, both revolvers and term loans fell sharply. New credit lines totaled
   7
     With our datasets we cannot determine whether a credit line, after being extended, is indeed used.
However, Campello, Giambona, Graham and Harvey (2011) show that firms drew down on their lines
during the crisis, which suggests that the all-in-drawn spread is indeed the proper measure of the cost of
revolvers during the crisis. An alternative measure for the cost of credit lines during the crisis by using
the all-in-undrawn spread, is shown in Figure 6-Panel D. Even here, we uncover a steep increase in the
cost of new financing during the crisis, which tripled relative to pre-crisis levels (331bps during Q2:2009).
   8
     If we used the all-in-undrawn spread for revolvers during the financial crisis, the cost of bank financing
would more than double to 215bps during Q2:2009.
   9
     Our type split (credit lines and term loans) covers 97% of all loans in our sample, which is why the
sum of loan types does not add to total loan financing in Figure 7-Panel A. Loans that are not classified
include bridge loans, delay draw term loans, synthetic leases, and other loans.

$24.15 billions in Q2:2009, which is roughly 25% of the credit lines initiated at the peak of
the credit boom ($124.03 during Q2:2007). New term loans halved from $30.05 billions
in Q2:2007 to $15.68 billions in Q2:2009. Issuances of revolvers start trending upwards
from 2010 and, as of Q4:2010, total credit lines correspond to about 40% of their dollar
values at the peak of the credit boom. Issuances of term loans increase at a slower pace,
and during Q4:2010 reach about 25% of their Q2:2007 levels.

3.2.3   Bond financing

In contrast to bank lending, bond issuance increased during the crisis; issuance of new
bonds totaled $50.64 billion in Q2:2009 – about twice as much as during the peak of the
credit boom ($26.56 billion during Q2:2007). This can be seen in Figure 8. In addition, the

number of newly issued bonds doubles from 54 during Q2:2007 to 116 during Q2:2009.
Moreover, Figure 8 confirms that the credit boom in the run-up to the crisis was not
exclusively a bank credit boom, since total bond issuances increase from 2005 onwards
also.
   Figure 8 graphs the evolution of the cost and maturity of bonds (Panel B and D,
respectively).                               Several similarities emerge between loan and bond financing.                                                                                     First,
bond maturities shorten during recessions and increase during booms; this is confirmed
by comparing maturities during the years leading to the peak of the credit boom to
maturities during the latest recession.                                                                Second, the credit boom preceding the recent
financial crisis is accompanied by a reduction in spreads. Finally, bond spreads almost
tripled during the financial crisis, from 156bps during Q2:2007 to 436bps during Q2:2009,
similar to the increase experienced by loan spreads.

   The micro-level evidence permits two conclusions. First, we confirm the evidence from
the Flow of Funds that non-financial corporations increased funding in the bond market,
as bank loans shrank.                                      Secondly, credit spreads increased sharply, for both loans and
bonds. In the next two sections, we will investigate the extent to which the substitution
from bank financing to bond financing is related to institutional characteristics.
   Kashyap, Stein, and Wilcox (1993) showed that following monetary tightening, non-
financial corporations tended to issue relatively more commercial paper. The authors link
this substitution in external finance directly to monetary policy shocks, and argue that the
evidence supports the lending channel of monetary policy over the traditional Keynesian
demand channel where tighter monetary policy leads to lower aggregate demand, and
hence lower demand for credit. Under the lending channel, it is credit supply that shifts.
Kashyap, Stein, and Wilcox’s (1993) evidence that commercial paper issuance increases,


                                                                                                 20
while bank lending declines points toward the bank lending channel. We will return to
this interpretation later, when we present our model of financial intermediation.
   Our empirical findings complement Kashyap, Stein, and Wilcox (1993) in two ways.
First, we highlight the relatively larger role of the bond market compared to commercial
paper in oﬀsetting the contraction in bank credit. As we saw for the corporate business
sector in the US, the increase in aggregate bond financing largely oﬀsets the contraction
in bank lending. Second, the micro-level data allow us to observe the yields at which the
new bonds and loans are issued. We can therefore go beyond the aggregate data used by
Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox.
   We are still left with a broader theoretical question, of what makes the banking sector
special. Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox envisaged the shock to the economy as a monetary
tightening that hit the banking sector specifically through tighter reserve constraints that
hit the asset side of banks’ balance sheets. In other words, they looked at a specific shock
to the banking sector. However, the downturn in 2007-9 was more widespread, hitting
not only the banking sector but the broader economy. We still face the question of why
the banking sector behaves in such a diﬀerent way from the rest of the economy.          We
suggest one possible approach to this question in our theory section.

3.3    Closer look at corporate financing: univariate sorts
We now investigate the eﬀect of the crisis on firms’ choices between bank and bond
financing and the cross-sectional diﬀerences in new financing behavior. We work with a
sample covering four years, which we divide equally into two sub-periods – before crisis
(from Q3:2005 to Q2:2007) and the crisis (from Q3:2007 to Q2:2009).           This balanced
approach is designed to average out seasonal patterns in our quarterly data (see Duchin,
Ozbas and Sensoy 2010).
   We restrict our attention to the sample of firms that issue loans and/or bonds during
the financial crisis. By doing so, we select firms that have access to both types of funding
and address the firm’s choice between forms of credit. In selecting firms that have access
to both types of credit, we do not imply that these firms are somehow typical. Instead,
our aim is to use this sample in our identification strategy for distinguishing shocks to the
demand or supply of credit. If the cost of both types of credit increased but the quantity
of bank financing fell and bond financing rose, then this would be evidence of a negative
shock to the supply of bank credit.

                                             21
   We first examine evidence on these firms’ issuances before and during the crisis with
univariate sorts, controlling for relevant firm characteristics. For a firm to be included
in our analysis (‘new debt issuer’) we require that: 1) it issues at least one loan or one
bond during the crisis, and has positive assets in at least one quarter during the crisis;
2) it has positive assets in at least one quarter before the crisis; 3) it has non-missing
observations for the relevant sorting variable in Q2:2005. Finally, in order to investigate
possible substitution eﬀects between the two sources of financing, we follow Faulkender
and Petersen (2006) and require firms to be rated during Q2:2005, as a way of ensuring
that we select firms that have access to the bond market.
   For every firm that meets these criteria we measure cumulative new debt issuances
over the pre-crisis and the crisis period to gauge the incremental financing immediately
before the crisis (Q2:2007) and at the trough of the crisis (Q2:2009).10              The firm-level
spread on new debt is calculated as the value-weighted spread.
   We build on previous literature (Houston and James 1996, Krishnaswami, Spindt and
Subramaniam 1999, Denis and Mihov 2003) to identify the firm-level characteristics that
aﬀect corporate reliance on bank and bond financing: size and tangibility (considered as
proxies for information asymmetry), Tobin’s Q (proxying for growth opportunities), credit
rating, profitability (which proxies for project quality), and leverage. All variables are
defined in Table 8 (see Appendix B) and measured during Q2:2005. Measuring firm-level
characteristics well before the onset of the crisis mitigates endogeneity concerns.
   Table 3 provides summary statistics of these variables. The last six columns in Table
3 report the percentage of per-period new financing that is due to new debt issuers,
conditional on the availability of each sorting variable: for instance, the top row indicates
that our sample has 492 new debt issuers with valid total assets during Q2:2005, and these
new debt issuers account for 52% and 80.7% respectively of the new issuances before and
during the crisis.
   We sort new issuers in two groups (below and above median) along each of the sorting
variables, and report in Table 4-Panel A cross-sectional means of firm-level cumulative
total loan and bond financing before and during the crisis. We report the t-statistics for
diﬀerence in means during and before the crisis for amounts and spreads.
   For the vast majority of firms in our sample, we do not see statistically significant
 10
    We exclude new debt tranches (and thus, possibly firms) issued before the crisis that mature before
Q2:2007, and those issued during the crisis that mature before Q2:2009.

Table 3: Summary statistics. This table reports summary statistics for the sample
of new debt issuers. A new debt issuer is defined as a firm issuing new debt between
Q3:2007 and Q2:2009, with positive assets during the quarter(s) of issuance and during
at least one quarter between Q3:2005 and Q2:2007, and rated in Q2:2005. All variables
are measured in Q2:2005. Definitions of the variables are provided in Table 8.

diﬀerences in the amount of total financing. We find some evidence that only the more
indebted firms and those with lower ratings see lower credit during the crisis. This can be
seen in Panel A of Table 4. Moreover, total financing increases during the crisis for the
smaller and less indebted firms. Panel B highlights that the main eﬀect of the crisis is on
the cost, rather than on the amount of new debt, with two to four times wider spreads.
   Splitting new financing into loan and bond issuances reveals that loan financing signif-
icantly decreased during the crisis. New loans decreased by 35% to 50% relative to their
pre-crisis levels, with the exception of smaller firms in our subsample that experienced a
3% increase in loan financing during the crisis (not statistically significant). We also find
strong evidence that all firms resorted to more bond financing. The total amount of new
bond issuances is about 2.5 to 4 times larger relative to its pre-crisis level.             Moreover,
the cost of both loan and bond financing increased significantly for all new debt issuers:
loan spreads during the crisis are 175% and 265% larger than before the crisis, and the
increase in bond spreads ranges between 200% and 350%.

3.3.1    Discussion

The evidence speaks in favor of a (firm-level) compositional eﬀect during the recent finan-
cial crisis. Firms substitute loans for bonds, leaving the total amount of new financing
unaltered. This evidence is consistent with the bird’s eye view of the US Flow of Funds
reported at the outset and, importantly, is obtained tracking a constant sample of firms
over time.
   Taking the findings in the present subsection together with the aggregate patterns of

Table 4: Financing before and during the crisis. This table presents cross-sectional
means of new debt issuers’ financing. A new debt issuer is defined as a firm issuing
new debt between Q3:2007 and Q2:2009, with positive assets during the quarter(s) of
issuance and during at least one quarter between Q3:2005 and Q2:2007, and rated in
Q2:2005. Sorting into below and above median groups is based on variables measured
during Q2:2005. Definitions of the variables are provided in Table 8. "Before crisis"
(resp. "Crisis") refers to the eight quarters between Q3:2005 and Q2:2007 (resp. between
Q3:2007 and Q2:2009). Firm-level amounts are cumulated over the relevant periods.
Firm-level spreads are computed using the amount of each debt type relative to the total
amount of debt issued as weights. Panel A (resp. B) reports cross-sectional means of loan,
bond and total amounts (resp. spreads). We test for significant diﬀerences in corporate
financing behavior during the crisis and report the t-statistic for the paired (unpaired)
t-test for diﬀerences in amounts (spreads) during and before the crisis. ***, **, and *
denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

new debt issuances documented in section 3.2 suggests that the substitution between loans
and bonds was stronger for firms having access to both funding sources. Bank-dependent
firms suﬀered a reduction in bank financing without being able to tap the bond market
and, as a result, witnessed a marked decrease in the amount of new credit. Moreover,

we uncover a significant (both economically and statistically) increase in the cost of new
financing, thus corroborating the evidence from the aggregate patterns of new financing
in subsection 3.2.
   The evidence presented here may appear to be in contrast to Gertler and Gilchrist’s
(1993, 1994) finding that monetary contractions reallocate funding from small firms to
large firms.    However, we should bear in mind that we consider publicly traded firms
recorded in Compustat, and we further restrict our attention to rated firms, while Gertler
and Gilchrist make use of the US Census Bureau’s Quarterly Financial Report for Man-
ufacturing Corporations (QFR). The QFR is likely to pick up a relatively larger share of
small firms. Indeed, the sorting of firms by size in our Table 4 shows the smallest firm to
have $230 mln total assets and the first percentile value to be $322 mln (nominal assets
during Q2:2005). In addition, we consider a broad definition of credit (loans and bonds),
while Gertler and Gilchrist focus on short-term debt, with maturity less than one year.
   With these diﬀerences in mind, we have retrieved corporate liabilities’ data from QFR
for the period Q2:2007 to Q2:2010, by firm class size (‘All Manufacturing’ quarterly series).

Figure 9: Short-term debt for small and large firms. Cumulative quarterly growth
rates as log-deviations from their Q2:2007 values. Large (resp. small) firms are those
with total assets above $250 mln (resp. below $50 mln). Data on short-term debt are
sourced from QFR and aggregated across firm class sizes.


We compute short-term debt (the sum of loans from banks with maturity shorter than
one year, commercial paper and other short-term loans) for large firms as the sum of
short-term debt for firms in the class size $250 mln to $1 bln and those with total assets
larger than $1 bln. We view these asset class sizes as the most comparable to firms in
our sample.    Similarly we compute short-term debt for small firms by aggregating the
two size classes with assets under $25 mln and $25 to $50 mln.
   Figure 9 plots short-term debt cumulative quarterly growth rates as log-deviations
from their Q2:2007 values.                                                 It shows a marked reduction in short-term debt for small
firms relative to their pre-crisis levels. Therefore our findings on cross-sectional variation
based on firm size can be reconciled with those in Gertler and Gilchrist.
   To the extent that small firms are wholly reliant on bank lending, the brunt of any
bank lending contraction will be felt most by such firms. In the Flow of Funds, the non-
corporate business sector would correspond best to such firms. In the online appendix we
report empirical findings for non-public firms in LPC and SDC. We find that the crisis
decreases total amounts of loans by a similar magnitude as for our sample (28% at the
trough, relative to peak), and the spreads register a 5-fold increase. Bond volumes are
very small, as expected for these firms.

3.4       Financing choices: logit evidence
We now investigate the determinants of new issuances in a regression framework. Our
results extend earlier studies of Denis and Mihov (2003) and Becker and Ivashina (2011).
We adopt the methodology of Denis and Mihov (2003) to study the marginal choice
between bank and bond financing.11 We follow Becker and Ivashina (2011) by including
aggregate proxies for bank credit supply.
       To be included in our sample, we require a firm to have new credit in at least one
quarter between 1998 and 2010. In addition, firms are required to have non-missing firm
characteristics (specified below) during the quarter prior to issuance.
       For every firm-quarter ( ) in our sample with new debt issuance – be it a loan
or bond – we set the indicator variable   to be one (resp. zero) if
firm  issues a bond (resp. loan) during quarter .             For a firm issuing both types of
debt during a given quarter we set   = 1 if the total amount of bond
financing exceeds that of loan financing, and zero otherwise. Finally, we require a firm
to be rated during the quarter prior to issuance. Our final sample includes 4 276 firm-
quarter observations (2,940 loan issuances and 1,336 bond issuances, corresponding to
1 177 unique issuers) with complete information on all firm characteristics.               All firm-
characteristics are measured in the quarter prior to issuance and, with the exception of
rating, are winsorized at the 1% level. Table 8 details the construction of our variables,
and Table 5-Panel A reports summary statistics for our sample.
       Table 6-Column (1) report the results of logit regression of   on firm
characteristics. Consistent with the findings in Houston and James (1996), Krishnaswami,
Spindt and Subramaniam (1999) and Denis and Mihov (2003) we find that reliance on
bond financing is positively associated with size, project and credit quality and leverage.
       As with Denis and Mihov (2003), we do not find evidence of a significant relation
between growth opportunities and financing sources, suggesting that firms may resolve
the underinvestment problem through some unobserved characteristics of debt (such as
maturity or covenants) rather than the debt source. To gauge the economic importance
of our findings, we compute in Table 6-Panel B the implied changes in the probability of
issuing bonds for hypothetical changes in our independent variables, assuming that each
  11
     We include only firm-level variables in an attempt to isolate the eﬀect of borrower’s preferences.
Relative to Denis and Mihov (2003) we therefore exclude the amount issued because it may partially
reflect supply.

Table 5: Descriptive statistics. This table presents summary statistics of firm charac-
teristics and bank credit supply indicators for the sample used in our multivariate analysis.
We require a firm to issue new debt in at least one quarter between 1998 and 2010, to
be rated the quarter prior to issuance, and to have non-missing values for the firm char-
acterstics in Panel A. All firm characteristics are measured the quarter before issuance.
Bank credit supply indicators in Panel B are observed every quarter between Q1:1998 and
Q4:2010 with the sole exception of EBP, which is not available in Q4:2010. Definitions of
the variables are provided in Table 8.

firm characteristic changes from its 5th percentile value to its 95th percentile value while
the other variables are kept at their means. Our results highlight that financing choices
are most strongly linked with firm size. Moreover, Table 6-Panel B indicates that changes
in Tobin’s Q and tangibility are not only statistically insignificant, but have a relatively
small impact on the implied probability of bond issuance.
   To understand the impact of the recent financial crisis on corporate financing we re-
estimate a logit model adding  (an indicator variable equal to one for each of the
eight quarters between Q3:2007 and Q2:2009, and zero otherwise) to the above mentioned
control variables.      Table 6-Column (2) shows that the crisis significantly decrease the
probability of obtaining credit. The estimates in Table 6-Column (2) imply an increase
in the probability of issuing bonds during the crisis of 14% keeping firm characteristics at
their mean values.
   In order to understand better the importance of bank credit supply over the business
cycle (not just the recent financial crisis), we employ a variety of quarterly time-series
variables proxying for bank credit (Table 5-Panel B contains descriptive statistics of these
variables between Q1:1998 and Q4:2010):

                                                28
       • BD leverage. Annual growth in broker-dealer leverage computed from the Flow of
         Funds. High values of BD leverage indicate easier credit conditions. The broker-
         dealer leverage variable has been used by Adrian, Moench, and Shin (2011) to price
         both the cross section and time series of asset returns. The authors show that the
         broker-dealer leverage variable is thus a good proxy for both the time series and the
         cross section of asset returns.

       • EBP. Excess bond premium (in percentage points) as computed in Gilchrist and
         Zakrajšek (2011).12 Higher values correspond to a reduction in the eﬀective risk-
         bearing capacity of the financial sector, and thus a contraction in credit supply.
         The excess bond premium is a measure of the risk premium embedded in the cross
         section of corporate bond yields, and has strong forecasting power for real activity.

       Table 6-Columns (3) and (4) report logit regression results of   on firm
characteristics and the above measures of bank credit supply in lieu of the crisis indicator.
The previously highlighted dependence of firms’ financing choices on firm-characteristics
remains valid across all specifications. Firms with lower information asymmetries, bet-
ter credit and project quality, and more indebtedness are more likely to resort to bond
financing. Moreover, all our measures of bank credit supply measures significantly aﬀect
firms’ financing decisions, and in the direction we expected.
       In order to gauge the economic significance of our results, we consider in Panel B
changes in implied probabilities when each variable – be it a firm characteristic or a
proxy for bank credit – increases from its 5th percentile value to its 95th percentile value
while the other variables are kept at their means. We find that, depending on the proxy
employed, a contraction in bank credit supply increases the probability of bond issuances
between 17.90% (BD leverage) and 23.8% (EBP).13

3.4.1      Magnitudes

Having established impact of the financial crisis on corporate financing choices, we now
turn to investigate which characteristics insulate firms from contractions in bank credit
during the crisis. Our first empirical exercise consists of re-estimating the logit regression
every quarter, with firm characteristics only (see Table 6-Column (1)). We then compute
  12

  13
    We refer to a contraction in bank credit supply as an increase in EBP from its 5th to 95th percentile,
or a decrease in BD leverage from its 95th to 5th percentile.

                                                   29
Table 6: Corporate financing choices and bank credit supply contraction. This
table presents logit regression results to explain corporate financing choices. To be in-
cluded in the analysis, we require a firm to issue new debt in at least one quarter between
1998 and 2010, to be rated the quarter prior to issuance, and to have non-missing values
for the firm characteristics in Panel A. The dependent variable is Bond Issuance, a dummy
variable that takes a value of one if a firm issues a bond in a given quarter, and zero if
it issues a loan. Panel A reports logit regression results of Bond Issuance on a set of
control variables defined in Table 8. Controls in Column (1) include firm characteristics
only, which we augment with the Crisis indicator in Column (2), or with diﬀerent bank
credit supply indicators in Columns (3) and (4). Firm characteristics are measured the
quarter prior to debt issuance. All regressions include a constant (untabulated). Panel
B reports the implied change in Bond Issuance when each control variable increases from
its 5th to its 95th percentile value and the other variables are kept at their means. The
implied probability change for Crisis is computed when Crisis changes from 0 to 1 and
the other variables are kept at their means. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level
and reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% levels, respectively.

the implied change in the dependent variable when each firm characteristic changes from
its 5th percentile value to its 95th percentile value, while the other variables are kept at
their means. Figure 10 graphs the quarterly time-series of implied probability changes to-
gether with a five-quarter moving average (solid line) and the implied probability changes
from the panel estimation in Table 6-Column (1) (dash-dot line).14 For example, during
Q4:2010 the estimates from the logit regression predict a 26.3% and 79.4% probability of
bond issuance, respectively for a firm with  equal to 6.278 (5th percentile) and 10.386
(95th percentile) while the other firm characteristics are stuck at their Q4:2010 mean val-
ues. The rightmost point in Figure 10-Panel A corresponds to 53.1%, i.e. the diﬀerence
between these two probabilities. Figure 10 provides suggestive evidence that the larger
and more profitable firms, and those with more tangible assets and better ratings were
more likely to resort to bond financing during the crisis, while heavily indebted firms were
more likely to issue loans.

3.4.2      Interaction eﬀects

Further insights on the sensitivity of financing choice to firm characteristics can be ob-
tained by augmenting the logit regression in Table 6-Column (2) with an interaction term
between a given firm characteristic and the crisis indicator.15
       Regression results are reported in Table 7. In line with our previous findings of Table
6, the probability of bond issuance is positively related to firm size, credit and project
quality, and leverage. In addition, firms are more likely to resort to bond financing during
the crisis.
       Due to the nonlinearity, the sign of the interaction term need not correspond to the
direction of the eﬀect of firm characteristics during the crisis. Moreover, the statistical
significance of the interaction eﬀect cannot be evaluated by looking at the standard error
of the interaction term (Huang and Shields 2000). We therefore compute implied proba-
bilities of bond issuance outside and during the crisis, and test for significant diﬀerences
between them.
       Figure 11 graphs the results for the diﬀerent firm characteristics. We first consider
  14
     Figure 10 does not include Q3:1998 because a linear combination of the control variables exactly
predicts   (eight bond and eleven loan issuances).
  15
     The interaction term is very highly correlated with the crisis indicator – correlations range between
0.82 and 0.98. To avoid multicollinearity concerns, we therefore demean firm characteristics before
creating the interaction terms. As a result, correlations between the interaction term and  oscillate
between −016 and 0.28.


                                                    31
the coeﬃcient estimates of the logit model with the interaction term between size and the
crisis indicator (see Table 7-Column (1)) and compute the implied probabilities of bond
issuance during the crisis over the entire range of values for firm size, keeping the other
firm characteristics at their means. The solid line in the left panel of Figure 11-Panel A
plots these probabilities ( = 1) as a function of , and the dotted line portrays
the same probabilities evaluated outside of the crisis ( = 0). In the right panel of
Figure 11-Panel A we plot the diﬀerence in these predicted probabilities associated with a
change in the crisis indicator (solid line) together with its 95% confidence interval (shaded
region).16 We then repeat the same steps for the logit models in Table 7-Columns (2) to
(6).
       Figure 11 shows that, conditional on the crisis, more profitable firms and those with
more tangible assets are more likely to issue bonds; the diﬀerence in predicted probabilities
increases with both   and Profitability and is statistically significant for all firms
(Figure 11-Panel C and E).
       Similarly, larger and better rated firms resort more to bond financing during the crisis;
the diﬀerence in implied probabilities is positive and statistically significant for all firms
with  larger than the 25th percentile value (total assets larger than $1,405 mln,
Figure 11-Panel A) and those with  above the 20th percentile value (BB- or more,
Figure 11-Panel D). We also document in Figure 11-Panel B and F that the diﬀerence
in predicted probabilities is decreasing in growth opportunities and indebtedness, and
significantly larger than zero for firms with  0   less than 3.552 (slightly above the
95th percentile value) and those with  below 0.197 (75% percentile value).
       Our analysis shows that firms that are larger or have more tangible assets, higher
credit ratings, better project quality, less growth opportunities, and lower leverage, were
better equipped to withstand the contraction of bank credit during the crisis.

3.4.3      Discussion

The full range of results in the present subsection can be pieced together to draw some
tentative conclusions. First of all, the decomposition of borrowing into bank and bond
finance, and the finding that bank and bond finance evolve in opposite directions during
  16
    To assess statistical significance we use 1,000 draws from a multivariate normal distribution with
mean equal to the estimated coeﬃcient vector from the logit model, and variance matrix equal to the
estimated variance-covariance matrix for the coeﬃcient estimates (King, Tomz and Wittenberg (2000)
and Zelner (2009)).

Table 7: Sensitivity of firm characteristics during the crisis. This table presents
logit regression results to explain the sensitivity of corporate financing choices to firm
characteristics during the crisis. To be included in the analysis, we require a firm to issue
new debt in at least one quarter between 1998 and 2010, to be rated the quarter prior

prior to debt issuance. The dependent variable is Bond Issuance, a dummy variable that
takes a value of one if a firm issues a bond in a given quarter, and zero if it issues a loan.
We report logit regression results of Bond Issuance on a set of firm characteristics defined

the crisis allows us to conclude that the contraction of bank credit was due to a fall
in supply.       This finding is robust to the exclusion of firm-quarters with simultaneous
issuance of both loans and bonds, as well as to the inclusion of industry fixed eﬀects (see
the online appendix posted on the authors’ homepages). This conclusion is in line with

   A further identification assumption in our analysis of corporate financing choices is the
conditioning on firm characteristics lagged one quarter. This may raise concerns since
inference may be confounded if variation in firm characteristics is endogenous to unob-

Figure 10: Time varying sensitivities. Every quarter we first estimate cross-sectional
logit regressions of Bond Issuance (a dummy variable that takes a value of one if a firm
issues a bond in a given quarter, and zero if it issues a loan) on a series of firm char-
acteristics (see Table 6, specification (1)). Every quarter we then compute the implied
change in Bond Issuance when each firm characteristic increases from its 5th to its 95th
percentile value and the other variables are kept at their means. The figure plots the
time series of these implied changes (dashed line) and their smoothed version (solid line).


served variation in financing choices. We have therefore repeated the analysis in Tables
6-7 and Figure 11 measuring firm characteristics eight quarters prior to debt issuance.
This way the probability of issuing bonds at the onset of the crisis (Q3:2007) is related
to firm-level control variables measured during Q3:2005, and the same probability at the
trough of the crisis (Q2:2009) depends on firm-characteristics measured during Q2:2007.
Our results are unchanged when we use variables measured eight quarters prior to debt
issuance.
   Finally, we corroborate evidence in Becker and Ivashina (2011) that financing choices
are significantly associated with aggregate proxies for credit supply. A decrease in broker-
dealer leverage or an increase in EBP trigger a substitution from loans to bonds.

Figure 11: Sensitivity during crisis. Sensitivity of bond issuance probability to firm
characteristics during and outside the crisis. Implied probabilities are based on the
logit regression specifications of Table 7 which include a series of firm characteristics, the
crisis indicator and an interaction term between the crisis indicator and one selected firm
characteristic. For every specification, the left panel plots the probability of bond issuance
during ( = 1, solid line) and outside the crisis ( = 0, dotted line) over the
entire range of values of the selected firm characteristic, keeping the other control variables
at their mean levels. The right panel plots the diﬀerence in these predicted probabilities
(solid line) together with its 95% confidence interval (shaded).


   We have further investigated the role played by firm characteristics during quarters
of reduced bank credit supply. We have repeated the analysis in Table 7 by replacing
the crisis indicator with our proxies for credit supply, and adding the interaction between
firm-characteristics and credit supply proxies.                                                                                                      We confirm the significant association
between financing sources and the credit supply proxies we uncover in Table 7 (direct
eﬀect).
   To understand whether (and how) firm characteristics aﬀect the substitution from
loans to bonds during episodes of credit supply contraction, we have reproduced the
analysis in Figure 11 using credit supply proxies in lieu of the crisis indicator. Consistent

                                                                                                                                   35
with our previous results, we find that, regardless of the credit supply proxy employed,
larger firms resort more to bond financing when bank credit supply contracts. We find
overall evidence that the same holds true for less indebted firms, while the relevance of
other firm characteristics is mixed.


4        Model of Bank and Bond Finance
Motivated by our empirical results, we now sketch a model of direct and intermediated
credit.      To set the stage, it is useful to take stock of the desired empirical features
encountered along the way.

       • First, the contrast between loan and bond financing points to the importance of
         accommodating both direct and intermediated credit.

       • Second, during the recent downturn, loan financing contracted but bond financing
         increased to make up some of the gap.

       • Third, even as the two categories of credit diverged in quantity, the spreads on both
         types of credit rose.

       • Fourth, bank lending changes dollar for dollar with a change in debt, with equity
         being “sticky”.     So, credit supply by banks is the consequence of their choice of
         leverage for a given level of equity.

       • Fifth, as a consequence, bank leverage is procyclical. Leverage is high when assets
         are large.

       We sketch a model that accommodates these five features. It is a model of direct and
intermediated credit where lending by banks is seen as the flip side of a credit risk model.17
Our model represents a departure from existing approaches to modeling financial frictions
in two respects. First, it departs from the practice of imposing a bank capital constraint
that binds only in the downturn. Instead, the capital constraint in our model binds all
the time – both in good times and bad. Indeed, during the booms, the constraint binds
in spite of the dampened risks.
  17
       The model was introduced in Shin (2011) in the context of cross-border banking and capital flows.




                                                    36
       Second, it is a model that is aimed at replicating as faithfully as possible the pro-
cyclicality of leverage. We have seen from the scatter charts of bank balance sheet man-
agement that banks adjust their assets dollar for dollar through a change in debt, with
equity remaining “sticky”.       To the extent that banking sector behavior is a key driver
of the observed outcomes, capturing these two features is important, and we address our
modeling task to replicating these features.

4.1       Bank Credit Supply
Bank credit supply is modeled as the flip side of a credit risk model, where banks adjust
lending so as to satisfy a risk constraint. In particular, banks are risk neutral and maxi-
mize profit subject only to a Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint that limits the probability of
bank failure. The VaR constraint stipulates that the probability of bank failure has to be
no higher than some (small) threshold level   0.18 In keeping with market practice, the
particular model of credit risk that drives the VaR constraint will be the Vasicek (2002)
model, adopted by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS 2005).
       The notation to be used is as follows.      The bank lends out amount  (with “”
standing for “credit”) at date 0 at the lending rate , so that the bank is owed (1 + ) 
in date 1 (its notional assets). The lending is financed from the combination of equity 
and debt funding , where  encompasses deposit and money market funding. The cost
of debt financing is  so that the bank owes (1 +  )  at date 1 (its notional liabilities).
       The economy has a continuum of binary projects, each of which succeeds with proba-
bility 1 −  and fails with probability . Each project uses debt financing of 1, which the
borrower will default on if the project fails. Thus, if the project fails, the lender suﬀers a
credit loss of 1. The correlation in defaults across loans follows the Vasicek (2002) model.
Project  succeeds (so that borrower  repays the loan) when   0, where  is the
random variable
                                                  √    p
                               = −Φ−1 () +       + 1 −                                   (1)

where Φ () is the c.d.f. of the standard normal,  and { } are independent standard
normals, and  is a constant between zero and one.               has the interpretation of the
economy-wide fundamental factor that aﬀects all projects, while  is the idiosyncratic
factor for project . The parameter  is the weight on the common factor, which limits
  18
    See Adrian and Shin (2008) for a possible microfoundation for the VaR constraint as a consequence
of constraints imposed by creditors.

the extent of diversification that lenders can achieve. Note that the probability of default
is given by
                                    ³√    p               ´
                                                      −1

   Conditional on  , defaults are independent. The bank can remove idiosyncratic risk
by keeping  fixed but diversifying across borrowers. We assume that loans are packaged
into bonds and banks hold such diversified bonds, rather than loans directly. By holding
bonds, banks can diversify away all idiosyncratic risk, and only the systematic risk from
the common factor  is reflected in the credit risk.      The realized value of the bank’s
assets at date 1 is then given by the random variable  ( ) where

                ( ) ≡ (1 + )  · Pr ( ≥ 0| )
                                       ³√         p                 ´

   The density over the realized assets of the bank is the derivative of (4) with respect
to .   Figure 12 plots the densities over asset realizations, and shows how the density
shifts to changes in the default probability  (left hand panel) or to changes in  (right
hand panel). Higher values of  imply a first degree stochastic dominance shift left for
the asset realization density, while shifts in  imply a mean-preserving shift in the density
around the mean realization 1 − .
   The bank adjust the size of its asset book  and funding  given equity  so as to
keep its probability of default to   0. Since the bank is risk-neutral and maximizes
profit, the VaR constraint binds whenever expected return from the bond is positive.
The constraint is that the bank limits total assets so as to keep the probability of its

 is a monotonic transformation of the leverage ratio, lying between zero and one. The

4.2       Direct Credit
Now consider the credit coming directly from bond investors. Bond investors (“house-
holds”) are risk averse with mean-variance preferences, and have identical risk tolerance
 . Households hold a portfolio consisting of three component assets – risky bonds, cash
and deposits in the bank. As stated already, deposits include claims on money market
funds that serve as the base of the shadow banking system. We assume that deposits
are guaranteed by the government (at least implicitly) so that households treat cash and
deposits as being perfect substitutes. We also assume that the households have suﬃcient
endowments so that the wealth constraint is not binding in their choice of holding for the
risky bonds. The demand for bonds (supply of credit) of mean-variance investor  with
risk tolerance  is then given by the first-order condition:
                                                 [(1 − ) (1 + ) − 1]
                                         =                                             (10)

where  2 is the variance of the bond with unit notional value.19 Clearly,  2 is a function
of  and .        The variance  2 reflects the fundamentals of the asset realization density
given in Figure 12.
      Suppose there is measure  of mean-variance investors in the economy, and that
 =  . Aggregating the bond holdings across all households, the aggregate supply of
credit from bond investors is thus given by:
                                                 [(1 − ) (1 + ) − 1]

 19
      Equivalently,  2 is the variance of  ( )  (1 + ) .

       Since bank liabilities are fully guaranteed by the government they earn the risk-free
rate.            Further, let the risk-free rate be zero, so that  = 0.                                                       Since bank credit supply
is increasing in  while bond investor credit supply is decreasing in 2 , the eﬀect of an
increase in  (assuming that   05) is to decrease credit supply from both groups of
creditors.

rate. Given our assumption that the risk-free rate is zero, the risk premium  is given

Consider the iso-lending curves for banks that plot the combination of default probability
 and risk premium  that give rise to the same credit supply by banks. The iso-lending
curve for banks corresponding to bank credit  is given by
                                    µ         ¶
                                            1−

                                            ()
     For banks, the iso-lending curve has the property that when  is small, the iso-lending
curve is close to being vertical in ( )-space. From (14), we have
                                     µ         ¶∙                ¸

where 0 () → −∞ as  → 0. Hence, the slope of the iso-lending curve tends to +∞ as
 → 0. Figure 14 plots the iso-lending curves in ( )-space for banks (left panel) and
bond investors (right panel).
     The vertical limiting case of the bank iso-lending curves is revealing about the behav-
ioral traits of banks.                         To say that the iso-lending curve is vertical is to say that bank
lending decisions depend only on the “physical” risk , rather than the risk premium

                                                                               42
.     This feature comes from the combination of the risk-neutrality of the bank, and
the constraint that limits its probability of failure. Risk neutrality means that the risk
premium  enters only through its VaR constraint.           Conventional risk-averse portfolio
investors would focus on the tradeoﬀ between physical risk  and the risk premium .
The right hand panel of Figure 14 shows the iso-lending curves of the bond investors, to
be derived shortly.    Although we have used mean-variance preferences for convenience
for the bond investors, any conventional risk averse preferences would imply a non-trivial
tradeoﬀ between physical risk and risk premium.
     The bond investors’ iso-lending curves in ( )-space follow from the supply of credit
by households given by (11), from which we can derive the following quadratic equation
in 
                                2          2
                                     2 (1 + ) − (1 + ) + 1 = 0                         (16)
                             (1 − )
The iso-lending curve for bond investors corresponding to bond credit supply of  is
given by                                 q
                                    1−    1 − 4  2  (1 − )2

     Let us now close the model by positing an aggregate demand for credit. The demand
for credit is a decreasing function of the risk premium, and is denoted by  (). The
market clearing condition is then

                                           (1 − )2 
                                         +              =  ()                         (18)

                                   1−

                                                


     How does the risk premium  vary to shifts in the physical risks ? Provided that
 is small – so that it lies in the plausible range for the probability of default – and
provided that the risk premium is not too large, we can show that the risk premium  is
an increasing function of .

Proposition 1 Suppose  is small so that ||   (1 − ) and the risk premium is
small so that   1. Then the market risk premium  is strictly increasing in .

     In other words, an increase in physical risk also raises the market risk premium. To
prove Proposition 1, note first that credit supply by bond investors is declining in , and
that bank lending declines in  if ||   (1 − ). Meanwhile, we can also show

                                                43
   0 and - assuming   1 - we also have    0.            Defining the excess
supply of credit function  ( ) ≡  +  −  (), we have
                                           
                                        + 
                          =−       = −    0     0                            (19)
                                 
                                           +  
                                                 −   ()

   Since bank credit is declining in , the balance sheet identity implies that the funding
 used by banks is also declining.

4.4    Relative Size of Banking Sector
We now come to our key result, which addresses the relative size of the banking sector
and its relationship to risk premiums.     Provided that credit demand  () is not too
elastic, a decline in  is followed by an increase in the size of the banking sector, both in
absolute terms and as a proportion to the total credit provided in the economy.

Proposition 2 Suppose that  is small enough so that the iso-lending curve of banks is
steeper than the iso-lending curve of bond investors.     Then, there is   0 such that,
provided | 0 ()| ≤ , an increase in  is associated with a contraction of banking sector
assets, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of the total credit received by borrowers.

   Proposition 2 can be demonstrated using a graphical argument using the iso-lending
curves for banks and bond investors.     Figure 15 illustrates an initial equilibrium given
by the crossing point for the iso-lending curves for banks and bond investors.       In this
illustration, total credit supply is 20, with 10 coming from banks and 10 coming from bond
investors. The four regions indicated in Figure 15 correspond to the four combinations
of credit supply changes by banks and bond investors. Region A is when both banks and
bond investors increase credit supply, while Region C is where both reduce credit supply.


   Now, consider a negative economic shock that raises the default probability . Such a
shock shifts the economy to the right hand side of the banks’ iso-lending curve, implying
a decrease in bank credit. In addition, the market risk premium  rises, as a consequence
of Proposition 1. Since bank credit supply contracts, bond credit supply must increase
for the market to clear. Thus, the new equilibrium ( ) pair must lie in Region D in
Figure 15. In Region D, bank credit supply contacts while bond credit supply expands.

    Figure 15: Crossing point for the iso-lending curves of banks and households.


   In this way, when default risk starts to increase as the financial cycle turns, there
will be an amplifying eﬀect through the risk premium .                              As  increases due to the
deterioration of fundamentals, we have the combination of sharply higher risk premiums
and the contraction in bank lending. Bond investors are then induced by the higher risk
premiums to close the credit supply gap in the market. The recoiling from risks, sharply
higher risk premiums and the substitution of bank lending by bond financing explains the
substitution away from bank financing to bond financing that we see in the data. Given
a fairly inelastic credit demand curve (at least in the short run), the sharp contraction in
loans from financial intermediaries will have to be made up somehow. The slack is taken
up by the increase in bond financing. However, for this to happen, prices must adjust in
order that the risk premium rises suﬃciently to induce risk-averse bond investors to make
up for the lost banking sector credit. Thus, a fall in the relative credit supplied by the
banking sector is associated with a rise in risk premiums.
   For macro activity, such a rise in the risk premium exerts contractionary eﬀects on the
real economy. Gilchrist, Yankov, and Zakrajšek (2009) documents evidence that credit
spreads have substantial eﬀect on macro activity measures. Thus, the financial friction
that such a mechanism generates is one that works through prices, rather than through a
shrinkage in the total quantity of credit. Exactly how increased spreads impact the real


                                                           45
economy is a subject that is ripe for further investigation.


5     Modeling Financial Frictions
Since the financial crisis, a new wave of dynamic, general equilibrium macro models that
incorporate financial frictions have been developed. The evidence in our study presents
a challenge to many of these models, as we point to a very specific set of empirical facts,
with tight implications for the modeling of financial frictions. The challenge for the theory
is to capture the five stylized facts that we documented earlier: 1) coexistence of bank and
bond finance; 2) substitution from bank to bond finance during recessions and crisis; 3)
increasing credit spreads; 4) stickiness of equity; 5) procyclicality of bank leverage. Our
model from the previous section presents a microfoundation that is rationalizing all five
stylized facts. However, no dynamic general equilibrium model has, to date, incorporated
such a set up for the financial sector. In this section, we review the recent macroeconomic
literature with financial frictions in light of our evidence.21
    In the seminal contributions of Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Bernanke, Gertler,
and Gilchrist (1999), the financial accelerator generates only one of the five stylized facts:
credit spreads increase during downturns. However, in the financial accelerator approach,
the financial friction resides with the corporate borrower. There are no banks, and hence
the model has nothing to say about the substitutability between loans and bonds.                  In
a recent extension of the Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist setting, Gertler and Kiyotaki
(2010) use the frictions of Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and apply them to both the
corporate sector and the banking sector. As a result, Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) are
able to talk about the role of the banking sector in business cycle fluctuations. However,
Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) still do not generate procyclical leverage of the financial
intermediaries. This is because of their assumption of the particular financing constraint.
    Perhaps the most distinctive feature of bank balance sheet management is the fact
that banks adjust assets dollar for dollar through a change in debt, with equity remaining
sticky. We have not attempted to resolve the microfoundations for such behavior, but
understanding the underlying corporate finance behind this feature seems critical. For
banks that adjust lending to shifts in Value-at-Risk, a good rule of thumb is that they
  21
     Brunnermeier, Eisenbach, and Sannikov (2011) and Quadrini (2011) oﬀer more comprehensive surveys
of the literature on general equilibrium macroeconomic models with financial frictions.



                                                 46
adjust their balance sheets in order to keep their probability of failure constant in the face
of changing financial conditions. In periods of heightened market stress, banks contract
lending and shed risky exposures, while in tranquil conditions, banks expand lending so
as to utilize any slack in the balance sheet.
   The banks’ practice of adjusting their assets dollar for dollar through debt also poses
some conceptual challenges for modeling of financial frictions. Many attempts at modeling
financial frictions have employed log preferences, or constraints that bind only in the
downturn.      Recent examples of analyses where one or both of these assumptions are
employed are Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2009, 2010) and He and Krishnamurthy (2010,
2011, 2012).    The determination of risk premiums and spillovers using log utility was
examined by Xiong (2001).
   Log utility has been a convenient means to simplify the dynamic portfolio problem,
as portfolio choices based on log utility imply leverage that is proportional to the ratio
of the risk premium to the variance of returns (Merton 1969). In order for leverage to
be procyclical, the ratio of risk premium to variance of returns (equivalently, the Sharpe
ratio divided by volatility) must also be procyclical.     However, supporting evidence is
lacking. If anything, to the extent that the Sharpe ratio tends to be low in booms and
high in busts, it would be plausible to find that log utility investors show countercyclical
leverage, rather than procyclical leverage. To the extent that banking sector behavior is
a key driver of the observed outcomes, capturing procyclical leverage seems crucial. On
this score, it would be fair to say that existing macro models of financial frictions are still
some way oﬀ from being fully satisfactory.
   Imposing additional constraints on banks so that their lending contracts would be
one way to bring the model closer to observed behavior, but such an approach implies
constraints that bind only in the downturn, rather than binding all the time. The scatter
charts we have seen for the balance sheet management of banks suggest that such an
asymmetric approach may not be completely satisfactory.
   In an international context, Mendoza (2010) develops a model of emerging market
crisis that does feature procyclical leverage of the economy in the aggregate. Bianchi and
Mendoza (2010) study a quantitative model of systemic risk, where agents do not take ex-
ternalities of financial fragility on others into account. The model features overleveraging
in the boom, countercyclical risk premiums, and excessive volatility associated with the
systemic risk externality.   Quadrini and Jermann (2012) study the financial policies of

                                                47
the corporate sector in a model that features procyclical leverage for the business sector.
The crucial ingredients to the model are adjustments at both the debt and equity issuance
margin. However, these model do not feature a banking sector, and therefore does not
capture the substitution between loan and bond financing.
    There is also a recent literature that is extending standard DSGE models to include
a banking sector. Gertler and Karadi (2011) present a parsimonious DSGE model with
a banking sector, production, and sticky prices, allowing them to study monetary policy.
The model again captures increases in spreads during crisis, but does not produce a
substitution between loans and bonds.        In addition, the paper does not feature the
procyclicality of the banking sector that we documented earlier.        Christiano, Motto,
Rostagno (2009) oﬀer a rich quantitative DSGE model with three production sectors,
and a banking sector. Curdia and Woodford (2009) incorporate banks that intermediate
between households.     Nevertheless, the relative size of the banking sector is not well
addressed in these papers, where all credit is intermediated credit.
    One important message from our investigation is that net worth, by itself, cannot
serve as the state variable that fully determines financial conditions.     The leverage of
the banking sector emerges as being a key determinant (and reflection) of financial condi-
tions. As such, understanding how the leverage of financial intermediaries fluctuates over
the cycle emerges as perhaps the most pressing question in the study of macroeconomic
fluctuations.


6     Conclusion
The financial crisis of 2007-9 has sparked keen interest in models of financial frictions and
their impact on macro activity. Most models share the feature that corporate borrowers
suﬀer a contraction in the quantity of credit. However, the evidence suggests that although
bank lending contracts during the crisis, bond financing actually increases to make up
much of the gap. This paper reviews both aggregate and micro-level data and highlights
the shift in the composition of credit between loans and bonds.
    The review of the evidence on the fluctuations in credit to non-financial firms allows
us to draw up a checklist of key empirical stylized facts that may be used to guide the
modeling exercise at the micro level. Although the workhorse models of financial frictions
used in macroeconomics capture some key empirical features, they fail to address others.


                                             48
We documented five stylized facts:

  1. Both bank and bond financing are quantitatively important in providing credit to
     nonfinancial corporations.

  2. In the recent financial crisis, and downturns more generally, credit in the form of
     loans contract, but bond financing increases to make up most of the gap.

  3. Credit spreads for both types of credit rise in downturns.

  4. Bank lending changes dollar for dollar with a change in debt, with equity being
     "sticky". So, credit supply by banks is the consequence of their choice of leverage.

  5. Bank leverage is procyclical.

   Motivated by this evidence, we have formulated a model of direct and intermediated
credit that captures these five stylized facts. In our model, the impact on real activity
comes from the spike in risk premiums, rather than contraction in the total quantity of
credit. However, to date, none of the macroeconomic equilibrium models have adequately
addressed all five stylized facts.   In reviewing the recent literature, we uncover that
some models capture the procyclicality, others oﬀer a substitution between bond and loan
financing, but no model captures all five stylized facts. Embedding a model as we present
within a general equilibrium framework appears as a promising avenue for research.
