                                        ABSTRACT

Equal access to voting is a core feature of democratic government. Using data from hundreds of
thousands of smartphone users, we quantify a racial disparity in voting wait times across a
nationwide sample of polling places during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Relative to
entirely-white neighborhoods, residents of entirely-black neighborhoods waited 29% longer to
vote and were 74% more likely to spend more than 30 minutes at their polling place. This
disparity holds when comparing predominantly white and black polling places within the same
states and counties, and survives numerous robustness and placebo tests. We shed light on the
mechanism for these results and discuss how geospatial data can be an effective tool to both
measure and monitor these disparities going forward.

     Providing convenient and equal access to voting is a central component of democratic
government. Among other important factors (e.g. barriers to registration, purges from voter
rolls, travel times to polling places), long wait times on Election Day are a frequently dis-
cussed concern of voters. Long wait times have large opportunity costs (Stewart and An-
solabehere 2015), may lead to line abandonment by discouraged voters (Stein et al. 2019),
and can undermine voters' confidence in the political process (Alvarez et al. 2008; Atkeson
and Saunders 2007; Bowler et al. 2015). The topic of long wait times has reached the most
prominent levels of media and policy attention, with President Obama discussing the issue
in his 2012 election victory speech and appointing a presidential commission to investigate
it. In their 2014 report, the Presidential Commission on Election Administration concluded
that, "as a general rule, no voter should have to wait more than half an hour in order to
have an opportunity to vote."
     There have also been observations of worrying racial disparities in voter wait times.
The Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) finds that black voters report facing
significantly longer lines than white voters (Pettigrew 2017; Alvarez et al. 2009; Stewart
III 2013). While suggestive, the majority of prior work on racial disparities in wait times
has been based on anecdotes and surveys which may face limits due to recall and reporting
biases.
     In this paper, we use geospatial data generated by smartphones to measure wait times
during the 2016 election. For each cellphone user, the data contain "pings" based on the
location of the cellphone throughout the day. These rich data allow us to document voter
wait times across the entire country and also estimate how these wait times differ based on
neighborhood racial composition.
     We begin by restricting the set of smartphones to a sample that passes a series of filters
to isolate likely voters. This leaves us with a sample of just over 150,000 smartphone users
who voted at one of more than 40,000 polling locations across 46 different states. Specifically,
these individuals entered and spent at least one minute within a 60-meter radius of a polling
location on Election Day and recorded at least one ping within the convex hull of the polling
place building (based on building footprint shapefiles). We eliminate individuals who entered
the same 60-meter radius in the week leading up to or the week after Election Day to avoid
non-voters who happen to work at or otherwise visit a polling place on non-election days.
     We estimate that the median and average times spent at polling locations are 14 and
19 minutes, respectively, and 18% of individuals spent more than 30 minutes voting.1 We

   1
       The time measure that we estimate in our paper is a combination of wait time in addition to the time


                                                     2
provide descriptive data on how voting varies across the course of Election Day. As expected,
voter volume is largest in the morning and in the evening, consistent with voting before and
after the workday. We also find that average wait times are longest in the early morning
hours of the day. Finally, as a validation of our approach, we show that people show up to
the polls at times consistent with the opening and closing hours used in each state.
    We next document geographic variation in average wait times using an empirical Bayes
adjustment strategy. We find large differences across geographic units ­ for example, average
wait times across congressional districts can vary by a factor of as much as four. We further
validate our approach by merging in data from the CCES, which elicits a coarse measure of
wait time from respondents. Despite many reasons for why one might discount the CCES
measures (e.g. reporting bias and limited sample size), we find a remarkably high correlation
with our own measures ­ a correlation of 0.86 in state-level averages and 0.73 in congressional-
district-level averages. This concordance suggests that our wait time measures (and those
elicited through the survey) have a high signal-to-noise ratio.
    We next explore how wait times vary across areas with different racial compositions. We
use Census data to characterize the racial composition of each polling place's corresponding
Census block group (as a proxy for its catchment area). We find that the average wait time in
a Census block group composed entirely of black residents is approximately 5 minutes longer
than average wait time in a block group that has no black residents. We also find longer wait
times for areas with a high concentration of Hispanic residents, though this disparity is not as
large as the one found for black residents. These racial disparities persist after controlling for
population, population density, poverty rates, and state fixed effects. We further decompose
these effects into between- and within-county components, with the disparities remaining
large even when including county fixed effects. We perform a myriad of robustness checks
and placebo specifications and find that the racial disparity exists independent of the many
assumptions and restrictions that we have put on the data.
    In the Appendix, we consider the potential mechanisms behind the observed racial differ-
ences. We ultimately find that a host of plausible candidate explanations do little to explain
the disparity in our cross-section, including differences in arrival times of voters, state laws
(Voter ID and early voting), the partisan identity of the underlying population or the chief


it took to cast a ballot. We typically refer to this as just "wait time" in the paper. One may worry that
the differences we find are not about wait times, but rather about differences in the amount of time spent
casting a ballot. However, there is evidence to suggest this is not the case. For example, we find incredibly
strong correlations between our wait time measures and survey responses that ask only about wait times as
opposed to total voting time ("Approximately, how long did you have to wait in line to vote?").


                                                     3
election official, county characteristics (income inequality, segregation, social mobility), and
the number of registered voters assigned to a polling place; although we do find larger dis-
parities at higher-volume polling locations. Overall, our results on mechanism suggest that
the racial disparities that we find are widespread and unlikely to be isolated to one specific
source or phenomenon.
    Our paper is related to work in political science that has examined determinants of wait
times and also explored racial disparities. Some of the best work uses data from the CCES
which provides a broad sample of survey responses on wait times (Pettigrew 2017; Alvarez
et al. 2009; Stewart III 2013). For example, Pettigrew (2017) finds that black voters report
waiting in line for twice as long as white voters and are three times more likely to wait for
over 30 minutes to vote. Additional studies based on field observations may avoid issues that
can arise from self-reported measures, but typically only cover small samples of polling places
such as a single city or county (Highton 2006; Spencer and Markovits 2010; Herron and Smith
2016). Stein et al. (2019) collect the largest sample to date, using observers with stopwatches
across a convenience sample of 528 polling locations in 19 states. Using a sample of 5,858
voters, they provide results from a regression of the number of people observed in line on an
indicator that the polling place is in a majority-minority area. They find no significant effect
­ although they also control for arrival count in the regression. In a later regression, they find
that being in a majority-minority polling location leads to a 12-second increase in the time
it takes to check in to vote (although this regression includes a control for the number of poll
workers per voter which may be a mechanism for racial disparities in voting times). Overall,
we arrive at qualitatively similar results as the political science literature, but do so using
much more comprehensive data that avoids the pitfalls of self-reports. Going forward, this
approach could produce repeated measures across elections, which would facilitate a richer
examination of the causal determinants of the disparities.
    Our paper also relates to the broader literature on racial discrimination against black
individuals and neighborhoods (for reviews, see Altonji and Blank 1999, Charles and Guryan
2011, and Bertrand and Duflo 2017), including by government officials. For example, Butler
and Broockman (2011) find that legislators were less likely to respond to email requests from
a putatively black name, even when the email signaled shared partisanship in an attempt
to rule out strategic motives. Similarly, White et al. (2015) find that election officials in the
U.S. were less likely to respond and provided lower-quality responses to emails sent from
constituents with putatively Latino names. Racial bias has also been documented for public
officials that are not part of the election process. For example, Giulietti et al. (2019) find


                                                4
that emails sent to local school districts and libraries asking for information were less likely
to receive a response when signed with a putatively black name relative to a putatively
white name. As one final example, several studies have documented racial bias by judges in
criminal sentencing (Alesina and Ferrara 2014; Glaeser and Sacerdote 2003; Abrams et al.
2012).


1        Data
The three primary datasets we use in this paper include: (1) SafeGraph cell phone location
records, (2) Polling locations, and (3) Census demographics.
    We use anonymized location data for smartphones provided by SafeGraph, a firm that
aggregates location data across a number of smartphone applications (Chen and Rohla 2018).
These data cover the days between November 1st and 15th, 2016, and consist of "pings",
which record a phone's location at a series of points in time. In general, GPS pings are
typically accurate to within about a 5-meter radius under open sky, though this varies de-
pending on factors such as weather, obstructions, and satellite positioning (GPS.gov). Pings
are recorded anytime an application on a phone requests information about the phone's
location. Depending on the application (e.g. a navigation or weather app), pings may be
produced when the application is being used or at regular intervals when it is in the back-
ground. The median time between pings in our sample for a given device is 48 seconds (with
a mode of 5 minutes).
    The geolocation data used in this paper is detailed and expansive, allowing us to estimate
wait times around the entire United States. This data, however, naturally raises concerns
about representativeness. If we were trying to estimate individual choices, e.g. vote choice,
the sample could only produce estimates that are at best representative of the approximately
77% of U.S. adults who owned a smartphone in 2016. While Chen and Pope (2019) show that
the data are generally representative of the U.S. along several observable dimensions (with
the exception of skewing more wealthy), they may differ on unobservables. However, our goal
is to estimate a property of places rather than individuals. That is, we estimate an outcome
of queues that have multiple individuals in them. While the restriction to smartphone users
may limit the number of wait times we observe, as long as there is a queueing rule at polling
places, we should still observe an unbiased estimate of the wait times faced by voters, both
those with and without smartphones.2

    2
        This is not to dismiss the potential issue of missing polling places or times of day. However, a priori,


                                                        5
    Polling place addresses for the 2016 General Election were collected by contacting state
and county election authorities. When not available, locations were sourced from local news-
papers, public notices, and state voter registration look-up webpages. State election author-
ities provided statewide locations for 32 states, five of which required supplemental county-
level information to complete. Four states were completely collected on a county-by-county
basis. In twelve states, not all county election authorities responded to inquiries (e.g. Nassau
County, New York).
    When complete addresses were provided, the polling locations were geocoded to coordi-
nates using the Google Maps API. When partial or informal addresses were provided, build-
ings were manually assigned coordinates by identifying buildings through Google Street View,
imagery, or local tax assessor maps as available. Additionally, Google Maps API geocodes
are less accurate or incomplete in rural locations or areas of very recent development, and
approximately 8% of Google geocodes were manually updated.
    Of the 116,990 national polling places reported in 2016 by the U.S. Election Assistance
Commission, 93,658 polling places (80.1%) were identified and geocoded and comprise the
initial sample of polling places in this paper. Appendix Figure A.1 illustrates the location of
the 93,658 polling places and separately identifies polling places for which we identify likely
voters on Election Day and pass various filters that we discuss and impose below.
    Demographic characteristics were obtained by matching each polling place location to the
census block group in the 2017 American Community Survey's five-year estimates. Census
block groups were chosen as the level of aggregation because the number of block groups is
the census geography that most closely aligns with the number of polling places and because
it contains the information of interest (racial characteristics, fraction below poverty line,
population, and population density).


2     Methods
In order to calculate voting wait times, we need to identify a set of individuals we are
reasonably confident actually voted at a polling place in the 2016 election. To do so, we
restrict the sample to phones that record a ping within a certain distance of a polling station
on Election Day. This distance is governed by a trade-off ­ we want the radius of the circle
around each polling station to be large enough to capture voters waiting in lines that may
spill out of the polling place, but want the circle to be not so large that we introduce a

these omissions do not point to systematic bias in a particular direction.


                                                      6
significant number of false positive voters (people who came near a polling place, but did
not actually vote).
    We take a data-driven approach to determine the optimal size of the radius. In Panel
A of Figure 1, we examine whether there are more unique individuals who show up near a
polling place on Election Day relative to the week before and the week after the election
(using a 100-meter radius around a polling location).3 As can be seen, there appear to be
more than 400k additional people on Election Day who come within 100 meters of a polling
place relative to the weekdays before and after. In Panel B of Figure 1, we plot the difference
in the number of people who show up within a particular radius of the polling place (10
meters to 100 meters) on Election Day relative to the average across all other days. As we
increase the size of the radius, we are able to identify more and more potential voters, but
also start picking up more and more false positives. By around 60 meters, we are no longer
identifying very many additional people on Election Day relative to non-election days, and
yet are continuing to pick up false positives. Therefore, we choose 60 meters as the radius
for our primary analysis. However, in Section 4.1, we demonstrate robustness of estimates
to choosing alternative radii.
    For each individual that comes within a 60-meter radius of a polling place, we would like
to know the amount of time spent within that radius. Given that we do not receive location
information for cell phones continuously (the modal time between pings is 5 minutes), we
cannot obtain an exact length of time. Thus, we create upper and lower bounds for the
amount of time spent voting by measuring the time between the last ping before entering
and the first ping after exiting a polling-place circle (for an upper bound), and the first and
last pings within the circle (for a lower bound). For example, pings may indicate a smartphone
user was not at a polling location at 8:20am, but then was at the polling location at 8:23,
8:28, 8:29, and 8:37, followed by a ping outside of the polling area at 8:40am; translating
to a lower bound of 14 minutes and an upper bound of 20 minutes. We use the midpoint
of these bounds as our best guess of a voter's time at a polling place (e.g. 17 minutes in
the aforementioned example). In the robustness section, we estimate our effects using values
other than the midpoint.

     More precisely, we construct a 100-meter radius around the centroid of the building identified by Mi-
crosoft OpenStreetMap as the closest to the polling place coordinates.

Notes: Panel A plots the number of unique device IDs observed within 100 meters of polling place building centroids on each
day from November 1 to November 15 ­ Election Day (November 8) is highlighted in orange. Panel B plots the difference in
the number of unique devices that are within a particular radius of the polling place (10 meters to 100 meters) on Election Day
relative to the average across all other days ­ our final radius of 60 meters is highlighted in orange. Panel C shows the sample
of unique devices that are observed within 60 meters of a polling place building centroid after applying the full set of filters ­
Election Day is highlighted in orange. Note that the Y-axes change across subfigures and that Veteran's Day was on Friday,
November 11 in 2016. The initial sample of smartphones that recorded at least one ping on Election Day(November 8, 2016)
consisted of 5.2 million unique devices. As Panel A shows, there are 1.5 million devices once we limit to those that recorded
at least one ping within 100 meters of a polling place on that date. Limiting to those within 60 meters of a polling place (the
final radius used in Panel C) drops this to 1.0 million devices. Further limiting to phones that recorded at least one ping in
the convex hull of the polling place building drops this to 406k devices, and limiting to phones that recorded a consistent set
of pings on Election Day (1 per hour for 12 hours) drops to 307k devices. Imposing the remaining filters discussed in the text
drops to the final sample of 155k observed in the orange bar of Panel C.




   Another important step in measuring voting times from pings is to isolate people who
come within a 60-meter radius of a polling place that we think are likely voters and not
simply passing by or people who live or work at a polling location. To avoid including
passersby, we restrict the sample to individuals who had an upper bound measure of at least
one minute within a polling place circle and for whom that is true at only one polling place
on Election Day. To avoid including people who live or work at the polling location, we


                                                                8
exclude individuals who we observe spending time (an upper bound greater than 1 minute)
at that location in the week before or the week after Election Day. To further help identify
actual voters and reduce both noise and false positives, we restrict the sample to individuals
who had at least one ping within the convex hull of the polling place building on Election
Day (using Microsoft OpenStreetMap building footprint shapefiles), logged a consistent set
of pings on Election Day (posting at least 1 ping every hour for 12 hours), and spent no
more than 2 hours at the polling location (to eliminate, for example, poll workers who spend
all day at a polling place). In Section 4.1, we provide evidence of robustness to these various
sample restrictions.
    After these data restrictions, our final sample consists of 154,489 individuals whom we
identify as likely voters across 43,413 polling locations. Panel C in Figure 1 shows how many
people pass our likely-voter filters on Election Day (154,489), and--as a placebo analysis--
how many observations we would have on non-Election ("placebo") days before and after
the 2016 Election that would pass these same filters (modified to be centered around those
placebo days). This analysis suggests that more than 87% of our sample are likely voters
who would not have been picked up on days other than Election Day. In Appendix Figure
A.2, we plot the distribution of wait times on each of these placebo non-election days. We
find that the wait times of people who would show up in our analysis on non-election days
are shorter on average than those that show up on Election Day. Thus, to the degree that we
can not completely eliminate false positives in our voter sample, we expect our overall voter
wait times to be biased upward. We also would expect the noise introduced by non-voters
to bias us towards not finding systematic disparities in wait times by race.
    Appendix Table A.1 provides summary statistics for our 154,489 likely voters. We find
average voting wait times of just over 19 minutes when using our primary wait time measure
(the midpoint between the lower and upper bound) and 18% of our sample waited more than
30 minutes to vote. Weighted by the number of voters in our sample, the racial composition
of the polling place block groups is, on average, 70% white and 11% black.


3    Results: Overall Voter Wait Times
We plot the distribution of wait times in Panel A of Figure 2. The median and average times
spent at polling locations are 14 and 19 minutes, respectively, and 18% of individuals spent
more than 30 minutes voting. As the figure illustrates, there is a non-negligible number of
individuals who spent 1-5 minutes in the polling location (less time than one might imagine


                                              9
is needed to cast a ballot). These observations might be voters who abandoned after dis-
covering a long wait time. Alternatively, they may be individuals who pass our screening as
likely voters, but were not actually voting.

      (c) Number of Voters by Hour of Day                           (d) Average Wait Time by Hour of Day




Notes: Panel A plots a histogram corresponding to the 154,495 cell phones who pass the filters used to identify likely voters
(using 1.5 minute bins). Panel B shows variation in (empirical-Bayes-adjusted) average wait times by congressional district
(115th Congress). Panel C plots the total number of voters (volume) by hour of arrival. Panel D plots the average wait time
for each hour of arrival.




    We next display the number of people who arrive to vote at the polling locations by time
of day. This descriptive analysis of when people vote may be of interest in and of itself, but
it also serves as a validation of whether people in our sample are indeed likely voters (e.g.
if our sample consists primarily of people showing up at the polling locations at 3am, then
one should worry about whether our sample is primarily composed of voters). Panel C of


                                                            10
Figure 2 shows the distribution of arrival times where the "hour of day" is defined using the
"hour of arrival" for a given wait time (i.e. the earliest ping within the polling place radius
for a given wait time spell). As expected, people are most likely to vote early in the morning
or later in the evening (e.g. before or after work) with nearly twice as many people voting
between 7 and 8am as between noon and 1pm. As a consistency check, Appendix Figure A.3
repeats this figure separately by state's opening and closing times ­ the figures show that
likely-voter arrivals match state-by-state poll opening and closing times. Finally, Panel D of
Figure 2 plots the average wait time by time of arrival, showing that the longest averages
are early in the morning.
    In addition to temporal variation in wait times, we can also explore how voting wait
times vary geographically. Appendix Tables C.1 - C.3 report average wait times by state,
congressional district, and the 100 most populous counties, along with accompanying stan-
dard deviations and observation counts, as well as an empirical-Bayes adjustment to account
for measurement error.4 Focusing on the empirical-Bayes adjusted estimates, the states with
the longest average wait times are Utah and Indiana (28 and 27 minutes, respectively) and
the states with the shortest average wait time are Delaware and Massachusetts (12 minutes
each). In Panel B of Figure 2 we map the empirical-Bayes-adjusted average voting wait time
for each congressional district across the United States. Average wait times vary from as low
as  11 minutes in Massachusetts's Sixth and Connecticut's First Congressional District to
as high as  40 minutes in Missouri's Fifth Congressional District. These geographic differ-
ences are not simply a result of a noisy measure, but contain actual signal value regarding
which areas have longer wait time than others. Evidence for this can be seen by our next
analysis correlating our wait time measures with those from a survey.
    We correlate our average wait time measures at both the state and congressional district
level with the average wait times reported by respondents in the the 2016 wave of the
Cooperative Congressional Election Study (Ansolabehere and Schaffner, 2017). The 2016
CCES is a large national online survey of 64,600 people conducted before and after the U.S.

     Even if all states in the U.S. had the same voter wait time, we would find some dispersion in our
measure due to sampling variation. Due to sample size, this measurement error in our estimates would result
in the smallest states being the most likely to show evidence of having either very short or very long wait
times. Thus, throughout the paper, whenever we discuss voter wait times or racial disparities that have been
aggregated up to either the county, congressional district, or state level, we will report estimates that have
been adjusted for measurement using a Bayesian shrinkage procedure. This iterative procedure (discussed in
detail in Chandra et al. (2016)) shrinks estimates toward the average of the true underlying distribution. The
amount of adjustment toward the mean is a function of how far the estimate for each state/county is from
the mean and the estimate's precision. The resulting adjusted estimate is our "best guess" (using Bayesian
logic) as to what the actual wait time or disparity is for each geographic unit.

general election. The sample is meant to be representative of the U.S. as a whole.5 There are
several reasons one might be pessimistic that the wait time estimates that we generate using
smartphone-data would correlate closely with the wait times reported from the CCES survey.
First, given sample sizes at the state and congressional district level, both our wait times
and survey wait times may have a fair bit of sampling noise. Second, our wait time measures
are a combination of waiting in line and casting a ballot, whereas the survey only asks about
wait times. Third, the question in the survey creates additional noise by eliciting wait times
that correspond to one of five coarse response options ("not at all", "less than 10 minutes",
"10 to 30 minutes", "31 minutes to an hour", and "more than an hour").6 Lastly, the survey
does not necessarily represent truthful reporting. For example, while turnout in the U.S. has
hovered between 50 and 60 percent, more than 80% of CCES respondents report voting.
Given these reasons for why our wait time results may not correlate well with those from
the survey, we find a remarkably strong correlation between the two. Using empirical-Bayes-
adjusted estimates for both state-level wait time estimates from the cellphone data and those
found in the CCES, we find correlation of 0.86 between the two. We find a similarly strong
correlation at the congressional district level (correlation = 0.73). Our wait-time estimates
are, on average, slightly longer than those in the survey, which is likely a reflection of the
fact that our measure includes both wait time and ballot-casting time. Scatter plots of the
state and congressional district estimates may be found in Appendix Figure A.4. Overall,
the strong correlations between the wait times we estimate and those from the CCES survey
provide validation for our wait time measure (and for the CCES responses themselves).


4       Results: Racial Disparities in Wait Times
In this section, we provide evidence that wait times are significantly longer for areas with
more black residents relative to white residents. We begin with a simple visualization of
wait times by race. Figure 3 plots the smoothed distribution of wait times separately for
polling places in the top and bottom deciles of the fraction-black distribution. These deciles

     There are 34,353 responses to the "wait time" question in the 2016 CCES. We restrict the sample of
responses to just use individuals who voted in person on Election Day (24,378 individuals after dropping
the 45 who report "Don't Know"). Following Pettigrew (2017), we translate the responses to minute values
by using the midpoints of response categories: 0 minutes ("not at all"), 5 minutes ("less than 10 minutes"),
20 minutes ("10 to 30 minutes") or 45 minutes ("31 minutes to an hour"). For the 421 individuals who
responded as "more than an hour" we code them as waiting 90 minutes (by contrast, Pettigrew (2017) uses
their open follow-up text responses.)

average 58% and 0% black, respectively. Voters from areas in the top decile spent 19% more
time at their polling locations than those in the bottom decile. Further, voters from the top
decile were 49% more likely to spend over 30 minutes at their polling locations. Appendix
Figures A.5 and A.6 provide similar density functions of wait-time comparisons for other
demographic characteristics.

Notes: Kernel densities are estimated using 1 minute half-widths. The 1st decile corresponds to the 34,420 voters across 10,319
polling places with the lowest percent of black residents (mean = 0%). The 10th decile corresponds to the 15,439 voters across
the 5,262 polling places with the highest percent of black residents (mean = 58%).

Notes : Robust standard errors, clustered at the polling place level, are in parentheses. Unit of observation is a cellphone identifier
on Election Day. DepVarMean is the mean of the dependent variable. The dependent variable in Panel B is a binary variable
equal to 1 if the wait time is greater than 30 minutes. Polling Area Controls includes the population, population per square
mile, and fraction below poverty line for the block group of the polling station. "Asian" includes "Pacific Islander." "Other
Non-White" includes the "Other," "Native American," and "Multiracial" Census race categories.



                                                                 14
    Of course, Figure 3 focuses just on polling places that are at the extremes of racial
makeup. We provide a regression analysis in Table 1 in order to use all of the variation across
polling places' racial compositions and to provide exact estimates and standard errors. Panel
A uses wait time as the dependent variable. In column 1, we estimate the bivariate regression
which shows that moving from a census block group with no black residents to one that is
entirely composed of black residents is associated with a 5.23 minute longer wait time. In
column 2, we broaden our focus by adding additional racial categories,revealing longer wait
times for block groups with higher fractions of Hispanic and other non-white groups (Native
American, other, multiracial) relative to entirely white neighborhoods. Column 3 examines
whether these associations are robust to controlling for population, population density, and
fraction below poverty line of the block group (see Appendix Tables A.2 and A.3 for the
full set of omitted coefficients). The coefficient on fraction black is stable when adding in
these additional covariates. Column 4 adds state fixed effects and the coefficient on fraction
black only slightly decreases, suggesting that racial disparities in voting wait times are just
as strong within state as they are between state.
    In column 5, we present the results within county. We find that the disparity is mitigated,
but it continues to be large and statistically significant. This suggests that there are racial
disparities occurring both within and between county. Understanding the level at which
discrimination occurs (state, county, within-county, etc.) is helpful when thinking about the
mechanism. Further, the fact that we find evidence of racial disparities within county allows
us to rule out what one may consider spurious explanations such as differences in ballot
length between counties that could create backlogs at other points of service (Pettigrew
2017; Edelstein and Edelstein 2010; Gross et al. 2013).
    Panel B of Table 1 is analogous to Panel A, but changes the outcome to a binary variable
indicating a wait time longer than 30 minutes. We choose a threshold of 30 minutes as this
was the standard used by the Presidential Commission on Election Administration in their
2014 report, which concluded that, "as a general rule, no voter should have to wait more
than half an hour in order to have an opportunity to vote" (Bauer et al. 2014). We find that
entirely black areas are 12 percentage points more likely to wait more than 30 minutes than
entirely white areas, a 74% increase in that likelihood. This remains at 10 percentage points
with polling-area controls and 7 percentage points within county.




                                              15
4.1    Robustness
We have made several data restrictions and assumptions throughout the analysis. In this
section, we document the robustness of the racial disparity estimate to using alternative
restrictions and assumptions.
    In our primary analysis we use the midpoint between the lower and upper bound of
time spent near the polling location as the primary measure of wait time. In Panel A of
Figure 4, we vary the wait time measure from the lower bound to the upper bound in 10
percent increments, finding that it has little impact on the significance or magnitude of our
estimates. We further vary the wait time trimming thresholds in Panel B and the radius
around a building centroid used to identify the polling location in Panel C. While these do
move the average wait times around, and the corresponding differences, we find that the
difference remains significant even across fairly implausible adjustments (e.g. a tight radius
of 20 meters around a polling place centroid). We show the associated regression output for
this figure in Appendix Table A.4.
    Another set of assumptions was in limiting the sample to individuals who (a) spent at
least one minute at a polling place, (b) did so at only one polling place on Election Day, and
(c) did not spend more than one minute at that polling location in the week before or the
week after Election Day. As a robustness check, we make (c) stricter by dropping anyone
who visited any other polling place on any day in the week before or after Election Day, e.g.
we would thus exclude a person who only visited a school polling place on Election Day,
but who visited a church (that later serves a polling place) on the prior Sunday. This drops
our primary analysis sample from 154,489 voters down to 68,812 voters, but arguably does
a better job of eliminating false positives. In Appendix Table A.5 and Appendix Figure A.7
we replicate our primary analysis using this more restricted sample and find results that are
very similar to our preferred estimates.
    As a placebo check, we perform our primary regression analysis using the same sample
construction methods on the non-Election days leading up to and after the actual Election
Day. Specifically, we repeat the regression used in Table 2, Panel A, Column 1 for each of
these days. Appendix Figure A.8 shows the coefficients for each date. We find that none of
these alternative dates produces a positive coefficient, suggesting that our approach likely
identifies a lower bound on the racial gap in wait times.
    As a final robustness/validation, we correlate the racial disparities in wait times that we
identify using the smartphone data with the racial disparities in wait times found using the
CCES survey (discussed in the previous section). As we found when correlating our overall


                                              16
wait time measure with the CCES, there is a strong correlation at the state level (0.72). The
correlation at the congressional district level is much more modest (0.07).

Notes: Points correspond to coefficients on "Fraction Black" from separate regressions (+/- 1.96 robust standard errors,
clustered at the polling place level). Unit of observation is a cellphone identifier on Election Day. All specifications are of the
form used in Column 1 of Panel A, Table 1. Panel A varies the dependent variable across splits between the lower and upper
bounds for our wait time measure (as described in Data and Methods); the first point (y = 0) corresponds to the lower bound,
the last point (y = 10) corresponds to the upper bound measure, and all other points are intermediate deciles of the split (e.g.
y = 5 corresponds to the midpoint of the two measures). Panel B varies the "reasonable values" (RV) filter, as follows: [RV1]
Upper Bound under 5 hours (N = 159,046; Mean of Dependent Variable = 22.92) [RV2] Upper Bound under 4 hours (N =
158,167; Mean = 21.79) [RV3] Upper Bound under 3 hours (N = 156,937; Mean = 20.63) [RV4] Upper Bound under 2 hours
(N = 154,411; Mean = 19.13) [RV5] Upper Bound under 2 hours and over 1.5 minutes (N = 154,014; Mean = 19.17) [RV6]
Upper Bound under 2 hours and over 2 minutes (N = 153,433; Mean = 19.24) [RV7] Upper Bound under 1 hour and over 2
minutes (N = 141,170; Mean = 15.64) [RV8] Upper Bound under 1 hour and over 2.5 minutes (N = 140,470; Mean = 15.71)
[RV9] Upper Bound under 1 hour and over 3 minutes (N = 139,788; Mean = 15.78) [RV10] Upper Bound under 1 hour and
over 4 minutes (N = 138,452; Mean = 15.91). Panel C varies the bounding radius around the polling station centroid from 10
meters (N = 60,821; Mean = 12.09) up to 100 meters (N = 113,797; Mean = 21.81). The red line on each figure corresponds to
the coefficient from the choice we use in our primary analysis, i.e. the midpoint wait time measure (Panel A), a filter of upper
bounds under 2 hours (Panel B), and a radius of 60 meters (Panel C).

5     Discussion and Conclusion
Exploiting a large geospatial dataset, we provide new, nationwide estimates for the wait
times of voters during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In addition to describing wait
times overall, we document a persistent racial disparity in voting wait times: areas with a
higher proportion of black (and to a lesser extent Hispanic) residents are more likely to face
long wait times than areas that are predominantly white. These effects survive a host of
robustness and placebo tests and are also validated by being strongly correlated with survey
data on voter wait times.
    While the primary contribution of our paper is to carefully document voting wait times
and disparities at the national level, it is natural to ask why these disparities exist. In the
Appendix, we explore the mechanism and do not find conclusive evidence in favor of arrival
bunching, partisan bias, early voting, or strict ID laws. We find suggestive evidence that the
effects could be driven by fewer resources that leads to congestion especially in high-volume
polling places. We are left with the fact that these racial disparities are not limited to just a
few states or areas with particular laws or party affiliations that might reflect strategic moti-
vations. Rather, there is work to be done in a diverse set of areas to correct these inequities.
A simple explanation is that government officials in general tend to focus more attention on
areas with white constituents at the expense of those with black constituents. For example,
this could be due to politicians being more responsive to white voters' complaints about vot-
ing administration than those from black voters (and relatedly, white voters lodging more
complaints), in line with prior work demonstrating lower responsiveness to black constituents
across a variety of policy dimensions (e.g. Butler and Broockman 2011; Giulietti et al. 2019;
White et al. 2015).
    Our results also demonstrate that smartphone data may be a relatively cheap and effective
way to monitor and measure progress in both overall wait times and racial disparities in wait
times across various geographic areas. The analysis that we conduct in this paper can be
easily replicated after the 2020 election and thereby generate a panel dataset of wait times
across areas. Creating a panel dataset across the country may be useful to help pin down the
mechanism for disparities (e.g. using difference-in-differences designs to test if disparities in
voter wait times change when different laws or election officials take over in a state). We hope
that future work can build on the results in this paper to provide a deeper understanding of
disparities in voting wait times and their causes.

Notes: This figure shows polling place locations (overlaid on county shapes) colored by whether smartphone pings were observed.

                              Figure A.2: Placebo Day Wait Time Histograms




Notes: In this figure, we replicate our sample construction across 14 placebo days (i.e. we apply our filters to identifying a
"likely voter" but replace the sample and the date used in each filter definition to the placebo date). The figure corresponding
to Election Day (i.e. Figure 2 of the paper) is also shown, highlighted in orange. The figure illustrates that our filters identify a
plausible distribution of wait times on Election Day, but that applying the same set of filters (with dates shifted accordingly)
produces a very different distribution shape on other dates. Note that the Y-axes change across sub-figures.

     Figure A.3: Voter Volume by Hour of Day (Early vs. Late Open and Close States)




Notes: In this figure, we use state poll opening and close times to further validate our filters as identifying likely voters. Panel
A separately plots the histogram for the 10 states where polls open at 6am and the 22 that open at 7am; Panel B plots the
histograms for the 17 states that close at 7pm versus the 18 states that close at 8pm. We see relative spikes at 7am for the
states that open at 7am (orange histogram), and that the number of voters falls substantially at 7pm for states that close
at 7pm (orange histogram). [State open and close times are taken from: https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_
Closing_Times_(2016)#table. We omit states which do not have standardized open (Panel A) or close times (Panel B) across
the entire state.]

                                Figure A.4: Comparison with CCES Data




Notes: The red line corresponds to the 45 degree line (lining up would indicate equality between the two measures). The gray
line is produced with lfit in Stata, giving the prediction of the Smartphone measure given the CCES measure. Both measures
are first independently empirical-Bayes-adjusted to account for measurement error.

Notes: This figure repeats Figure 3 across other racial categories. We show the decile splits by Hispanic (Panel A), Asian
(Panel B), and "Other Non-White" (Panel C), and then group these categories together with Black in Panel D. Note that
"Asian" includes "Pacific Islander." "Other Non-White" includes the "Other," "Native American," and "Multiracial" Census
race categories. "All Non-White" includes Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other Non-White.

                   Figure A.7: Wait Time Disparities: Stricter Likely Voter Filter




Notes: In this figure, we repeat Figure 3 with a sub-sample of voters. Specifically, we use a more conservative first filter for
identifying "likely voters." Our primary analysis limited the sample to individuals who (a) spent at least one minute at a polling
place, (b) did so at only one polling place on Election Day, and (c) did not spend more than one minute at that polling location
in the week before or the week after Election Day. Here we make (c) stricter by dropping anyone who visited any other polling
place on any day in the week before or after Election Day, e.g. we would thus exclude a person who only visited a school polling
place on Election Day, but who visited a church (that later serves a polling place) on the prior Sunday. This drops our primary
analysis sample from 154,489 voters down to 68,812 voters. Kernel densities are estimated using 1 minute half-widths. The 1st
decile corresponds to the 15,402 voters across 6,576 polling places with the lowest percent of black residents (mean = 0%). The
10th decile corresponds to the 6,881 voters across the 3,229 polling places with the highest percent of black residents (mean =
54%).




                                                               28
                          Figure A.8: Main Specification Run on Placebo Days




Notes: In this figure, we replicate our sample construction for the 14 placebo days around Election Day, similar to A.2. We
then repeat the regression used in Table 1, Panel A, Column 1 for each of these days. We find that none of these alternative
dates produces a positive coefficient, suggesting that our approach likely identifies a lower bound on the racial gap in wait times.
Additional Notes: Points correspond to coefficients on "Fraction Black" (+/- 1.96 standard errors) from separate regressions.

Notes : In this figure we repeat Table 1, Panel A, but display the coefficients on control variables (Fraction Below Poverty Line,
Population, Population Per Sq Mile). We additionally add column 6 which adds two additional sets of control variables: fixed
effects for each hour of the day (hour of arrival for a wait time) and whether the cellphone is Android (vs. iPhone). Additional
Notes: Robust standard errors, clustered at the polling place level, are in parentheses. Unit of observation is a cellphone identifier
on Election Day. DepVarMean is the mean of the dependent variable. Polling Area Controls includes the population, population
per square mile, and fraction below poverty line for the block group of the polling station. "Asian" includes "Pacific Islander."
"Other Non-White" includes the "Other," "Native American," and "Multiracial" Census race categories. Column 6 adds an
additional specification beyond Table 1; there we include fixed effects for the hour of arrival (i.e. the first ping of a waiting
spell within the 60 meters of the polling place centroid) and a dummy variable for whether the observation corresponds to an
Android phone.

Appendix B: Mechanisms
In Section 4 of the paper, we documented large and persistent differences in wait times for
areas with a larger fraction of black residents relative to white residents. In this section, we
explore potential explanations for these differences. This descriptive exercise is important
as different mechanisms may imply different corrective policies. For example, if wait time
disparities are driven by differential job flexibility (and thus bunching in busy arrival hours),
the best policy response might be to create Federal holidays for elections (e.g. as proposed
in "Democracy Day" legislation). By contrast, if the disparity is driven by inequalities in
provided resources, the optimal policy response might be to set up systems to monitor and
ensure equal resources per voter across the nation.
    The nature of our data does not lend itself to a deep exploration of mechanism. A complete
understanding of mechanism would likely need to include a large amount of investigative
work including data for the quantity and quality of resources at the level of a polling place.
There are also two measurement and identification issues to keep in mind. First, as noted in
Section 3, our wait time measure may include voters who abandon the line after discovering
a long wait time. Second, our estimates are conditional on a voter turning out. Each of the
mechanisms below could affect either of these intermediate outcomes. For example, a Strict
ID law could increase the amount of time it takes to process a single voter. However, it may
also discourage potential voters from turning out to vote (decreasing the actual queue length
for the marginal voter) and it could increase the likelihood that a voter who does turnout
would leave the line early (decreasing the average measured time from our method). These
two issues thus further caution against using this analysis in isolation to identify the causal
effect of addressing these mechanisms. However, in our analysis below, we are able to cast
doubt on a few potential mechanisms and draw some tentative conclusions that at the very
least may help guide further work that attempts to pinpoint causal determinants of wait
times.


B.1     Inflexible Arrival Times
One potential mechanism for the differences in wait times that we find is that areas differ
in the intensity of voting that occurs at different times of day. For example, it is possible
that polling stations in black and white areas are equally resourced and prepared to handle
voters, but that voters in black areas are more likely to show up all at once. This could occur,
for example, if black voters have less flexible jobs than white voters and therefore can only


                                               34
vote in the early morning or evening. This mechanism for differences in wait times is a bit
more indirect than other potential mechanisms in that it is not driven by less attention or
resources being devoted to black areas, but rather is a result of congestion caused by more
general features of the economy (e.g. job flexibility).
    To test for evidence of this mechanism, Figure B.1 plots the density of arrival time for
voters from the most black areas (highest decile) and from the the least black areas (lowest
decile).7 A visual inspection of Figure B.1 shows quite minor differences in bunching. Voters
in black areas are slightly more likely to show up in the very early morning hours whereas
voters in white areas are slightly more likely to show up in the evening.
    Figure B.1 does not appear to make a particularly strong case for bunching in arrival
times. However, as we showed in Panel B of Figure A.3, wait times are longer in the morn-
ing (when black voters are slightly more likely to show up). A simple test to see if these
differences are large enough to explain the racial disparities we find is to include hour-of-
the-day fixed effects in our main regression specification. These fixed effects account for any
differences in wait times that are due to one group (e.g. voters from black areas) showing
up disproportionately during hours that have longer wait times. We include hour-of-the-day
fixed effects in Column 6 of Appendix Table A.2. The coefficient on fraction black drops from
a disparity of 3.27 minutes to a disparity of 3.10 minutes, suggesting that hour-of-the-day
differences are not a primary factor that contributes to the wait-time gap that we find.
    A different way to show that bunching in arrival times is not sufficient to explain our
results is to restrict the sample to hours that don't include the early morning. In Appendix
Table B.1, we replicate our main specification (Column 4 in Table 2), but only use data
after 8am, 9am, and 10am. We continue to find strong evidence of a racial disparity in wait
times despite the fact that this regression is including hours of the day (evening hours) when
white areas may be more congested due to bunching. This table also provides estimates that
exclude both morning and evening hours when there are differences in bunching by black and
white areas and also restricts to just evening hours where white areas have higher relative
volume in arrivals. Once again, we find strong black-white differences in voter wait times
during these hours.

   7
     We restrict the sample to the 32 states that opened no later than 7am and closed no earlier than
7pm, and restrict the range to be from 7am to 7pm in order to avoid having attrition in the graph due
to the opening and closing times of different states. We thus exclude the following states from this figure:
Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
North Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont. Despite this sample restriction, we find a similar disparity estimate in
this restricted sample (coefficient = 5.43; t = 13; N = 124,950) as in the full sample (coefficient = 5.23; t =
14; N = 154,411).


                                                      35
    We conclude that the evidence does not support congestion at the polls due to bunching
of arrival times as a primary mechanism explaining the racial disparity in wait times that
we document.

B.2       Partisan Bias
Another explanation for why voters in black areas may face longer wait times than voters
in white areas is that election officials may provide fewer or lower quality resources to black
areas. Using carefully-collected data by polling place across three states in the 2012 election
(from Famighetti et al. 2014), Pettigrew (2017) finds evidence of exactly this ­ black areas
were provided with fewer poll workers and machines than white areas. Thus, it seems likely
that differential resources contribute to the effects that we find. An even deeper mechanism
question though is why black areas might receive a lower quality or quantity of election
resources. In this section, we explore whether partisanship is correlated with wait times.
    At the state level, the individual charged with being the chief elections officer is the


                                                            36
secretary of state (although in some states it is the lieutenant governor or secretary of
the commonwealth). The secretary of state often oversees the distribution of resources to
individual polling places, although the process can vary substantially from state to state
and much of the responsibility is at times passed down to thousands of more local officials
(Spencer and Markovits 2010).8
    It could be that state and county officials uniformly have a bias against allocating re-
sources to black areas and this creates racial disparities in wait times across the U.S. as a
whole. Alternatively, some election officials may be especially unequal in the resources they
provide. An observable factor that could proxy for how unfair an election official may be in
allocating resource is party affiliation. In 2016, black voters were far more likely to vote for
the Democratic candidate than the Republican candidate.9 Given this large difference in vote
share, it is possible that Republican party control or overall Republican party membership
of an area predicts a motivation (either strategic or based in prejudice) for limiting resources
to polling places in black areas.
    To test for evidence of a partisan bias, we plot empirical-Bayes-adjusted state-level racial
disparities in wait times against the 2016 Republican vote share at both the state (panel A
of Figure B.2) and county level (panel B of Figure B.2).10 Panel A also color codes each state
marker by the party affiliation of the chief elections officer in the state.11 The fitted lines in

   8
     Spencer and Markovits (2010) provide a useful summary of the problem of identifying precisely who is
responsible for election administration in each of the 116,990 polling places spread over the country:
       One major reason why polling place inefficiency has yet to be adequately studied is that the
       administration of elections in the United States is extremely complicated. Each state creates its
       own rules, budgets its own money, and constructs its own election processes. In some states, such
       as Wisconsin and Michigan, local jurisdictions have primary autonomy over election adminis-
       tration. In others, such as Oklahoma and Delaware, all election officials are state employees.
       Still others share administrative duties between state and local election officials. For example,
       in California, counties have significant authority, yet they operate within a broad framework
       established by the Secretary of State. On the federal level, the United States Constitution
       preserves the right of Congress to supersede state laws regulating congressional elections. The
       result is a complex web of overlapping jurisdictions and 10,071 government units that adminis-
       ter elections. To complicate matters further, authority in all jurisdictions is ceded to two million
       poll workers who control the success or failure of each election.

   9
      Exit polls suggested that 89% of black voters cast their ballot for the Democratic candidate in 2016
whereas only 8% voted for the Republican candidate (source: https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/
results/exit-polls).
   10
      The sample sizes for some counties are very small. Thus, we restrict the analysis to the 718 counties
with at least 30 likely voters (and for which the disparity can be estimated) in order to avoid small-sample
inference issues.
   11
      State and county Republican vote shares are taken from the MIT Election Data and Science
Lab's County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2016 (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?

both panels do not show evidence of positive correlation between Republican vote share and
racial disparities in voter wait times. If anything we find larger disparities in areas that have
a lower Republican vote share.
    While this analysis is correlational in nature, it suggests that racial disparities in wait
times are not primarily driven by how Republican the state/county is. Rather, both red and
blue states and counties are susceptible to generating conditions that lead to black voters
spending more time at the polls than their white counterparts.

                           Figure B.2: Republican Vote Share and Racial Gaps




Notes: Panel A shows a scatter plot of empirical-Bayes-adjusted state-level wait time disparities (i.e. the adjusted coefficient
from a regression of wait time on "Fraction Black", with standard errors clustered at the pollling place level) against the 2016
Republican vote share for that state. Panel B shows the same relationship for county-level measures. Points are colored by the
partisan affiliation of the chief elections officer in that State (Red = Republican). The fit lines are produced using lfit in Stata.




persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ/FQ9NBF&version=5.0). We compute the Republican vote share
as the number of votes cast at the County (or State) level divided by the total number of votes
cast in that election, and thus states with a Republican vote share under 50% may still have more
votes for Trump over Clinton (e.g. Utah). The partisan affiliation of the chief elections officer in
the state is taken from: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Secretary_of_state_(U.S.

                                                                38
B.3     County-Level Correlates
We do not find evidence of a correlation between party affiliation at the county level and
racial disparities in wait times. However, there may be other characteristics of counties
that correlate with our measure of racial disparities. In Figure B.3, we show estimates of a
regression of our measure of racial disparities at the county-level (empirical-Bayes adjusted
and limited to those counties with more than 30 observations) against a Social Capital Index,
Top 1% Income Share, Gini Coefficient, Theil Index of Racial Segregation, and two measures
of social mobility from Chetty and Hendren (2018). Each of these variables is taken from
Figure 5 of Chetty and Hendren (2018), corresponds to the 2000 Census, and has been
standardized.12 We find little evidence that voter wait time disparities are correlated with
these additional measures. Overall, we argue that a clear pattern does not emerge where
counties of a particular type are experiencing the largest disparities in voter wait time.


B.4     State Voting Laws
A large recent discussion has emerged regarding the impact of Strict ID laws (Cantoni and
Pons 2019; Grimmer and Yoder 2019) and unequal access to early voting (Kaplan and Yuan
2019; Herron and Smith 2014) on the voting process. Both of these types of laws have
the potential to produce racial inequalities in wait times. For example, Strict ID laws may
disproportionately cause delays at polling places in minority areas. The effect of early voting
laws is less clear. It is possible that early voting allows voters who would have otherwise
faced long lines to take advantage of the early voting process and therefore release some of
the pressure at the polling places with the longest waits. However, it is also possible that
white voters are more likely to learn about and take advantage of early voting (or that early
voting is more likely to be available in white areas within a State that has early voting) which
could lead to even longer disparities in wait times if election officials don't adjust polling
place resources to accommodate the new equilibrium.
    The final two bars in Figure B.3 show how our measure of racial disparity at the state
level interacts with states with early voting laws (N = 34) and states with Strict ID laws (N
= 10).13 As can be seen in the figure, we do not find evidence that the variation in wait time

      We source these variables from: https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/
online_table4-2.dta and merge on the Census County FIPS (taken from the 2000 Census in the Chetty
and Hendren (2018) data and from the 2017 ACS in our data.
   13
      Following Cantoni and Pons (2019), we source both of these measures from the National
Conference of State Legislatures. We use Internet Archive snapshots from just before the 2016
Election to obtain measures relevant for that time period (e.g. for Strict ID laws we use


                                               39
disparities is being explained in a substantial way by these laws.

Notes: Each row reports the coefficient from a bivariate regression of a county-level (empirical-Bayes-adjusted) wait time average
on a county-level measure (rows 1-8) or of a state-level (empirical-Bayes-adjusted) wait time average on a state-level measure. See
footnote 9 for further details on the county-level measures taken from Chetty and Hendren (2018). States identified as having
strict voter ID laws in 2016 are: Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia,
and Wisconsin. States identified as not having any type of early voting in 2016 are: Alabama, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia.




B.5        Congestion
A final mechanism that we explore is congestion due to fewer or lower quality resources per
voter at a polling place. Congestion may cause longer wait times and be more likely to be a
factor at polling places with more black voters. We do not have a direct measure of resources
the following link: https://web.archive.org/web/20161113113845/http://www.ncsl.org/research/
elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx). For the early-voting measure we define it as any state that
has same-day voter registration, automatic voter registration, no-excuse absentee voting, or early voting
(Cantoni and Pons (2019) study multiple elections, and thus define this measure as the share of elections
over which one of these was offered). States identified as having strict voter ID laws in 2016 are: Arizona,
Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. States iden-
tified as not having any type of early voting in 2016 are: Alabama, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia.


                                                               40
or overall congestion at the polling place level, but a potential proxy for congestion is the
number of registered voters who are assigned to each polling place. We use data from L2's
2016 General Election national voter file. These data allow us to determine the total number
of registered voters who are assigned to vote at each polling place and also the number of
actual votes cast. For most voters, their polling place was determined by the name of their
assigned precinct; precincts were assigned to one or more polling places by their local election
authority. In the rare case where voters were allowed their choice from multiple polling places,
the polling place closest to their home address was used. Registered voters and votes cast by
polling place are highly correlated (correlation = 0.96) and the analysis below is unchanged
independent of what measure we use. We will therefore focus on the number of registered
voters for each polling place.
    It is not obvious that polling places with more voters should have longer overall wait
times. In a carefully-resourced system in equilibrium, high-volume polling places should have
more machines and polling workers and therefore be set up to handle the higher number of
voters. However, it is possible that the quality and quantity of polling resources is out of
equilibrium and does not compensate for the higher volume. For example, polling-place
closures or residential construction may increase the number of registered voters assigned
to a given polling place and polling resources may not adjust fast enough to catch up to
the changing volume. Alternatively, even if variable resource are in equilibrium, there may
be fixed differences that lead to longer wait times in high volume areas (e.g. constrained
building sizes leading to slower throughput, or a higher risk of technical issues).14
    Following our baseline specifications, we regress voting wait time for each individual in
our sample on the number of registered voters assigned to the polling place where they voted.
These results can be found in Appendix Table B.3. We do indeed find a positive relationship
across specifications with varied fixed effects suggesting that congestion may be an issue in
high-volume polling locations.
    Given the above association, if polling places with a large fraction of black voters are also

   14
     In Appendix Table B.2, we investigate these potential fixed building type differences directly by matching
polling place buildings to information on size and types from Microsoft OpenStreetMap. We group building
types into 6 categories (Commercial, Medical, Private, Public, Religious, School) and 76 sub-categories (e.g.
Commercial is divided into Gym, Hotel, Shopping Center, and 7 other sub-categories). We show in Panel C
that building categories and building size are only weakly predictive of fraction black. Panels A and B in
turn show that controlling for a second-order polynomial in building size (Column 2), category fixed effects
(Column 3), and sub-category fixed effects (Column 4) has little effect on estimates of the racial disparities.
This analysis suggests that at least these coarse building characteristics, on their own, do not seem to mediate
the relationship. Moreover, this analysis provides some reassurance that the rules for cleaning data--which
may differentially affect different building types--do not skew our estimates of the racial disparities.


                                                      41
more likely to be high volume, this could help explain the black-white disparity in wait times
that we have documented. The data, however, do not bear this out. There is not a strong
correlation between volume and the fraction of black residents at a polling place (correlation
= .03). One way to see this is we run our baseline regressions, but include the number of
registered voters in each polling place as a control. The table indicates that this new control
does not significantly diminish the racial disparity in wait times and if anything may cause
the disparity to become a bit larger in some specifications.
    Lastly, we explore whether or not the racial disparity in voter wait times that we document
interacts with our proxy for congestion. Is the racial gap in wait times larger or smaller in
high-volume polling places? In Appendix Table B.4 we run our baseline regressions and
include the number of registered voters in each polling place and also an interaction between
registered voters and the fraction of black residents. Across all specifications, we find a
significant and robust interaction effect indicating larger racial disparities at higher volume
polling places. Figure B.4 helps put this interaction effect in perspective. In this figure, we
plot the density function for the number of voters registered in each individual's polling place
in our data (labeled on the left y-axis). We also plot the predicted wait time for an area
composed entirely of black residents (fraction black = 1) as well as an area with no black
residents (fraction black = 0) by the number of registered voters at the polling place (labeled
on the right y-axis). The predicted lines indicate that the black-white disparity in wait times
for individuals who vote at a low-volume polling location (10th percentile = 1,150 registered
voters) is 3.7 minutes whereas the disparity in high-volume polling locations (90th percentile
= 5,242 registered voters) is almost twice as large at 7 minutes.

                      Figure B.4: Congestion and Wait Times by Fraction Black




Notes: The left y-axis corresponds to the kernel density (estimated using 100 person half-widths) of the Number of Registered
Voters per Polling Place (after first dropping the top 1% of observations, i.e. voters in polling places with more than 10,746
registered individuals). The right y-axis corresponds to the two regression lines (estimated on the full sample) ­ both lines
correspond to a voter (i.e. cellphone identifier)-level regression of wait time on "Fraction Black", the "Number of Registered
Voters Per Polling Place", and the interaction. The top line reports the predicted regression line for "Fraction Black" = 1, while
the bottom line reports this for "Fraction Black" = 0.




    Thus, we find that the largest racial disparities in voter wait times are in the highest
volume polling places. This finding is consistent with several possible stories. For example,
this pattern may reflect another dimension of the aforementioned inequality in polling ma-
chines, workers, and other support. Black areas may face persistent under-resourcing and
these resourcing constraints may be especially harmful at higher volumes of voters. Relat-
edly, election officials may respond less quickly to adjustments in volume (e.g. caused by
polling closures or changes in voter-age population) in areas with higher concentrations of
black residents. This off-equilibrium response may lead to the differential gradient we find
in volume between black and white areas. Our analysis is correlational and thus does not
allow us to make conclusive statements about the exact underlying mechanism. On the other
hand, this descriptive exercise can provide guidance on potential sources for the disparity
that are worthy of further exploration.

Notes : Robust standard errors, clustered at the polling place level, are in parentheses. Unit of observation is a cellphone identifier
on Election Day. DepVarMean is the mean of the dependent variable. The dependent variable in Panel B is a binary variable
equal to 1 if the wait time is greater than 30 minutes. Polling Area Controls includes the population, population per square
mile, and fraction below poverty line for the block group of the polling station. "Asian" includes "Pacific Islander." "Other
Non-White" includes the "Other," "Native American," and "Multiracial" Census race categories. "Voters per Polling Place" is
the number of registered individuals for that polling place in the National voterfile.

Notes : Robust standard errors, clustered at the polling place level, are in parentheses. Unit of observation is a cellphone identifier
on Election Day. DepVarMean is the mean of the dependent variable. The dependent variable in Panel B is a binary variable
equal to 1 if the wait time is greater than 30 minutes. Polling Area Controls includes the population, population per square
mile, and fraction below poverty line for the block group of the polling station. "Asian" includes "Pacific Islander." "Other
Non-White" includes the "Other," "Native American," and "Multiracial" Census race categories. "Voters per Polling Place" is
the number of registered individuals for that polling place in the National voterfile.

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a state fixed effect and the "Fraction
Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of state fixed effects and the interaction of those
fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling place level. Column 7
provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these state-level disparities to account for measurement error. Similarly, Column
4 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted state-level means shown in Column 2.

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a congressional district fixed effect and
the "Fraction Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of congressional district fixed effects and
the interaction of those fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling

measurement error. Similarly, Column 4 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-
level means shown in Column 2.                                  49

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a congressional district fixed effect and
the "Fraction Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of congressional district fixed effects and
the interaction of those fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling
place level. Column 7 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these congressional-district-level disparities to account for
measurement error. Similarly, Column 4 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-
level means shown in Column 2                                   51

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a congressional district fixed effect and
the "Fraction Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of congressional district fixed effects and
the interaction of those fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling
place level. Column 7 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these congressional-district-level disparities to account for
measurement error. Similarly, Column 4 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-
level means shown in Column 2                                   52

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a congressional district fixed effect and
the "Fraction Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of congressional district fixed effects and
the interaction of those fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a congressional district fixed effect and
the "Fraction Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of congressional district fixed effects and
the interaction of those fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling
place level. Column 7 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these congressional-district-level disparities to account for
measurement error. Similarly, Column 4 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-
level means shown in Column 2                                   54

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a congressional district fixed effect and
the "Fraction Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of congressional district fixed effects and
the interaction of those fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling
place level. Column 7 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these congressional-district-level disparities to account for
measurement error. Similarly, Column 4 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-
level means shown in Column 2                                   55

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a congressional district fixed effect and
the "Fraction Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of congressional district fixed effects and
the interaction of those fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling
place level. Column 7 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these congressional-district-level disparities to account for
measurement error. Similarly, Column 4 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-
level means shown in Column 2                                   57

Notes : Columns 5-7 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a congressional district fixed effect and
the "Fraction Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of congressional district fixed effects and
the interaction of those fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling
place level. Column 7 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these congressional-district-level disparities to account for
measurement error. Similarly, Column 4 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-
level means shown in Column 2                                   58

Notes : Columns 6-8 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a county fixed effect and the "Fraction
Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of county fixed effects and the interaction of those
fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling place level. Column 7
provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these congressional-district-level disparities to account for measurement error.
Similarly, Column 5 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-level means shown in
Column 3. Column 2 displays the population of each listed county; we just show the 100 largest counties (by population in the
2017 American Community Survey's five-year estimates).

Notes : Columns 6-8 (Disparity ) correspond to the coefficients on the interaction between a county fixed effect and the "Fraction
Black" variable from the voter-level regression of wait time on the full set of county fixed effects and the interaction of those
fixed effects with "Fraction Black", omitting the constant and clustering standard errors at the polling place level. Column 7
provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of these congressional-district-level disparities to account for measurement error.
Similarly, Column 5 provides empirical-Bayes-adjusted estimates of the unadjusted congressional-district-level means shown in
Column 3. Column 2 displays the population of each listed county; we just show the 100 largest counties (by population in the
2017 American Community Survey's five-year estimates).
