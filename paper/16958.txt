Trade Adjustment and Productivity in Large Crises

                                           ABSTRACT

We empirically characterize the mechanics of trade adjustment during the Argen- tine crisis using
detailed transaction-level customs data covering the universe of import transactions during 1996-2008.
Though imports collapsed by nearly 70 percent from 2000-2002, the entry and exit of firms or products
at the country level (the \extensive margin") played a small role in this adjustment. By contrast, the
within-firm churning of inputs (the \sub-extensive margin") played a sizeable role, and we highlight
significant heterogeneity in how firms adjusted their import mix. Motivated by these facts, we build
a model of trade in intermediate inputs with heterogeneous firms, fixed import costs, and roundabout
production to evaluate the channels through which a collapse in imports affects productivity. Import
demand is non-homothetic and therefore the implications for productivity depend on the details of
individual firm adjustments and cannot be summarized by the change in the aggregate import share.
We simulate the model to discuss quantitatively these mechanisms in the context of an imported input
cost shock that produces a significant productivity decline

1         Introduction
Large crises such as the Mexican crisis in 1994–1995, the East Asian crisis in 1997–1998, and
the Argentine crisis in 2001–2002 are characterized by large exchange rate depreciations and
collapses in imports. The dollar value of Argentina’s imports, for instance, dropped by 69
percent between 2000 and 2002. A second feature of these episodes is the large decline in
real GDP and total factor productivity (TFP). Sandleris and Wright (2011) document an 11
percent decline in TFP of continuing manufacturing plants in Argentina between 2000 and
2002.1
        In this paper we do two things. First, we empirically characterize the mechanics of trade
adjustment at the firm and product level during the Argentine crisis. Our analysis makes use
of detailed firm-level customs data covering the universe of import transactions for Argentina
during 1996–2008, a period that includes a dramatic nominal exchange rate depreciation and
trade balance reversal. Second, motivated by the empirical evidence, we develop a model of
trade in intermediate inputs with heterogeneous firms, fixed import costs, and roundabout
production to evaluate the channels through which the collapse in imports affects a welfare
relevant measure of productivity in manufacturing.
        The trade literature includes many empirical analyses of the impact that permanent
shocks such as trade liberalizations have on the extensive margins of adjustment—either
via changing the allocation of resources across firms (Melitz, 2003) or via changing product
varieties (Krugman, 1980). This paper empirically evaluates how important these various
forms of extensive margin adjustment are at business cycle frequencies, particularly in the
context of a large crisis.
        We establish the following facts about the collapse in imports during Argentina’s crisis.
First, the number of firms that exit the import market is large, but when weighted by value
these exits explain a small share of the total decline in imports. The number of importing
firms dropped from over 15,000 to less than 7,000 over the first four quarters of the crisis and
did not return to its pre-crisis level for about five years. However, the net contribution of firm
entry and exit explains less than 8 percentage points of the 69 percent decline in imports
    1
    Meza and Quintin (2006) document that TFP declined by 8.6 percent in Mexico in 1994, by 15.1 percent
in Thailand, and by 7.1 percent in South Korea during the East Asian crisis.


                                                   1
during the crisis. The pattern is similar for the number of imported product varieties.
The number of distinct 10-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) product codes imported
dropped from approximately 13,000 to 10,000 over the same period and also took about five
years to recover. Product entry and exit, though, only explains between 0 and 15 percentage
points of the decline depending on the definition used. These findings hold when looking at
the quarterly or annual frequency, when looking at normal times as well as during the crisis
and recovery, and when separately considering each end-use category.
       The reason for this result is the high degree of concentration in international trade among
a small number of key firms and sectors. The largest 5 percent of importing firms contribute
approximately 85 percent of Argentina’s imports and generally do not change their import
status after the crisis.2 Similarly, the largest 5 percent of imported 6-digit HTS categories
together account for about 60 percent of imports and are rarely dropped from the set of
aggregate imports.
       However, trade in most countries, including Argentina, consists primarily of intermediate
inputs. It is therefore important to examine what happens to the bundle of imports at the
firm level as opposed to the country level. Even if a particular input variety continues to be
imported into the country, it may still be the case that several firms stop importing it and
thereby experience changes in their unit costs of production.
       As an illustration, Figure 1 shows sample import activity for two large Argentine in-
dustrial manufacturing companies, both among Argentina’s top 50 importers: BGH S.A.
and Siderca S.A.I.C. Both companies imported heavily in key intermediate input categories
before the crisis, but stopped importing these inputs during the crisis.3 These products
disappeared from the import bundle of these two companies, but this absence would not be
observable in aggregate data because other Argentine firms continued to make purchases in
all of these categories during the same period. Further, while these two companies stopped
   2
     As discussed below, we can rule out the possibility that the largest importers are simply huge distributors
or import/export brokers.
   3
     BGH imported industrial cooling fans and anti-vibration materials, largely from Motorola, during most
quarters in 2000 and 2001. With the onset of the crisis and after the exchange rate shock, imports of those
goods dropped to zero for six quarters, only to return in late 2003. Siderca, after importing more than
$2 million of tools for steel-cutting lathes in 2001 and spending more than $200,000 on imported tools for
aluminum smelting and mixing, exited those import markets completely in 2002 and early 2003. By late
2003, they returned to importing in those sectors and by 2004 spent almost $9 million on those imported
goods.

                                                       2
importing these particular inputs, neither company would appear in aggregate extensive
margin calculations because they continued importing at least some other product during
the crisis. More generally we document that many imported products which are dropped
by a clear majority of importers are not considered to be dropped varieties at the aggregate
level because a minority of firms continue to import them. A product only contributes to
the extensive margin at the country level if all importers of that variety happen to decide to
stop importing it, something unlikely to happen for goods with large import volumes.

            Figure 1: Sample Quarterly Product Imports for Two Large Argentine Firms


      This observation leads to our second empirical finding: Within-firm changes in the mix of
imported varieties and supplier countries, regardless of whether other importers drop those
same varieties, play a significant role in trade adjustment. This within-firm extensive margin,
or “sub-extensive” margin, explains up to 45 percent of the 69 percent decline in imports
between 2000 and 2002.
      Third, we find that the way importers adjust their imports varies with the size of the
firm. The extensive margin, when a firm exits trade entirely, is the most prevalent margin of
external adjustment for the smallest firms. Among continuing importers, the sub-extensive
margin becomes less important as the size of the importer grows. The largest firms adjust
primarily by reducing—but not dropping—their imports of particular products, which we
call the sub-intensive margin. As a result, the largest pre-crisis importers exhibited smaller
percentage declines in their import volumes.

                                                                                    3
   Fourth, we estimate the impact of sub-extensive margin adjustment on unit costs under
the assumption of a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. If inputs
are imperfect substitutes, a drop in the number of imported varieties used will raise firms’
unit costs of production. In the absence of firm-level data, one would conclude that the
impact on the unit cost of an import bundle arising from dropped varieties is close to zero.
Our firm-level data, by contrast, imply that this unit cost increased by up to 13 percentage
points for a typical importer due to the sub-extensive margin.
   Motivated by these empirical facts, we build a simple partial equilibrium model of a
monopolistically competitive industry (manufacturing) that imports intermediate inputs.
The firms in the industry differ in terms of their technology, pay fixed costs for importing
input varieties, and use each other’s output as inputs giving rise to roundabout production.
The intermediate input aggregator in the production function displays a “love of variety”
feature with inputs being imperfectly substitutable as in Ethier (1982). We introduce an
imported input cost shock and study the implications for a welfare relevant measure of
productivity.
   We start by using the model to clarify why imperfect competition implies that, in contrast
to findings in the previous literature, terms of trade shocks have a first-order effect on
productivity. We follow Basu and Fernald (2002) and calculate productivity as the Solow
residual with value added factor share weights that need not sum to one, the standard welfare
relevant measure. We assume imperfect competition in the product market, which implies
that the marginal rate of transformation of factors in the production function exceeds their
marginal rate of substitution in the utility function. As a result, shocks that reduce the
scale of a firm’s production have a first order effect on productivity even when technology is
unchanged, an insight that goes back to Hall (1988, 1990).
   An imported input cost shock increases the unit cost of production because domestic
and imported inputs are imperfectly substitutable. Roundabout production amplifies the
shock because the increase in one firm’s costs results in higher output prices which imply
higher input prices for other firms. These cost increases can reduce the relative demand
for output of sectors that rely on imported inputs (manufacturing) relative to those that
do not (like services) generating a decline in the scale of production of manufacturing and

                                              4
therefore productivity. The presence of intermediate inputs can render large the impact on
productivity, even when markups are small but non-zero.
   Next, we use the theory to focus on three repercussions for productivity of our empirical
findings on the sub-extensive margin. First, in the presence of fixed costs, firms adjust input
use both along the intensive and sub-extensive margins by dropping imported varieties. The
elasticity of imports to the shock is therefore bigger. Moreover, the change in imported
input varieties generates an increase in unit costs above and beyond that implied by the
shock, along the lines of Halpern, Koren, and Szeidl (2009). These two forces work in the
direction of generating a greater decline in productivity. On the other hand, there is also
a force pushing productivity in the opposite direction, as less labor is used to pay for fixed
costs. Second, we show that the model with sub-extensive margin generates non-homothetic
import demand, with larger firms importing a larger set of varieties. This implies the impact
on aggregate productivity will depend on the details of the individual firms’ responses to the
shock and cannot be summarized by the change in the aggregate import share. Differences in
sub-extensive margin adjustment imply differences in the change in firms’ unit costs, leading
to changes in firms’ market shares. The change in aggregate import share does not equal
the import-weighted sum of changes in firm-level import shares. Third, our theory clarifies
how the sub-extensive margin implies mismeasurement of productivity. Standard national
accounting practices, including those used in Argentina, use “matched-model” price indices
that ignore changes in varieties. If production is CES, this practice would underestimate
the increase in input prices, thereby increasing imputed real intermediate input use and
decreasing measured productivity. This mismeasurement is only economically meaningful
when taking into account the sub-exensive margin.
   We then calibrate the input cost shock to match our empirical findings for Argentina and
simulate the model to evaluate quantitatively the combined impact of these channels relative
to standard models that exclude sub-extensive margin adjustment. The effects of the shock
are sizable with productivity declining by over 5 percentage points. In the absense of firm-
level data, one might ignore heterogeneity in trade responses across firms and conclude that
dropped input varieties were not an important part of adjustment. We therefore compare our
benchmark simulation to a calibration of our model without fixed costs, as one might choose

                                              5
if guided only by aggregate data. We show that the model with active sub-extensive margin
adjustment exhibits a productivity decline nearly 30 percent larger, or 1.2 percentage point
more, than that in the equivalent specification without a sub-extensive margin and exposed
to the same shock. If we additionally take into account the mismeasurement implied by
dropped varieties, the sub-extensive margin generates a measured productivity decline more
than 50 percent larger than the equivalent model without a sub-extensive margin. We also
consider simulations without roundabout production and find the productivity decline is
about one half the size of the benchmark case.
       There clearly were many other negative shocks that impacted productivity during the
Argentine crisis. The time-series pattern for TFP, imported input use, and sub-extensive
margin adjustments, however, do offer corroboration that the mechanisms highlighted in
our paper may well have been salient for TFP in Argentina over this period. The share
of input spending on imports and the importance of the within-firm dropping of import
varieties moved together with TFP both in the period of economic decline and recovery.
We focus on Argentina due to the availability of long-dated and detailed transaction-level
data surrounding an acute sudden stop and exchange rate shock. Our analysis, however, has
broader relevance and can help answer the question of how trade adjusts and the impact
this adjustment has on the macroeconomy during business cycles and crisis episodes.

Related Literature
       This paper relates to many literatures. First, it relates to the literature that empirically
characterizes the margins of trade adjustment and is consistent with the findings of Bernard,
Jensen, and Schott (2009) and Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2009) who use U.S.
data to document that the firm and aggregate product extensive margins are small while
the sub-extensive margin is large.4 Distinct from their analysis we focus on a dramatically
larger trade adjustment episode using the Argentine experience and specifically evaluate the
implications of these findings for productivity.
       Second, it is related to the literature that evaluates the impact of imported interme-
diate inputs on productivity. See, for instance, Amiti and Konings (2007) and Goldberg,
   4
    Also see di Giovanni and Levchenko (2009) who argue that this finding can imply the welfare impact of
high entry costs on production is small.


                                                   6
Khandelwal, Pauvcnik, and Topalova (2009) for the impact of liberalization and increased
trade in Indonesia and India, respectively. Halpern, Koren, and Szeidl (2009) use Hungarian
firm-level data to document gains from improved access to imports when these imports are
imperfectly substitutable for domestic inputs at the firm level. Their measure of productiv-
ity gains is the decline in firms’ unit costs (marginal costs) of production arising through
the sub-extensive margin. We evaluate the impact on a welfare relevant measure of produc-
tivity that differs from changes in unit cost, and we study the implications for aggregate
productivity of the various margins of trade adjustment.5
       Third, our work relates to research linking terms of trade shocks to productivity and
welfare. Kehoe and Ruhl (2008) argue that, under perfect competition, terms of trade
movements have no first-order effects on productivity. This is not the case in our environment
since firms are price setters who charge markups. As is well known from Hall (1990) and Basu
and Fernald (2002), in the presence of markups, variations in the use of primary factors and
in the intensity of use of intermediate inputs will have a first order impact on productivity.6
       Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2011) point out that in a broad class of models,
all that is needed to evaluate trade-induced changes in welfare is the observed change in
aggregate trade shares and an appropriate elasticity. The specifics of firm-level adjustment
do not matter. On the contrary, in our setting the full distribution of import shares are
needed to evaluate aggregate effects on welfare and productivity. There are economically
meaningful differences between an environment with and without fixed costs even when they
both generate the same change in aggregate import shares.
       Lastly, our work is related to Sandleris and Wright (2011) and Neumeyer and Sandleris
   5
      Broda, Greenfield, and Weinstein (2006) also evaluate the gains in unit costs in many countries brought
about by increased input varieties at the sector level from 1994–2003. Feenstra, Mandel, Reinsdorf, and
Slaughter (2009) consider the possibility that unmeasured gains in the terms of trade around 1995 contributed
to the measured productivity acceleration in the United States. Among other channels, they highlight the
failure of conventional price indices to account for the increase in varieties of traded information technology
products. Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2005) note, also in the context of the Argentine crisis, that
changes in price indices may be biased downward during large devaluations because households substitute
toward lower-quality goods. Burstein and Cravino (2010) evaluate how trade liberalizations lead to increases
in real GDP if price indices partially capture reductions in tariffs.
    6
      Ghironi and Melitz (2005) highlight the impact of firm entry and exit decisions on business cycle mo-
ments. Mendoza and Yue (2009) explore quantitatively the impact of imperfect substitutability between
domestic and imported intermediate inputs coupled with a worsening of the terms of trade on the amplifi-
cation of financial shocks.

(2010), which explore the impact of misallocation on TFP during the Argentine crisis and
find that it plays an important role. We view our explanation for the productivity decline
as complementary to the one proposed in these other papers.



2         Data
After eight years of growth averaging just under 6 percent per year, Argentina entered a
recession in 1999, with GDP, consumption, and investment all declining in real terms. The
recession worsened sharply in 2001:Q4, with real GDP ending 2002:Q1 more than 16 percent
below its level a year earlier. A large banking and currency crisis ensued and the Argentine
peso rapidly depreciated by nearly 200 percent relative to the U.S. dollar. Argentina’s
dollar-denominated import price index was relatively stable, implying an upward spike in
peso-denominated import prices that resulted in a 69 percent drop in dollar imports from
2000 to 2002.7
        We now describe the data we use on firms and trade transactions during the Argentine
crisis. We bring together three datasets, starting with two datasets containing Argentine
customs data provided by private vendors called Datamyne and Nosis. We combine these
data with operating and financial information on the largest Argentine firms, available from
the Capital IQ database.


2.1        Detailed Trade Data from Customs

Our data are collected from import and export shipping manifests by the customs agency
in Argentina and are publicly released. The data vary somewhat in coverage over time,
but give detailed information for each trade shipment, generally including the name of the
importer or exporter, the date of declaration, the source or destination country, the quantity,
weight, price, and value of the good, along with detailed information at levels at least
as disaggregated as the 10-digit HTS classification.8 We obtained most of our data from
    7
     There was a secular shift in import market shares away from U.S. and toward Brazilian exporters
from 1999–2006, but the crisis of 2001–2002 itself did not have an obvious impact on the import shares of
Argentina’s trading partners.
   8
     Argentina additionally adds its own code with an 11th digit and a letter (as the 12th character, A-Z) to
the HTS classification, so these products can often be easily distinguished at a 12-digit level.

                                    Figure 2: Our Dataset Compared to Other Sources


          Figure 2(a) compares the total value of Argentina’s imports in our dataset with the value
reported in the International Financial Statistics database provided by the International
Monetary Fund. The data line up extremely well, including at high frequency, with the
only exception being a period from mid-1997 to early 1999 when our data miss about one-
third of the imports because Argentine customs did not provide it to Datamyne. Further,
we compare reporting on these flows to their counterparts in data collected by the Foreign
Trade Division of the U.S. Census Bureau. Figure 2(b) demonstrates that though some
discrepancies clearly exist, the basic patterns captured in the U.S. bilateral trade data are
also reflected in our micro dataset.
          Economy-wide, imports come from more than 100 countries, include more than 15,000
HTS codes, and often reflect more than 100,000 different country and product code combi-
nations. The smallest importers may trade with only one partner, but some importers are

    Though Datamyne does not add or edit any information on its own, it takes significant measures to ensure
the information is fully and accurately transmitted from the customs authority. Moreover it is among the
few such data providers that has received International Standards Organization (ISO) certification, reflecting
the reliability of its quality control systems.

                                 Table 1: Import Summary Statistics


       The Datamyne data include the equivalent information on export transactions from 1996–
2008, though the exporter names are redacted from 2000 onward. This redaction was per-
formed by Argentina’s customs authority and is not specific to the Datamyne data. To
overcome this problem, we merge the data from Datamyne with another dataset covering
the period subsequent to 2000 that we obtained from Nosis, a private vendor.10 Unfortu-
nately, the Nosis data omit firm identifiers for a large share of the transactions in 2000 and
2001, so we cannot do the same analyses for exports as we do for imports.11
  10
      Nosis combines their own market knowledge with an algorithm that compares export transactions for
the post-2000 period, when exporter names are not available, to earlier transactions that include the names
in order to generate a “probable exporter.” For instance, if an export transaction in 2003 had similar port,
HTS, volume, and destination information as several of BGH’s export transactions from the late 1990s,
the algorithm would likely list BGH as the exporter in 2003. The Nosis database does not contain tax
identification codes that we use as our firm identifiers so we hired data analysts to use text-matching software
to link the two parts of our export data. We identify each firm by its CUIT, which is the company’s tax
identification number. This is a more stable and reliable indicator of each firm than the “name” field, which
is more prone, for example, to typographical errors.

2.2       Capital IQ Database

We match the firm names in our trade data with the Capital IQ database so we can learn more
about the importers themselves. Capital IQ contains operating and financial information on
about 4,500 firms in Argentina, including public, private, domestic, and multinational firms.
Our trade data include dramatically more firms, but given the concentration of trade and
Capital IQ information among the largest firms, we are able to match firms accounting for
60–70 percent of Argentina’s imports.
       Table 7 (found at the end of the paper) lists Argentina’s largest 50 importers for the
period 1996–2008, along with their primary industry and primary sector, as reported in the
Capital IQ database.12 Seven of the largest eight importers, themselves responsible for a
bit less than 10 percent of total imports in a typical year, are all Argentine subsidiaries
of foreign automobile manufacturers. Outside of these seven, however, many industries are
represented with no obvious concentrations or patterns. Though most of the companies are
recognizably not trading firms or distributors, we formalize this analysis using data on the
primary industry of importing firms. The monthly share of imports by firms with primary
industry data that go to firms classified as “Distributors,” “Food Distributors,” “Healthcare
Distributors,” “Technology Distributors,” or “Trading Companies and Distributors” ranges
from about 3 to 8 percent. These percentages are fairly stable throughout the dataset.



3        Empirical Findings
In this section we report our main empirical findings. We show that the large decline in
aggregate imports during the crisis is explained primarily by declines from continuing im-
porters and has little to do with the entry and exit of firms into and out of import status.
The adjustment in trade takes place within firms at what we call the sub-intensive and
sub-extensive margins as firms both reduce the import value of each continuing variety and
reduce the number of imported varieties. Firms typically differ, however, in their decisions of
which varieties to drop, with one firm dropping a variety and another continuing to import
  12
    We exclude Argentina’s Central Bank, which is credited in the data with some import flows associated
with its extension of trade financing. We had a research assistent fill in blank entries for companies’ primary
sector and primary industry classifications.

                                                      11
that same item. As a result, our firm-level data reveal that the product extensive margin is
an important source for adjustment, but an analysis of aggregate data would conclude it is
insignificant.
   Additionally, we show that the relative importance of the extensive, sub-extensive, and
sub-intensive margins varies with firm size, and the import volumes of larger importers
decline proportionately less than those of smaller importers. Finally, we show that if inputs
are imperfect substitutes, within-firm sub-extensive margin adjustment impacts the unit cost
of production for firms. Assuming a constant elasticity of substitution, we calculate that
the unit cost of the typical import bundle increased up to 13 percentage points more than
what one would infer based only on information contained in aggregate data. We describe
in detail the findings below.
Finding 1: Defined as the entry and exit of firms or the entry and exit of
products at the country level, the “extensive margin” plays a small role in
understanding trade adjustment during the crisis.

   Total dollar imports declined by 69 percent from 2000 to 2002. We first evaluate what
fraction of this decline is explained by firm entry and exit into and out of import status and
similarly what fraction is explained by the entry and exit of products into the import bundle.
Figure 3 shows the number of importers and number of imported 10-digit HTS categories
for 1996–2008, excluding the period in the late 1990s when the data are incomplete. We
find that the number of firms that imported any goods in each quarter dropped by more
than one-half and the number of imported product categories dropped by nearly one-fourth.
However, in terms of volumes these entries and exits explain a small fraction of the decline
in imports.
   We can disaggregate the intensive margin from the importers’ margins of entry and exit
as follows:

in period t, vt =       i∈Ψt   vi,t are total imports in the economy, and ∆vt = vt − vt−1 . The
first term on the right hand side of Equation (1) is the intensive margin and captures the
change in imports from continuing importers. The second term is the extensive margin and
captures the value of imports from new importers net of the volume lost from those that
stopped importing in period t.
   Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show, for definitions of t as quarters and as years, the breakdown
of aggregate movements in trade by intensive and extensive margins. Note that the sum of
these lines equals the growth rate of aggregate imports. They plot the share of overall import
growth due to each margin, not the growth of each margin, and therefore correspond to the
economic significance of each type of adjustment. The plots demonstrate that the entry or
exit of firms or products attribute only a small share of the change in the volume of imports.
For example, the black line in Figure 4(b) dips to about -57 percent in 2002 while the red
line reaches about -4 percent. This means that while overall imports declined by nearly 61
percent in 2002 compared to 2001, the vast majority came from the intensive margin.
   We can do the equivalent exercise for products, where we use the same disaggregation
(1), but redefine Ψt to be the set of all imported product categories in period t. Figures

4(c) and 4(d) use the 10-digit HTS definition, and Figures 4(e) and 4(f) define goods as the
interaction of the 10-digit HTS code and exporting country. Argentina implemented HTS
revisions in 1996/1997 (though it is unclear which month), May 2002, and May 2007. This
series of revisions potentially introduces an upward bias in our calculation of the extensive
margin’s importance. We use the concordance in Pierce and Schott (2009) to attempt to
solve this problem, but can only apply this procedure for the 6-digit HTS codes. Pierce and
Schott base their concordance on U.S. data, and 6-digit is the most disaggregated level at
which the codes are internationally comparable. These adjustments make little qualitative
or quantitative difference. As with the extensive margin of importers, the quantitative
importance of the extensive margin of imported products is small.13 (One exception is 1997,
when the changing code definitions clearly impacted the 10-digit disaggregation.)

                       Table 2: Intensive and Extensive Margins, 2000–2002

       Table 2 summarizes these results and splits total trade adjustment for 2000-2002 into
intensive and extensive margins for varying product definitions. Total imports in 2002 were
69 percent below their already depressed levels in 2000 and these flows were generated by
about half as many importing firms. However, the last column of the top row shows that
the contribution to the 69 percent decline from the firm extensive margin was less than 11
percent, or 8 percentage points, and the last column of the second row shows that essentially
none of this adjustment came from dropped 6-digit product categories. Very little trade
adjustment at business-cycle frequencies, even in the event of a large contraction in imports,
  13
     We have also looked at the trade patterns for 1996–2008 of a constant set of goods or importers chosen
to include all goods of firms involved in trade in a particular year. The exit of imported products is virtually
irrelevant for the long-term change in imports through the crisis — from late 1998 to early 2002 — and new
products explain at most about one-quarter of import growth from 2002 to late 2006. We have separately
generated these plots by good type and the pattern is very similar across 1-digit end-use categories.

is explained by firm entry and exit or by product entry and exit at the aggregate level. This
finding extends the findings in Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2009) and Arkolakis,
Demidova, Klenow, and Rodriguez-Clare (2008) to characterize a dramatically larger trade
adjustment.

Finding 2: The within-firm churning of inputs, which we call the “sub-extensive
margin,” plays a sizeable role in aggregate trade adjustment.

       We now consider changes in the mix of products imported by each firm, a margin we
call the sub-extensive margin. In contrast to the extensive margin of importers or goods at
the economy-wide level, this within-firm margin plays an essential role in aggregate trade
adjustment. This result is depicted in Figure 5, where the sub-extensive margin is defined
firm-by-firm and includes changes in imports for continuing importers due to newly imported
or newly dropped goods (defined, as above, in a variety of ways).14 The black lines plot the
contribution to the total change in imports coming from continuing importer-product com-
binations (“the sub-intensive margin”), while the red lines plot the combined contribution
from within-importer variety churning (“the sub-extensive margin”) and entry or exit of
firms themselves (“the extensive margin”). Notice that, in juxtaposition to Figure 4, the
declines in the red and black lines during the crisis are of a similar magnitude in Figures 5(a)
to 5(d). In fact, Figures 5(a) and Figures 5(c) show that the sub-extensive and extensive
margins can explain more than 50 percent of adjustment during the peak crisis quarter. This
is consistent with Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2009), who also note significant
within-firm trade variety churning in U.S. data and conjecture that the welfare effect of
increasing product varieties is underestimated in country-level measures.
       Table 3 quantifies more precisely the importance of these margins by listing the fraction
of the 69 percent overall decline in dollar imports from 2000 to 2002 as explained by the
different definitions of the extensive, sub-extensive, and sub-intensive margins. Table 2
showed that whether the extensive margin is defined as entering/exiting firms or products
(whether HTS-6 or HTS-10) at the country level, it explains little of the decline. By contrast,
the third column of Table 3 shows that within-firm changes in import categories explains a
  14
   We omit separate plots of this disaggregation by end-use but have confirmed that the sub-extensive
margin is significant for each of the end-use categories (with the automotive sector as the only exception).

large share up to 45 percent of the decline, even over a two year period, depending on the
product variety definition used.
   The importance of the sub-extensive margin (Finding 2 ) is consistent with the small
role played by the country-level extensive margin (Finding 1 ) because there is heterogeneity
across firms in the products imported. For example, imagine that before the crisis two
firms, Siemens Argentina and C.T.I., both imported the same semiconductor, but C.T.I.
stopped importing the chip after the peso depreciation. In this case, the country-level product

adjustment capturing the elimination of C.T.I.’s semiconductor imports.

ing the four quarters ending in September 2001, before the crisis.15 We exclude country-level
extensive margin products that were dropped from Argentina’s aggregate import bundle.
The blue circles indicate the share of importer-product combinations in each of these per-
centiles that were dropped during the following four quarters. For any grouping of imported
products, somewhere between 60 and 75 percent of the firms that imported it before the
crisis stopped doing so subsequently. Many imported products which are dropped by a clear
majority of importers are not considered to be dropped varieties at the aggregate level be-
cause a minority of firms continue to import them. Perfect synchronization is required across
importers in terms of the products they add or drop for the product extensive margin to
show up at the country level, an occurrance which would correspond to a blue circle reaching
1.0 in Figure 6.

Finding 3: Smaller importers typically experienced a greater percentage decline
in imports than larger importers. Further, the relative importance of the three
adjustment margins varies with firm size.

       The pattern of trade adjustment varies with the size of the importer (as proxied by
the size of imports). Figure 7(a) divides firms into percentiles based on the size of their
imports in 2000.16 The cirlces clearly increase (become less negative) as one moves from the
smallest firms on the left to the larger firms on the right, indicating that the largest buckets
of importers had smaller magnitude declines in their imports from 2000 to 2002.17 This

$50,000/$210,000/$770,000.

           To show this, we can decompose these trade declines into the three margins of adjustment.
Firms that stop importing altogether adjust along the extensive margin. The remaining firms
(nearly all in the smallest 5 percentiles to the left of the plots) that exhibited an increase in imports of more
than 100 percent.


                                                                                                                           19
adjust using a combination of the sub-extensive margin, which is the dropping of imported
varieties (or addition of new ones), and the sub-intensive margin, which is the reduction (or
increase) in flows within a variety with continuing imports. Figure 7(b) plots the share of
each of these three margins in the adjustment of existing combinations of importing firm
and HTS 10-digit products pooled by the percentile of the firm’s total imports in 2000 (our
proxy for size).18 The three margins, of course, must sum to 1.
       Diamond markers are used to plot extensive margin adjustment, and so a diamond placed
at a y-axis value of 1 would mean that all importers within that percentile exited trade in
2000. The declining diamond marker values indicates that the prevalence of extensive margin
adjustment declines as firm size increases. Differences between the sub-extensive and sub-
intensive margins are less stark, but the relative importance of the sub-intensive margin is
greatest among the very largest firms, as evidenced by the fact that the square markers
are above the triangle markers for the very largest firms on the right. Heterogeneity in the
importance of these margins underlies the heterogeneity in the degree of trade adjustment
across firms of different sizes.19
       The fact that the relative importance of the extensive margin and the magnitude of
changes in imports declines with size across essentially all sub-regions of the importer size
distribution suggests that this effect is not driven by industry composition or by the difference
between multinationals and domestic firms. However, to test this more formally, we run a
series of regressions of the form:


                         vbi = β0 + β1 ln(vi,2000 ) + β2 sector + β3 M N C + εi ,


where vbi is the growth of firm i’s imports from 2000 to 2002, vi,2000 is the level of firm i’s
imports in 2000, “sector” is a dummy variable that corresponds to the 10 different primary
sectors identified in the Capital IQ database, and “MNC” is an indicator for when the firm
is a multinational.20 We can only run this regression with the approximately 1,350 firms
  18
     The plot ignores the small value of firm-product combinations that were added in 2002 relative to 2000.
  19
     Some of these patterns are consistent with trade flows being innately lumpy as in Armenter and Koren
(2010). In our analysis below, it makes little difference whether the patterns are generated by lumpiness or
by fixed costs, so long as they generate heterogeneity in trade adjustment and cause firms to drop varieties.
  20
     We are motivated by work such as Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) in considering whether a firm is a



                                                     20
that match with the Capital IQ database in 2000. This set represents more than half of all
import flows, but the small number of observations rules out inclusion of more covariates. We
run this regression without dummies, with sector dummies, and with both sector dummies
and a dummy for multinationals. The sector dummies pick up a moderate amount of cross-
sector heterogeneity and the multinational dummy suggests that imports by multinationals
dropped about 7 percentage points less than domestic firms. However, the coefficient on
size, β1 , is positive and significant at the 1 percent level in all three regressions.21

Finding 4: Assuming imported inputs are combined in a CES aggregator, the
scale of the firm-level extensive margin adjustment implies that the price of
the imported input bundle increased up to 13 percentage points more than the
increase implied by aggregate data.

    As is well known, the ideal price index of a CES production function changes due to
both input prices and the number of input varieties. Let Mt be a CES aggregate of varieties
k ∈ Ψt with prices pk,t that combine with an elasticity of substitution 1/(1 − θ). Following
Feenstra (1994), we write the growth of the unit import cost index PbMt as:

                   PMt (pk,t ; k ∈ Ψt )
      PbMt =
                PMt−1 (pk,t−1 ; k ∈ Ψt−1 )

                                                                        vk,t /                  vk,t
                                                 

              =                                             P                     P

                                                      ft is growth in unit costs that ignores

differences in Ψt−1 and Ψt . Ft captures the impact on unit costs of a change in varieties.
It also equals the factor by which growth in a conventionally measured price index PbM
                                                                                     f will

multinational since the ability to borrow through internal credit markets might plausibly have mattered
during this episode. Firms with headquarters in foreign countries are classified as multinationals. When a
firm’s listed headquarters was in Argentina, research assistants looked in industry databases such as Hoovers
as well as company websites to try determine if any foreign operations existed. If so, we label the company a
multinational. If no foreign operations were found, or if the company does not have a website, we label it a
domestic firm. If anything, this vetting errs on the side of having less multinationals. With this classification,
multinationals account for about three quarters of all imports of firms included in the Capital IQ database.
   21
      We do note that these regressions are more sensitive to specification than would be suggested by Figure
7(a). This is because by including only the largest firms (which match with the Capital IQ database), we
significantly limit the degree of size variation in the data and omit most extensive margin adjusters.

differ from growth in the true index PbM .
       The first column of Table 4 lists the aggregate factor F calculated from aggregate data for
2000–2002 for various definitions of product variety and using an elasticity equal to 4, a value
near the middle of a relatively wide range of estimates found in a large literature.22 When the
extensive margin is defined at the country level without taking into account the within-firm
sub-extensive margin, F ranges from 0.992 to 1.012 percent depending on the granularity
with which we define product categories. None of these corrections is meaningfully different
from 1. Consistent with our finding that very little trade adjustment is done via the country-
level extensive margin (Finding 1 ), the aggregate data suggest there is no meaningful impact
from dropped varieties on the cost of an imported input bundle.23

       Table 4: Impact of Product Extensive Margin on Imported Input Costs, 2000-2002

       Next, we use the information available in the firm-level data to calculate the impact of
the product sub-extensive margin on the cost to each firm of its imported input bundle.
The calculation is identical to that in Equation (2) but adding a firm index i to all val-
ues and yielding: PbMi,t = PbM
                             fi,t Fi,t . The second through fourth columns of Table 4 give

the trade-weighted average of firm-level factors Fi including all firms, after excluding the
top and bottom 5 percent of correction factors, and after excluding the top and bottom 20
percent of correction factors. We only include firms that had positive import flows in both
  22
      For example, Broda and Weinstein (2006) define a product variety as the interaction of an HTS 10-
digit code and country and obtain a median elasticity estimate of 2.9 and a mean elasticity estimate of 8.2.
Eaton and Kortum (2002) generate an estimate of 8.28, Bernard, Eaton, Kortum, and Jensen (2003) give
an estimate of 3.6, and the estimate in Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2011) equals 4.87.
   23
      This is similar to the finding in Arkolakis, Demidova, Klenow, and Rodriguez-Clare (2008) who evaluate
the effect of trade liberalization in Costa Rica on increased import variety over the period 1986–1992. They
find that the gains from importing a larger variety of goods following the liberalization is small because
import spending is concentrated in a few products that were imported before liberalization. They estimate
the F to be 0.997 for consumer goods and 1 for intermediate goods.

                                                    22
2000 and 2002. The impact of the product sub-extensive margin Fi differs somewhat across
specifications, product definitions, and treatment of the outliers, but is always economically
significant. The average value in these columns ranges from 6.4 to 13.4 percent. Consistent
with Finding 2, under the assumption of a CES production function, sub-extensive margin
adjustment driven by within-firm input churning has a large impact on the cost of an im-
ported input bundle. In essence, rather than focusing only on the traditional terms of trade
measured at the country level, we show that one must focus on the firm-level terms of trade.
       It is clearly the case that as the level of disaggregation increases more of the adjustment
will be classified as extensive or sub-extensive, so a reasonable question is what is a meaning-
ful level of disaggregation for this exercise? Previous quantification of the product extensive
margin, as in Broda and Weinstein (2006), Broda, Greenfield, and Weinstein (2006), or
Arkolakis, Demidova, Klenow, and Rodriguez-Clare (2008) has been done at the country or
sector level. This categorization is appropriate under the assumption that all imports are
final goods consumed by agents with homothetic preferences or are intermediates consumed
by a representative firm. In such a setup, if a good enters the country, it also enters the
representative consumer’s consumption bundle or the representative firm’s input bundle. By
contrast, our calculations assume that all imported goods are intermediates used only by
the importing firm. In the context of the above example, we assume Siemens’ continued
semiconductor imports reflects their continued use of the input in production, while C.T.I.’s
dropping of that particular input implies it is no longer using it in production.
       In essence, we assume that when a firm does not import a variety it is not using that
variety in production. We believe this is generally the most appropriate assumption, but it
is violated if firms purchase inputs from a domestic distributor who imports it or if firms
draw down holdings of a particular input from inventory.24 As discussed above, the share of
imports due to distributors is low throughout the sample and in fact decreases during the
crisis, ruling out the first concern.
       To get a quantitative sense for the importance of the inventory mechanism for our mea-
surements, we would ideally like to condition firm import behavior on changes in their

inventories. Unfortunately, firm or detailed sector level data on inventories are not broadly
available for Argentina. As an alternative, we classify 6-digit HTS sectors into three groups
with low, medium, and high inventory intensities, based on the inventory/sales ratio in the
corresponding 3-digit NAICS manufacturing sector in U.S. Census data from 2000. Figure
8 plots the evolution of the value of imports for the three groups, where the lines are each
normalized to equal one prior to the crisis. The plot shows differential trajectories through
the crisis period, despite similar import behavior in the runup to the crisis.25 For instance,
comparing 2002:Q1-Q2 with 2001:Q1-Q2, low inventory intensity imports dropped by 53
percent, compared to a 73 percent decline in the other two categories.

      These results show that ignoring inventories may lead to an overstatement of the change
in varieties used in production because the import decline was steepest in sectors presumably
holding large inventories. For this reason, we focus on the 2000–2002 period. Given that
U.S. manufacturing inventories typically equal from 1 to 2 months of sales, this substantially
longer period should alleviate the concern that firms continued producing with inventoried
imported inputs. In our simulations in Section 5.7, we will also take inventories into account
 25
      The average monthly inventory to sales ratio in the three groups equals 1.2, 1.5, and 1.9.


                                                      24
by reducing the magnitude of the simulated shock such that the drop in imported input use
is consistent with the more muted decline seen in imports of the lowest inventory intensive
categories.
      Finally, one might be concerned that the reduction of import varieties need not impact
production costs if there is a similar reduction in final good varieties. For instance, if each
import variety is used by multiproduct firms to produce a single output variety, then the
reduction in imports can simply follow from a reduction in final good varieties without
altering in any way the production of continuing goods (though this reduction will still
have welfare effects). The best evidence against such a hypothesis would be data on total
varieties produced, which we do not have. However, we can proxy for the number of varieties
available for domestic consumption by looking at the varieties exported from Argentina over
this period. Figure 9(a) shows that in the aggregate there is a small secular increase in both
import and export varieties from 2000 to 2008. Imported varieties, however, sharply collapsed
during the crisis while export varieties barely changed (and, if anything, increased).26

                  Figure 9: Export Varieties did not Decline Along with Import Varieties

      Even stronger evidence comes from matching the imports and exports of the same firm
and regressing import varieties, export varieties, and their difference, on time fixed effects
after absorbing firm fixed effects. The quarter fixed effects from this regression are plotted
in Figure 9(b) and show that while the number of both import and export varieties have
 26
      Plots 9(a) and 9(b) have been seasonally adjusted by removing estimated quarter time-effects.


                                                                                  25
a similar long-term growth rate from 1996 to 2008, they diverge dramatically during the
crisis, with firms importing far fewer varieties to support relatively stable numbers of export
varieties.27 This evidence suggests that it was not the case that all (or any) of the decline
in imported input varieties was accompanied by a reduction in final good varieties.28
       In sum, the micro data indicate that dropped product varieties by continuing importers,
the sub-extensive margin, plays an important role in trade adjustment, a conclusion that
could not be inferred from aggregate data. In this sense, studying the micro data is important
for thinking about the appropriate model for trade in intermediate inputs. This in turn is
important for understanding the impact on productivity of trade shocks, something we turn
to in the next sections.



4        Multi-Input Firms, Trade, and Productivity
Consistent with Findings 1-4, we build a model where firms combine labor, capital, and a
continuum of imported and domestically sourced intermediate inputs to produce a unique
variety of good that is used both for final consumption and as an intermediate input by
other firms. The intermediate input aggregator in the production function displays a “love of
variety” feature with inputs being imperfectly substitutable as in Ethier (1982). Firms differ
in their technologies and they pay a fixed cost for each variety of input that is imported.29
       This model generates both within-firm adjustment on the sub-extensive margin and het-
erogeneity in trade adjustment across firms. Firms with worse technology will not have
sufficient scale to cover the fixed costs of importing a larger number of varieties. Conse-
quently, firms will differ in the share of their spending on inputs that are imported. This
  27
      As discussed in the data description, our economy-wide export data have large gaps before 2000, which
is why Figure 9(a) starts in 2000. Our firm-level export data are of lower quality before 2002:Q1, but if the
missing flows reflect the omission of representative exporters in their entirety, rather than the omission of
some subsets of given exporters’ shipments, then the fixed effect regression in Figure 9(b) will be unaffected.
At a minimum, the export series from 2002 onward and the entire import series in Figure 9(b) are uncorrupted
by data concerns. Even over this smaller region, the evidence suggests export varieties did not drop along
with import varieties.
   28
      Since we do not have data on purchases of domestic input varieties, we cannot evaluate the impact on
the domestic input component of unit costs of changes (if any) of the number of domestic varieties used.
   29
      Motivated by Finding 1, there is no fixed cost for entry into import status and therefore firm entry and
exit will play no role in trade adjustment. We have performed calculations with a fixed entry cost calibrated
to match the data and found little difference with a model without fixed entry costs in its implications for
productivity.

                                                      26
endogenously generates an additional source of variation in the unit cost of production across
firms, in addition to the exogenous technological differences. We use the model to evaluate
the channels through which an imported input cost shock can affect the welfare relevant
measure of manufacturing productivity. We show that these effects are sizable and when
calibrated to Argentina can generate a productivity decline of over 5 percentage points.
   The aggregate data misleadingly imply that dropped input varieties were not an impor-
tant part of adjustment and give no evidence of non-homotheticities in import demand. In
the absence of firm-level data, therefore, the most natural model of trade during the Ar-
gentine crisis would omit fixed costs. We compare our benchmark model to this model and
show that the model with sub-extensive margin adjustment exhibits a productivity decline
that is 30 percent, or 1.2 percentage point, larger. Due to mismeasurement associated with
dropped varieties, the implications are even greater for measured productivity.


4.1    Environment

Each domestic manufacturing firm i produces a unique variety of good using the production
function:
                                                         1−µ µ
                                     Yi = Ai (Kiα L1−α
                                                   p,i )    Xi ,                           (3)

where Xi is the intermediate input bundle, Ki is capital, Lp,i is the labor input used in
production, and Ai is the firm’s exogenous technology. Xi combines a bundle of diverse
intermediate inputs produced domestically, Zi , and another bundle of imported intermediate
inputs, Mi , according to the CES aggregator:

                                                                1
                                             Xi = [Ziρ + Miρ ] ρ ,


where the input bundles are themselves CES aggregates:

                             Z              θ1           Z                   θ1
                      Zi =        zijθ dj           Mi =             mθik dk          .
                              j                               k∈Ωi


zij represents firm i’s use of domestically produced inputs j, Ωi is the set of foreign input
varieties imported by i, and mik is the quantity of imported input k. The elasticity of

substitution 1/(1−θ) is the same within domestic varieties and within foreign varieties, while
1/(1 − ρ) is the elasticity of substitution between the bundles of imported and domestically
produced inputs.
       The output of each domestic firm i is used to produce a final good gi and as an interme-
diate input zi that is used domestically by other firms. This captures the roundabout nature
of production. There are no exports:

                                                               Z
                                     Yi = gi + zi = gi +                 zji dj.
                                                                     j


The aggregate final good G is formed by aggregating all the individual final goods gi :

                                                    Z               θ1
                                              G=           giθ di          ,
                                                       i


where 0 < θ < 1 and 1/(1 − θ) is the elasticity of substitution across the different varieties
used in producing the final good.30
       There is a fixed cost f denominated in units of labor that is an increasing function of
the measure of varieties imported. The presence of these fixed costs is consistent with the
empirical evidence we presented earlier and the evidence in Bernard, Jensen, and Schott
(2009) and Halpern, Koren, and Szeidl (2009). Total fixed costs can be written as:


                                             F (|Ωi |) = f |Ωi |λ ,


where f > 0, λ > 0. We denote the labor used to pay fixed costs for firm i as Lf,i . This spec-
ification implies that all firms will import at least some positive quantities. Consistent with
Finding 1, firm entry into and exit from import status will not be important for aggregate
trade adjustment.
  30
     For simplicity we assume that the elasticity of substitution across domestic varieties in producing good
j is the same as across domestic varieties in producing the final good. This will imply that the elasticity of
demand faced by firm i is a constant equal to 1/(1 − θ). If the elasticities differ then the elasticity of demand
faced by firm i is a weighted average of the elasticity of the final good demand and of the intermediate input
demand, where the weights reflect the relative shares of output going to the final demand sector compared
to intermediate input demand.

4.2       Firm’s Problem

Firms engage in monopolistic competition. Each firm i chooses Ki , Lp,i , and the vector {zij },
given the price of labor w, the rental price of capital r, and the set of domestic intermediate
input prices {pj }. They also choose the set of imported varieties Ωi and the amount of each
variety k, mik .
       We assume that the price of all imported goods is pm , and since all imported varieties are
identical, the quantity of each imported foreign variety will be the same, mi .31 The firm’s
unit cost function is then:

differs across firms to the extent that they import a different measure of varieties |Ωi |. The
larger the measure of imported varieties used the lower the intermediate input cost index,
all else equal. The number of imported input varieties used by each firm can vary, while the
number of domestic input varieties remains fixed. We make this assumption because fixed
costs (if any) required for buying domestic varieties are likely much smaller than those for
importing goods and because we lack data on domestic varieties used for production.
       Firm i’s demand for production workers Lp,i , capital Ki , domestically sourced inputs

    We make this simplifying assumption because the main comparative static we consider is the effect
of the Argentine peso devaluation on import purchases. This large common shock likely dominated any
idiosyncratic movement in import prices.

where PG is the CES price index for final varieties gi . The price set by firm i is pi = Ci /θ.
Firm i then chooses Ωi to maximize profits net of the cost of importing varieties:


                                          Ωi = arg max {Πi − wF (|Ωi |)} ,
                                                            Ωi



where Πi are profits gross of all fixed costs.
       It follows that firms with better technology will import a larger measure of varieties
as long as the second-order conditions for an interior solution for Ωi are satisfied.32 Since
varieties are homogenous the identity of each specific imported variety is indeterminate. The
model is then consistent with firms dropping disjoint sets of varieties that are generally not
dropped in the aggregate, as was the case in the empirical evidence.

γi is decreasing in Ai . The domestic input price index can be expressed as:

    The price index therefore depends on the joint distribution of firm-level technologies
Ai and import shares (1 − γi ), which captures the heterogeneity in unit costs of production
arising from exogenous differences in Ai and endogenous differences in γi . Since high Ai firms
have lower γi they have lower unit costs of production. This cost advantage is decreasing
in the elasticity of substitution across domestic and foreign inputs, ρ. The revenue, profits,
and value added will be more dispersed in this environment than in one without fixed costs.



5     Productivity
The goal of this section is to evaluate the impact of a foreign input cost shock on the
productivity of the manufacturing sector and the resulting implications for the welfare of
a representative agent in the economy. We measure firm level productivity PRi using the
Solow residual:
                          ∆ ln PRi = ∆ ln YiV A − sLi ∆ ln Li − sKi ∆ ln Ki ,                            (6)

where ∆ ln Li , ∆ ln Ki , and ∆ ln YiV A denote the growth rates of labor, capital input, and
value-added of the firm, and sLi and sKi denote shares of labor and capital in value added.
Industry level value added is just a weighted sum of firm level value added:33


                          ∆ ln PR = ∆ ln Y V A − sL ∆ ln L − sK ∆ ln K,                                  (7)


where ∆ ln Y V A = ωi i ∆ ln YiV A , sL ∆ ln L = i ωi sLi ∆ ln Li , sK ∆ ln K = i ωi sLk ∆ ln Ki ,
                      P                         P                              P
                                 
and ωi ≡ PiV A YiV A / P V A Y V A denotes firm i’s share of industry value added. Note that
  33
     Industry-level factor shares multiplied by growth in industry-level inputs can be written as the value-
added share weighted sum of the corresponding firm-level object because all firms pay the same factor prices.


                                                         31
this measure of the Solow residual, often referred to as the “modified” Solow residual, has
factor shares that need not sum to one. As highlighted by Basu and Fernald (2002) and Basu,
Pascali, Schiantarelli, and Serven (2011), this is the welfare relevant measure of productivity.


5.1    Firm-level and Sector-level Productivity

The standard definition of value-added growth is:

                                              ∆ ln Yi − sYXi ∆ ln Xi
                               ∆ ln YiV A   ≡                        ,
                                                     1 − sYXi

where sYXi = (PXi Xi ) / (pi Yi ) is the share of intermediate input spending in total revenues (as
opposed to in value added). Equations (4) and (5), together with the optimality of constant
markups, imply that sYXi = µθ for all firms. In the appendix, we follow steps similar to those
in Basu and Fernald (2002) with the distinction that we have labor that is used for fixed
costs as well as for production and show that one can use a first-order approximation to
express changes in the productivity of firm i as:

                                                                          
                            (1 − θ)               µθ
             ∆ ln PRi    =            ∆ ln Vi +        (∆ ln Xi − ∆ ln Yi )
                           θ(1 − µ)             1 − µθ
                             (1 − µθ)               
                           −           sLi 1 − ωLp,i ∆ ln Lf,i + ∆ ln Ai /(1 − µ).             (8)
                             θ (1 − µ)

We write ∆ ln Vi ≡ sKi ∆ ln Ki + sLi ∆ ln Li for the percent change in use of primary inputs
and use ωLp,i ≡ Lp,i /Li to denote the share of firm i’s labor that is used in production.
   Equation (8) allows us to describe how a generic shock will impact firm-level productivity.
First, productivity will change with the scale of production ∆ ln Vi since firms have pricing
power and θ < 1. This follows because value added growth exceeds the sum of shares of
payments going to primary factors times input growth in the presence of mark-ups. Why
is this decline in productivity relevant from a welfare perspective? When consumers are
price takers, the payments to primary inputs corresponds to the welfare loss to consumers of
providing more labor (foregoing leisure) and more capital (foregoing current consumption)
and the value added growth captures the welfare gain in consumption in exchange. In
the presence of mark-ups, the marginal rate of transformation exceeds the marginal rate of

                                                  32
substitution. A decline in scale is therefore associated with a welfare loss in consumption that
exceeds the welfare gain from a reduction in labor and capital. The fact that in the presence
of mark-ups productivity is impacted by scale effects even when technology is unchanged
goes back to Hall (1988, 1990). This argument is developed more generally and linked to
welfare in Basu and Fernald (2002) and Basu, Pascali, Schiantarelli, and Serven (2011).
   Second, changes in the intensity of intermediate input use, ∆ ln Xi − ∆ ln Yi , will have an
impact on productivity when firms have pricing power for the same reasons as changes in the
scale of production do. With positive markups, the opportunity cost of using up inputs is
exceeded by the gains from their contribution to value added. Importantly, in the presence of
intermediate inputs, µ > 0, even small deviations from θ = 1 can have significant effects on
productivity. Below, we relate changes in this term to changes in the share of intermediate
input spending on domestic inputs, γi .
   A third effect on firm productivity arises from changes in the use of labor for fixed costs
∆ ln Lf,i . Equation (3) shows that fixed labor has no direct effect on output. Therefore,
all else equal, a decline in its use has a positive impact on this welfare-relevant measure of
productivity.
   Finally, the fourth term refers to changes in the technology Ai of each firm. We hold
technology fixed by assumption and therefore shut down this last mechanism for productivity
changes.
   It is clear from equation (8) that shocks to imported input costs will have a first order
impact on firm productivity in our economy. This result differs from Kohli (2004) and Kehoe
and Ruhl (2008) who assume perfect competition and conclude that terms of trade shocks
have no first-order effect on productivity. The difference is that we consider the case when
firms have pricing power. In the limiting case of no pricing power when θ → 1 we also obtain
the result that there are no first order effects on productivity. This is seen in equation (8)
as the first term collapses to zero if θ = 1 and the second term will equal zero if there are
no fixed costs.
   In the presence of fixed costs there will be heterogeneous adjustments in each of the non-
technology terms of equation (8). Because of differential adjustments on the sub-extensive
margin across firms of different sizes, the change in PMi will vary across firms. This will

                                              33
imply variation in changes in the unit cost of production and consequently on the scale
of production. In parallel, heterogeneity in sub-extensive margin adjustment will bring
heterogeneous adjustment in fixed costs.
       Next, we consider the impact on sectoral productivity of a common change in the cost
of imported inputs in our model, designed to capture the effect of a large nominal exchange
rate devaluation that increases the relative price of imported to domestically sourced inputs.
We adopt a partial equilibrium framework that holds factor prices (w, r) fixed and write the
impact on sector-level productivity of an increase in the relative price of imported inputs
as:34

   The first term on the right hand side of line (9) captures the overall scale effect on
                                                       P
productivity of the change in factor input use ∆ ln V ≡ i ωi ∆ ln Vi . The increase in foreign
input costs in our economy generates an increase in the unit cost of production for firms that
in turn raises the price of each firm’s output relative to sectors that do not use imported
inputs. This reduces the demand for the industry and consequently generates a decline in
the usage of K and L.35 Firm sub-extensive margin adjustment also generates movement in
L by changing the use of labor associated with fixed costs.
  34                                                                                               γi
      As discussed in the appendix, these expressions rely on the approximation ∆ ln(1 − γi ) = − 1−γ i
                                                                                                        ∆ ln γi ,
which is valid for small shocks. In the simulation section we do not use this approximation because we study
large shocks.
   35
      Note that overall final good demand for domestic firms necessarily declines. However, firms that relied
less on imported inputs are less impacted by the shock causing their share and output to increase. As
firms shift from foreign to domestic inputs the relative share of spending on domestic intermediate inputs
increases. The net level effect on intermediate input demand depends on both the derived demand effect for
intermediate inputs following the decline in overall final demand (negative) and the increase in the relative
demand for domestic versus imported inputs (positive). In Section 5.3 we obtain a net decline in total
manufacturing demand/output consistent with that documented in the data when parameters are calibrated
to match key moments in the data.


                                                       34
   The next set of terms arise from heterogeneity in trade adjustment due to the interaction
of fixed costs and heterogeneous technologies. The term in line (10) can in principle be
positive or negative and reflects the impact of non-homothetic import demand. Because
firms adjust differentially, the price of their output will adjust differentially and market
shares will change endogenously (i.e. ∆ ln ωi 6= 0). As discussed above, trade (or changes
in trade) induces a shift in market shares relative to the exogenous technology distribution.
Lines (11) and (12) capture the impact of adjustments in import shares across the entire
distribution of firms.
   It is useful to compare productivity and welfare in our benchmark model to the case
where there are no fixed costs in importing varieties. With no fixed costs, each firm imports
the same foreign varieties and spends the same cost share on imports. Trade has the same
impact on all firms’ unit cost of production and consequently the full distribution of market
shares ωi remains unchanged in response to import cost shocks. Firms with different tech-
nologies might operate at different scales but this heterogeneity is irrelevant for all aggregate
measures. For example, ∆ ln Vi is the same across firms. In this case, line (10) is equal to 0.
Combining lines (11) with (12), we arrive at a term

                                            µ 1−ρ 1−θ
                                      −                  ∆ ln γ,
                                          1 − µ ρ 1 − µθ
            P
where γ ≡       i   ωi γi is the industry average of intermediate input spending on domestic inputs.
   This expression resembles the finding in Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2011),
where primary factors are in fixed supply and therefore ∆ ln V = 0. The impact of a change
pm is an increasing function of the share of intermediates in production µ, a decreasing
function of the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign intermediates ρ, and
is summarized by this scaled movement in ∆ ln γ. In models where L and K are exogenously
fixed and where there is no change in the market share of continuing importers, the impact
on productivity and welfare is a simple linear function of the percent change in spending on
domestic intermediate inputs.
   In the case with fixed costs and heterogenous firms, the terms in lines (10), (11), and (12)
do not simplify and the impact on productivity depends on the full distribution of individual


                                                   35
firm responses. This is because, consistent with Finding 3, firms respond to the same shock
with a different share of their adjustment due to the sub-intensive and sub-extensive margins.
Firms with more product sub-extensive margin adjustment see import volume decline more
than firms with more sub-intensive margin adjustment. Line (10) reflects the differential
changes in firm shares of value added and line (11) does not simplify because it is no longer
the case that the change in the aggregate import share equals the import-weighted sum of
changes in firm-level import shares. Also note that the sign of expression (11) is always
positive. This in part reflects the positive impact on productivity from the savings of fixed
cost labor implied by the shift from foreign to domestic inputs.


5.2    Measured Productivity

In the previous sections we focused on the impact of an import collapse on the welfare
relevant measure of productivity under the assumption that the measurement of prices and
quantities properly accounted for changes in input varieties. As pointed out by Feenstra
(1994), however, statistical agencies in all countries employ matched-model price indices
which do not adjust for changing import varieties. Therefore, if trade collapsed in part due
to the product sub-extensive margin, and if production involves CES aggregation as in our
model, these agencies would underestimate the true rise in import prices. If a matched
model price index were used to calculate Xi from the observed spending on inputs (PXi Xi ),
it would result in an overestimate of intermediate input use which would lead to a further
decline in measured productivity.
   Under these assumptions, we write the measured change in productivity as:


                      g = ∆ ln PR −        µ 1−θ X
                 ∆ ln PR                                ωi ∆ ln(PXi /PeXi ),
                                         1 − µ 1 − µθ i


where PeXi is the mismeasured price index that does not account for the change in the
varieties of imported inputs. This measurement implies a positive movement in (PXi /PeXi )
and a greater decline in measured than in actual productivity. In this sense, our firm-level
data reveal that dropped import varieties are not only important for understanding the
actual change in productivity but are additionally important for the practical measurement

                                             36
of it.
       The above analytical expressions suggest that important differences in productivity emerge
in response to the same shocks depending on the underlying structure of the model. Our
firm-level data and Findings 1-4 motivated the structure of our benchmark model presented
in Section 4. In the absense of simulations of the benchmark and any alternative model,
however, it is hard to determine when productivity will be higher or lower in response to
any given shock or if these differences are significant. We therefore turn now to simulations
to compare the outcomes for productivity in models with and without fixed costs.


5.3       Simulation

We numerically simulate the model with a simple algorithm in which we specify the number
of domestic firms, the distribution of their technologies G(Ai ), the fixed cost function F (|Ωi |),
an initial value for the import price pm , and the set of parameters {θ, ρ, α, µ, b, λ, w, r}. To
allow for some substitution away from the manufacturing sector, we specify utility as a CES
bundle of both the manufacturing good and a non-traded good, [ωGη + (1 − ω) CNη ]1/η , and
additionally specify fixed values for C, PN , and ω. Equilibrium in this partial equilibrium
setup is simply the price of output and the number of imported varieties, {pi , Ωi }, such
that the firm’s first-order conditions are satisfied given final demand in the economy. The
numerical algorithm used to solve for the equilibrium is detailed in the appendix.


5.4       Calibration

We now describe our calibration of the most important parameters used in our benchmark
simulation, though we later report results for varying parameter values. We set θ = ρ = 0.75,
corresponding to an elasticity of 4, the value used in Section 3. We choose µ = 2/3, consistent
with the 1997 input-output table for Argentina obtained from the OECD.36 Table 5 lists these
as well as the other parameter values used in our benchmark simulation, which simulates an
industrial sector with 1,000 firms.
  36
     The OECD input-output table contains 48 sectors of which we classify 21 as manufacturing. We find sim-
ilar values for 1998–2002 using Argentina’s annual manufacturing census (the Encuesta Industrial Annual ).
The stability of this share corroborates our Cobb-Douglas functional form assumption.

                              Table 5: Baseline Simulation Parameters

       We can directly measure the share of input spending on domestic goods, γ, for 1997
from the input-output table, but Argentina has not released a version for subsequent years.
The annual manufacturing census gives annual input spending by manufacturers, though,
so we can approximate γ in future years by assuming that the growth in manufacturing
spending on imported inputs follows the growth in total imports.37 This results in a pre-
crisis minimum value of 0.83 for γ (i.e. γ pre = 0.83). We do not formally estimate the fixed
cost function, but choose a functional form and parameterization which, in conjunction with
other parameter values, both satisfies the second-order condition listed in footnote 32 and
allows us to qualitatively replicate the findings from the empirical section.38 Given the level
of expenditures on the manufactured good, the wage, the rental rate on capital, and the
fixed cost function, we choose the initial unit import price pm to match γ pre .
       Our analysis does not require a parametric form of the productivity distribution, so we
choose Ai manually, which allows us to better target various moments of the import share
distribution. The dotted red line of Figure 10 plots the simulated import cdf, which is a
close match with that in the solid blue line plotted from the Argentine data in 2000.39
       We choose values for η and ω and set the non-manufactured good price PN so that
the initial share of the manufacturing sector in total consumption spending equals about
26 percent, the level of manufacturing value added in consumption in Argentina’s national
accounts prior to the recession. We then hold these and all other parameter values fixed and
  37
      We have also tried growing imported input spending by the import spending on capital goods, interme-
diate goods, fuels, and parts of capital goods as reported in Argentina’s annual manufacturing census. The
results do not meaningfully change.
   38
      In the base period of our simulation, spending on the fixed cost averages about 14 percent of the total
fixed and variable spending on each import. This is only a bit above the equivalent 11 percent number given
as the upper end of the range in Alessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan (2010).
   39
      In principle, we could have tried to match every point on the cdf, but restrictions due to computational
speed prevented us from doing this. We believe our match of the distribution at the 10, 20, 50, and 95
percent y-axis values is sufficient to capture the relative importance of large, medium, and small firms in our
simulated economy.

shock pm such that the share of manufacturing input spending allocated to imported goods,
1 − γ, decreases to 0.11 (i.e. γ post = 0.89), consistent with the 2002 value in our calculations
with the Argentine data. We do not aim to explain objects outside of the manufacturing
sector, such as real GDP growth. As such, the values of PN , ω, and η are not important
for our simulation other than their determination of the initial share of overall consumption
spending on the manufacturing sector that uses imported inputs and the real decline in
manufacturing value added.40 Given these values and the shock to pm , the implied reduction
in real manufacturing value added equals 17 percent, equal to the real decline of industrial
production in the Argentine national accounts over this same period.


5.5     Simulated Adjustment Patterns

We now simulate an import price shock in our model and report results in order to achieve
three goals. First, we wish to demonstrate that the model can reproduce Findings 2-4 (it
by assumption reproduces Finding 1 ). Second, we wish to evaluate the scale of productiv-
  40
   For example, exogenously imposing a change in aggregate final consumption C or changing the parameter
η would be isomorphic for the objects in the manufacturing sector we focus on.



                                                  39
ity changes brought about from the shock. Third, we use the simulations to demonstrate
the differential response of our economy, which is designed to reproduce the large product
sub-extensive margin observed in our firm-level data, compared with an economy without
significant extensive margin adjustments, as would be consistent with aggregate data.
       Finding 1 documented that the firm extensive margin played little role and given there
is no fixed cost of importing per se (only a per-variety fixed cost), the firm extensive margin
plays no role in trade adjustment in our simulated model.41 Sub-extensive margin adjustment
in our model, however, contributes 47 percent of the simulated decline in exports, with the
remainder due to the sub-intensive margin. This compares with the sub-extensive margin
contributing 45 percent and the sub-intensive margin contributing 44 percent in the data,
as we showed in Finding 2. The sub-extensive and sub-intensive margins are comparably
important with each other in both our simulated model and in the data.
       Finding 3 noted that larger firms (proxied by the size of their pre-crisis imports) exhibit
on average a smaller percentage decline in trade than do smaller firms and that the sub-
intensive margin played a greater role for larger firms. In the data this result is driven by
the reduced prevalence of extensive and sub-extensive margin adjusters among larger firms.
Figure 11 plots these moments of trade adjustment against importer size and confirms these
findings hold in our simulated data. The differences between large and small firms in these
respects are more muted in our simulation than in the data. This emerges in large part
because we have omitted the extensive margin in our model. If we introduced a fixed
importing cost which generated the exit from trade among small firms, dispersion in these
figures would more closely resemble the magnitudes witnessed in the data.42
       Figure 11(a) shows that larger firms in the simulation adjust less and Figure 11(b) shows
that a greater share of this adjustment for the largest firms comes from the sub-intensive
margin. In general the relationship between firm size and the elasticities of response to cost
shocks depends on the model’s details, parameter values, and distributional assumptions,
  41
     We could, of course, easily add an initial fixed cost to increase the role of the firm extensive margin.
Because these firms will be the smallest in the economy, this change would have no meaningful impact on
any other reported result.
  42
     We also note that while only the smallest firms would adjust along the extensive margin in such an
exercise, any randomness (such as technology shocks) introduced to this environment would spread these
extensive margin adjusters across the size distribution.

discussed further in the appendix.43 In our simulation, firms with worse technology (smaller
size) have a higher γi . A higher γi on one hand increases the responsiveness to a shock of the
number of foreign varieties imported (because the firm with a higher γi has a higher price
movement of PMi relative to PXi ). On the other hand it lowers the responsiveness to a shock
of the optimal price and therefore demand, which in turn affects the demand for inputs. The
first effect will dominate if:
                                                                                     ρ     µθ

which is the case with our benchmark parameters.
                   Finally, Finding 4 measured the implied change in the unit cost of each firm’s CES import
bundle and found that a trade-weighted average of these changes ranged between 6 and 13
percent, depending on the definition of “variety” used. We calculate this identical object in
our simulation and find a value of 8.9 percent, highly consistent with the empirical range.
This confirms that the economic impact of the simulated sub-extensive margin adjustment
also resembles that found in the firm-level data.
  43
     In Chaney (2008) the elasticity depends on the specifics of the distribution function across imported
varieties. In the case of Pareto the elasticity is shown to be invariant to firm productivity. In our setup the
distribution is degenerate because all varieties are identical.




                                                                                         41

Figure 12 shows how ∆ ln γi and ∆ ln PRi vary across the size distribution of firms. The
firms with the best technology import the most and are at the right of the plot. Their initial
γi values were lowest and the percent increase in those values is greatest. This results in the
largest productivity decline for those firms.

   We next provide estimates of sectoral level productivity in Table 6. For each simula-

benchmark model with fixed costs and roundabout production, reported in row (1), which
is labeled “Benchmark.” As described above, the foreign input cost shock in this simulation
generates an increase in the manufacturing sector’s γ from 0.83 to 0.89 and generates a
decline in manufacturing productivity, ∆ ln PR, of 5.5 percent. If we take into account the
mismeasurement due to ignoring the 8.9 percentage point increase in import bundle prices
due to dropped varieties, the magnitude of the mismeasured productivity decline, ∆ ln PR,

       We start by comparing rows (1) and (2) to answer the question of how a shock impacts
productivity in a model which incorporates a sub-extensive margin (the benchmark) com-
pared to the identical shock in a model without one (no fixed costs). The decline in import
shares is smaller in row (2) compared with that in the benchmark case in row (1), and none
of the losses are associated with less import varieties. Even accounting for the savings of la-
bor associated with declines in payment of fixed costs, welfare relevant productivity declines
by 1.2 percentage points more when we take into account the sub-extensive margin. This
difference roughly doubles if one considers the impact of sub-extensive margin adjustment
on measured productivity. The jump from approximately zero to -4.3 percent, which comes
from the move from perfect competition to imperfect competition is clearly larger than the
additional movement from the sub-extensive margin. However, this margin does contribute
an additional 30 percent.
  44
    In these simulations we adjust PN and pm to match the initial share of spending on manufactures and
γ to the benchmark case.



                                                     43
   Row (3) evaluates the quantitative importance of roundabout production. We specify
that the price of domestic inputs PZ is fixed at the same initial value as in the benchmark
simulation and is completely insensitive to changes in the import price pm . All other features
of the model are the same as in the benchmark case. In this environment firms will sub-
stitute more than in our benchmark case to the domestically produced intermediate inputs.
The increase in unit cost of production is therefor lower and manufacturing value added falls
falls by less than in the benchmark case. The resulting productivity decline of 2.6 percent is
roughly half the magnitude of the decline in the benchmark case, even though both simula-
tions are calibrated to the same initial conditions and are exposed to the same shock. This
highlights the importance of this mechanism for amplifying the shock.


5.7    Robustness

In this sub-section, we re-simulate our system with a number of different parameter values or
assumptions used in our empirical analysis to determine the sensitivity of our productivity
and welfare estimates. The results are reported in rows (4)-(8) of Table 6.
   Rows (4) through (6) evaluate the sensitivity to the key elasticity parameters ρ and θ.
Feenstra, Obstfeld, and Russ (2010), in a model with very similar structure to ours, empha-
size estimates suggesting ρ < θ. We consider this possibility by simulating the model with
ρ = 0.5, corresponding to an elasticity between domestic and foreign varieties of 2. Because
the importance of the sub-extensive margin is decreasing in ρ the decline in productivity in
response to the same shock is larger than the benchmark case and close to 7%. Row (5)
shows that productivity declines by 1.7 percent if we increase θ to 0.90, corresponding to a
high elasticity within domestic and within foreign varieties of 10. Row (6) shows that the
combination of making the between-elasticity lower and the within-elasticity higher yields a
productivity decline of about 2.8 percent.
   Next, we consider the impact of inventories. As shown in Figure 8, the Argentine firms
in industries which appear to hold the least inventories relative to their sales reduced their
imports by significantly less than typical firms. If we re-calculate the value in the 2002
Argentine data of the aggregate share of input spending on domestic goods γ under the



                                              44
assumption that aggregate import growth is scaled down to match the experience of these
least inventory intensive sectors, we obtain the value γ post = 0.86 rather than the benchmark
post-crisis value of 0.89. We therefore introduce a simulated decline in the import price
of a magnitude that generates this more limited movement in γ. Row (7) reports that
this produces a productivity decline that is a bit less than half as large as that seen in
the benchmark case but which we still consider to be economically significant. Relatedly,
row (8) considers a shock that is calibrated to the change in γ found in the data when we
exclude import spending on capital goods. This implies a value for γ post equal to 0.87 and a
productivity decline of 3.3 percentage points.
    In sum, we find that an imported input cost shock generates meaningful declines in
productivity across several specifications.



6     The Decline and Recovery of TFP in Argentina
We have demonstrated how aggregate productivity can decline as firms substitute from
imported to domestic input use. The shift in spending toward domestic sources is captured
by movement in γ, while the importance of dropped import varieties for raising firm unit
costs is captured by F. In this section we correlate our measures of changes in γ and F
with independent estimates of TFP for Argentina. These independent TFP estimates differ
slightly from the welfare-relevant measure of productivity we use in this paper, but the basic
time-series properties of these should be similar. We show that the chronology of our γ and
F measures is consistent with the chronology of TFP movements, both during the period
when TFP declined and when it recovered.
    Figure 13 includes plots of two estimates of productivity in Argentina as measured by
ARKLEMS, an Argentine project that measures productivity following the methodology
of the WORLD KLEMS initiative and of Coremberg (2009). The solid black line plots
“unadjusted” TFP, which the author says corresponds to the typical methodology used in
Argentine and Latin American TFP estimation as well as by other studies such as Kydland
and Zarazaga (2002). The blue dashed line plots what they label “strict” TFP, which includes




                                              45
adjustments of labor quality and capital utilization.45 We should point out that the adjusted
TFP measure is done with limited data and restrictive assumptions and may therefore be
less reliable.

       Both TFP series are normalized to equal 1 in 2000 and indicate that TFP began to decline
in 1999. The unadjusted series exhibits moderate to large declines through 2001, with its
largest decline occurring in 2002. A rapid recovery of this measure of TFP then begins in
2003. The adjusted series declines more modestly in 2002 and continues this decline in 2003
before exhibiting a more mild recovery in 2004 and 2005. The unadjusted TFP series finishes
2006 (the last available ARKLEMS estimate) only slightly below its pre-recession level while
  45
    We do not plot the TFP measures from Sandleris and Wright (2011) here as those estimates end in
2002. Our results are consistent with their estimate from continuing establishments, the relevant comparison
group for us because all of the adjustment in trade takes place within continuing firms. This measure of
TFP declines most steeply in 2001 but continues to meaningfully decline in 2002.


                                                    46
the adjusted series remains depressed.
       The long-dashed green line plots our estimates of (1 − γ), the share of imported inputs in
total input spending. The decline in (1 − γ) from a peak of 0.17 to the trough value of 0.11
corresponds to the values in Table 5 of γ pre = 0.83 and γ post = 0.89. Though much of the
substitution away from imported inputs occurs in very late 2001 and 2002 due to movement
in the exchange rate, this substitution in fact started as early as 1999. This is consistent
with our model because in the presence of fixed costs of importing, firms will spend less on
imported inputs as total demand declines, even holding fixed the relative price of imports.
The series stabilizes in 2003 and then recovers starting in 2004.46
       The short-dashed red line plots our estimates of the impact of dropped import varieties
on the unit cost of production F using the same methodology as those done in Table 4.
We consider idiosyncratic firm-specific changes in the cost of imported inputs in each year
relative to the base year of 2000 due to changes in the mix of 10-digit inputs by country
of origin. This series has a small decline in 2001, a larger decline in 2002, and a recovery
starting in 2003.47 The time variation in F therefore displays a positive correlation with that
of TFP.
       While clearly there were many other negative shocks during the Argentine crisis, the
time-series patterns do offer corroboration that the mechanisms highlighted in our paper
may well have been salient for TFP in Argentina over this period.



7        Conclusion
Two prominent features of large macroeconomic crises are the collapse in imports and the
large decline in measured TFP. We use transaction-level trade data from the Argentine crisis
of 2001–2002 to characterize, mechanically, how this reduction in trade occurred and how
  46
     Calculation of the imported input share in this plot differs slightly from the methodology described in
Section 5.3 because we need data for years for which annual manufacturing censuses are not available. We
therefore use data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators to compare growth in manufacturing
spending on imports to growth in manufacturing value added, rather than total input spending, in order
to grow the earlier series forward. This implicitly assumes that, as in the model, the ratio of spending on
inputs to the sector’s value added remains constant. We compared estimates of γ for 1998-2003 using this
new methodology to estimates using that described in Section 5.3 and found them to be highly similar.
  47
     In fact, this measure also shows a small downward trend from 1998 to 2000, but less confidence should
be placed in the 1998 and 1999 values for this measure due to the gap in our data over this period.


                                                    47
the decline influences a welfare-relevant measure of productivity. We find that the extensive
margin of trade at the country level, where previous importers stop importing or product
varieties are dropped by all importers, is not quantitatively significant. However, the micro-
data allow us to observe quantitatively significant within-firm churning of inputs that we
call the sub-extensive margin. Finally, the scale and type of trade adjustment differs with
the size of the importer, generating heterogeneous changes in their unit costs of production.
   Motivated by these empirical findings, we build a heterogeneous firm model with round-
about production and fixed costs of importing. The model replicates the above empirical
findings and generates economically significant declines in productivity. When calibrated to
reproduce the lack of extensive margin adjustment observable in aggregate data, the impact
on productivity differs meaningfully.
   Crises such as the one Argentina experienced surely involve multiple shocks, and no one
channel can explain its entire economic impact. Our analysis suggests, however, that the
reduced use of imported intermediate inputs is a significant contributor to the productivity
and welfare losses experienced during crises.

Appendix A: Derivation of Equations for Productivity
Derivation of Equation (8)
The derivation is very similar to Basu and Fernald (2002) with the distinction that we have
labor that is used in fixed costs. The production function for each firm is given by equation
(3). Since firms are price takers in the primary factor and intermediate input markets and
set prices as a constant markup 1/θ over marginal cost, we have:

                                    ∂Yi   w     ∂Yi  r     ∂Yi   P Xi
                              pi         = , pi     = , pi     =      .

To measure the growth rate of value added we use the convention divisia index formula:

                          ∆ ln Yi − sYX ∆ ln Xi               sYX
           ∆ ln YiV A   =                       = ∆ ln Yi −         (∆ ln Xi − ∆ ln Qi ) ,

    Step 1: We express ∆ ln Xi − ∆ ln Yi as a function of γi . It follows from equations (4),
(5), and pi = Ci /θ, given fixed w and r, that:

                     ∆ ln Xi − ∆ ln Yi = ∆ ln pi − ∆ ln PXi = (µ − 1) ∆ ln PXi .

Following the definition of γi , we write:

As γi and λ increase, so does the share of labor that is used for production. This is used to
arrive at the expression for ωLPi :

    Step 4: Replace the expression for ∆ ln PXi from equation (13) in the preceding equa-
tion. Replacing the above terms in the expression for firm-level productivity, equation (8),
and aggregating over all i using firm value-added shares ωi , we arrive at an expression for
aggregate productivity.

shocks. In the simulation section we do not use this approximation because we study large

Appendix B: Numerical Algorithm
The algorithm works as follows. Firms start with an initial assumption about the prices
of the domestic input bundle PZ0 and the final good PG0 . Since the importing behavior of
each firm determines its marginal cost and thereby influences PZ and PG , this assumption is
effectively equivalent to taking as given all other firms’ importing decisions. Holding these
price aggregates fixed, each firm i simultaneously chooses the optimal number of imported
varieties |Ω1i |.48 With this new set of import variety choices {Ω1i }, we must solve a fixed
point problem to find a consistent set of new prices {p1i } because each firm’s marginal cost is
a function of all other firms’ prices due to roundabout production. In particular, we iterate
the system:

for all firms i until the set of prices {p1i } is consistent with the domestic input price index
PZ1 and with all firms’ choices of imported varieties {Ω1i }. We then repeat this algorithm,
with firms taking as given the price indices PZ1 and PG1 , and generate a new set of prices
and
 j import  varieties  {p2i , Ω2i } and price indices {PZ2 , PG2 }. We continue this process until
        j      j−1    j−1

Appendix C: Comparative Statics of the Firm’s Trade
Response
In this appendix, we evaluate how each firm’s response to the terms of trade shock will differ
based on its pre-shock level of total imports. The intent here is to derive an expression that
provides some intuition for the results in the text and as such we do not provide a formal
proof. We have shown that as long as λ is sufficiently high, the number of imported varieties
is increasing in the firm’s exogenous technology Ai . Given their relative cost advantage, firms
with higher Ai have lower prices pi and consequently sell more and have higher Yi . These
are also the firms with the lowest γi (since PMi /PZ is lower) and the highest Mi .
     The elasticity of the response in γi to the import price change is a function of the initial
γi . Using the definition of γi we can show that:
                                                                 

    Though our firms have finite market shares, they ignore the impact of their own price changes on the
aggregate price index. This is not problematic because the largest firm in our benchmark calibration has a
market share of only 5 percent.

(which is not always the case), firms increase the share spent on domestic inputs, γi , when
import prices increase. To see how this elasticity varies across existing importers, we write:

the direct effect of a lower γ on raising the percent change in γ exceeds the indirect effect

less.                          

Appendix D: Additional Empirical Analyses
In this appendix, we consider two additional empirical analyses. First, we study the cross-
section of manufacturing industries. Next, we consider changes in the frequency with which
dropped input varieties are permanently dropped.
    Starting with the cross-sectional analysis, we focus on within-manufacturing variation be-
cause trade may plausibly account for important variation in productivity. Differences in the


                                                                   57
productivity declines of the finance and government sectors, for example, would likely have
little to do with trade. The Argentine Annual Manufacturing Census includes information
on value-added and the number of salaried workers in roughly 20 2-digit industries.
     We combine this with information (also from the Argentine national statistics) on pro-
ducer prices in those same 2-digit industries to construct growth in real value-added per
worker. This is a proxy for total factor productivity at the sector level. Next, we use the
information from the Capital IQ database on each firms Primary Sector to classify some of
them as belonging to these 2-digit industries (some sectors do not match and are excluded).
Finally, we combine (1) the implied growth in imports for each manufacturing subsector
from our data with (2) information on initial sector levels of γ from the 1997 input-output
table and with (3) growth in total sectoral intermediate spending from the census to obtain
a time-series for sectoral γ. This is essentially the same method used to determine changes
in γ for the overall manufacturing sector in our calibration.
     Figures 14(a) and 14(b) show the resulting relationship between changes in this measure
of productivity and in the share of input spending on imports (1 − γ) for the period 2000-
2002. Figure 14(a) shows this plot for all sub-sectors with available data, but we note that
some of these data points can reflect as few as two firms each.
     Figure 14(b) shows this relationship when including only those sectors with at least 20
matched firms. Both figures suggest that shifts in intermediate spending from imported
inputs toward domestic inputs correlate with measured productivity declines, though the
relationship is clearly noisy and sensitive to rules on the treatment of outliers. Given this
sensitivity, and given this is not our preferred welfare-relevant productivity measure, we
consider this evidence less compelling and robust than the results in the primary paper and
for that reason only include them in this Appendix.
     Next, we consider the share of dropped varieties that are permanently dropped as a way
to address concerns that inventoried varieties are used for production. In the paper, in
part to deal with this concern, we focus on a 2 year period. This is a horizon much longer
than that typically used by forecasters to describe the inventory cycle. But we additionally
find it useful here to measure the share of all firm and import variety combinations from
the previous period that are permanently dropped (i.e. permanent sub-extensive margin
adjustment) in the current period.
     A variety is defined as HTS10xCountry and is considered to be permanently dropped if
the firm does not again import it through 2008 (we cannot go back earlier in the analysis due
to the gaps in our data in 1999, as discussed in the paper.) In this analysis, we only consider
firms that imported at least 1 dollar of some good sometime after 2006 and therefore exclude
all firms which permanently exited trade. This is a conservative treatment of these extensive
margin adjusters, which, if included, would increase the set of permanently dropped goods.
     The share of varieties that are permanently dropped is plotted in Figure 15. Early
in the crisis, the line jumps above 0.2, indicating that more than one-fifth of all previous
importer-variety combinations are permanently dropped, a level far in excess of anything
seen before or after the crisis. Our analysis does not require that varieties are permanently
dropped, but this nonetheless confirms that not only did the number of dropped varieties
spike dramatically upward during the beginning quarters of the crisis (as shown in the paper),
but many of those dropped varieties are permanently dropped. While this does not eliminate
a possible role for inventories in smoothing the use of input varieties, it limits the extent to
which inventories could have substituted for these dropped varieties.
