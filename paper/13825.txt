                                            ABSTRACT

Using recent advances in the econometrics literature, we disentangle from high frequency observations
on the transaction prices of a large sample of NYSE stocks a fundamental component and a microstructure
noise component. We then relate these statistical measurements of market microstructure noise to
observable characteristics of the underlying stocks, and in particular to different financial measures
of their liquidity. We find that more liquid stocks based on financial characteristics have lower noise
and noise-to-signal ratio measured from their high frequency returns. We then examine whether there
exists a common, market-wide, factor in high frequency stock-level measurements of noise, and whether
that factor is priced in asset returns.

    HIGH FREQUENCY MARKET MICROSTRUCTURE
    NOISE ESTIMATES AND LIQUIDITY MEASURES

              Using recent advances in the econometrics literature, we disen-
         tangle from high frequency observations on the transaction prices
         of a large sample of NYSE stocks a fundamental component and
         a microstructure noise component. We then relate these statistical
         measurements of market microstructure noise to observable charac-
         teristics of the underlying stocks, and in particular to di erent -
         nancial measures of their liquidity. We nd that more liquid stocks
         based on nancial characteristics have lower noise and noise-to-signal
         ratio measured from their high frequency returns. We then examine
         whether there exists a common, market-wide, factor in high frequency
         stock-level measurements of noise, and whether that factor is priced
         in asset returns.


   1. Introduction. Understanding volatility and its dynamics lies at the
heart of asset pricing. As the primary measure of risk in modern nance,
volatility drives the construction of optimal portfolios, the hedging and pric-
ing of options and other derivative securities or the determination of a rm's
exposure to a variety of risk factors and the compensation it can expect to
earn from those risk exposures. It also plays a critical role in discovering
trading and investment opportunities which provide an attractive risk-return
trade-o .
   It is therefore not surprising that volatility estimation and inference has
attracted much attention in the nancial econometric and statistical liter-
ature, including the seminal ARCH model of Engle (1982). Indeed, many
estimators are available to measure an asset's volatility from a discrete price
sample. But at least in the framework of parametric models, one will often
start with the sum of squared log-returns, as not only the simplest and most
natural estimator, but also as the one with the most desirable properties. For
instance, in the context of parametric volatility models, this quantity will

be not only the least squares estimator or the method of moments estimator
with the sample variance as the moment function, but also the maximum
likelihood estimator.
   The asymptotic properties of this estimator are especially striking when
sampling occurs at an increasing frequency which, when assets trade every
few seconds, is a realistic approximation to what we observe using the now
commonly available transaction or quote-level sources of nancial data. In
particular, as is well known in the context of stochastic processes, fully
observing the sample path of an asset will in the limit perfectly reveal the
volatility of that path. This result is nonparametric in nature, in that the
estimator will converge to the quadratic variation of the process, a result
which holds in great generality for semimartingales and does not rely on a
parametric volatility model.
   More recently, however, the statistical and econometric literatures have
faced up to the fact that the situation in real life is not as simple as these
asymptotic results suggest. Controlling for the market microstructure noise
that is prevalent at high frequency has become a key issue. For a while,
the approach used in the empirical literature consisted in ignoring the data
sampled at the very highest frequencies out of concern for the noise that
they might harbor, and sample instead once every 15 or 30 minutes.
   The latest approach consists in explicitly incorporating microstructure
noise into the analysis, and estimators have been developed to make use of
all the data, no matter how high the frequency and how noisy, as prescribed
by statistical principles. These methods make it possible to decompose the
total observed variance into a component attributable to the fundamen-
tal price signal and one attributable to the market microstructure noise.
These estimators can also produce consistent estimates of the magnitude
of the market microstructure noise at high frequency, thereby producing a
decomposition of total asset return volatility into fundamental and noise
components.
   Our objective in this paper is to better understand the nature of the
information contained in these high frequency statistical measurements and
relate them to observable nancial characteristics of the underlying assets,
and in particular to di erent nancial measures of their liquidity. Intuitively,
one would expect that more liquid assets would tend to generate log-returns
with a lower amount of microstructure noise, and a lower noise-to-signal
ratio.

   Market microstructure noise captures a variety of frictions inherent in the
trading process: bid-ask bounces, discreteness of price changes, di erences
in trade sizes or informational content of price changes, gradual response of
prices to a block trade, strategic component of the order ow, inventory con-
trol e ects, etc. A better understanding of the relationship between these
\micro" frictions and their \macro" consequences for asset prices' liquid-
ity has implications for the asset management practice, especially for the
strategies known as statistical arbitrage or proprietary trading.
   This said, liquidity is an elusive concept. At a general level, the de nition
is straightforward: a market is liquid if one can trade a large quantity soon
after wanting to do so, and at a price that is near the prices that precede
and follow that transaction. How to translate that into an operative concept
that is amenable to empirical analysis is less clear, and a variety of di erent
measures have been proposed in the literature, including various measures of
transaction costs, the extent to which prices depart from the random walk,
etc.: see, e.g., Amihud, Mendelson, and Pedersen (2005) for a recent survey.
   Our objective is therefore to examine the extent to which the high fre-
quency statistical estimates that we will construct correlate with the various
  nancial measures of liquidity, and whether they contain new or di erent
information. In particular, we will look at whether high frequency estimates
of microstructure noise contain a systematic, market-wide, risk factor and
whether that risk factor is priced in the market, meaning that stocks that
covary with our high-frequency measure of liquidity tend to get compensated
in the form of higher returns. We will examine all these questions using a
massive dataset consisting in all transactions recorded on all NYSE common
stocks between June 1, 1995 and December 31, 2005.
   The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain the strategies
we use to estimate and separate the fundamental and noise volatilities. Sec-
tion 3 describes our data. The empirical results where we relate the noise
volatility to liquidity measures are in Section 4. In Section 5, we construct
a semiparametric index model for the various nancial measures of liquid-
ity as they relate to our high frequency measurement: there, we construct
the index of the diverse nancial measures that best explains the statistical
measurement of market microstructure noise. Then, we study in Section 6
whether there exists a common factor in stock-level liquidity measured at
high frequency { we nd that there is { and then in Section 7 whether that
common factor is priced in asset returns { we nd that the answer is yes,

with some quali cations. Section 8 concludes.

   2. The Noise and Volatility Estimators. In this Section, we brie y
review the two complementary estimation strategies that we will apply to
decompose the returns' total variance into one due to the fundamental price
and one due to market microstructure noise. The starting point to this analy-
sis is a representation of the observed transaction log price at time t, Yt ; as
the sum of an unobservable e cient price, Xt ; and a noise component due
to the imperfections of the trading process, "t :

(1)                              Yt = Xt + "t :

One is often interested in estimating the volatility of the e cient log-price
process dXt = t dt+ t dWt using discretely sampled data on the transaction
price process at times 0, ,:::, n = T .
    The speci cation of the model coincides with that of Hasbrouck (1993),
who interprets the standard deviation a of the noise " as a summary mea-
sure of market quality. In Roll (1984), " is due entirely to the bid-ask spread
while Harris (1990b) lets additional phenomena give rise to ". Examples
include adverse selection e ects as in Glosten (1987) and Glosten and Har-
ris (1988); see also Madhavan, Richardson, and Roomans (1997). A related
literature has looked at transaction costs using bid-ask spread, price im-
pact, etc., including Huang and Stoll (1996), Chan and Lakonishok (1997)
and Cao, Choe, and Hatheway (1997). When asymmetric information is in-
volved, the disturbance " would typically no longer be uncorrelated with
the process W driving the e cient price and would also exhibit autocorre-
lation, which would complicate the analysis without fundamentally altering
it: see the discussion below. Another important source of measurement error
are rounding e ects, since transaction prices are multiples of a tick size: see
Gottlieb and Kalay (1985), Harris (1990a), Jacod (1996) and Delattre and
Jacod (1997).
    We will use below two classes of consistent estimators designed for the two
situations where t is parametric (which can be reduced to t = ; a xed
parameter to be estimated), and t is nonparametric (i.e., an unrestricted
stochastic process), in which case we seek to estimate the quadratic variation
              R
hX; XiT = 0T t2 dt over a xed interval of time T; say one day. In both
cases, we are also interested in estimating consistently a2 = E["2 ]: For the

parametric problem, we will use the maximum-likelihood estimator of A•t-
Sahalia, Mykland, and Zhang (2005a). For the nonparametric problem, we
will use the estimator called Two Scales Realized Volatility Zhang, Mykland,
and A•t-Sahalia (2005b), which is the rst estimator shown to be consistent
for hX; XiT .
   The estimation of hX; XiT has been studied in the constant case by
Zhou (1996), who proposes a bias correcting approach based on autocovari-
ances. The behavior of this estimator has been studied by Zumbach, Corsi,
and Trapletti (2002). Hansen and Lunde (2006) study the Zhou estimator
and extensions in the case where volatility is time varying but conditionally
nonrandom. Related contributions have been made by Oomen (2006) and
Bandi and Russell (2003). The Zhou estimator and its extensions, however,
are inconsistent. This means in this particular case that, as the frequency
of observation increases, the estimator diverges instead of converging to
hX; XiT .

   2.1. The Parametric Case: Constant Volatility. Consider rst the para-
metric case studied in A•t-Sahalia, Mykland, and Zhang (2005a), which by a
change of variable and It^o's Lemma can be immediately reduced to one where
  is constant. If no market microstructure noise were present, i.e., " 0; the
log-returns Ri = Y i Y i 1 would be i.i.d. N (0; 2 ): The MLE for 2 then
                                                               P
coincides with the realized volatility of the process, ^ 2 = T1 ni=1 Ri2 : Fur-
thermore, T 1=2 ^ 2     2      ! N (0; 2 4 ) and thus selecting       as small
                              n !1
as possible is optimal for the purpose of estimating 2 :
    When the observations are noisy, with the "0 s being i.i.d. noise with mean
0 and variance a2 , the true structure of the observed log-returns Ri is given
by an MA(1) process since Ri =       W i W i 1 +" i " i 1             ui + u i 1
             0
where the u s are mean zero and variance       2         2       2
                                                 with (1 + ) = Var[Ri ] =
  2        2
       + 2a and   2  = Cov(Ri ; Ri 1 ) = a : 2

    If we assume for a moment that "        N (0; a2 ) (an assumption we will
                           0
relax below), then the u s are i.i.d. Gaussian and the likelihood function
for the vector R of observed log-returns, as a function of the transformed
parameters ( 2 ; ); is given by

   Since AVARnormal (^ 2 ) is increasing in ; we are back to the situation
where it is optimal to sample as often as possible. Interestingly, the AVAR
structure of the estimator remains largely intact if we misspecify the distri-
bution of the microstructure noise. Speci cally, suppose that the "0 s have
mean 0 and variance a2 but are not normally distributed. If the econome-
trician (mistakenly) assumes that the "0 s are normal, inference is still done
with the Gaussian log-likelihood l( 2 ; a2 ), using the scores l_ 2 and l_a2 as
moment functions. Since the expected values of l_ 2 and l_a2 only depend on
the second order moment structure of the log-returns R, which is unchanged
by the absence of normality, the moment functions are unbiased: Etrue [l_ 2 ]
= Etrue [l_a2 ] = 0 where \true" denotes the true distribution of the Y 0 s. Hence
the estimator (^ 2 ; a^2 ) based on these moment functions remains consistent
and the e ect of misspeci cation lies in the AVAR. By using the cumu-
lants of the distribution of "; we express the AVAR in terms of deviations
from normality. We obtain that the estimator (^ 2 ; a   ^2 ) is consistent and its
asymptotic variance is given by
                                                                                                     !

In the special case where " is normally distributed, Cum4 ["] = 0
   The presence of a drift does not alter these earlier conclusions, not just
because it would be economically irrelevant at the observation frequencies
we consider, but also because of the following. Suppose that Xt = t + Wt
then the block of the AVAR matrix corresponding to (^ 2 ; a^2 ) is the same as
if were known, in other words, as if = 0; which is the case we focused
on.
   A•t-Sahalia, Mykland, and Zhang (2005a) also discuss how the likelihood
function is to be modi ed in the case of serially correlated noise and noise
that is correlated with the price process. In those cases, the form of the
variance matrix of the observed log-returns must be altered, replacing 2 vij

             + cov(        W   j   W   j   1       ;"   i   "     i 1   ) + cov("          i   "   i 1   ;"   j   "   j   1   )

where ij = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. A model for the time series depen-
dence of the " and its potential correlation to the price process would then
specify the remaining terms.

is nonparametric, where volatility is left unspeci ed, stochastic, and we now
summarize the TSRV approach to separating the fundamental and noise
volatilities in this case. When dXt = t dWt ; the object of interest is now

In the absence of noise, [Y; Y ]T consistently estimates hX; XiT : The sum
converges to the integral, with a known distribution, dating back to Jacod
(1994) and Jacod and Protter (1998). As in the constant case, selecting
   as small as possible (that is, n as large as possible) is optimal.
   But ignoring market microstructure noise leads to an even more dangerous
situation than when is constant and T ! 1. After suitable scaling, RV
based on the observed log-returns is a consistent and asymptotically normal
estimator { but of the quantity 2nE["2 ] rather than of the object of interest,

hX; XiT . Said di erently, in the high frequency limit, market microstructure
noise totally swamps the variance of the price signal at the level of the
realized volatility.
   This is of course already visible in the special case of constant volatil-
ity. Since the expressions above are exact small-sample ones, they can in
particular be specialized to analyze the situation where one samples at in-
creasingly higher frequency ( ! 0; say sampled every minute) over a xed
time period (T xed, say a day). With N = T = ; we have
             h   i2na2          2nE "2
(6)       E ^2 =       + o(n) =         + o(n)

                          T2                     T2
so (T =2n)^ 2 becomes an estimator of E "2 = a2 whose asymptotic variance
is E "4 : Note in particular that ^ 2 estimates the variance of the noise,
which is essentially unrelated to the object of interest 2 :
                                                                         (all)
   It has long been known that sampling as prescribed by [Y; Y ]T is not
a good idea. The recommendation in the literature has then been to sam-
ple sparsely at some lower frequency, by using a realized volatility estima-
           (sparse)
tor [Y; Y ]T        constructed by summing squared log-returns at some lower
frequency: 5 mn, or 10, 15, 30 mn, typically (see e.g., Andersen, Boller-
slev, Diebold, and Labys (2001), Barndor -Nielsen and Shephard (2002)
and Gencay, Ballocchi, Dacorogna, Olsen, and Pictet (2002).) Reducing the
value of n; from say 23; 400 (1 second sampling) to 78 (5 mn sampling over
the same 6:5 hours), has the advantage of reducing the magnitude of the
bias term 2nE["2 ]: Yet, one of the most basic lessons of statistics is that
discarding data is, in general, not advisable.
   Zhang, Mykland, and A•t-Sahalia (2005b) proposed a solution to this
problem which makes use of the full data sample yet delivers consistent
estimators of both hX; XiT and a2 . The estimator, Two Scales Realized
Volatility (TSRV), is based on subsampling, averaging and bias-correction.
By evaluating the quadratic variation at two di erent frequencies, averaging
the results over the entire sampling, and taking a suitable linear combi-
nation of the result at the two frequencies, one obtains a consistent and
asymptotically unbiased estimator of hX; XiT .
   TSRV's construction is quite simple: rst, partition the original grid of
observation times, G = ft0 ; :::; tn g into subsamples, G(k) ; k = 1; :::; K where
                   MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE AND LIQUIDITY                                                            9

n=K ! 1 as n ! 1: For example, for G(1) start at the rst observation
and take an observation every 5 minutes; for G(2) ; start at the second obser-
vation and take an observation every 5 minutes, etc. Then we average the
estimators obtained on the subsamples. To the extent that there is a bene t
to subsampling, this bene t can now be retained, while the variation of the
estimator will be lessened by the averaging. This reduction in the estimator's
variability will open the door to the possibility of doing bias correction.
   Averaging over the subsamples gives rise to the estimator
                                                          K
                                      (avg)            1 X          (k)
(8)                         [Y; Y ]T               =         [Y; Y ]T
                                                       K k=1

                                                                     (k)
constructed by averaging the estimators [Y; Y ]T obtained on K grids of av-
                                                              (all)      (avg)
erage size n = n=K. While a better estimator than [Y; Y ]T , [Y; Y ]T          re-
                                 (avg)         2
mains biased. The bias of [Y; Y ]T     is 2nE[" ]; of course, n < n; so progress
is being made. But one can go one step further. Indeed, E["2 ] can be con-
sistently approximated using RV computed with all the observations:

                                   [   2] =
                                             1        (all)
(9)                                E["         [Y; Y ]T
                                            2n
                                                                                                       (all)
Hence the bias of [Y; Y ](avg) can be consistently estimated by n[Y; Y ]T                                      =n.
TSRV is the bias-adjusted estimator for hX; Xi constructed as

Unlike all the previously considered ones, this estimator is now correctly
centered.

     A small sample re nement to hX; XiT can be constructed as follows
                                                1
                   \

(12)              hX; XiT             = 1           hX; XiT        :
                                            n
The di erence with the estimator (10) is of order Op (K 1 ), and thus the
two estimators have the same asymptotic behaviors to the order that we
consider. However, the estimator (12) is unbiased to higher order.
    So far, we have assumed that the noise " was i.i.d. In that case, log-
returns are MA(1); it is possible to relax this assumption, and compute a
TSRV estimator with two separate time scales (see A•t-Sahalia, Mykland,
and Zhang (2005b).) TSRV provides the rst consistent and asymptotic
(mixed) normal estimator of the quadratic variation hX; XiT ; as can be
seen from (11), it has the rate of convergence n 1=6 . Zhang (2006) shows
that it is possible to generalize TSRV to multiple time scales, by averaging
not just on two time scales but on multiple time scales. For suitably selected
weights, the resulting estimator, MSRV converges to hX; XiT at the slightly
faster rate n 1=4 . TSRV corresponds to the special case where one uses a
single slow time scale in conjunction with the fast time scale to bias-correct
it.
    Finally, we exclude here any form of correlation between the noise " and
the e cient price X, something which has been stressed by Hansen and
Lunde (2006). As discussed in A•t-Sahalia, Mykland, and Zhang (2006),
however, the noise can only be distinguished from the e cient price under
speci c assumptions. In most cases, the assumption that the noise is sta-
tionary, alone, is not enough to make the noise identi able. For example,
coming back to the starting point (1) for the observed (log) price process
Y , the model does not guarantee that one can always disentangle the signal
or the volatility of the signal. To see this, suppose that the dynamics of the
e cient price X can be written as dXt = t dt + t dWt ; where the drift
coe cient t and the di usion coe cient t can be random, and Wt is a
standard Brownian motion. If one assumed that the noise "t is also an It^o
process, say, d"t = t dt + t dBt ; then Yt is also an It^o process of the form
dYt = ( t + t )dt + !t dVt ; where !t2 = t2 + t2 + 2 t t d hW; Bit =dt. Unless
one imposes additional constraints, it is therefore not possible to distinguish
signal and noise in this model, and the only observable quadratic variation
    R                                           R
is 0T !t2 dt; instead of the object of interest 0T t2 dt:
    Another issue we leave out is that of small sample corrections to the as-
                      MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE AND LIQUIDITY                                 11

ymptotics of the estimators. Recently, Goncalves and Meddahi (2005) have
developed an Edgeworth expansion for the basic RV estimator when there
is no noise. Their expansion applies to the studentized statistic based on
the standard RV and it is used for assessing the accuracy of the bootstrap
in comparison to the rst order asymptotic approach. By contrast, Zhang,
Mykland, and A•t-Sahalia (2005a) develop an Edgeworth expansion for non-
studentized statistics for the standard RV, TSRV and other estimators, but
allow for the presence of microstructure noise. Since we are using here point
estimates for a2 and hX; XiT ; and the small sample corrections a ect their
distribution but not the point estimates, Edgeworth expansions are irrele-
vant to the present paper.

transactions recorded on all NYSE common stocks between June 1, 1995 and
December 31, 2005. These stocks display a wide variety of characteristics.
Many of them do not trade very frequently, especially at the beginning of the
sample, to the point where some assumptions of the data generating process
used in either the parametric or nonparametric models can be questioned:
Is    small enough for the TSRV asymptotics to work? What is the impact
of assuming that is not random? Further, what is the impact of jumps in
the price level and volatility, if any, on the MLE which assumes these e ects
away? What is the impact of stochastic volatility on the MLE? Relative
to TSRV, to what extent does the e ciency of MLE outweigh its potential
misspeci cation?
   We now conduct Monte Carlo simulations, designed to be realistic given
the nature of the data to which we will apply these estimators, to examine
the impact of these various departures from the basic assumptions used to
                 MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE AND LIQUIDITY                        13

derive the properties of the estimators.
   It turns out that since we are estimating volatility and noise averages
over a relatively short time interval [0; T ]; where T = 1 day, assuming that
the underlying values are constant over that time span is not adversely
a ecting the performance of the MLE of the average values of the underlying
processes. Speci cally, randomness in t over that time span, calibrated to
multiples of the range of observed values, has little impact on the MLE. We
will also see that the MLE is robust to incorporating a fair amount of jumps
as well as randomness to the sampling intervals.
   To see this, we perform simulations where the true data generating ex-
hibits stochastic volatility.

                       dVt =   (v   Vt ) dt + s Vt dW2t

where W1t and W2t are independent Brownian Motions. The parameters
are v = 0:09 (corresponding to 30% volatility per year) and = 0:5. s is
the volatility of volatility parameter and will vary in our simulations. V0 is
initialized with its stationary distribution. The standard deviation of the
noise, a, is set to 0.1%.
   To add realism, we make the sampling interval random; we assume an
exponential distribution with mean . By increasing ; we proxy for lower
liquidity in the sense of less active trading. We make the distribution of
   independent of that of X; this is not completely realistic, but introduc-
ing a link between the two variables would change the likelihood function.
With independence, we can treat the parameters of the distribution of
as nuisance parameters. 10,000 simulation sample paths are drawn. We run
simulations for various combinations of the average sampling interval and
the volatility of volatility parameter s.
   The results are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. In these tables and
the next, we report the average and the standard deviation (in parentheses)
of MLE and TSRV estimates across the same 10,000 sample paths. The
averages are to be compared to the true values a2 = 1E 6 and 2 = 0:09;
respectively. The sampling interval is random and exponentially distributed
with mean . TSRV is evaluated at K = 25 subsamples.
   Next, we add jumps. The data generating process includes stochastic

   It can be seen from the results that in all cases the ML and TSRV es-
timators of a2 are robust to various types of departures from the model's
basic assumptions under a wide range of simulation design values, including
properties of the volatility and the sampling mechanism. MLE assumes that
volatility is non-stochastic; we nd that for the purpose of applying the es-
timator over intervals of 1 day, any reasonable variability of volatility over
that time span has no adverse e ects on the estimator. Similarly, jumps and
randomness in the sampling intervals, within a large range of values that
contains the empirically relevant ones, do not a ect the estimator.
   TSRV is of course robust to stochastic volatility, but on the other hand,
it is more sensitive to low sampling frequency, i.e., high sampling intervals
  , situations : the bias-correction in TSRV relies on the idea that RV com-
                                 (all)
puted with all the data, [Y; Y ]T , consists primarily of noise which is the
notion that underlies (9). This is of course true asymptotically in n, that
is when ! 0: But if the full data sample frequency is low to begin with,
as for instance in the case of a stock sampled every minute instead of every
               (all)
second, [Y; Y ]T will not consist entirely of noise and bias-correcting on the
16                       Y. A•IT-SAHALIA AND J. YU

basis of (9) may over-correct. Since these types of situations (low sampling
frequency) will occur fairly often in our large sample below, the simula-
tions argue for privileging MLE as the baseline estimator in our empirical
application.

   3. The Data. We are now ready to examine the results produced by
the estimators on real data and relate them to various nancial measures of
liquidity.

   3.1. High Frequency Stock Returns. We collect intra-day transaction prices
and quotes from the NYSE Trade and Quote (TAQ) database, for all NYSE
common stocks during the sample period of June 1, 1995 to December 31,
2005. Common stocks are de ned as those in the Center for Research in
Security Prices (CRSP) database whose SHRCD variable is either 10 or 11.
The TAQ database starts in January 1993. Beginning in June 1995, the
trade time in TAQ is the Consolidated Trade System (CTS) time stamp.
Previously, the time shown was the time the trade information was received
by the NYSE's Information Generation System, which is approximately 3
seconds later than the CTS time stamp.

   3.2. Liquidity Measures. We look at a wide collection of liquidity proxies.
Two sets of liquidity measures are considered { a set of measures constructed
from high frequency data (denoted as H) and a set of measures constructed
from daily or lower frequencies (denoted as D).
   We obtain daily share turnover, closing price, total number of shares out-
standing, and monthly stock return from the Center for Research in Security
Prices (CRSP) database. For stock i in day t, let i;t denote the annualized
stock return volatility, to be estimated as described in Section 2.1 from intra-
day observations. We write SP READi;t for the average intra-day propor-
tional bid-ask spread (Ask Bid) =Bid Ask M idpoint. Only those intra-day
observations with an ask price higher than the bid price are included. We
let LOGT RADESIZEi;t denote the logarithm of the average number of
shares per trade and LOGN T RADEi;t denote the log of the total number
of intra-day trades. The vector H of intra-day liquidity measures is

      H = [ ; SP READ; LOGT RADESIZE; LOGN T RADE]T :

  We let LOGV OLU M Ei;t be the log of daily share volume for stock i on
day t obtained from CRSP daily stock le. Let M ON T HV OLi;t denote the
                  MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE AND LIQUIDITY                            17

annualized monthly stock return volatility for stock i estimated using sixty
monthly returns data in the most recent ve-year window ending no later
than t. Let LOGPi;t denote the log of stock i's closing price on day t. We
use LOGSHROU Ti;t to denote the log of total shares outstanding for stock
i at the end of day t. These liquidity measures have been used to explain
transaction costs in Huang and Stoll (1996), Chan and Lakonishok (1997)
and Cao, Choe, and Hatheway (1997).
    Hasbrouck (2005) constructs a variety of annual liquidity measures. From
Hasbrouck (2005), we obtain ve liquidity measures: cLogM eani;t (Gibbs
estimate of the log e ective cost), cM dmLogzi;t (Moment estimate of the
log e ective cost, infeasible set to 0), I2i;t (square root variant of the Amihud
illiquidity ratio), L2i;t (square root variant of liquidity ratio), i;t (Pastor and
Stambaugh gamma). These measures are constructed annually for stock i
using observations in the most recent calendar year ending no later than t.
We exclude those estimates constructed from less than sixty observations.
    We also collected data on analyst coverage (from I/B/E/S database) and
institutional ownership (from the CDA/Spectrum Institutional 13f Holdings
database). Let COV ERi;t denote the most recently reported number of ana-
lysts following stock i, and LOGCOV ERi;t = log (1 + COV ERi;t ). When a
stock has no analyst coverage, LOGCOV ERi;t = 0. We use IOi;t to denote
the most recently reported fraction of stock i's total shares outstanding that
are owned by institutions.
    The vector D of daily (or lower) frequency liquidity measures is

(15) D = [LOGV OLU M E; M ON T HV OL; LOGP; cLogM ean;
           cM dmLogz; I2; L2;       ; LOGSHROU T; LOGCOV ER; IO]T :

The lower frequency measures ignore intra-day information, but have a
longer time series available. The vector A of all liquidity measures is

(16)                             A = [H; D]T :

   4. The Noise and Volatility Estimates. We now relate the high
frequency estimates of market microstructure noise to the nancial measures
of stock liquidity.

  4.1. High Frequency Estimates of Microstructure Noise and Volatility.
Using log returns constructed from intra-day transaction prices, we esti-
mate the market microstructure noise ai;t and the volatility i;t of stock i on

is 653. There are at least 61 stocks and at most 1278 stocks on any given day
in the sample. There tends to be less stocks in the early part of the sample.
The number of stocks varies also because, to be included in the sample, a
stock-day combination is required to have a minimum of 200 intra-day trans-
actions. There is an average of 910 transactions in a stock-day combination.
The maximum number of intra-day transactions for one stock observed in
this sample is 8445.
   Table 6 reports the basic summary statistics for the noise and volatility
estimates. Estimates for all stocks j in all days t of the sample period June
1, 1995 { December 21, 2005 are pooled to computed the mean and stan-
dard deviation. The average noise standard deviation a in the sample is 5
basis points (bps). The estimates of volatility average to 34.8%. Figure 1
contains the histograms of MLE of a and estimated in our sample for all
the stock-day combinations.
   We will use the TSRV estimates as control variables for the MLE results.
They are generally quite similar and do not produce economically meaningful
di erences. In order to save space, we will not report the corresponding
results based on the TSRV estimates.

   4.2. Market Microstructure Noise and Liquidity. We begin by determin-
ing the extent to which our estimates of the market microstructure noise
magnitude aj;t correlate with the liquidity measures that have been proposed
in the literature. Speci cally, for each liquidity measure x in the vector A in
(16) we run the following regression

(17)                       aj;t = c0 + xt    1 c1   + "i;t :

   The estimation results are in the rst column of Table 7. This table reports
the OLS regression results of market microstructure noise a on individual
liquidity measures one-by-one (column (1)), on all liquidity measures (col-
umn (2)), and on all those liquidity measures that can be constructed with-
out using intra-day data (column (3)). The noise a and intra-day volatility
   are estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation. The t-statistics are
adjusted for heteroskedasticity and correlation within industry level using
Fama-French 48 industry classi cation (Fama and French (1997)).
   The noise is positively correlated with volatility (both the intra-day and
the monthly volatility), spread, transaction size, e ective cost of trading,
                 MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE AND LIQUIDITY                         21

Amihud's Illiquidity ratio, and Pastor-Stambaugh's gamma. The noise is
negatively correlated with number of intra-day transactions, price level, liq-
uidity ratio, shares outstanding, analyst coverage, and institutional owner-
ship. This is consistent with the notion that liquid stocks have less noise.
The adjusted regression R-squared indicates that intra-day bid-ask spread
explains most of the variation in noise (63%). Bid-ask bounces are a well-
recognized phenomenon in transaction price data { indeed the only source
of noise in the model of Roll (1984). Among the daily liquidity measures,
the price level explains the most variation in noise (28%).
   We then look at the following two regressions.

(18)                      aj;t = c0 + ATi;t   1 c1   + "i;t

                                       T
(19)                      aj;t = c0 + Di;t    1 c1   + "i;t

where the vector A contains all liquidity measures in (16) and D has all
daily liquidity measures in (15) constructed without relying on intra-day
observations.
   The second column of Table 7 reports the regression results of (18). Intra-
day spread and price level are the most statistically signi cant explanatory
variables, consistent with the result from (17). Some of the regression coef-
  cients changed sign relative to the estimates of (17). This is not surprising
since the explanatory variables are all correlated. The third column of the
table reports the regression results of (19). The price level is now the most
statistically signi cant regressor, which is not surprising given its impact
on the bid-ask spread (a $2 stock will not have the same spread as a $200
stock with otherwise equivalent characteristics.) Trading volume, which ag-
gregates the information in trade size and number of trades, is positively
correlated with noise.

  4.3. Noise-to-Signal Ratio and Liquidity. We use N SRj;t to denote the
noise-to-signal ratio of stock j on day t. When using MLE under the as-
sumptions of Section 2.1, the proportion of the total return variance that is
market microstructure-induced is
                                              2a2
(20)                         N SR =     2      + 2a2

at observation interval : Here, N SR is de ned as a ratio of the noise
variance to the total return variance, as opposed to the use of the term in
other contexts to separate volatility from a trend.
   As     gets smaller, N SR gets closer to 1; so that a larger proportion of
the variance in the observed log-return is driven by market microstructure
frictions, and correspondingly a lesser fraction re ects the volatility of the
underlying price process X: This e ect is responsible for the divergence of
traditional realized measures at high frequency: instead of converging to 2
as intended, they diverge according to 2na2 where n = T = goes to in nity
when T = 1 day is xed and one samples at increasing frequency, ! 0:
   Table 6 reports the summary statistics for the noise-to-signal ratio esti-
mates constructed from estimates of and a. Estimates for all stocks in
all days of the sample period June 1, 1995 { December 21, 2005 are pooled
to computed the mean and standard deviation. The noise-to-signal ratio
averages 36.6%.
   We next examine the correlation of the noise-to-signal ratio N SRj;t with
the existing liquidity measures contained in the vector A. Speci cally, for
each liquidity measure x in the vector A in (16) we run the following regres-

sion

(21)                      N SRj;t = c0 + xt     1 c1   + "i;t :

    The estimation results are reported in the rst column of Table 8. As in the
preceding table, column (1) reports the OLS regression results of noise-to-
signal ratio N SR on individual liquidity measures one-by-one, while column
(2) includes on all liquidity measures, and column (3) all those liquidity mea-
sures that can be constructed without using intra-day data. Except for intra-
day volatility, monthly volatility, illiquidity ratio, liquidity ratio, shares out-
standing, and analyst coverage, the correlations between noise-to-signal ratio
and liquidity measures have the same sign as the correlations between noise
and liquidity measures. The negative correlation between noise-to-signal ra-
tio N SR and volatility is not surprising because the noise-to-signal ratio has
volatility in the denominator. The positive correlations between N SR and
shares outstanding, analyst coverage, and liquidity ratio are likely due to
the same reason, with more shares outstanding/analyst coverage/liquidity
proxying less volatile stocks. The negative correlation between N SR and the
illiquidity ratio is likely due to the same reason, too. The price level explains
the most variation in noise-to-signal ratio.
    We then look at the following regressions

(22)                     N SRj;t = c0 + ATi;t    1 c1   + "i;t ;

                                         T
(23)                     N SRj;t = c0 + Di;t     1 c1   + "i;t :

   The second column of Table 8 reports the regression results of (22). The
price level is the most statistically signi cant explanatory variables, con-
sistent with the result from (21). The coe cients for most right-hand-side
variables have the same sign as those from (21). The coe cients for the Gibbs
estimates of the e ective trading cost, liquidity ratio and Pastor-Stambaugh
gamma changed sign. This is again not surprising since the explanatory
variables are all correlated and some of these regressors are not signi cant
to begin with. The third column of the table reports the regression results
of (23). The price level remains the most signi cant regressor. Trading vol-
ume, which aggregates the information in trade size and number of trades,
is negatively correlated with noise-to-signal ratio because trading volume is
positively correlated with intra-day volatility.

     4.4. Robustness Checks.

   4.4.1. Structural Breaks in Microstructure Noise. We now proceed to
check that the large R2 obtained in the regressions reported in Sections
4.2 and 4.3 are not simply the product of structural breaks due to the two
reductions of the tick size during the sample period. Indeed, regressing a
variable with two level changes in the same direction, on anything else with
a trend (deterministic of stochastic) could produce a large R2 , which may
or may not be spurious.
   Structural breaks in the time series of the average noise magnitude at ob-
tained from averaging the stock-level estimates of aj;t can be see in Figure 2:
there are two main breaks, corresponding to the a reduction from a 1=8 to
a 1=16 minimum tick size on June 24, 1997; the second corresponds to the
move to decimalization, i.e., a further reduction in the tick size to 1=100 on
January 29, 2001. Since bid-ask bounces represent the leading cause of mar-
ket microstructure noise in our transactions-based price data, it is natural
to check that these two breaks, leading to decreases in the average value of

at are not by themselves giving rise to spurious results.
   For that purpose, we re-do the regressions in column (1) of tables 7 and
8 except that we also include two dummy variables SIXT EEN T H and
DECIM AL in the regressions isolating the three sample periods where
minimum tick sizes were respectively, 1=8, 1=16 and 1=100. SIXT EEN T H
equals one in the sample period where minimum tick size is 1=16 and zero
otherwise. DECIM AL equals one in the sample period where minimum
tick size is 1=100 and zero otherwise. The results are largely similar to those
in tables 7 and 8 and are omitted for brevity. The adjusted R2 in these
regressions are, if anything, slightly higher than those in tables 7 and 8
because the two dummy variables capture some variations in noise.

   4.4.2. Fixed E ect Regression. In addition to the OLS regressions (17),
(18) and (19), we also run the following stock xed-e ect regression to ac-
count for rm-speci c heterogeneity. Speci cally, for each individual liquid-
ity measure x, we run

         aj;t = c0 + xt     1 c1   + ST OCK F IXED EF F ECT + "i;t :

  For the vector A of all liquidity measures and for the vector D of liquidity
measures constructed without relying on intra-day observations, we run

            aj;t = ATi;t   1c   + ST OCK F IXED EF F ECT + "i;t
                    T
            aj;t = Di;t    1c   + ST OCK F IXED EF F ECT + "i;t :
   A similar set of stock xed e ect regressions are ran for N SR to double
check the results from (21), (22) and (23).
   The results from the xed e ect regressions are similar to those from OLS
regressions. For brevity, the results are omitted and can be obtained from
the authors upon request.

   4.4.3. Nonlinearities. We re-run the noise-to-signal ratio regressions (22)
by including 2 in addition to        as explanatory variable to account for
potential nonlinearity. Similarly, for the noise regression (18), we re-run it
with the following permutations: replace the dependent variable noise a with
a2 , and include 2 in addition to as explanatory variable. The results are
similar to what we nd previously. For brevity, the results are not reported
here but are available from the authors upon request.

   The results are consistent with the conclusions in Section 5, namely that
a linear combination of the liquidity measures in (18), (19), (22), and (23)
can accurately capture the variation in noise and noise-to-signal ratio.

   5. Semiparametric Index of Microstructure Noise. There are many
di erent nancial measures of liquidity contained in the vector A. We would
like to be able to construct a single index that parsimoniously captures the
variation in noise or noise-to-signal ratio using the various nancial measures
of liquidity that have been proposed in the market-microstructure literature.
By summarizing the multidimensional vector of liquidity measures A into
an (endogenously determined) index AT b; we reduce the sampling error as-
sociated with the various measures and allow for more robust out-of-sample
extrapolation and forecasting.
   We will estimate a semiparametric single index model

(24)                    y = E [yjA] = m (A) = g AT b

where y is either noise a or noise-to-signal ratio N SR, A is the vector of
liquidity measures, b is an unknown vector of coe cients, and g ( ) is the un-
known functional form linking y and the index AT b. The restriction imposed
by the index structure is that y depends on A only through its potentially
nonlinear dependence on the single index AT b. The speci c way in which
the index averages the various measures of liquidity is not pre-speci ed {
it will be estimated. We use the classical index model method to estimate
g ( ) and b, see e.g., Hrdle and Linton (1994) for details on semi-parametric
single index model and the related estimation methods.1
   Figure 3 plots the estimated semi-parametric link function gb ( ) for the
noise against the single index AT b constructed using, respectively, all liq-
uidity measures and daily liquidity measures. Similarly, Figure 4 plots the
estimated semi-parametric link function gb ( ) for the noise-to-signal ratio
constructed using, respectively, all liquidity measures and daily liquidity
measures. The single index AT b is standardized to have zero mean and stan-
dard deviation of one. Also plotted in Figure 3 and Figure 4 are the various
quantiles for the estimates of noise a and noise-to-signal ratio, respectively.
   As seen in both gures, the variations in noise or noise-to-signal ratio
can be adequately captured by the single index AT b, and a linear link func-
     1
    We use a standard Gaussian kernel in the estimation and the bandwidths are chosen
using Silverman's rule (see Hrdle and Linton (1994)).

tion g ( ) approximates fairly well the unknown functional form m ( ). Im-
portantly, the link functions are all increasing, which is consistent with a
positive dependence between our statistical, high frequency, estimates of
liquidity and the nancial liquidity measures documented in the Sections
above. Based on this, we will construct a single index from linear regres-
sions on asset pricing implications, which will not rely on non-parametric
estimation of the unknown link function g ( ). Rather, we will work under
the restriction that g ( ) is linear, using the construction of the index of
the various liquidity measures provided by the estimates of index coe cient
vector b:
   Besides reducing the dimensionality of the regression, which in theory has
robustness advantages, one further advantage of using the single index from
daily liquidity measures in asset pricing is that it allows extrapolation, mak-
ing it possible to use a longer time series of otherwise unavailable nancial
liquidity measures for some individual stocks.

   6. Market-Wide Liquidity Risk. There are many reasons to expect
that liquidity across many di erent stocks could co-move. First, at the mi-
crostructure level, factors believed to a ect the provision of liquidity are sub-
ject to common factors: for instance, dealers' adjustments to their inventory
levels in response to price or volatility movements (which we know are partly
co-movements) can lead to adjustments to individual bid-ask spreads, quoted
depths and other liquidity proxies that then exhibit co-variation across wide
segments of the market. Second, at the macroeconomic level, periods of un-
certainty are generally accompanied by a market-wide reduction in trading
activity as investors sit on the sidelines waiting for the uncertainty to get
resolved. Similarly, shifts in the perception of an asymmetric information
risk can also lead to co-movements in liquidity, perhaps on a more limited
scale (say, industry-wide.)2
   2
     Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2000) examine whether quoted spreads, quoted
depth, and e ective spreads co-move with market- and industry-wide liquidity. After con-
trolling for individual liquidity characteristics such as volatility, volume and price, they
  nd that these co-movements remain signi cant. Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2001)
  nd that daily changes in market averages of liquidity and trading activity are time-varying
and negatively autocorrelated. When stock returns fall, so does liquidity. Periods of volatil-
ity are followed by a decrease in trading activity. Finally, they document day-of-the-week
patterns, with Fridays experiencing lower trading activity and liquidity. Hasbrouck and
Seppi (2001) examine common movements in various liquidity proxies, such as the bid-ask

   We now examine whether similar ndings hold for our measure of liquidity,
based on intraday high frequency returns. In particular, we examine whether
the time series of stock-level liquidity measures we have constructed above
is subject to common factor variation, or whether it is primarily driven by
microeconomic events and rm-speci c variation, such as news announce-
ments.
   We start by looking at market-wide liquidity, as measured by an equal-
weighted cross-sectional average of the estimates a we constructed above.
Figure 5 plots the daily percentage variation in market liquidity for the
sample period of June 1995 { December 2005. The aggregate liquidity can
have sizeable uctuations from time to time. Higher a in the plot indicates
low liquidity. The biggest upward spike takes place in the summer of 1998
when the liquidity is widely perceived to have dried up due to Russian
default and LTCM collapse. The biggest downward spike occurs in February
spread and quote sizes, have relatively small common factors. Huberman and Halka (2001)
estimate models for quotes and depths for portfolios and nd evidence of common factors
in liquidity in the form of residuals being correlated across portfolios.

2001 when NYSE went decimal. There is a similar downward spike around
mid-1997 when NYSE reduced tick size from one-eighth to one-sixteenth.
We have also constructed market liquidity using value-weighted average of
a and the plot looks similar. The pairwise correlation between changes in
equal-weighted and value-weighted averages of a is 0.963 in this sample
period.
   We then look at the empirical covariation between individual stock liquid-
ity (as measured by our stock-level estimate of a) and market-wide liquidity
(as measured by the equal-weighted average of the at estimates). We do this
by regressing daily percentage changes in our individual stock liquidity mea-
sure aj;t on a constant and the daily percentage changes in the market-wide
liquidity measure aM;t :

(25)           ln(aj;t =aj;t   1)   =   j    +   j   ln(aM;t =aM;t        1)   +    j;t


We remove each individual stock from the computation of the market-wide
liquidity average used in that stock's regression, so that the right hand side
regressor does not contain the left hand side variable, and the estimated
coe cients in all those regressions are not arti cially constrained.

   The results are reported in column (1) of Table 9. Column (1) of this table
conducts, for each stock, a time-series regression of the daily log changes in
individual stock liquidity measure a on log changes in the equal-weighted
cross-sectional average a for all stocks in the sample (\Market"). The cross-
sectional average of time series slope coe cients is reported with t-statistics
in the parenthesis. \% positive" reports the percentage of positive slope co-
e cients, while \% + signi cant" gives the percentage of time-series regres-
sion t-statistics (from Newey and West (1987)) that are greater than 1.645
(the 5% critical level in a one-sided test). Column (2) reports the results
from a time-series regression of daily log changes in individual stock a on
log changes in both equal-weighted market average of a and equal-weighted
industry average of a (\Industry"). Industry is classi ed using one-digit SIC
codes. Slope coe cients for both the market and the industry are reported.
Column (3) conducts a time-series regression of daily log changes in indi-
vidual stock a on log changes in market-wide a in the current, the previous,
and the next trading days. In the table, \sum" = concurrent + lag + lead
slope coe cients, \median" is the median of time-series slope coe cients in
columns (1) and (2), or the median of \Sum" in column (3), \p-value" is
the p-value of a signed test of the null hypothesis that median=0. Cross-
sectional mean and median adjusted R-squared of the time-series regressions
are also reported. The liquidity measure a of an individual stock is excluded
from the construction of the market and the industry liquidity averages used
in that stock's time-series regression.
   The cross-sectional average of j is 1.027 with a t-statistic of 1.95. 62.8%
of the slope coe cients are positive. For each time-series regression, we ob-
tain the Newey and West (1987) t-statistic for the slope coe cient. 12.6%
of the time-series regression t-statistics are greater than 1.645, the 5% crit-
ical level in a one-sided test for the positivity of the slope coe cient. The
cross-sectional median of the slope coe cients is 0.472 and the null hypoth-
esis of zero median is rejected with p-value = 0.000 in favor of a positive
slope coe cient. There is a large unexplained component of individual stock
liquidity variations, as is clear from the low regression adjusted R2 . This is
consistent with the ndings in Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2000)
and Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001).
   We have also run the corresponding regressions with value-weighted in-
stead of equal-weighted market-wide liquidity averages and nd similar re-
sults. For example, the cross-sectional average of j is 2.376 with a t-statistic
                        MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE AND LIQUIDITY                                                33

of 4.53 when a value-weighted average of market liquidity is used. These
results suggest that there is a common component in individual stock liq-
uidities measured by aj;t .
   We next investigate common industry components in stock-level liquidity
a by regressing daily percentage changes in our individual stock liquidity
measure aj;t on a constant, the daily percentage changes in the market-wide
liquidity measure aM;t , and the daily percentage changes in the industry-
level liquidity measure aI;t

   ln(aj;t =aj;t   1)   =   j   +   j;M   ln(aM;t =aM;t   1)   +   j;I   ln(aI;t =aI;t   1)   +   j;t :

aI;t is constructed from equal-weighted industry average of individual stock
a. Firm j is excluded from the construction of the industry-level liquidity
used in its own regression. One-digit SIC code is used as industry classi ca-
tion, though we have also used Fama-French 5 industry and Fama-French 10
industry classi cations and obtained similar results. Column (2) of Table 9
reports the regression results. The slope coe cient for market-wide liquidity
is 1.553, similar to that in column (1) and remains statistically signi cant
(t-statistic=1.99). The industry slope coe cient is positive. However, both
the economic and statistical signi cance is much smaller compared to that of
the market coe cient. This is suggestive of some co-movements in industry
liquidity, though the e ect is measured with some noise. We have re-run the
regression using value-weighted market and industry average liquidity and
found similar results.
   As a robustness check, we have run the regression speci cation (25) with
one lag and one lead of changes in market liquidity. The lag and the lead are
intended to capture delayed responses to common determinants of liquidity.
The result is in column (3) of Table 9. The concurrent slope coe cient is
0.944, similar to those in columns (1) and (2). It is statistically signi cant
with a t-statistic of 2.12. Both the lag and the lead coe cients are posi-
tive, though both their economic and statistical signi cance is smaller than
the concurrent coe cient. The sum of the concurrent, lag and lead coe -
cients averages to 1.645 with a t-statistic of 2.42, con rming that individual
liquidity measures a do co-move to some degree with each other.

   7. Asset Pricing Implications. Given the evidence above that there
is a common factor in liquidity as measured by our high frequency esti-
mates, we now ask whether that common factor is priced. We begin by

looking at the returns of portfolios sorted on various liquidity measures, in-
cluding our high frequency measurement of the magnitude of the market
microstructure noise, a. At the end of June in each year, we sort stocks
into quintiles using one of the liquidity measures. Monthly value-weighted
portfolio returns are calculated for the twelve months following the sort.
Table 10 shows the time-series averages of the monthly portfolio returns in
the sample period of July 1995 { June 2005. For the noise a, the annual
sort at the end of June is based on the average of daily MLE estimates of
a within June. To reduce the estimation variability, we require at least a
week's worth of a estimates (i.e. at least ve daily estimates) to construct
the monthly average. The results are similar if di erent minimum numbers of
daily estimates are used. We construct monthly liquidity measures for N SR,
  , SP READ, LOGT RADESIZE, LOGN T RADE, LOGV OLU M E. For
share price LOGP and total number of shares outstanding LOGSHROU T ,
we use the information from the last trading day of June to construct the
monthly measure.
    Table 10 shows the portfolio returns sorted using all NYSE stocks. The
                 MICROSTRUCTURE NOISE AND LIQUIDITY                           35

returns are monotonically increasing for portfolios sorted on a. The portfolio
corresponding to the highest quintile a outperform the portfolio with the
lowest quintile a by 44 basis points (bps) per month (5.3% per year), and
the di erence is statistically signi cant. The portfolio returns sorted on N SR
are not monotonic across the ve N SR quintiles due to the e ect of on
returns, though the portfolio with the lowest N SR underperforms the other
four quintiles. Portfolio returns sorted on another common liquidity measure,
SP READ; are roughly monotonic, although the return di erence between
the top and bottom quintiles is only about 20 bps per month. There are no
clear return implications for the other liquidity measures.

   To check the e ect of low-price stocks, Table 11 shows the portfolio returns
sorted using all NYSE stocks whose price at the end of June is at least $5.
The result is similar.
   It is important to note from Table 10 and Table 11 that none of the other
liquidity measures in the vector A appears to be priced the way a is. This
provides evidence that a as a measure of liquidity contains information that
is not captured by any single one of the traditional nancial measures of

market microstructure noise and liquidity. To obtain a liquidity factor with
similar pricing power as a; one needs to group all the liquidity measures into
the index AT b constructed above. At that point, we have an e ective proxy
for a.

   To see whether the extra return earned by the illiquid portfolio is compen-
sation for risk, we run, for each given i = 1; 2; :::; 5, the following time-series
regression
                    ri;t rf;t = i + i (rM;t rf;t ) + "i;t
where i indicates one of the liquidity-sorted quintile portfolios. ri;t is the
portfolio return in month t. rf;t is the one-month Treasury-bill rate. rM;t is
the stock market return. The estimate of i measures the exposure to the
market risk. The estimate of i (CAPM alpha) measures the return unex-
plained by the exposure to the market factor which is then attributed to the
sort on liquidity. Table 12 reports the CAPM alpha for the quintile portfolios
constructed from all NYSE stocks. The monthly alpha of the top quintile
a-stocks is 31 bps (3.7% per year) higher than the bottom quintile stocks,
about 30% smaller than the raw stock return di erence. The alphas across

stocks. The spread between top and bottom N SR quintile stocks increased
to 56 bps. This is partly due to the return spread across -quintiles (see Ang,
Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006)). SP READ does not correlate with return
alpha. We have also calculated CAPM alphas for liquidity-sorted portfolios
constructed from a restricted sample of all NYSE stocks whose end of June
price is at least $5. The results are similar and omitted for brevity.
   In addition to the CAPM alpha, we also calculated alpha relative to the
Fama-French 3-factor model (see Fama and French (1993)). Speci cally, we
run, for each given i = 1; 2; :::; 5, the following time-series regression
                        M                      HM L               SM B
ri;t   rf;t =   i   +   i   (rM;t   rf;t ) +   i      rHM L;t +   i      rSM B;t + "i;t

where rHM L;t and rSM B;t are the returns of two portfolios constructed to
mimic risk factors associated with value and size, respectively.3 The esti-
mate of i (Fama-French 3-factor alpha) measures the return unexplained
by exposure to market, value-, and size-related risks. When considering al-
phas with respect to the Fama-French 3-factor included, we nd that higher
a portfolios of liquidity-sorted stocks no longer have signi cantly higher re-
turns alphas. This suggests that the extent to which this liquidity factor is
priced in the marketplace is either too weak to be observable in the sample
when high frequency data are available after controlling by a multifactor
asset pricing model, or alternatively that the additional two factors in the

    The portfolios, which are constructed and subsequently rebalanced at the end of each
June, are based on the intersections of 2 portfolios formed on size (market equity, ME)
and 3 portfolios formed on the ratio of book equity to market equity (BE/ME). The size
breakpoint for year t is the median NYSE market equity at the end of June of year t.
BE/ME for June of year t is the book equity for the last scal year end in t-1 divided by
ME for December of t-1. The BE/ME breakpoints are the 30th and 70th NYSE percentiles.
Growth / neutral / value stocks refer to those stocks with the lowest 30% / middle 40%
/ highest 30% BE/ME. SM B (Small Minus Big) is the average return on the three small
portfolios minus the average return on the three big portfolios, SM B = 1/3 (Small Value
+ Small Neutral + Small Growth) - 1/3 (Big Value + Big Neutral + Big Growth). HM L
(High Minus Low) is the average return on the two value portfolios minus the average
return on the two growth portfolios, HM L = 1/2 (Small Value + Big Value) - 1/2 (Small
Growth + Big Growth). See Fama and French (1993) for more details on the SMB and
the HML factors.

Fama-French model proxy to some extent for the liquidity as measured by
these estimates.4

   8. Conclusions. In this paper, we decomposed the transaction prices
of NYSE stocks into a fundamental component and a microstructure noise
component. We relate the two components to observable nancial character-
istics, and in particular to di erent observable measures of stock liquidity.
We nd that less noise, as measured statistically by lower estimates of the
magnitude of the noise at high frequency, correlates positively with nancial
measures of liquidity, either at the daily frequency or at higher frequencies.
More liquid stocks have lower noise and noise-to-signal ratio. Using daily liq-
uidity measures, we construct a single index of the various nancial measures
of liquidity. We nd that there is a common factor in liquidity as measured
by our high frequency estimates, and that this common factor is priced by
the market.

    Brennan and Subrahmanyam (2002) study the relationship between monthly returns
and measures of illiquidity obtained from intraday returns. They nd that liquidity is
signi cant for asset returns, even after accounting for the Fama-French factors (market
return, size, value) as well as the stock price level. Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) also
  nd that marketwide liquidity risk, measured at the daily frequency, is a state variable
important for asset pricing: in their sample, the average return on stocks with high loadings
on the liquidity factor is 7.5% higher than on those with low loadings, after adjusting for
exposures to the three Fama-French factors plus momentum.
