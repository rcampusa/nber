                                          ABSTRACT

The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre resulted in the looting, burning, and leveling of 35 square blocks
of a once-thriving Black neighborhood. Not only did this lead to severe economic loss, but the
massacre also sent a warning to Black individuals across the country that similar events were
possible in their communities. We examine the economic consequences of the massacre for Black
populations in Tulsa and across the United States. We find that for the Black population of Tulsa,
in the two decades that followed, the massacre led to declines in home ownership and
occupational status. Outside of Tulsa, we find that the massacre also reduced home ownership.
These effects were strongest in communities that were more exposed to newspaper coverage of
the massacre or communities that, like Tulsa, had high levels of racial segregation. Examining
effects after 1940, we find that the direct negative effects of the massacre on the home ownership
of Black Tulsans, as well as the spillover effects working through newspaper coverage, persist
and actually widen in the second half of the 20th Century.

1. Introduction

Between May 31 and June 1, 1921, Tulsa experienced one of the largest and worst incidents

of racial violence, murder, and destruction in postbellum U.S. history. During the course of

the massacre, 35 square blocks of the thriving Black community were completely destroyed.

Black people were taken to internment centers at gunpoint. Their homes and businesses were

looted and then set on fire. The vibrant Black community of Greenwood, Tulsa which was once

hailed as "Black Wall Street," had been burned to the ground. Figure 1 provides photographs of

Greenwood prior to, during, and after the Massacre. These images help make clear the extent

of the damage and loss from the event. Losses are estimated to be between $32,560,722 and

$47,376,836 in 2020 USD ($2,212,600 and $3,219,400 in 1921 USD).1

   While there were many other incidents of racial violence during this time period, the Tulsa

Massacre2 of 1921 was unique for both the level of property damage and the affluence of the

targeted Black community. A common narrative is that the event had long-term and widespread

effects on Black people. If the riot had not occurred, "Black Wall Street" would have been an

example of the achievement and economic success that was possible for other Black people across

the country. Instead, the massacre sounded a warning of what would happen if other Black

communities became too successful. The view that the Tulsa massacre had such lasting effects,

was described by State Senator Maxine Horner in the 2001 Report on the Massacre. She writes that

those who had been through the Tulsa Massacre "emerged haunted as a result of that experience.

The way they relate to their children and grandchildren and the world around them is not how

they may have related had it not been for that experience. If a people have been terrorized to the
   1 We arrive at this range using data on insurance claims amounts from the Oklahoma Historical Society's (OHS)

Tulsa Race Riot Commission Collection combined with Red Cross reports of the number of residential buildings and
businesses destroyed.
  The claims for damages to residential buildings generally range from $22,074 to $29,432 ($1,500 to $2,000 in 1921
USD), and the Red Cross reports 1,256 destroyed homes. We multiply the damage amount by the number of houses to
arrive at $27,724,944 to $36,966,592 in residential damage ($1,884,000 to $2,512,000 in 1921 USD). Following the same
procedure, there were 529 looted homes with personal property claims generally ranging from $5,886 to $8,830 ($400
to $600 in 1921 USD), giving $3,113,694 to $4,671,070 in property damages ($211,600 to $317,400 in 1921 USD). There
were 39 destroyed businesses with damage claims ranging from $44,148 to $147,160 ($3,000 to $10,000 in 1921 USD),
giving $1,721,772 to $5,739,240 in business damages ($117,000 to $390,000 in 1921 USD).
  The total amount of claims reported in the OHS records is $21,643,064 ($1,470,712 in 1921 USD). This amount is
lower than our finding since we take into account the total number of buildings damaged (as reported by the Red
Cross), even when a claim was not filed. Additionally, these are estimates of insurance claims, not necessarily the
worth of the property. There are several instances where the property worth is listed along with the claim amount,
and in these instances the claim amount is usually about half of the original worth of the property.
   2 While the Tulsa Race Massacre was commonly called a `Race Riot', this terminology is misleading. The 1921

Centennial Commission (Krehbiel, 2018) changed the official designation to `Massacre' in 2018 and we use the term
`Massacre' in this paper in line with the Commission's decision.

degree that North Tulsa survivors and descendants were, it could be expected that they would

not make themselves noticed or be noticed by the group that terrorized them in the first place."

(Horner, 2001, p. 177).

   While there are many other incidents of racial violence that are worth investigating for the

sake of understanding the short and long-run effects of racial violence,3 the Tulsa Massacre

was exceptional historically and marked a turning point in expectations and beliefs about racial

violence in the United States. As Lisa Cook (2014, p. 235) puts it, ". . . before 1921 potential

victims implicitly believed that, if implored, the federal government would act. The response to

the Tulsa riot was considered a major policy shift in favor of nonintervention by federal and state

governments. Accounts of the Tulsa riot suggest that many at the time believed that government

violence against Black communities (p. 26) as well as Cook (2014) for tables and context on mob violence and violent
events from 1870­1940 (pp. 222­227).



                                                          2
failed at all levels, and that this was a turning point in federal policy and national practice related

to property-rights protection, and that the country was likely headed towards racial warfare."

   In addition to being historically significant, the Tulsa Massacre is particularly well suited for

focused empirical investigation given the historical context and data available. The Greenwood

area of Tulsa was known for its affluence. Prior to the Massacre, the area had 191 businesses

(including solo-practice lawyers and doctors), a library, two schools, and a hospital. During the

Massacre, over one thousand houses were burned and thousands of Black people were held in

internment centers. While there are death certificates for thirty-nine victims, estimates for those

killed in the event range up to 300.

   Despite the historical importance of this event, there is little empirical evidence on its effects

in the short- or long-run. While previous empirical work has highlighted important dynamics

between racial violence, segregation, innovative activity, and property values (e.g., Collins and

Margo, 2004, 2007, Cook, 2014, Cook, Logan and Parman, 2018), our study adds to existing

knowledge by providing an in-depth empirical analysis of the effects of one particularly important

event. Historical narratives and stories suggest that the Massacre had severe consequences for

the Black community of Tulsa. What were the consequences of the massacre for those whose

businesses and homes were looted and destroyed? How did they cope with the loss? What

were the longer-term effects for them and their descendants? Were the consequences of the

massacre different for those that owned homes or businesses relative to those that did not? Were

the consequences different for those who had relatives or neighbors who were killed during the

massacre? These are the questions that our study seeks to empirically examine.

   In addition to the potential direct impacts on those who experienced the massacre, other

Black communities in the state, region, or country, may have also been affected. The Greenwood

neighborhood of Tulsa that was looted and destroyed was economically vibrant, dynamic, and

affluent; it provided one of the best examples of Black entrepreneurship and success in the early

twentieth century. The 1921 massacre put an abrupt end to this, destroying nearly all of the

community's wealth and assets. Given the widespread media coverage of the massacre at the

time, it is possible that this affected the expectations, aspirations, and economic decisions of

Black entrepreneurs, business owners, and even homeowners in other parts of the state or even

country.

   If one believed there was a very real chance of a similar race riot occurring in one's own


                                                  3
community, then the incentives to invest in a business or purchase a home may have been

significantly reduced. These possible shifts in incentives raise a larger set of questions. Did the

Tulsa race massacre have an effect on Black entrepreneurship and home ownership in other parts

of the United States? If there are such spillover effects of the massacre to other communities, how

far-reaching were they? Were the effects weaker in communities that were more geographically

distant or located in other regions or states?

   We make progress on these questions by tracing the effects of the Tulsa Massacre. We begin

by examining the short- and medium-run effects of the massacre on the home ownership and

occupational status of Black Tulsans. We examine a panel that has three dimensions: racial group

(white, Black, and other), a city or county, and a Census year (initially 1910, 1920, 1930 and

1940). We estimate effects using a triple-difference design, where the coefficient of interest is for

an interaction between a post-massacre indicator, an indicator for the racial group being Black

individuals, and an indicator for Tulsa being the county of residence. In the specifications, we

control for county-race, county-year, and race-year fixed effects. Thus, the estimates effectively

compare Black people to white people, within Tulsa county versus elsewhere, before versus after

the 1921 Massacre.

   We estimate a version of the equation that is at the individual-level but restricted to Tulsa and

a set of control cities that have a 1920 total population greater than 25,000 and a Black population

greater than 1,000 individuals, are located within 400 miles of Tulsa, and are in one of the states

that border Oklahoma (Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Texas). We also estimate a version of

the equation using weighted least squares where the unit of observation is a racial group, county

and census year. Regardless of which specification we use, we find consistent evidence that the

Massacre is associated with a sizeable decline in home ownership and lower average occupational

status. The estimates are large in magnitude and highly significant. For example, we estimate that

the massacre resulted in a decline in the likelihood of home ownership among male household

heads of 4.2 percentage points, which can be compared to a baseline of 30 percent among Black

Tulsans in 1920, just prior to the massacre.

   We then turn to the question of whether the massacre also affected Black communities in

other parts of the country. We test whether we observe reduced rates of home ownership and

lower occupational status in Black communities that received greater exposure to the massacre

through newspaper articles published at the time of the event. Greater newspaper coverage


                                                 4
would mean that the warning the massacre offered would have been more extensively and clearly

communicated, particularly given that a sizeable portion of the articles described the massacre as

justified, a blessing in disguise and for the greater good of the community. We also test whether

we find evidence of effects in communities with a high level of racial segregation like Tulsa.

In counties with segregated Black neighborhoods, spatial targeting, looting, and destruction of

Black-owned buildings was possible.

   We find evidence of spillover effects along both information and segregation dimensions that

are in the same direction as the direct effects and most clearly observed in home ownership.

Both estimates are sizeable, although the newspaper spillover effects are less precisely estimated

compared to the segregation spillover effects. For example, the estimated spillover effect for Black

individuals in the state with the greatest newspaper exposure is about 75% the size of the direct

effect experienced by Black Tulsans. For those in the least exposed state, there is no spillover effect.

The findings are consistent with the Massacre being a warning about the potential destruction of

wealth, which in turn affected the decision to invest in assets like homes.

   We then turn to an examination of the longer-run dynamics of the effects of the massacre. For

home ownership, we are able to extend the period of analysis to 2000 and estimate longer-term

consequences. We find that the direct effects of the massacre on Black Tulsans persist and actually

increase over time. We estimate the effect of the massacre on home ownership of Black Tulsans in

2000 to be over twice the magnitude of the effect in 1940. Similarly, we find that the newspaper

spillover effect persists past 1940 and increases in size and precision. The estimated effect in 2000

is over 60% the magnitude in 1940. By contrast, we find that the segregation spillovers do not

persist, instead dying out over time and approaching zero by 2000.

   Our findings add to the rich existing literature on the history of race, coercion, violence, and

unrest in the United States. Cook (2014) studies the effects of race riots and lynchings between

1870 and 1940 and finds that these forms of violence and insecurity reduced patenting by Black

people by more than 15% annually from 1882­1940. Williams (2018) estimates the county-level

relationship between lynchings from 1882­1930 and lower rates of voter registration among Black

people today. Acharya, Blackwell and Sen (2016) study the lasting consequences of slavery on

racial and political attitudes of white people today. Counties with more slavery in the past

are more racist today, have strong support for the Republican Party, and are more likely to

oppose policies that provide support for Black people, such as affirmative action. Logan (2019)


                                                   5
documents a relationship between violence against Black politicians and declines in tax revenues

between 1870 and 1880. Collins and Margo (2004, 2007) study the effects of the race riots of

the late 1960s. The authors find that the riots had a negative and persistent effect on Black

incomes, employment, and property values. Ample additional research, some outside the US

context, speaks to the effects of exposure to violence and exploitation on outcomes ranging

from: distrust (Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011, Alsan and Wanamaker, 2018, Archibong and Obikili,

2020), political participation and political attitudes (Bautista, 2015), and views about freedom of

expression (Garcia Ponce and Wantchekon, 2011).

   Our findings also contribute to the existing literature within economics that studies the histor-

ical determinants, be they political, social, economic, or institutional, of the economic success of

Black people in during the late-19th and 20th Centuries (e.g., Naidu, 2012, Hornbeck and Naidu,

2014, Logan and Parman, 2018, Clarke, 2019, Derenoncourt, 2019, Aneja and Xu, 2020). Lastly,

our work also adds to descriptive accounts of the Tulsa Massacre and its consequences (e.g.,

Halliburton, 1972, Horner, 2001, Messer, 2011, Messer, Shriver and Adams, 2018). Our analysis

builds on these accounts and provides estimates of the general effects of the Massacre, including

spillovers effects to all parts of the country.


2. Tulsa Prior to the Massacre

Tulsa experienced an oil boom in the 1910's due to Glenn Pool, which was known as the "richest

small oil field in the world" (Ellsworth, 2001). By 1921, Tulsa was home to more than 400 different

oil and gas companies, 4 different railroads, and even a commercial airport (Ellsworth, 2001).

Excitement about the prospects of oil and broader economic opportunity meant that Tulsa's

population boomed between 1910 and 1920. To illustrate this empirically, we examine county

population data from the 1910 to 1940 US censuses. Tulsa county more than tripled in population

size from around 35,000 to 109,000 residents between 1910 and 1920.

   To put into context the population boom in Tulsa before the Massacre, consider the 20 counties

in the US with the highest population growth from 1910­1920. This list, which is reported in

Appendix Table A13, shows that Tulsa ranks ninth on the list. Many of the boom towns on this

list are in Oklahoma and Texas, which were also experiencing population growth due to interest

in oil.



                                                  6
Figure 2: Map of Tulsa City and Greenwood, shown in dark gray. Source: Tulsa Race Riot: A
Report by the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921.



  When Oklahoma was established as a state in 1907, the area was seen as an opportunity

for Black people seeking freedom from Southern oppression (Ross, 2001).          In fact, of the

approximately 50 "all-Black towns" (i.e., municipalities established for or by a predominantly

Black population), more than 20 were located in Oklahoma (Ross, 2001). Despite the promising

setting, the first bill passed after Oklahoma statehood was "Senate Bill One," which aggressively

segregated the state. The Greenwood neighborhood in Tulsa and its vastly different racial makeup

from the rest of Tulsa was a mechanical consequence of these strict Jim Crow laws.

  The location of the Greenwood neighborhood within Tulsa is shown in Figure 2. The neigh-

borhood boasted 191 businesses before the Massacre. There were doctors, dentists, lawyers as

well as two newspaper offices. Residents had access to a public library, two schools, and a

hospital. The economic success of a number of Black entrepreneurs such as Loula and John

Williams (owners of the Dreamland Theater), O.W. Gurley (owner of the Gurley Hotel), and J.B.


                                               7
Stradford (owner of the 54-room Stradford Hotel) added to the view of Tulsa as the "Black Wall

Street." However, as Ellsworth (2001) points out, most Black-owned businesses were more modest

than hotels or theaters, such as many small barber shops and groceries, and, moreover, "the vast

majority of Greenwood's adults were neither businessmen nor businesswomen, but worked long

hours, under trying conditions, for white employers" (p. 43). Legally barred from oil industry

jobs and most manufacturing facilities, Black Tulsans were largely unable to take up many of the

professions that their white counterparts could during the county's oil boom (Ellsworth, 2001).

   About a third of the Greenwood population lived in servant's quarters of white Tulsa (Madi-

gan, 2001). Doormen and shoeshine boys would pick up tips of ten dollars per day (despite

making five dollars per week). The city's tight segregation laws meant that money earned in the

white downtown area was then spent in Greenwood (Clark, 2020).

   Exploring the census data on segregation and occupation categories provides evidence consis-

tent with descriptive accounts of a highly segregated Tulsa. We use Logan and Parman's (2017a)

measure of racial similarity of neighbors to examine how Tulsa's segregation compared to other

counties in the United States at the time. The segregation of Tulsa is shown in Figure 3, which

reports the distribution of county-level segregation across the United States in 1920. Tulsa's level

of segregation is indicated by the vertical line. It is clear that consistent with descriptive accounts,

Tulsa was one of the most segregated counties in the country.4

   This high level of segregation is an important aspect of Tulsa that facilitated the events that

followed. Because there was a Black neighborhood, where commercial buildings and homes were

located, it was feasible to target Black-owned property and buildings. Relative to a setting of

integration, it was relatively easy to know which properties were Black-owned and which were

white-owned. In addition, integration meant there was less worry that if one set a structure

on fire it might spread to the neighboring structure. In the segregated setting of Tulsa, the

neighboring structure was almost certainly also Black-owned. The link between segregation and

ease of identifying Black-owned buildings has important implications for the extent to which

Black communities might be worried about similar events happening in their city. We might

expect that the more spatially segregated a community was, the more feasible and likely an event
  4 Tulsa'shigh level of segregation is particularly noteworthy given our interest in home ownership. Logan and
Parman (2017b) have shown that during this period, in the cross-section, there is a negative relationship between
segregation and homeownership for Black and white households. We return to the relationship between the Massacre,
segregation, and home ownership below.

          Figure 3: Segregation in Tulsa County compared to other U.S. counties in 1920



like the Tulsa Massacre might be. This is something that we explore in our empirical analysis.

   Although the extent of segregation within Tulsa was exceptional, in other dimensions the Black

population of Tulsa was not very different from other Black communities across the country.

Figure 4 reports the same histogram as in Figure 3 but for eight measures of the Black population

of Tulsa.5 In each of these dimensions, Tulsa appears more typical. If one restricts the comparison

to other counties that are also in the segregated U.S. South, the same picture emerges (see

Appendix Figure A18). The one exception is the proportion of individuals who are in white

collar occupations. Though still low, at approximately 1.5%, the share of Tulsa's Black population

with white collar occupations was much higher than nearly every other county. This may be an

important factor behind the perception of Tulsa as the "Black Wall Street."

   We probe the racial differences within Tulsa further by examining the differences between the

white and Black population of Tulsa. Figure 5 reports a series of graphs that have the value of the

characteristic of the white population on the x-axis and of the Black population on the y -axis.6

Each graph also reports the 45-degree line which indicate Black-white equality for the dimension

of interest. Tulsa is denoted by a solid red circle, while all other counties are denoted by an

least 5% Black population in the 1920 Census.
   6 The analogous figure but with the comparison counties restricted to those that are also in the segregated U.S.

opaque gray circle. The figures show clearly that, within a county, Black populations tended to

have smaller populations, lower likelihood of home ownership, less white collar employment,

lower average occupational status, and a higher proportion of individuals participating in the

labor force. To understand how typical the Black-white differences in Tulsa were, we examine

the location of Tulsa, particularly its distance to the 45-degree line, relative to the other counties.

From the figures it is clear that Tulsa was not an extreme outlier.

   The data suggest that Black Tulsa was a success story. Black wealth, as measured by the

likelihood of home ownership, was high at 30%. Average occupational status was also high, with

a relatively high proportion of population engaged in white collar jobs. However, the data also

suggest that there were many other counties in the U.S., and even in the segregated South, that

were similarly successful. This is also true when looking at the differences between the relative

success of the white and Black populations. What appears most exceptional about Tulsa was not

the absolute level of prosperity of the Black community ­ there were other communities within

the country that were similar ­ but the level of segregation in the county.

   The existence of many other prosperous Black communities is particularly important for

potential spillover effects. At the time and today, a common perception was that an important

determinant of the Massacre was the economic success of the Black population in a community

relative to its white population. For example, a 1921 NAACP report wrote that "[t]he negro in

Oklahoma has shared in the sudden prosperity that has come to many of his white brothers, and

there are some colored men there who are wealthy. This fact has caused a bitter resentment on

the part of the lower order of white people, who feel that these colored men [. . . ] are exceedingly

presumptuous in achieving greater economic prosperity than they who are members of a divinely

superior race." Knowledge of the events of the Tulsa Massacre may have been particularly salient

for Black people living in counties that were similarly prosperous to Tulsa. Given that Tulsa

was comparable to other counties in terms of both the absolute level of economic prosperity of

the Black community and its level of relative prosperity relative to the white population, a large

proportion of the Black population in other parts of the United States may have felt that their

communities were also susceptible to the same events.


3. The 1921 Race Massacre

On May 31, 1921, Dick Rowland, a Black man, was accused of assaulting a white woman named

Sarah Page. Rowland was a shoe-shiner who would take an elevator, operated by Page, to use a

restroom in a nearby building since the shine parlor where he worked had no restrooms for Black


                                                 11
people (Ellsworth, 2001). There is no record as to what Sarah Page initially said to police who

had interviewed her (Ellsworth, 2001).

   As Rowland was held at the courthouse, crowds of white people showed up outside. Members

of the Black community grew concerned that the white mob might try to lynch Rowland. People

were skeptical of law enforcement's ability to keep defendants safe, as a mob had successfully

taken a man from the courthouse and lynched him in 1920.7 A confrontation in the crowd

between Black and white Tulsans led to mob violence against the Black community. Motivated in

part by fear that "the color line" was being erased, armed white people broke into Black homes

and businesses (Ellsworth, 2001). These white Tulsans then looted homes and businesses before

setting them on fire with oil-rags and torches.8 As many as five-hundred white men and boys

were sworn-in by police officers as "Special Deputies" during the riot who then participated in

burning homes (Ellsworth, 2001).

   Thousands of Black Tulsans were taken to internment centers at gunpoint. They were detained

during the Massacre in makeshift internment centers at the Convention Hall, the fairgrounds, and

a baseball park (Goble, 2001, Ellsworth, 2001). Even after the restoration of order it was official

policy to only release a Black detainee upon the application of a white person (Goble, 2001). The

Frissell Memorial Hospital, the only hospital that served Black people, burned down, meaning

that Black victims with injuries went untreated in internment centers or were eventually treated

in a converted basement of a white hospital (Morningside Hostpital). While there are 39 deaths

confirmed by death certificates, the Red Cross estimates as many as 300 deaths (Snow, 2001,

Brooks and Witten, 2001). One hundred years later, the city of Tulsa still plans to search for mass

graves.9

   In terms of property damage, 1,256 homes were burned down, leaving thousands homeless

(Goble, 2001). In all, 35 square blocks of the Black community were completely destroyed. About

$25 million (in 2020 dollars) of property damage was estimated using Tulsa Real Estate Exchange

Commission records, claims from Tulsa City Commission meetings, and court cases (O'Dell,
   7 This was the Nida-Benton incident, described by Ellsworth (2001). Ten days before riot, the media conflated crime
rates in Tulsa with pointed commentary on Black men and white women. As (Ellsworth, 2001, p. 55) puts it: "[i]n
a lengthy, front-page article concerning the ongoing investigation of the police department, not only did racial issues
suddenly come to the foreground, but more importantly, they did so in a manner that featured the highly explosive
subject of relations between black men and white women."
    8 Some account also mention gunshots and the dropping of incendiaries from airplanes.
    9 Excavation at Oaklawn Cemetery was scheduled to begin in April 2020, but has been postponed due to COVID-19

(Brown, 2020, Trotter, 2020).

2001). This is surely an underestimate of actual loses since not all residents took insurance

companies or the city to court. Professor Alicia Odewale estimates financial losses at $50­100

million (Chang, 2019). Black residents who filed insurance claims were never compensated since

companies, as it is was standard in their contracts, were not liable for loss caused by "riot".10

The Red Cross remained in Tulsa for months to provide relief. Despite the Red Cross's enormous

relief efforts, Ellsworth (2001) writes that "thousands of black Tulsans were forced to spend the

winter of 1921­22 living in tents. Others simply left. They had had enough of Tulsa, Oklahoma"

(pp. 88­89).

   Months later, in the autumn of 1921, the Tulsa World ran an article saying "Grand Jury

Blames Negroes for Inciting Race Rioting: Whites Clearly Exonerated" (Brophy, 2001). That

same autumn, Dick Rowland's case was dismissed because Sarah Page failed to appear in court

(Brophy, 2001). For decades after 1921, Tulsa and Oklahoma possessed "historical amnesia" when

it came to the Massacre, leaving it out of textbooks and newspapers.11 The following words of

Oklahoma Governor James B. A. Robertson seemed to dictate how the Massacre was approached:

"riots are unfortunate affairs at all times and the less said about them the better for all concerned."

See Appendix Figure A15 for the full letter from which the quote is taken.

   While our analysis estimates average effects of the Massacre, each person behind the aggregate

numbers has their own story and experience. Concrete accounts of experiences during the

massacre were collected in January and February 1999, by the Tulsa World and the Oklahoma

Eagle newspapers, which put out calls requesting information on the 1921 Massacre from its

readers. More than 150 people called in with family stories, eye witness accounts, and more.

These accounts were then converted to draft write-ups of telephone conversations. Images of the

text from some of these conversations, which are from the Oklahoma Historical Society's Tulsa

Race Riot Commission Collection, are shown in Appendix Figure A16.

   The four accounts shown in Appendix Figure A16, although brief, provide rich context to the

experiences of those who experienced the Massacre. They describe a man who, after hearing of

the riot, "tore down the stairs" to his family's apartment and "stationed himself with a shotgun at
  10 The cases against insurance companies were inert for years and then dismissed in 1937 (Brophy, 2001). See

Appendix Figure A14 for the "riot exclusion clause" language in contracts, as found in court documents at the
Oklahoma Historical Society.
  11 Even the Tulsa Tribune's "Fifteen Years Ago" feature failed to mention the Massacre on its 15 year anniversary. It

was "as if the greatest catastrophe in the city's history simply had not happened at all" (Franklin and Ellsworth, 2001,
p. 26).

the top" (no. 25); firemen in Greenwood who were forced to "let it burn by armed white civilians"

and who witnessed "two flat bed trucks with bodies" (no. 71); a private trash hauler who was

forced to transport "six bodies to a hole. . . in Oaklawn Cemetery" (no. 76); and a man"who had

been in the riot and shot many Blacks. . . He said hundreds of them were buried under the railroad.

He was proud of this and said he would do it again." (no. 37).


4. Consequences of the Massacre

Our analysis examines a number of consequences of the Massacre. The most obvious consequence

is home ownership. Nearly every Black-owned business or home was looted and then burned.

The locations of the destroyed buildings are shown in Figure 6 for Tulsa as a whole (Figure 6a)

and for the neighborhood of Greenwood in particular (Figure 6b). It is clear that the destruction

was concentrated within the Black neighborhood of Greenwood and that the destruction was

extensive with full city blocks being burned to the ground. The high rate of segregation in Tulsa

(which is shown in Figure 3) made it easy to target Black-owned buildings and reduced the risk

of nearby white-owned buildings also accidentally catching fire.

  Despite years of litigation, no compensation, either from insurance companies or the gov-

ernment, was received by any of the victims. Thus, the Massacre resulted in the permanent

destruction of assets, buildings, and capital. Therefore, we expect that the massacre may have

resulted in a decrease in home ownership, as well as occupational downgrading.

  Beyond the direct effect of the Massacre for those who experienced it, we also expect that

the event may have had effects on Black communities outside of Tulsa. In the aftermath of

the Massacre, it became clear that such an event could easily occur again. The narrative that

emerged from those in positions of power was that the blame for the Massacre fell squarely on

the shoulders of the Black community and that they were to blame for the death and destruction.

There was no regret or remorse for the events that had occurred. The mayor of Tulsa, T.D. Evans,

in a statement to city commissioners on June 14 made clear his views that the Black community

was to blame: "Let the blame for the Negro uprising lie right where it belongs ­ on those who

armed negroes and their followers who started this trouble and who instigated it. . . Any person

who seeks to put half the blame on the white people are wrong and should be told so in no

uncertain terms." He continued, arguing that "it was good generalship to let the destruction

come to that section where the trouble hatched up. . . All regret the wrongs that fell upon the

innocent Negroes [but] the fortunes of war fall upon the innocent as well as the guilty." (Hirsch,

2002, pp. 126­127).

   Ironically, the only blame that was placed on white individuals was to ask why whites in

positions of power allowed the Black community to exist in the first place. An editorial titled

"It Must Not Be Again," published in the Tulsa Tribune on June 4, 1921, argued that the area

must never be allowed in Tulsa again: "Such a district as the old "Nig***town" must never be

allowed in Tulsa again. It was a cesspool of inquiry and corruption. . . In this old "Nig***town"

were a lot of bad nig***s and a bad nig*** is about the lowest thing that walks on two feet." The

article goes on to ask why the community was not eradicated earlier and to blame the Police

Commissioner for not doing so. "Well, the bad nig***s started it. The public would now like to

know: why wasn't it prevented? Why were these nig***s not made to feel the force of law and

made to respect the law?" (Titcomb, 1921)

   This same narrative appeared in newspapers across the country. Greenwood was described

as a cesspool that should never have existed and the Massacre as a welcome event that made

Tulsa better off. As an example, The Fresno Morning Republican, in a July 18, 1921 article titled

"The Tulsa Crime Belt" wrote "The city administration is being asked why it permitted such

places as "Nig***town" dives to exist. The city administration has created a special committee

of prominent citizens to help cover the ash-covered acres in a much needed warehouse district

which would give the land greater value and with the money from which the negroes might buy

a better residential subdivision which might be carefully plotted and made sanitary and parked."

The article continues, "The cause of the Tulsa race riot was the cause that is common to all race

riots plus a city too busy building to give thought or care to the spawning pools of crime. . . Most

such disasters bring their resultant good. Tulsa teaches a lesson to other cities. Don't neglect the

"over there." Teach the "over there" to live more like the "over here." It is that kind of living

that cultivates understanding and levels the rough prejudices into a smoother friendliness." (The

Fresno Morning Republican, 1921).

   To the Black population outside of Tulsa, the message was clear. Rather than regretting the

destruction of Greenwood, authorities and the white population in general lamented the fact that

it existed in the first place and felt that the Massacre resulted in a better city. This sent a clear

message to Black populations across the country that an event like the Tulsa Massacre was easily

possible in their community.

Figure 7: Fraction of Newspapers that Contain the Word `Tulsa' on the Front Page, June 1­4, 1921



   There is a question of the extent to which this message would have travelled beyond Oklahoma.

While our statistical analysis tests for this explicitly, here we provide some preliminary evidence

of the media coverage of the Massacre. Examining all available digitized newspapers from

the days immediately following the Massacre (June 1­4, 1921), we calculate the proportion of

newspapers that mention `Tulsa' on their front page.12 This proportion is shown in Figure 7.

From the map, it is clear that for much of the country more than half of the newspaper editions

mentioned the Tulsa Massacre on their front cover. Using coverage within Oklahoma as a baseline,

we see that most states had coverage that was at least as extensive as Oklahoma's. In addition,

this coverage was not superficial. The massacre often comprised nearly all of the content on the

front page. An example is provided in Appendix Figure A17, which shows the front page of

the The Selma Times-Journal from June 21, 1921, which featured eight articles about the Tulsa

Massacre. In all, there appears to have been immediate, widespread, and significant coverage of

the event.

   Another potential consequence that we consider is the effect of the event on the occupation of

the victims. To see how this could happen, consider the case of Pressley and Mable Little (Hirsch,
   12 The data are from newspapers.com. Although the source does not contain complete nor representative coverage of

all newspapers, the sample does provide some sense of the extent to which the news of the Tulsa Massacre immediately
spread across the country.

2002, pp. 145­147). Prior to the Massacre, Mabel had owned a beauty salon, while Pressley ran

a cafe. The couple also owned their own home, two rental properties, and a Model T Ford. All

were destroyed during the Massacre. The couple fled their home after the first night of looting

and destruction. After fleeing North, they were intercepted by the National Guard and brought

back against their will to Tulsa. After the Massacre, the couple, with fifty dollars to their name,

built a three-room shack without electricity, running water, or gas. To survive, Pressley, the once

entrepreneur and landlord, did manual labor and carpentry to survive until his death three years

later.


5. Data and Descriptive Analysis

We now turn to an overview of the primary outcomes of interest in our analysis. The finer details

of each measure are provided in the Appendix. The measures are constructed using the complete

count U.S. census microdata from 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940 (Minnesota Population Center, 2019).

   Our primary variable of interest is home ownership. The census collected information on

whether the home where the enumeration was taking place was owned or rented. A home

is classified as owned if it is owned by one of its inhabitants. Since people unrelated to the

household head may also be living in a home as roomers, boarders, lodgers, or employees, we

construct two measures of home ownership. The first variable measures the extent to which a

household head owns the home. For each individual in the sample, we code a respondent-level

indicator that equals one if the home is owned and the respondent is the household head (who we

presume is likely to be the home owner). As such, the variable that we construct is conceptually

equivalent to asking: "Is your home owned and are you the household head?".

   While this measure is suitable for a sample of men, who tend to be the household heads, it is

problematic when the sample includes women. Therefore, we also construct a second measure

of home ownership which doesn't depend on a respondent's status as the household head. The

variable measures family home ownership by asking if the home is owned and the household

head (assumed home owner) is a family member of the respondent. Thus, the variable that we

construct is conceptually equivalent to asking: "Is your home owned by a family member that

you live with?".

   We are also interested in income. Because the census does not record income directly, it must be

proxied by an individual's reported occupation. Occupations have been assigned income values

                                                18
which are based on "the median total income (in hundreds of 1950 dollars) of all persons with that

particular occupation in 1950."13 We take the natural log of the income measure since this makes

the variable less skewed (and more normally distributed) than the raw income measure. We also

construct a measure for whether an individual reports a professional or technical occupation,

which we call "white collar" occupations. Further details on these variables can be found in

Appendix A1.

  A natural first step in examining the consequences of the Massacre is to consider the trajectory

of the Black population of Tulsa over time. This is shown in Figure 8, which reports the evolution

of each of the outcomes of interest for Tulsa and other counties in the United States from 1910­

1940. The first four graphs report patterns for the Black population of Tulsa. As shown, the

change over time appears to be roughly similar in Tulsa relative to other counties. Looking at the

following four graphs, which are for the white populations of Tulsa, there is some indication that

the trajectory of home ownership, occupation score, and white collar share is increasing faster in

Tulsa than in other counties.


6. Empirical Analysis of the Short and Medium-Term Effects of the Massacre, 1910­
   1940

A. Estimates using comparison cities

We begin our empirical analysis by first studying the direct effects of the Massacre on Black

inhabitants of Tulsa by using a set of comparison cities that have a similar geography and

population to Tulsa. We pool unlinked individuals living in Tulsa and the comparison cities

from1910 to 1940 and analyze home ownership and occupational earnings.

  We estimate a difference-in-difference-in-differences specification, where we compare out-

comes of Black Tulsans with control groups for which the massacre should have no direct effect:

white Tulsans and Black and white individuals in comparison cities. The identifying assumption

of our DDD approach is that there exist no changes, contemporaneous to the effects of the

massacre, to black-white trends between Tulsa and the other cities.

  Here, we begin by comparing Tulsa to a set of fourteen comparison cities. Specifically, the

comparison cities are all cities that have a 1920 population greater than 25,000 and a Black

   Our estimating equation is given by:

and t census years (1910, 1920, 1930 and 1940). yijrt is an outcome of interest measured for

standard errors at the city level.

   Our interest is in the coefficients on the interaction term 1 , which captures the difference in the

outcome of interest for Black Tulsans after the 1921 Massacre. The relevant double interactions are

absorbed by the fixed effects that are also included in the specification, which include race-year

fixed effects rt , city-year fixed effects jt , and city-race fixed effects jr .

   The estimates of equation (1) are reported in Table 1. Due to the fact that men were the primary

home owners and income earners at the time, our baseline analysis focuses on a sample of men

only. We report additional estimates using a sample that includes both men and women in Table 2.

Column 1 reports estimates where the sample is all household heads and the dependent variable

is an indicator that equals one if the household head reports owning their home. Column 2 reports

estimates that also examine home ownership but looks at all individuals, not only household

heads. The dependent variable in this specification is an indicator that equals one if the home

in which the individual lives is owned by someone in their family. For both outcomes and both

samples, we find evidence that the massacre resulted in a statistically significant decrease in home

ownership. Because we report marginal effects, the reported coefficients indicate the estimated

effects (evaluated at the means of the relevant variables). According to the sample of men (Table

1), the Tulsa Massacre is associated with a decline in the likelihood of home ownership of 4.5

percentage points for household heads. This can be compared to the home ownership rate of

Black individuals in Tulsa in 1920, which was 31.6 percent. The massacre reduced the rate of

individuals living in a home owned by a family member by 6.3 percentage points, which is

relative to a baseline rate of 27.5 percent among Black Tulsans in 1920.

  Columns 3 and 4 report estimates that provide evidence on the effect of the massacre on

occupational status. In Column 3, we examine the natural log of the occupation score among

all individuals who are in the labor force and have a valid occupation code. In Column 4,

we examine all individuals who are in the labor force and report a valid occupation code and

examine an indicator variable that equals one if an individual is employed in a profession or

technical position, which we call a white collar occupation. The estimates provide evidence that

the Massacre led to a decline in occupational status ­ i.e., occupational downgrading ­ for Black

Tulsans. This decline is consistent with historical accounts of former professionals, after losing

their business, having to enter into manual occupations in order to survive economically following

the Massacre.

  We probe the robustness of our occupation findings by using alternative measures of

occupation-based income. A detailed description of the construction of each alternative measure

is provided in the Appendix. The estimates for the male sample are reported in Table 3. Across all

four measures, we see consistent evidence of occupational downgrading among the Black male

The effects are sizeable in magnitude and can be compared to the mean values for Black Tulsans

in 1920, which are reported in the final row of the table.


B. National estimates without spillovers

The next step in our analysis examines variation across all counties in the United States. We

begin by first considering the case without spatial spillovers to Black populations outside of

Tulsa. While the assumption of no spillovers is likely unrealistic, it provides a useful benchmark

against which to compare our estimates that allow for spillovers. If the spillover effects are of

the same sign as the direct effects, then not accounting for them will tend to bias the estimated

direct effects towards zero since the observations that we compare to the treated group are also

affected, resulting in a smaller difference between the two groups. As we will see, our estimates

are consistent with this being the case.

   In our first specification, we continue to estimate a standard diff-in-diff-in-diff regression

where we compare individuals who are living in Tulsa, before and after the Massacre, and who

are white or Black. While we could continue to estimate the regression at the individual-level as

above, for computational efficiency, we aggregate the data and perform the analysis at the county,

race, and census year level using weighted least square. Our estimating equation is as follows:

                                              T ulsa
                    ycrt = rt + ct + cr + 1 (Ic         Black
                                                     × Ir     × ItP ost ) + X crt  + crt ,                         (2)

where c denotes U.S. counties, r race (Black, white, or other), and t census years (1910­1940).15

The dependent variable, ycrt , is the group mean of one of our outcomes of interest discussed
        T ulsa is an indicator that equals one if county c is Tulsa, I Black is an indicator that equals
above. Ic                                                             r
                                                                         P ost is an indicator that
one if the race of the aggregated observation is Black individuals, and It

equals one if decade t is after 1920. Our interest is in the coefficients on the interaction term 1 ,

which capture the difference in the outcome of interest for Black Tulsans after the 1921 Massacre.

The relevant double interactions are absorbed by the fixed effects that are also included in the

specification, which include decade-race fixed effects rt , decade-county fixed effects ct , and

county-race fixed effects cr . The equation also includes a vector of covariates denoted by X crt .

These covariates include a control for the 1919 race riots: the interaction of an indicator for the
  15 Observations   from Alaska and Hawaii exist for 1910 but no other years in our time period of interest (likely due
to the fact that they were not yet states). We exclude the 1910 observations for those two states in our analysis.


                                                          24
                   Table 4: Economic effects of the Tulsa Massacre, sample of men




presence of a riot in the county, a post 1919 indicator, and an indicator for the race being Black

individuals. We estimate equation (2) using weighted least squares (WLS) with weights given by

the population of each observation. All standard errors are clustered at the county level.

   Estimates of equation (2) are reported in Table 4 for men and Appendix Table A14 for men and

women combined. In Columns 1 and 2, we report estimates examining home ownership as the

dependent variable. As before, the dependent variable in Column 1 is the fraction of household

heads who report owning their home. In Column 2, the dependent variable is the fraction of

individuals who live in a home that is owned by a family member. For both measures, we find

a significant negative effect. For example, the Tulsa Massacre is associated with a decline in

the share of male household heads who own their home by 4.2 percentage points and a decline

in the share of men who live in a home owned by a family member by 4.7 percentage points.

These estimates are qualitatively identical and quantitatively very similar to the estimates from

the individual-level regressions where the comparison locations were restricted to a set of control

cities.

   We next turn to an examination of income as proxied by the natural log of the occupation

score of those in the labor force. As reported in Column 3, for the male sample, we find that the

Massacre had an adverse effect on the occupational score. For men, the Massacre resulted in a

decline of 2.3%.

   Motivated by the fact that the occupation-based income measure is only a rough proxy of



                                                25
               Table 5: Occupational effects of the Tulsa Massacre, sample of men




actual income, we examine an alternative measure of occupational success, measured as employ-

ment in a professional or technical position, which we call white-collar jobs. The estimates are

reported in Column 4. We find a statistically significant decline in employment in white collar

occupations. For men, the massacre resulted in a decline of white collar employment by 1.2

percentage points, which is enormous given that the baseline share for Black male Tulsans was

1.8 percent in 1920. The estimates are consistent with the estimate of occupational downgrading

found in Column 3. They are also consistent with historical accounts of individuals who were

previously in professional occupations having to take jobs as manual laborers after the Massacre.

  As before, we probe the robustness of our occupation findings by examining alternative

measures of occupation-based income. The estimates for the male sample are reported in Table

5. Across all four measures, we see consistent evidence of occupational downgrading among the

Black male population of Tulsa following the Massacre.


C. National estimates allowing for spillovers

We next turn to estimates that allow for the possibility that the Tulsa Massacre also affected

the behavior of Black residents living in other communities. There are a number of potential

dimensions for such spillover effects and we focus on two that we expect to be the most important.

One is of spillover effects that occur through the media coverage of the Massacre. Locations with

extensive news coverage, much of which actually justified the Massacre and described it as being


                                                26
in the long-term best interest of all involved, would have experienced a stronger warning and a

more salient signal of what was possible in their own community. A second characteristic that

was also likely important in this regard was the extent to which a county was segregated at the

time. Places that, like Tulsa, were highly segregated were vulnerable to large-scale violence, theft,

and destruction that targeted black neighborhoods. In integrated counties, precise racial-targeting

would be much more difficult or even impossible. Without segregated neighborhoods, common

knowledge of which houses were Black-owned and which were white-owned would have been

limited. Beyond this, burning a home would have been risky to the neighbors. If the neighbors

of a burned home were white, this risk would have different consequences than if the neighbors

(and the whole nearby neighborhood) were Black-owned.

   We measure information flows about the massacre using information on newspaper coverage

of the event using data from Newspapers.com, which covers about 31,000 pages of newspapers

from about 2,000 different publications across the United States. We search all pages from June

1­4, 1921 of all papers in the database for mentions of `tulsa' or `tulsa riot.' We also search for

the term 'june.' Since the date of each search is in June 1921, all pages should include this phrase

and this count serves as a measure of the total number of newspapers or pages.

   We use these data to construct six state-level measures of newspaper coverage of the 1921 Tulsa

Massacre. For each term (`tulsa' or `tulsa riot'), we calculate the fraction of: (1) all newspaper

pages with the term, (2) newspapers with the term anywhere on the pages, and (3) newspapers

with the term somewhere on their front page. As reported in Appendix Table A15, the six

state-level measures tend to be positively correlated with each other. In all cases but one, the

pairwise correlations are positive and in all cases but two, the correlation coefficient is above 0.19

and they are generally above 0.5.

   While it is reassuring that the variables tend to be positively correlated, the differences in the

strength of the correlations also indicate that there is variation in the underlying variables even

though they were each constructed to capture the extent to which the newspapers in a county

discussed the Tulsa Massacre. To back out this underlying variable of interest from our multiple

measures, we use factor analysis and calculate the first principal component of the six measures.

The factor loadings are reported in Appendix Table A16. All loadings for the first principal

component are positive with weights ranging from 0.18 to 0.48. The fact that all loadings are

positive is reassuring. The weights on each variable are very similar, except for the fraction of


                                                 27
Figure 9:   Index of Newspaper Coverage of the Tulsa Massacre, using Principal Components
Analysis



pages with the word Tulsa, which has a weight that is less than half of the other variables.

   We normalize the principal component to lie between zero and one and to facilitate a clean

interpretation of the estimates as spillovers, assign a value of zero to Tulsa. The resulting variable,

which we denote Newspapers(c) , is displayed visually in Figures 9 and 10. As shown, there appears

to be rich variation between states and even between states in the same regions.

   To account for spillovers that depend on the extent of segregation in a county at the time, we

rely on Logan and Parman's (2017a) measure of the racial similarity of neighbors of a county.

We use the 1920 measure and normalize it to range between zero and one. To facilitate a clean

interpretation of spillovers, we assign the measure the value of zero for Tulsa. We denote the

variable Segregationc .

   With our constructed spillover variables, we then estimate the following equation:

                              T ulsa    Black
    ycrt = rt + ct + cr + 1 (Ic      × Ir     × ItP ost ) + 2 (Newspapers(c) × Ir
                                                                                Black
                                                                                      × ItP ost )
                                 Black
              3 (Segregationc × Ir     × Itj ) + X crt  + crt .                                     (3)



                                                   28

where c continues to denotes counties, t census years, and r a racial group (either Black, white, or

other). The index s(c) denotes the state of county c. All variables are as defined above. As noted,

Newspapers(c) is our state-level measure of newspaper exposure and Segregationc is the measure

of segregation of a county in 1920. Since for Tulsa, which directly experienced the massacre, the

spillover variables takes on the value of zero, 1 captures the total (direct) effect of the massacre on

Black inhabitants of Tulsa, and 2 and 3 provide measures of the (indirect) effect of the Massacre

on locations other than Tulsa through newspaper articles about the Massacre and the extent of

segregation in their county (as of 1920).

   The estimates of equation (3) are reported in Table 6 for the male sample. We find that

accounting for spillovers does not qualitatively alter our estimate of the direct effect of the Tulsa

Massacre. The estimated direct effects are very similar to the estimates of equation (2) reported in

Table 4. We find evidence of sizeable spillover effects on home ownership. Despite being sizeable,

the estimates lack precision and are not significant at conventional levels. For Black people living

in counties outside of Tulsa, home ownership rates after 1921, relative to before, tend to be lower

the greater the newspaper coverage of the Tulsa Massacre. According to the magnitude of the

estimates, if a Black community lived in a state with the maximum level of coverage in the sample

(Maine), then the effect of the Massacre on home ownership was approximately the same as for

Tulsa. For the median state, with a value of 0.37, the estimated effect is approximately 37% of the



                                                  30
direct effect.

   The most likely explanation for the spillover effects is that the massacre altered the beliefs and

expectations of Black people across the country. At the time, the massacre was the largest single

episode of property destruction experienced by a Black community.16 It provided a warning of

the danger of the accumulation of wealth through home ownership. In an instant, one's home

and possessions could be destroyed. This could have certainly affected one's decision of whether

to accumulate wealth through housing stock. Our findings are consistent with this.

   We next turn to our estimates that allow for spillovers to the Black community of a county

depending on the extent of racial segregation in the county in 1920. The estimates are reported in

Table 7. The direct effects remain nearly identical when accounting for this additional spillover

type. In addition, the newspaper spillover estimates remain very similar. We find that the segrega-

tion spillover estimates for home ownership is negative and significant. This is consistent with the

Massacre reducing rates of Black homeownership in counties across the country that, like Tulsa,

were highly segregated. In segregated counties with distinctively Black neighborhoods, after 1921

there was the legitimate concern of the entire neighborhood being targeted and experiencing the

same fate as Greenwood. We also find a spillover effect for individuals being in a white collar

occupation. This is potentially explained by the fact that these occupations are typically associated

with the ownership of one's own place of business (e.g., law firms, newspaper offices, etc) and of

being a particular target of racial animosity.


7. Long-Term Effects of the Massacre on Home Ownership, 1910­2000

To this point, we have focused on the effects of the Massacre until 1940. We now turn to an

examination of the longer-term effects of the massacre on home ownership. While for the post-

1940 years, we do not have access to the micro-Census, we are able to use county-level data by

race from the NHGIS, which are available for 1980, 1990, and 2000. The NHGIS include data on

the number of household heads who live in owned housing units and the number who live in

rented housing units, broken down by county and race. We use these data to construct a measure

of the home ownership rate (owners divided by the sum of owners and renters).17 While there
  16 The  Rosewood Massacre, another large-scale destruction of Black-owned property, occurred two years later in
January of 1923.
  17 For all the finer detail of the data construction and differences between the pre-1940 and post-1940 measures, see

the Appendix.

Table 7: Estimates allowing for segregation and newspaper coverage spillovers, men sample,

are some slight differences between the post- and pre-1940 Census measures, the full series does

provide measures that are comparable for 1910, 1920, 1930, 1940, 1980, 1990, and 2000, allowing

us to examine longer-term effects.

  We begin the analysis by extending our panel to include 1980, 1990, and 2000. Because the

post-1940 data do not allow us to focus specifically on the sample of men, we must use the

full sample. Thus, for comparison we report estimates for the full sample where the dependent

variable is the share of household heads that are home owners. As reported in Table 6, the

estimates are nearly identical to the same estimates when the sample of men is used.

  The estimates of equations (2) and (3) for a panel that includes 1980, 1990 and 2000 are reported

in Table 9. Column 1 reports estimates of equation (2), which is our baseline equation without

spillovers. Columns 2­4 then report estimates of version of equation (3), where newspaper

and/or segregation spillovers are included in the equation. We continue to estimate a negative

and statistically significant negative direct effect of the Tulsa Massacre on home ownership. In

addition, the magnitude of the estimated direct effect is about twice as large when we extend the

sample period to 2000. This can be seen by directly comparing the estimates of each column of

Table 8 with the estimates from the same column in Table 9. The 1910­1940 estimates of the direct

effect range from -0.042 to -0.097. By contrast, the 1910­2000 estimates range from -0.130 to

                                               32
                Table 8: Estimates for HH Head Home Ownership, 1910­1940, full sample




-0.198.
  We find that in the sample that is extended to 2000, the estimated newspaper effects are larger

in magnitude but the segregation effects are smaller.18 The newspaper spillover estimate is either

-0.042 or -0.041 depending on whether or not we also account for segregation spillovers. In
the longer-run sample, the same estimates are -0.115 and -0.114. By contrast, we find the

longer-term estimates of the segregation spillover effects to be noticeably smaller in magnitude,

which suggests that unlike the other effects these may have been temporary.

  These estimates provide evidence that the effects of the Massacre ­ namely, the direct effects

and newspaper spillover effects ­ were not temporary but persistent, and that the effects may

actually be widening overtime. The Massacre may have put Black Tulsans and some Black

communities on a different trajectory, at least in terms of home ownership. We now turn to a

more detailed examination fo these dynamics by estimating a flexible dynamic equation, which

allows the post treatment effects of the Massacre to vary by decade:


   ycrt = rt + ct + cr +                j   T ulsa
                                        1 (Ic

                                       j J                                  j J

 18 As   before, accounting for the spillover effects also increases the estimated magnitude of the direct effect.

and with each of the spillover measures: Newspapers(c) × Ir        t                 c   r         t

   The estimates of equation 4 are reported in Table 10, which has the same structure as Table 9.

We report the estimates that do not account for the spillover measures in Column 1 and estimates

with either the newspaper and/or the segregation spillover measures in Columns 2­4. To help

visualize the dynamics, we also graph the estimated coefficients and 95%confidence intervals

for the direct effect estimates (Figure 11), the newspaper spillover estimates (Figure 12), and the

segregation spillover estimates (Figure 13).

   A number of interesting patterns emerge from the estimates. As shown in Figure 11, as long

as we account for either newspaper or segregation spillovers, we find no evidence for pre-trends

in either the direct effect or the spillover effect, which is reassuring. In addition, for both spillover

effects, we also find no evidence of pre-trends (Figures 12 and 13).

   We also find that for both the direct effect and for the newspaper spillover effects, the estimates

show that the legacy of the massacre persists in the long-run. For both effects, we see an

immediate short-run effect that is large in 1930 and then grows slightly in 1940. The direct

effects appear to then remain constant until 1980, after which the adverse effect grow over time

until 2000, the last period in our sample. The newspaper spillover effects also grow but appear

more constant after 1940. We also find that, as expected, the magnitudes of the direct effects are

much greater than the spillover effects. To see this, consider the state with the greatest newspaper

exposure with a normalized exposure measure of one. For this state, the estimated newspaper

effect in 2000 is only half the size of the direct effect.

   Lastly, we find that the segregation spillover effects do not persist. After 1940, the estimated

effects are close to zero (and sometimes positive and sometimes negative). Thus, we do not see

persistently lower rates of home ownership after 1921 among Black inhabitants in counties that

were more segregated in 1920. The Massacre appears to have reduced Black home ownership in

places that were more segregated until 1940 but not afterwards.

   One may have expected the segregation effect to persist. A potential explanation for the lack

of persistence of the importance of 1920 segregation is that what is important is the contem-

poraneous measure of segregation and that the extent of segregation does vary over time. The

relationship between segregation measures in different years between 1880 and 1940 is reported

in Appendix Table A17. As shown, there is change in segregation over time. For example, while

the correlation between segregation in 1880 and 1900 is 0.70 the correlation weakens over time.

The same correlation between 1880 and 1940 is 0.53. Thus, the lack of persistence of this spillover

might be due to the fact that the importance of segregation works through a contemporaneous

effect and over time 1920 segregation becomes a weaker predictor of current segregation.


8. Conclusions and Future Research

We have reported preliminary estimates of the effects of the 1921 Tulsa Massacre. The estimates

use a place-based triple differences approach and estimate the effect of the Massacre on the Black

population of Tulsa. The estimates compare Black people to white people, within Tulsa county

versus elsewhere, before versus after the 1921 Massacre.

   We find that the Massacre is associated with a decline in home ownership and lower average

occupational status. We also find evidence of spillover effects to Black people in other parts

of the United States that were either exposed to extensive newspaper coverage of the Massacre

(much of it supportive of the events) or, like Tulsa, had high levels of racial segregation which

made widespread and targeted destruction of black homes and businesses possible. The spillover

effects tend to be in the same direction as the direct effects, although smaller in magnitude, and

are most clearly seen in home ownership. The clear impact on home ownership is consistent with

the Massacre being a warning about the potential destruction of wealth, which in turn affected

the decision to invest in assets like homes.

   When we extend the analysis past 1940 to include 1980,1990, and 2000, we find that the direct

effects of the massacre persist and actually grow. The same is found for the newspaper coverage

spillover effects. However, we find that the spillover effects working through historical racial

segregation (measured in 1920) do not persist over time. This is potentially explained by the

imperfect persistence of county-level segregation over time.

   In ongoing work, we seek to better understand many aspects of these preliminary findings.

An important part of our larger project involves the matching of respondents (and parents and

children) across census years, which allows us to study the longer-term intergenerational effects

of the Massacre by tracing individuals and their descendants even if they relocate. This matching

allows us to estimate the effects of the Massacre on the descendants of those who experienced the

events. It is possible that individuals who were not alive during the Massacre are still affected by

it through the intergenerational persistence of wealth and economic well-being.

   Another part of our ongoing endeavors is the linking (and digitization when necessary)

of diverse historical sources, including the complete-count micro-Censuses (from 1910, 1920,

1930 and 1940), census enumeration maps, court records, death records, historical accounts,

genealogical records, and the Tulsa City Directory, which is available annually. These efforts

will allow us to better understand whether different experiences during the Massacre, such as the

extent of property loss or death of family, friends, or loved ones, is an important determinant of



                                                38
the magnitude and nature of the effects. In addition to the purely economic outcomes that we

examine here, in future research we will also examine a variety of outcomes that provide evidence

about the psychological or social effects of the massacre.

A1. Data: Measurement and Sources

Outcomes of interest

We use complete count U.S. census microdata from 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940 (Minnesota

Population Center, 2019). These datasets include detailed information at the person-level. We

describe below the outcome variables of interest in this draft.19


HH Head Home Ownership

For household head home ownership, we require that a respondent report living in an owned

home and also report being the household head. We assume household heads of owned home

are the people who own the homes. For the hh head home ownership measure, we restrict the

sample to household heads, so that the variable is missing for all non-household heads.


Family Home ownership

We want to capture whether someone in a person's family owns their home. Currently, the

ownership variable sometimes only shows whether someone in the household head's family

owns the home, meaning a servant can have an "owned" value for her home even though it's

really her employer who owns the home.

   The measure we construct takes non-primary-family members into account by only counting

individuals as living in an owned home if the home is owned by someone living there and that

owner is a family member. On a technical level, under our definition, a person owns a home

if and only if they are marked as living in an "owned home" in the census and they are in the

primary family unit.

   Our slight alteration to this variable makes it consistent over time.20 The way the home

ownership variable was assigned to non-family house hold members differs based on census

year. For instance, in 1930 the questionnaire instructions differentiate between family units in the

same household. But in 1940, they do not.

   As such, we make the variable equivalent of the question "does someone in your family own

the house you live in?" to get at a person-level of "home ownership" rather than a household-level
 19 Highest    grade of schooling and educational attainment are also variables of interest but are only available in 1940.

of home ownership. Our home ownership variable is a binary variable for each person that is the

same at the family-level.


Home ownership, 1980, 1990, 2000

In addition to the micro-census data, we use county-level data on home ownership from the

NHGIS to examine longer-run impacts in the years 1980, 1990, and 2000. We use the following

NHGIS data files on tenure: nhgis0011_ds104_1980_county, nhgis0011_ds104_1990_county, and

nhgis0011_ds104_2000_county. These data and corresponding codebooks can be downloaded

from https://data2.nhgis.org/main, with additional documentation and source information at

https://www.nhgis.org/documentation/tabular-data.

  To construct a measure of county-level household head ownership by race, we rely on the

counts of householders who live in an owner-occupied housing unit and householders who live

in a renter occupied housing unit (for example, variables CY001 through CY010 in the 1980 data).

A "householder" is "The person, or one of the people, in whose name the home is owned,

being bought, or rented. If there is no such person present, any household member 15 years old

and over can serve as the householder. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family

householder and a nonfamily householder. A family householder is a householder living with

one or more people related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and

all people in the household related to him are family members. A nonfamily householder is a

householder living alone or with nonrelatives only."

  The variables draw from the universe of occupied housing units and are available for 1980,

1990, and 2000. We take the number of owner occupied housing units in the county as the

numerator and the number of owner occupied housing units plus the number of renter occupied

housing units as the denominator. To create the ownership measure for Black individuals in 1980,

our calculation is C7Y002 / (C7Y002 + C7Y007). For white individuals it is C7Y001 / (C7Y001 +

C7Y006). The NHGIS describes these count variables as the number of units, which we take to be

the same as the number of householders.

  As with the complete-count measures, we combine other races into one category, so that

the races we analyze are Black, white, and other. For example, in the 1980 data, we sim-

ply take the sum of American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut owners (C7Y003), Asian and Pa-

cific Islander owners (C7Y004), and Other owners (C7Y005) to create the other category.


                                               44
The ownership share for the other category is calculated as (C7Y003+C7Y004+C7Y005) /

(C7Y003+C7Y004+C7Y005+C7Y008+C7Y009+C7Y010).

   We use the population of householders as weights in the regressions. As with the complete

count data, weights vary by census year, county, and racial group.

   Our measure of home ownership in the NHGIS corresponds closely with the household head

ownership measure in the complete count census (described above). Both samples restrict analysis

to householders (in the NHGIS) or household heads (in the complete count census), and calculate

home ownership rates at the year, race and county level. Since the NHGIS does not include

a gender breakdown, we append the NHGIS data to the full sample complete count data and

report estimates using this dataset.


Occupation-based income proxy

We use a measure of income constructed based on occupation responses, called the occupational

income score, occscore. The variable "assigns each occupation in all years a value representing

the median total income (in hundreds of 1950 dollars) of all persons with that particular occupa-

tion in 1950." The measure converts occupational responses in the census median income values.

IPUMS documentation explains that "[f]or years prior to 1940, information on occupation was

collected for persons who had not permanently retired," but, in 1940, "only persons in the labor

force responded to the occupation inquiry." Therefore, to "construct a fully compatible universe,"

we follow IPUMS recommendations and restrict the sample to persons currently in the labor force

with valid occupational responses.21

   For one measure we condition on being in the labor force, while in the other we do not. If

we condition on being in the labor force with valid occupation responses, our income measure is

necessarily an intensive-margin measure of economic status. That is, the measure will always be

non-zero. In the analysis, we take the natural log of the measure, which is less skewed than the

raw measure. If we don't condition in this way, we need to take the natural log of the measure

plus 1 (to avoid undefined values).
 21 See   the description section at: https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/OCCSCORE.




                                                       45
White-collar jobs

We also capture if someone reports a professional or technical job in the census, which we call

white-collar jobs. For reference, the ten most common white collar occupations in Tulsa in the

1920 census, broken down by race, are reported in Appendix Tables A11 (for men) and A12 (for

women).


Additional occupation-based measures

Our baseline occupation-based measure, occscore, is the median 1950 income of each occupation.

IPUMS also provides other variables on occupational standing that we use for robustness. These

capture different elements of occupations. Similar to the occupational income score measure,

these variables are intensive measure of labor market position, meaning we only have entries

for the variables for individuals who are in the labor force with a valid occupation code. The

alternative measures that we use are summarized below.

   SEI: Quoting from IPUMS, "SEI is a constructed measure that assigns a Duncan Socioeconomic

Index (SEI) score to each occupation using the 1950 occupational classification scheme available

in the OCC1950 variable. The SEI is a measure of occupational status based upon the income

level and educational attainment associated with each occupation in 1950."22

   Occupational Earnings Score: This variable, ERSCOR50 in IPUMS, assigns a measure of the

median earned income for each occupation. "In order to maximize comparability over time, the

median earned income reported in ERSCOR50 is standardized as a z-score and then converted

to a percentile rank. ERSCOR50 reports the percentage of persons in occupations having lower

standardized median earnings than the respondent's occupation."23

   Occupational Prestige Score: This variable, PRESGL in IPUMS, assigns a Siegel prestige score

to each occupation. This assignment was based on surveys conducted at NORC in the 1960s.24

   Occupational Status Score: Quoting from IPUMS, "The NPBOSS50 is a measure of occupational

status based upon the median earnings and median educational attainment associated with each

category in the occupational scheme available in OCC1950 variable. Occupational status score

gives equal weights to education and earnings, and can be interpreted as the percentage of

and earnings below that occupation. The scores can vary from 0 to 100."25

A2. Archival Data

To supplement our complete count census data, we also use archival data on Massacre causalities

and property losses to more finely define treatment. These other records allow us to better

understand whether different experiences during the Massacre, such as the extent of property

loss or death of family, friends, or loved ones, is an important determinant of the magnitude and

nature of the Massacre effects.


A1. Deaths

We compiled our list of those killed from four sources, all of which we digitized from the

Oklahoma Historical Society's Tulsa Race Riot Commission Collection. The first is the table of

39 confirmed causalities (killed) according to death certificates, which is referenced as "Table 1:

Tulsa Race Riot Deaths" in the Oklahoma Commission Report. The second is "Race Riot Dead"

by Dick Warner, which is a listing of people proven dead by cemetery burial records or funeral

home records. The third is "Computations as to the Deaths from the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot" also

written by Dick Warner, which lists individuals who were issued death certificates or were listed

as dead in funeral home records, legal claims, or newspapers or were mentioned dead by family

or neighbors. Lastly, we use the "A working list of the confirmed victims of the riot compiled

by Dick Warner, Dr. Scott Ellswoth, and Dr. Clyde Snow," which includes names from death

certificates, funeral home records, newspapers, court case petitions, and interviews.

   These four sources identify deaths on the basis of the following distinct kinds of primary

sources: death certificates26 , funeral records27 , cemetery burial records (graves), legal claims,

newspaper articles28 , and interviews.29 The list of those killed and the source of the information

is provided in Appendix Table A19.
  26 Death Certificates were issued by the City of Tulsa.
  27 The funeral houses providing the records were Stanley & McCune and Mitchell-Flaming.
  28 The main newspapers reporting on mortalities were the June 1, June 2, and June 3 1921 editions of Tulsa World,

the June 1 and June 2 1921 editions of the Tulsa Tribune, the June 1 1921 edition of the Guthrie Daily Leader, and the
June 1 1921 edition of the Muskogee Phoenix.
  29 We cross-validated these listings, which have been compiled by the Oklahoma Historical Society, against a listing

of Tulsa Race Riot victims compiled by I. Marc Carlson, a librarian at the University of Tulsa. All names in our listing
were also in his listing.




                                                          48
A2. Injuries

Since no comparable listing of individuals injured during the massacre has been made available

by the Oklahoma Historical Society, we relied on listings by the June 1, June 2, and June 3 1921

editions of Tulsa World, the June 1 and June 2 1921 editions of the Tulsa Tribune and the 1921

Red Cross report to assemble a list of individuals admitted to hospitals due to massacre-induced

wounds.30 The final list, which contains 99 injured individuals, is reported in Appendix Table

A19.


A3. Property Losses

We compiled our list of those who lost property from three sources. First, we used the "Database

of damage claims filed through the City of Tulsa by Blacks and Whites after the riot," which we

digitized from the Oklahoma Historical Society's Tulsa Race Riot Commission Collection. This

source includes names and amounts of losses in dollars. Second, we use a partial list of financial

and property losses in the Massacre from the book "Race riot 1921" by Mary E. Jones Parrish (we

digitized pages 115­126). The list includes losses in dollar amounts by addresses, businesses, and

people. Third, and largest, we use the "Cases Filed Database" as compiled by OHS during the

preparation of the 2001 report on the Massacre.31 This source includes plaintiff names, addresses,

defendants, property loss details, and an amount in dollars.




  30 The 1921 Red Cross Disaster Relief Report summarizes the impact of the Tulsa Massacre on the health and
economic well-being of the local population, and includes the names, ages, and biographical details of 10 patients
who were in hospital on December 30th, 1921 due to riot-induced wounds. Although the American Red Cross paid for
the hospitalization of 183 (48 black and 153 white) individuals that suffered riot-induced wounds, it does not provide
the names of those that were discharged before the publication of the report. As a result, our count necessarily
represents a lower bound on the true number of individuals injured by the massacre.
  31 Larry O'Dell shared a digitized version of this database with us.
