                                              ABSTRACT

Recent dramatic declines in U.S. stock and housing markets have led to widespread speculation that
shrinking retirement accounts and falling home equity will lead workers to delay retirement. Yet the
weakness in the labor market and its impact on retirement is often overlooked. If older job seekers
have difficulty finding work, they may retire earlier than expected. The net effect of the current economic
crisis on retirement is thus far from clear. In this paper, we use 30 years of data from the March Current
Population Survey to estimate models relating retirement decisions to fluctuations in equity, housing,
and labor markets. We find that workers age 62 to 69 are responsive to the unemployment rate and
to long-run fluctuations in stock market returns. Less-educated workers are more sensitive to labor
market conditions and more-educated workers are more sensitive to stock market conditions. We
find no evidence that workers age 55 to 61 respond to these fluctuations or that workers at any age
respond to fluctuating housing markets. On net, we predict that the increase in retirement attributable
to the rising unemployment rate will be almost 50 percent larger than the decrease in retirement brought
about by the stock market crash.

I. INTRODUCTION

        One casualty of the financial and economic crisis that began in the fall of 2008 may be

workers’ carefully laid retirement plans. The popular press recognized this from the start of the

crisis, as the headlines listed above make clear. Front page stories of lost retirement savings and

plunging home values are commonplace. With diminished retirement savings and less home

equity to draw on, the story goes, expected retirement income has shrunk, forcing older

individuals to stay in the labor force longer. Workers interviewed for these stories wondered

when or if they would ever be able to retire.

        Amidst these concerns, another news story appeared briefly in spring 2009 indicating that

Social Security benefit claims have risen sharply since the crisis began, suggesting an increase in

retirements rather than a decrease.1 But why are more workers retiring now if their expected

retirement income is going down? The answer may lie in another aspect of the crisis, the weak

labor market. The unemployment rate has more than doubled and the economy has shed millions

of jobs since the crisis began. Some of those workers struggling to stay employed or find new


1
 See, for example, Dorning (2009). The media coverage around May 24, 2009 was based on an interview with
Stephen Goss, the Social Security Administration’s Chief Actuary. A few days later, his office released a memo
detailing these findings. In it, Goss reports that the number of claims for new retirement benefits in 2009 rose 10
percent more than one would expect based on demographics alone (Goss, 2009). Goss indicated that the economic
downturn is the potential cause of this increase.

                                                        1
jobs are surely nearing retirement age. For the unfortunate ones who are not able to maintain or

find employment, retirement may be the only solution, despite its involuntary nature.

        The net effect of the current financial and economic crisis on retirement is thus far from

clear, as plunging equity and home values would be expected to lead to a decrease in retirements

while a weak labor market would be expected to lead to an increase. The purpose of this paper is

to examine this issue. We use 30 years of data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS)

to estimate models relating retirement decisions to changes in equity, housing, and labor markets

over time and (where possible) across geographic locations.         We also use the Survey of

Consumer Finances (SCF) to provide a descriptive analysis of the impact of falling equity prices

on older household’s expected retirement income. We then use our regression estimates to

predict the net effect of the current crisis on retirement.

        Our analysis indicates that the retirement decisions of workers between ages 62 and 69

with more education are affected by long-run fluctuations in stock market returns. We also find

that labor market conditions are an important determinant of retirement decisions. When the

unemployment rate rises, more workers between ages 62 and 69 retire, particularly those with

less education. Workers between ages 55 and 61 are not found to be responsive to either type of

market fluctuation. Individuals do not seem to respond to fluctuations in the housing market

regardless of their age. On net, we predict that the increase in retirement brought about the

recent rise in unemployment will be almost 50 percent larger than the decrease in retirement

brought about by the stock market crash.

        Overall, our findings suggest that the plight of those who are forced to retire early as a

result of weak labor market conditions merits greater attention. These results have potentially

important distributional implications as well. It is often those on the bottom of the economic



                                                   2
ladder who are being hurt by retiring prematurely due to labor market factors and those at the top

who may not be able to retire as planned due to equity losses. Our results also have implications

beyond the current economic crisis, as they suggest that the past literature on retirement has paid

too little attention to the important role of labor market conditions in the retirement decision.

       The remainder of our analysis proceeds as follows.            In the following section, we

document trends in the environment surrounding retirement decisions, including stock returns,

housing prices, and the labor market. Next, we review the relevant literature and discuss the data

and methods we use in the remainder of the analysis. We then present our results regarding the

impact of changes in equity, housing, and labor markets, respectively, on retirement decisions.

Finally, we simulate the net effect of recent market events on retirement and discuss the policy

implications of our findings.



II. BACKGROUND

       In this section, we present trends in equity, housing, and labor markets to review recent

activity and summarize earlier events that may be less well remembered. We also discuss the

conditions under which fluctuations in these markets may affect retirement behavior.

A. Trends in the Stock Market

       Annual changes in the value of the stock market, as captured by the S&P 500 Index, are

shown in Figure 1A. This figure reports real annual changes (adjusted for inflation) based on

December monthly average values. The figure illustrates the tremendous year-to-year volatility

in aggregate stock prices. The pattern in the 1980s and early 1990s is one of two good years

with 10 to 20 percent annual returns followed by a bad year with zero or negative returns. Since

then, the market has experienced more prolonged booms and busts, including two five-year



                                                  3
rallies in the late 1990s and mid 2000s, as well as a multi-year bear market early in this decade.

The market fell by 40 percent in real terms in 2008, the sharpest decline in recent history.

       One can see how these dramatic turnarounds in equity markets have captured the public’s

attention. The question at hand, though, is whether they alter retirement decisions. Given that

there has always been substantial year-to-year variability in stock prices, is it sensible to expect a

single year’s market performance to drive behavior?

       The market return over a longer period of time could potentially play a more important

role in retirement decisions. In Figure 1B, we display five-year and ten-year market returns

(again calculated using December monthly average values). This figure shows that there is

substantial variability in longer-term returns over time. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the five-

year real return was consistently about 50 percent. After that real returns rose, hitting almost 200

percent in the year 2000 before collapsing to small or negative values. Ten-year returns are

higher, but the patterns are similar.

       These statistics suggest that market returns could have a significant impact on retirement

behavior. One worker approaching retirement age could have tripled the value of his portfolio

over a five year period, while another worker’s portfolio remained constant or even shrank. If

workers have considerable resources invested in the stock market, a boom or a bust in the period

leading up to traditional retirement ages could play a key role in the decision of when to retire.

We later explore the level of stock ownership among the population and various subgroups.

B. Trends in the Housing Market

       Although the volatility in the housing market is less dramatic, home values also exhibit

substantial fluctuations over time. Figure 2 displays annual changes in real house prices from

1987 to 2008 based on the Case-Shiller (CS) Index for 10 large cities across the country and



                                                  4
from 1976 to 2008 based on data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight Home

Price Index (OFHEO) for the entire country.2 The figure shows that housing market returns are

considerably more serially correlated than stock returns. In the late 1980s and early-to-mid

1990s, home values did not keep pace with inflation. In the decade that followed, however,

prices rose continuously, with annual growth rates in the Case-Shiller Index of over 10 percent in

some years. House prices have fallen sharply since 2006, dropping almost 20 percent in 2008.

        These statistics suggest that home prices could also affect retirement decisions.

Depending on their year of birth, individuals may have doubled their home equity or had it cut in

half as they approach traditional retirement ages. If workers had substantial home equity to

begin with and are willing to draw down this equity during retirement, a substantial increase in

home equity could accelerate retirement while a substantial drop could delay it.

C. Trends in the Labor Market

        Figure 3 presents the cyclical variation in the labor market, as measured by the monthly

unemployment rate for workers age 16 and over. As we describe subsequently, older workers

have a lower unemployment rate, but the pattern over time is very similar to that for all workers.

The highest unemployment rate in recent times was 10.8 percent in 1982. Subsequent recessions

in the early 1990s and the early 2000s were less severe, with the unemployment rate reaching

highs of 7.8 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively. In the current crisis, the unemployment rate is

climbing rapidly; as of August of 2009, it had reached 9.7 percent. Aside from these recessions,

the unemployment rate has been at a low level, around 4.5 percent, for much of the period since

the mid-1990s.




2
  We discuss these two indices in more detail below. Annual returns in the CS Index are calculated as the change in
the December values. Annual returns in the OFHEO Index are calculated as the change in the fourth quarter values.

                                                         5
       As with our earlier discussions of equity and housing markets, labor market conditions

around traditional retirement ages may matter. Workers are twice as likely to be unemployed

now as they were a few years ago. In times when obtaining a new job is difficult, older

individuals who are laid off or unemployed for other reasons may be more likely to retire. This

may be especially true for workers age 62 and up, who generally have access to Social Security.

       As this discussion has made clear, there are reasons to believe that variations in stock

prices, house prices, and the labor market have the potential to alter retirement behavior. It is

also clear that there are important conditions for these behavioral responses. Lower stock and

housing prices may lead to fewer retirements if individuals nearing retirement hold sufficient

levels of equity and plan to consume that equity during retirement. Higher unemployment rates

may lead to more retirements if older individuals are unable to find work and withdraw from the

labor force instead. Furthermore, for market fluctuations to affect aggregate retirement rates, the

relevant elasticities must be large enough to generate behavioral responses by more than just a

handful of older individuals. In the end, the retirement responses to fluctuations in equity,

housing, and labor markets are empirical questions. In the remainder of this paper, we attempt to

answer these questions.



III. PREVIOUS LITERATURE

       Much of the existing retirement literature has focused on Social Security, private

pensions, and health. While these factors may be important in explaining long-run trends, such

as the steep decline in older men’s labor force participation since World War II and the recent

reversal of that trend, they are unlikely to explain dramatic changes in retirement behavior in any




                                                6
given year, such as those that might result from the current crisis. In this section, we focus on

those parts of the retirement literature that are most directly relevant to our analysis.

A. Financial Shocks

        Economic theory suggests that individuals should respond to negative stock market

shocks by reducing their consumption of normal goods (including leisure) and delaying

retirement. Articles in the popular press have similarly asserted that this will be the effect of the

current crisis. Nevertheless, there is little empirical research to support this hypothesis.

        In an earlier paper (Coile and Levine, 2006), we use methods similar to those described

below to address this issue. We treat the stock market boom and bust of the late 1990s and early

2000s as a quasi-experiment and explore whether groups with more stock assets were more

likely to retire during the boom and less likely to retire during the bust. We find no evidence of

this pattern. We also argue that individuals would have to have been implausibly sensitive to

market fluctuations for the observed rise in retirement in the year 2000 to have been the result of

that year’s market crash. Our findings are consistent with those obtained by Hurd, et al. (2009).

They are unable to find support for the notion that “households which had large (financial) gains

retired earlier than they had anticipated or that they revised their retirement expectations

compared with workers in households that had no large gains.”3

        There are two possible explanations for the lack of an effect. The first is that the number

of people who experienced large unexpected wealth gains from market fluctuations is relatively

small, as Coile and Levine (2006) argue. The second is that the effect of unexpected wealth on

labor supply is fairly small. This view is supported by Coronado and Perozek (2003), who find

3
 Sevak (2001) reached a different conclusion, finding that men in defined contribution (DC) pension plans increased
their retirement rates by more than men in defined benefit (DB) pensions during the stock market boom of the late
1990s. However, this study is limited by an inability to control for differences in retirement trends between the two
groups, a deficiency that is overcome in Coile and Levine (2006) by the use of the boom and bust as a double
experiment.

                                                         7
that being a stockholder during the boom of the late 1990s is associated with retiring 6 months

earlier than expected, but that each additional $100,000 of unexpected gains is associated with

retiring only two weeks earlier than expected. Hurd, et al. (2009) are also sympathetic to this

argument, citing evidence from lotteries.

B. The Role of Housing

       As with stock market shocks, economic theory suggests that unanticipated losses in home

equity should lead households to retire later. However, shocks to home equity will only affect

retirement behavior if households routinely consume their housing wealth in retirement. In fact,

studies suggest that this is not the case. For instance, Venti and Wise (2004) find that most

households do not sell their homes until they experience an event such as the death or entry into

a nursing home of a spouse. This finding has led some authors to argue that many households

treat their home equity as a “buffer stock” of wealth against the risk of shocks late in life. If so,

then it seems unlikely that home price fluctuations will affect retirement behavior, although

many recent stories in the popular press have asserted that this is the case. The effect of housing

wealth on retirement has not been directly addressed in the previous literature. We provide an

empirical analysis of this question below.

C. Labor Market Shocks

       A small body of literature has established that job loss is relatively common for older

workers (Farber, 2008; Munnell, et. al., 2006). For instance, Farber (2008) reports that 10 to 12

percent of private-sector workers between the ages of 50 and 64 experienced permanent and

involuntary job losses when labor markets were weak during the 1991 to 1993 and 2001 to 2003

periods, while displacement rates of around 8 percent (over a three year period) were observed

during the expansions of the mid-to-late 1990s and the middle 2000s. Previous studies have



                                                 8
found that job loss among older workers has long-lasting negative consequences for employment

and wages (Chan and Stevens 1999, 2001, and 2004; von Wachter, 2007). Chan and Stevens

(1999) estimate that the employment rate of displaced older workers two years after a job loss is

25 percentage points lower than that of similar non-displaced workers and that the median

reemployed worker earns 20 percent less than at his old job.

        More directly related to the question we seek to address here is our earlier work (Coile and

Levine, 2007). Using similar methods and data to that described subsequently, we find that

retirement transitions are cyclically sensitive, a result supported by Von Wachter (2007) and

Hallberg (2008). We estimate that changes in rates of retirement between the peak and trough of a

business cycle are comparable to those brought about by moderate change in financial incentives to

retire or to the threat of a health shock, factors that have traditionally received far more attention in

the literature. We also find that Social Security interacts with labor market conditions in affecting

retirement transitions, as the effect of the unemployment rate on retirement appears only as

workers become eligible for benefits. We expand upon this discussion later in our analysis.

D. Contribution of this Research

        The current analysis builds on the previous literature, including our own past work, in

several ways. First, we update and extend our analyses of the effect of stock market and labor

market fluctuations on retirement. Second, we provide a new analysis of the effect of housing

market fluctuations on retirement, a question not addressed in the previous literature. Third, we

use these various estimates to predict the net effect of the current crisis on retirement. Finally, we

discuss the distributional consequences and policy implications of our findings.




                                                   9
IV. DATA SOURCES

         The main data requirement for our analysis is a way to measure retirements for large

numbers of workers over time. Beyond data on their labor market activity, we also need

information on workers’ asset holdings, including both financial assets and home equity. This

section of the paper will describe the sources of data we use.

A. Measuring Retirement

         Our main source of data for measuring retirements is the Current Population Survey

(CPS). The CPS is the leading survey of labor market activity in the United States. The monthly

CPS survey asks a sequence of questions about the respondent’s involvement in the labor market

around the time of survey and also collects demographic data. In March of each year, the

“Annual Social and Economic Supplement” (previously called the “Annual Demographic

Survey”) is administered as a supplement to the regular monthly CPS.                             Each March CPS

provides sample sizes of between 130,000 and 215,000. Although we only are interested in the

data for workers around the age of retirement, the large size of each sample coupled with the

annual nature of the survey provides us with a tremendous amount of information. For instance,

when we pool data from the 1980 through 2008 March surveys for individuals between the ages

of 55 and 69, we obtained a sample of nearly 600,000 individuals.

         For our purposes, one key attribute of the March CPS is that it enables us to identify

retirement transitions.4 To do so, we make use of information on the labor market activity of

respondents in the preceding calendar year, including weeks worked, usual hours worked per
4
  As we describe subsequently, we define retirement as complete labor force withdrawal. However, we recognize
that retirement could be defined in other ways, for example, as the initial claim of retirement benefits or as departure
from a “career” job. In fact, several studies have found that it is quite common for workers to leave a career job and
work for a period of time at a less demanding “bridge” job before completely withdrawing from the labor force; see
Cahill, et. al. (2006) for a recent contribution. The data available to us leads us to focus on a definition of complete
labor force withdrawal. However, an analysis of these other types of retirement transitions would be a fruitful area
for future research.


                                                          10
week, and weeks spent looking for work. Combining this retrospective information along with

that obtained in the regular monthly survey, we can define a retirement to occur when an older

worker reports being in the labor force for 13 or more weeks during the preceding year, but is out

of the labor force on the March survey date.5 When we restrict our sample to those in the labor

force last year in this way, we are left with a final sample size of over 300,000. Of these

workers, we observe that about 9 percent retire in the following year according to our definition.6

State of residence is available in the March CPS, which we can use to merge in state-level data

on unemployment rates and house prices.

B. Measuring Home Prices

        We use two sources of home price data. The first is the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price

Index, which is available monthly for 20 metropolitan areas beginning in 1987. The index uses a

“repeat sales pricing” methodology, where data on sale prices of individual single-family homes

is collected from county records and matched to each home’s previous sales price, then a

weighted aggregate index is created based on the change in sales prices of these homes. We

convert the index to real values using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate real changes

in house prices. We calculate the percent change in the index from one March to the next, as our

definition of retirement in the CPS is essentially based on changes in labor market activity



5
  A second way that we could use CPS data is by taking advantage of the longitudinal structure of the CPS to create
a short panel of information for each respondent. This panel can be created by matching CPS information for some
respondents in one March CPS with that from the CPS in the following March. The procedure for doing so is
reported in Madrian and Lefgren (1999). These data offer about one-third the sample size as the regular CPS. An
advantage of these data, though, is that we can create a definition of retirement for workers who have been more
committed to the labor market and out of the labor force for a longer period of time. We have used these data as
well and obtained findings qualitatively similar to those reported subsequently. We have chosen not to report them
for expediency.
6
 Using matched March CPS data, described in the preceding footnote, we can also estimate the likelihood that a
worker who retires according to our definition regains employment in the following year. Our estimates suggest that
16 percent of those 55 to 69 and 13 percent of those 62 to 69 who retired in the preceding year found employment
again in the following year.

                                                        11
between one March and the next, and relate retirement decisions in a given year to housing

returns over the previous 12 months.

       The second data source is the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO)

Home Price Index. This index is available quarterly at the state level starting in 1975. The

OFHEO index is also based on changes in the value of individual homes over time, but is

calculated using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac data on mortgages originated by these entities

during home purchase and refinancing transactions. We use first-quarter data and again relate

retirement decisions to home price appreciation in the previous 12 months.

       In comparing the two indices, the OFHEO index has the advantage that it is available for

all states and years in our sample, allowing for larger sample sizes in these regressions than those

that use the Case-Shiller index. However, the Case-Shiller index displays more variation over

time, as shown in Figure 2, which can be attributed to several differences in the construction of

the two indices, including the fact that the OFHEO index does not include foreclosures. As we

report below, results using the two indices are very similar.

C. Measuring Asset Values

       The primary source of wealth data in the United States is the Survey of Consumer

Finances (SCF). The survey has been conducted every three years since 1983, most recently in

2007, with a sample of roughly 4,500 households per survey. The survey oversamples high net

worth households to obtain a more accurate estimate of aggregate wealth holdings. The survey

collects detailed data on assets and income, including data on asset allocation within retirement

accounts. We use the SCF to generate information on the stock holdings of older households,

using sample weights to obtain statistics that are representative of the population.




                                                 12
V. METHODOLOGY

        Although the specific methods we use depend on whether we are addressing stock market

wealth, housing wealth, or unemployment, the general approach is similar. To avoid repeating

ourselves, we first present the basic methodological framework and then provide details

regarding the ways in which we modify it for each specific application.7

A. Framework

        Our goal is to determine whether different types of market conditions alter retirement

decisions. Underlying our analysis is a regression model where the dependent variable is an

indicator for whether an older worker retired in a particular year as a function of the market

conditions he faces along with other explanatory variables, mainly demographic factors like

race/ethnicity, gender, level of education, etc. We also include a full set of exact age dummies,

which essentially converts our retirement regression into a hazard model with a nonparametric

baseline hazard. We use the same CPS data to provide information on retirement behavior as

well as the explanatory variables (other than the market conditions).

        For each analysis we exploit quasi-experimental variation in the data, which we believe is

able to plausibly generate causal conclusions regarding the impact of conditions in each market

on retirement behavior.          Quasi-experimental variation relies on changes over time in the

explanatory variables occurring in some locations or for some groups but not in other places or

for other groups. Those individuals who experienced no change act as a quasi-control group for

those in a quasi-treatment group who experienced a change. Comparing differences in outcomes

over time between the two groups provides a means to identify the effect of the change.


7
 In principle, we could use one regression model that would include all three measures of market conditions. As we
describe subsequently, though, each analysis has somewhat different data and sources of identification that requires
separate analyses. Where possible, however, we include other market conditions as control variables. For instance
our analysis of the impact of home prices includes the unemployment rate as an explanatory variable.

                                                        13
Statistically, this approach is referred to as a difference-in-difference method as the change, or

difference, within one group is differenced from the change in the other group to estimate the

effect.

          In practice, this approach is generally implemented using panel data, estimating

regression models that include specific market conditions (stock market, housing market, and

labor market) along with relevant fixed effects when possible. One set of fixed effects would

represent a vector of state of residence dummy variables that can hold constant any longstanding

differences in behavior between workers who live in different areas of the country.8 A second

set of fixed effects would represent dummy variables for the time periods included in the

analysis. These time fixed effects would hold constant broader social and economic conditions

that may be changing over time and that might alter outcomes for all individuals. What remains

to be estimated once these fixed effects are included is the difference in outcomes that take place

over time between the groups. The coefficient on the market conditions variable, our key

explanatory variable, is this estimate.            We will apply this general approach in all of our

subsequent analyses.

B. Application to Changes in Financial Wealth

          Not everyone holds financial wealth. As we document later, some segments of society

have little financial wealth. Because changes in equity market conditions should have little or no

direct bearing on retirement decisions for those who do not own equities, these individuals can

be thought of as a quasi-control group. We can compare the effect of stock market fluctuations

on retirement for those without financial wealth to the effect for those with significant financial

wealth to estimate the impact of the market on retirement.

8
 If the quasi-treatment and quasi-control groups were identified by a characteristic other than location, for example
education, then the dummy variables for each education group would serve to hold constant any longstanding
differences in behavior between workers in different education groups, as the state dummies do in this discussion.

                                                        14
         In practice, the CPS data we use to measure retirement do not include data on financial

wealth. Instead, we first divide individuals by educational attainment. As we report later,

individuals with no more than a high school degree typically have very limited equity holdings

and can act as a quasi-control group for college graduates, whose holdings are more extensive. If

the more educated are estimated to retire at a differentially higher rate in response to higher stock

market prices, this would support the hypothesis that market conditions matter.

         In these specifications, we are unable to include a complete vector of year fixed effects

because the stock market variables available to us vary only over time and not across locations.

Instead, we capture broader movements in retirement behavior over time by including quadratic

time trends in our regression model, allowing the trends to differ by group. This model enables

us to identify the impact of stock market changes by estimating whether retirement behavior

deviates from a quadratic trend in years in which market returns are higher. To support a causal

effect, estimates would need to be greater for the more highly educated.

B. Application to Changes in Housing Wealth

         Our use of quasi-experimental variation and difference-in-difference methods is

somewhat different when we analyze changes in housing wealth. We first consider the variation

available to us as a result of differences in house price changes by location. In the extreme, we

could think about individuals who live in locations where housing prices have remained flat (in

real terms).9 They would represent a control group to compare to those in locations where prices

rose or fell. Dividing individuals in this way is a bit unrealistic, however, since housing prices

tend to fluctuate everywhere at least some of the time.

9
  In reality, since we are interested in unanticipated housing gains or losses, what should matter for retirement is not
so much the total amount of the gain but the amount that was unexpected, so the ideal control group would be one
where housing prices rose no more or less than expected. While it is plausible that expectations about house price
appreciation may vary by location, we have no data to guide us on this point, so we must treat all gains or losses in
all locations as (equally) unanticipated.

                                                          15
       Nevertheless, we can use the same methods and somewhat modify our interpretation. In

reality, what we have are groups who were more affected than others in the sense that housing

prices change by more in some locations at some points in time than others. Implementing the

difference-in-difference method with location and time fixed effects enables us to estimate

whether there are greater changes in retirement behavior in areas with greater changes in home

prices. This method still holds constant longstanding differences in retirement behavior across

locations and trends in retirement behavior over time that affect the population as a whole. The

experimental analogy does not work quite as well here, but the general approach is the same and

yields results that plausibly can be interpreted as causal.

       We can further expand upon this approach by incorporated a “third difference” as well.

As with financial wealth, home equity varies across individuals. While we are not able to

identify the exact amount of home equity held by each individual, we can identify home

ownership status in the CPS, allowing us to use those with no equity as a true quasi-control

group. If we find that homeowners increase retirement by more than renters in response to an

equivalent increase in housing prices, this would be consistent with the hypothesis that home

equity affects retirement and provide further support for a causal interpretation of our findings.

C. Application to Changes in Labor Market Conditions

       The methods available to evaluate the impact of changes in labor market conditions, as

measured by the unemployment rate, are similar to those for housing wealth. The unemployment

rate changes in some places at some points in time more than others and we rely on that variation

just like we described with changes in housing prices. We can also estimate difference-in-

difference models separately for different demographic groups, including by educational

attainment. Less-skilled workers tend to be more sensitive to labor market conditions (Hoynes,



                                                  16
2000), so we would expect any impact of an economic downturn on retirements to be larger for

this group. Following the previous literature, we use less-educated as a proxy for less-skilled

workers.   Therefore, we can use the differential responsive in retirement to labor market

conditions across educational attainment categories as a further test of a causal effect.



VI. IMPACT OF LOST STOCK MARKET WEALTH

A. Descriptive analysis

       Before proceeding with our econometric analysis, we begin with a descriptive analysis of

individual equity holdings using data from the 2007 SCF, the most recent data available. Our

goals in this analysis are to determine the level of equity holdings and the differences in holdings

across population subgroups and to get a sense of whether the level of equity holdings may be

sufficient to influence individuals’ retirement behavior if the market rises or falls.

       Table 1 presents information on equity holdings for households headed by individuals

between the ages of 55 and 64, who are likely to be contemplating retirement in the near future.

The results in Table 1 indicate that the typical household’s equity holdings are very small. In

fact, the median values of directly held stocks, stock-based mutual funds, and retirement

accounts (including DC pension plans and Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs) that include

stocks are zero or very close to it. For all stock-based investments combined, the median value

of holdings is just $8,000. The 75th percentile of this distribution is just under $100,000. One

needs to look very high in the distribution in order to find households with very large levels of

stock holdings.

       As previewed earlier, stock ownership is strongly correlated with education. The share of

households with any stock-based investments is 46 percent for high school graduates vs. 78



                                                  17
percent for college graduates.        Furthermore, those with high levels of wealth are heavily

concentrated among more highly educated individuals. For example, the 75th percentile of the

distribution of all stock-based investments is just $28,500 for high school graduates vs. $271,300

for college graduates.

        Despite the relatively low levels of equity holdings for most households in 2007, equity

holdings are even lower at the beginning of our sample period. While estimates for earlier years

are complicated by the fact that some previous SCF surveys did not ask about the asset allocation

in all relevant accounts, we can nonetheless infer that equity holdings have risen dramatically

over time.     Table 1 suggests that the vast majority of stock-based investments for most

households are stocks held in retirement accounts, and participation in these accounts has

increased markedly over time. For example, the Employee Benefit Research Institute (2009)

reports that the share of pension plan participants with a DC plan rose from 34 percent in 1980 to

64 percent in 2005. It seems very likely that stock holdings were much lower when many fewer

households held such accounts and those that did had only recently established the accounts.10

        Table 2 presents a descriptive analysis of the impact that the recent stock market crash

will have on future retirement income based on the 2007 equity holdings reported in Table 1.

We begin by listing different levels of equity holdings ranging from none to $500,000 in Column

1. In Column 2, we identify the fraction of households headed by an individual between ages 55

and 64 that have equity holdings at that level or lower. About 42 percent have no holdings at all

and 75 percent have $100,000 or less; 8 percent have $500,000 or more. In Column 3, we

approximate the loss experienced by households at each the equity threshold, assuming that their

portfolios fell by 50 percent.        We then make the simplifying assumption that households


10
   Despite the growing importance of DC plans, Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai (forthcoming) provide
evidence indicating that DB plans still play a more important role for those currently nearing retirement age.

                                                     18
consume 5 percent of their wealth per year to approximate the lost retirement income resulting

from the market crash. This is reported in Column 4; Column 5 divides this figure by 12 to get

monthly statistics.

        The results of this analysis suggest that if households divide this lost wealth over their

remaining retirement years, the change in income would be modest for most of them. Those

with $100,000 of equity holdings would lose $2,500 per year or $208 per month as a result of the

stock market crash. These are not insignificant values, but the losses are likely to represent a

small percentage of retirement income. The losses are, obviously, even smaller for those with

less invested in equities, a group that includes 75 percent of older households in 2007.

        Our conclusion from this analysis is that, based on our assumptions, there are relatively

few older households that lost enough money in the recent stock market crash that their

retirement income will be substantively diminished.11 Alternative assumptions, however, may

lead one to predict a larger retirement response. Individuals could plan to consume a larger share

of their savings just after they retire, for example to generate retirement income until Social

Security benefits are available. If so, the relatively small amounts of stock holdings that most

households have could lead to a substantial shock to retirement income, if just in the short-run.

This could generate a larger retirement response. In the end, this is an empirical question that we

will address using the regression techniques described earlier.

B. Econometric analysis

        In our econometric analysis, we estimate regression models using data from the March

CPS, where the dependent variable is an indicator variable for retirement and the key


11
   Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai (2009) come to a similar conclusion using even more detailed wealth data
(including Social Security and DB pension wealth) available in the Health and Retirement Survey. In their analysis,
they conclude that the share of wealth associated with equities tends to be so small that even a dramatic decline in
the stock market is unlikely to have retirement implications for many workers.

                                                        19
explanatory variable is the change in the S&P 500 Index. As we discussed earlier, we consider

the one-year change, the five-year change, and the ten-year change because the time frame over

which individuals respond to market fluctuations is not clear.                     We implement the quasi-

experimental approach described earlier where we estimate the response to market changes

across groups that differ by their likelihood of holding substantial amounts of stock.                         For

instance, more educated respondents would be predicted to respond more strongly to market

fluctuations. We also estimate models separately for those 55 to 61 and those 62 to 69, since 62

is the age at which individuals are first eligible for Social Security benefits and that eligibility

may alter responses.12

        The results of this analysis are presented in Table 3. Each cell in this table represents the

results of a separate regression for the demographic groups previously identified. Based on the

results reported here, there is some evidence supporting the notion that stock market fluctuations

alter retirement behavior. This finding is strongest for those with more education who are

between 62 and 69 and in response to long-term market fluctuations. For workers in this age

group, the coefficients on short-run fluctuations are positively signed, though there is no

systematic pattern across educational attainment groups and coefficients are small in magnitude

relative to the mean retirement rate. For example, a one-standard deviation (or 16 percentage

point) increase in the one-year return increases the retirement rate of college graduates by 0.4

points, or 3.2 percent relative to the mean retirement rate of 11.7 percent. For the ten-year

return, however, the pattern across educational groups is consistent with what we would predict




12
  We have also estimated regression models in which the effect of stock market fluctuations is allowed to vary over
time, to allow for the possibility that the response has strengthened as the number of workers with stock market
assets and the value of those assets has risen. We fail to find consistent evidence in support of this hypothesis.

                                                        20
and the magnitude of the coefficients is greater.13 A one-standard deviation (or 77 percentage

point) increase in the ten-year return increases the retirement rate of college graduates by 1.5

points, or 12.9 percent relative to the mean.

        For those workers age 55 to 61, few coefficients are statistically significantly different

from zero and there is no systematic pattern in coefficients across education groups. Point

estimates on short-run fluctuations are mainly wrong-signed.



VII. IMPACT OF LOST HOUSING WEALTH

        Next, we turn to our econometric analysis of the effect of housing market fluctuations on

retirement. As discussed above, this analysis is largely similar to the stock market analysis,

except that we now have a true quasi-control group, renters. We thus compare results by home

ownership status rather than education level. As before, we examine the effect of the market

return over different time periods, one and five years. As discussed earlier, we use two price

indices to measure the variation in home prices, the Case-Shiller Index and the OFHEO index,

and identify the effects of home prices on retirement based on geographic differences in home

price changes over time.

        The results of this exercise are presented in Table 4. When we group all households

together, we find no evidence that home price fluctuations affect retirement. For both indices,

time horizons, and age groups, the coefficients are generally wrong-signed and statistically

insignificant. Estimating the effect separately by home ownership status does not change the



13
  We have also estimated similar regression models distinguishing workers by whether or not they are covered by a
private pension. The type of pension held (DB versus DC) or the dollar amount of their holdings is not reported, but
those with pensions are likely to have greater stock market wealth than those without, forming another type of quasi-
experiment. Results by pension status are not shown in the interest of space, but are consistent with the results by
education group, in that they are more in line with our expectations for older workers than for younger workers and
for long-term fluctuations than for short-run fluctuations. These results are available from the authors on request.

                                                        21
results substantively, as most coefficients are again wrong-signed and insignificant. Thus we

find no evidence that retirement is responsive to home price fluctuations. This finding is

consistent with the previous literature suggesting that most households do not consume their

home equity in retirement. Given our results, we make no attempt to include any changes in

retirement resulting from home price fluctuations in the simulations of the effect of current

market conditions on retirement presented below.



VIII. IMPACT OF LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS

A. Descriptive Analysis

       Before reporting our econometric results, we begin by presenting a descriptive analysis

designed to gauge the magnitude of the potential retirement response brought about by a weak

labor market. Are there enough unemployed older workers and is the likelihood of their labor

force withdrawal sufficiently large that we would be able to identify whether a labor market

shock would generate an aggregate retirement effect?

       To begin to address this issue, we first examine the level of unemployment among older

workers and how this varies over the business cycle, using official statistics from the Bureau of

Labor Statistics and our own calculations from the CPS. Older workers are less likely than the

average worker to be unemployed. Unemployment rates for all workers cycle around a value in

the vicinity of 6 percent, while the comparable figure for those 55 to 69 is more like 4 percent.

The actual number of older workers who experience some unemployment over a given period

(like a year), though, is greater than that. The unemployment rate is a point-in-time measure

rather than a longer window available in a retrospective measure. Our calculations indicate that




                                               22
the number of workers 55 to 69 experiencing some unemployment over the past year is a number

more like 8 percent with cyclical swings similar to those in the official unemployment rate.14

        Earlier in this paper, we argued that we did not expect much of an aggregate retirement

response to lost stock market wealth since so few individuals hold much wealth. Yet the number

of people affected by labor market shocks is probably not a lot different. We would therefore

only observe a bigger effect of labor market fluctuations on retirement if older workers who

experience unemployment are quite likely to retire. In fact, this is what the evidence shows.

        We first provide some descriptive evidence on this point using data from the Displaced

Worker Survey (DWS), another supplement to the CPS. A displaced worker is someone who

lost their job because of a plant closing, slack demand, or because their position was abolished.

We calculate the rate at which workers displaced within the last three to five years withdrew

from the labor force by the survey date. For those workers aged 20 to 54, roughly 10 percent

withdrew. For those aged 55 to 69, roughly 30 percent withdrew. These withdrawals of older

workers would be defined as a retirement, based on the operational definition of the term used in

this analysis. Thus workers are very likely to retire in response to a job displacement.

        Using our March CPS data directly, we can also distinguish retirement rates between

unemployed older workers and others. Figures 4 and 5 present the results from such an analysis.

In Figure 4, we present retirement hazard rates by age over the 1980 to 2007 sample period and

in Figure 5 we present retirement hazard rates by year over the 55 to 69 age range.15 In both

figures, solid (dashed) lines represent the retirement rates for workers who experienced no

(some) unemployment in the year preceding the survey. At all ages and in all years it is clear


14
  See Levine (1993) for a comparison of retrospective and contemporaneous measures of unemployment.
15
  An older worker who is in the labor force in, say, 2003, and withdraws by the March 2004 survey is said to retire
in the year 2003. We define that worker’s age according to the March 2004 reported age less one to approximate
age in 2003.

                                                        23
that unemployed older workers have higher retirement rates. These results along with those from

the DWS are not conclusive in showing that unemployment “causes” increased retirement rates

because workers who experience a job displacement or unemployment may be more likely to

withdraw from the labor force for other reasons.            Nonetheless, we view this evidence as

supportive of a relationship between unemployment and retirement among older workers.

        Figure 5 provides additional evidence that unemployment may serve as a constraint that

forces workers into retirement. For workers who experience no unemployment, there is a

noticeable trend towards lower retirement rates over time. Annual retirement rates for these

workers are about 10 percent in the beginning of the sample period, but begin to decline in the

early 1990s, reaching a level of 6 percent by 2007. This pattern is consistent with the recent

trend towards greater labor force participation among older workers. Interestingly, no such

pattern exists among workers experiencing some unemployment. For them, retirement rates

remain roughly constant (albeit a bit noisy due to smaller sample sizes) at around 16 percent.

This suggests that whatever factors are driving many workers to choose to remain in the labor

force longer are not influencing the behavior of unemployed older workers.16 This would lead

one to believe that other constraints may be dominating their behavior. Again, this evidence is

merely suggestive that unemployment may play an important role in the retirement process for

some workers. We move on to discuss the results of our econometric analysis next.

B. Econometric Analysis

        The results of our econometric analysis are reported in Table 5. In the left part of the

table we show results for the full sample as well as separate estimates for workers ages 55 to 61

and 62 to 69. On the whole, we find evidence that older workers’ retirement behavior is


16
  Friedberg and Webb (2003) argue that the shift from DB to DC pensions can explain some of this increase;
Gustman and Steinmeier (2008) make a similar argument with respect to changes in Social Security rules.

                                                   24
responsive to changes in labor market conditions. A one percentage point increase in the

unemployment rate increases the annual retirement rate by 0.18 percentage points. The average

retirement rate is 9 percent per year, so this translates into a two percent increase relative to the

mean. In the current crisis, the unemployment rate has risen by around five percentage points so

far. Our estimates suggest this would increase retirements by 0.9 percentage points, or ten

percent relative to the mean retirement rate.

       Breaking up our sample by age, we find that the entire effect is driven by those who are

62 to 69. For 55 to 61 year old workers our results indicate a small and statistically insignificant

effect of higher unemployment rates. For workers between the ages of 62 and 69, we find that a

one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate would generate a 0.36 percentage point

increase in the retirement rate. The five percentage point jump in the unemployment rate

experienced recently is predicted to increase the rate of retirement by 1.8 percentage points, or

12 percent relative to the average retirement rate of 15.6 percent.

       As in past analyses, we also estimate our models by education group; we report these

results in the right part of Table 5. We find that high school graduates’ retirement decisions are

most responsive to a weak labor market. For them, a five percentage point increase in the

unemployment rate would generate a 1.8 percentage point increase in the retirement rate, a 19

percent increase relative to the mean. More-educated workers do not increase their retirement

significantly (in either a statistical or economic sense) in response to rising unemployment rates.

Based on this evidence, we conclude that changes in labor market conditions have an important

effect on retirement decisions, particularly for less-educated workers.



IX. OVERALL IMPACT ON RETIREMENT



                                                 25
       The results that we have presented suggest that the stock market may cause some workers

to delay retirement. In particular, in response to long-term declines in the value of stocks, highly

educated workers between the ages of 62 and 69 appear to respond by reducing their likelihood

of retirement. We find no support for the idea that declining housing values will have much

impact in retirement. A likely explanation for this fact, as past research would suggest, is that

few older workers use their housing wealth to finance retirement consumption. The impact of a

sharply contracting labor market appears to be a relevant, and apparently overlooked, factor in

forecasting coming retirement trends.

       Taken together, our results suggest that retirements in the near term are likely to fall

because of the long-term decline in equity prices, be largely unaffected by the decline in housing

prices, and rise because of the increase in the unemployment rate. The net effect is uncertain

because the effect of the long-term decline in stock prices and the rapidly rising unemployment

rate tend to offset each other.

       To assess the relative magnitudes of the two effects, we conduct a simulation exercise

designed to estimate the number of individuals in a birth cohort likely to be affected by the

recent changes in the stock market and the labor market. The results of this analysis are reported

in Table 6. We begin by using data from the 2005 through 2007 American Community Survey

(ACS) to estimate the size of the labor force by exact age. We find that there are 2.8 million

individuals in the labor force at exact age 55, a figure that declines to 1.4 million at age 62,

800,000 at age 65, and 400,000 at age 69. Then we apply to these data age-specific hazard rates

that we estimate using the March CPS data to arrive at the number of retirements we would

predict over the course of a typical year at each exact age. These statistics represent a baseline of




                                                 26
the “typical” number of expected retirements per year. In total, about 2 million workers between

the ages of 55 to 69 would be expected to retire per year, on average.

        The remainder of the table simulates the impact of the changes in retirement brought

about by the weak labor market and the plunging stock market. We use the results presented in

Tables 3 and 5 to implement this. In both cases, we use the regression coefficients relating

changes in market conditions to changes in retirement rates that were estimated separately for

workers ages 55 to 61 and 62 to 69. For the stock market, we focus on the ten-year change in the

S&P 500 index and simulate the effect of a 110 point drop in the return, which is equivalent to

moving from the average ten-year return during the past thirty years (62 percent) to the ten-year

return experienced in the period ending in 2008 (-48 percent). For the labor market we estimate

the impact of a five percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, approximating the

actual rise in that rate from the low point of 4.4 percent in March 2007 to 9.4 percent in May

2009.   The product of these changes in market conditions and the age-specific coefficient

estimates from Tables 3 and 5 yields estimates of the change in hazard rates. We apply these

estimates to the baseline hazard rate to obtain “adjusted” hazard rates. The product of the

adjusted hazard rates and the actual number of workers in the labor force at each age provides an

estimate of the adjusted number of individuals retiring. Taking the difference between these new

estimates of the number of annual retirements and the number in the base case provides an

estimate of the impact of the changes in market conditions on retirement.

        The results presented in Table 6 suggest that 86,000 workers who otherwise would have

retired will not do so as a result of the declining stock market that year. As that return converges

back to normal rates, the annual number of delayed retirements will decline. As a simple

example, suppose that it took five years for the market to revert to normal long-term rates of



                                                27
return at a linear rate. In this case, our simulations suggest that 258,000 workers would delay

retirement over the course of the market downturn.

       On the other hand, our estimates indicate that 126,000 workers will be forced into

retirement this year as a result of the weak labor market. Similarly assuming a linear return to

normal labor market conditions over a five-year period, we project that 378,000 workers will be

forced to retire early as a result of the recession. Importantly, these results indicate that almost

50 percent more workers will be forced to retire because of the weak labor market than will be

forced to work longer because they cannot afford to retire. On net, we predict that almost

120,000 additional retirements will occur as a result of the economic crisis.

       We would further argue that the impact of a weak labor market on older workers’ well-

being may well be more significant than that of a weak stock market even if the number of older

workers affected by each were similar. As we highlighted earlier, those workers forced to stay in

the labor force because the falling stock market reduced their retirement nest egg tend to be from

wealthier households. The plunging stock market cannot hurt those without large stock holdings

in the first place. For these workers, the alternative to retirement may be to work for another two

or three years so that they have fewer years of retirement to finance and may replenish some of

their lost wealth with additional savings. We do not mean to diminish this cost for those

workers. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the weak labor market has its greatest impact on

less educated workers who have fewer resources in the first place. Workers who are unable to

replace labor earnings lost due to a job displacement by extending their working lives are likely

to have lower levels of consumption for the rest of their lives. For instance, they may need to

claim Social Security earlier than planned in order to make ends meet. Although the adjustment

to Social Security benefits for early claiming is designed to be roughly actuarially fair, the



                                                28
worker’s annual flow of income from this source is reduced if he retires earlier, increasing the

household’s risk of poverty in old age. The cost to these individuals appears to us to be greater

than that experienced by workers with substantial stock holdings who are forced to work a few

extra years to make up for equity losses.



X. CONCLUSIONS

       Taken as a whole, our results indicate that the public discussion regarding the impact of

the recent economic crisis on retirement is off target. Some relatively wealthier workers will be

forced to delay retirement, but a larger number of workers with fewer economic resources will be

forced into retirement because of their inability to find new jobs. These workers may need to

start collecting retirement benefits now to make ends meet, resulting in lower income in

retirement and an increased risk of poverty in old age. Indeed, the fact that Social Security

claims have risen sharply since the recession began suggests this response has already begun.

Despite a wealth of media attention to the effect of the economic crisis on older workers, the

risks they face as a result of weak labor markets have gone largely unnoticed.

       More generally, our findings suggest that the role of labor market conditions in workers’

retirement decisions has not received sufficient attention from economists. For example, while

our earlier work suggests that the impact of unemployment on retirement is comparable in

magnitude to that of poor health, the amount of research exploring the impact of health on

retirement decisions dwarfs that on labor market conditions.

       Our finding that labor market conditions are an important determinant of retirement

decisions may also have important implications for public policy. One example of this is the

debate over raising the Social Security normal and early retirement ages. With individuals living



                                               29
longer and drawing more Social Security benefits over their lifetimes than in the past, one

possible reform to help address the financial shortfalls in the Social Security system is to raise

the retirement ages. In the past, a common criticism regarding such proposals is that they will

harm those individuals who are forced to retire involuntarily because of poor health.           A

substantial body of evidence exists supporting the notion that poor health is an important prelude

to retirement for some older workers (Currie and Madrian, 1999). Our findings indicate that

unemployment may be another involuntary mechanism that leads to retirement. The concerns of

of older workers with weak labor market prospects may need additional consideration in the

design of policies for workers nearing retirement age.
