Inference in Structural Vector Autoregressions When the Identifying Assumptions are Not
Fully Believed: Re-evaluating the Role of Monetary Policy in Economic Fluctuations

                                         ABSTRACT

Reporting point estimates and error bands for structural vector autoregressions that are only set
identified is a very common practice. However, unless the researcher is persuaded on the basis of
prior information that some parameter values are more plausible than others, this common
practice has no formal justification. When the role and reliability of prior information is
defended, Bayesian posterior probabilities can be used to form an inference that incorporates
doubts about the identifying assumptions. We illustrate how prior information can be used about
both structural coefficients and the impacts of shocks, and propose a new distribution, which we
call the asymmetric t distribution, for incorporating prior beliefs about the signs of equilibrium
impacts in a nondogmatic way. We apply these methods to a three-variable macroeconomic
model and conclude that monetary policy shocks were not the major driver of output, inflation, or
interest rates during the Great Moderation.

1     Introduction.

A common approach to interpreting economic relations uses structural models of the form


                                           Ayt = Bxt−1 + ut                                     (1)


for yt an (n×1) vector of observed variables at date t, A an (n×n) matrix summarizing their

contemporaneous structural relations, xt−1 a (k × 1) vector (with k = mn + 1) containing a
                                       ′
constant and m lags of y (x′t−1 = (yt−1 , yt−2
                                           ′           ′
                                               , ..., yt−m , 1)′ ), and ut white noise with variance

matrix D. Knowledge of θ, a vector collecting the unknown elements in A, B, and D, would

allow us to draw conclusions about how the variables are causally related.

    The reduced form of this structural model is a vector autoregression (VAR):


                                           yt = Φxt−1 + εt                                      (2)


                                              Φ = A−1 B                                         (3)

                                             εt = A−1 ut .                                      (4)

The parameters of the VAR, Φ and Ω = E(εt ε′t ), can be estimated by OLS regressions.

The problem is that knowing the VAR parameters Φ and Ω is not enough to infer θ.

    Estimating θ requires additional information about the structural model. For example,

θ would be identiﬁed if we knew that A is lower triangular and D is diagonal, corresponding

to the popular Cholesky or recursive identiﬁcation scheme. However, such restrictions are

rarely completely convincing.      For this reason, it has recently become quite common to

draw conclusions about θ using weaker assumptions, for example, knowing only the signs

                                                  1
of the eﬀects of certain shocks, an approach pioneered by Faust (1998), Canova and De

Nicoló (2002) and Uhlig (2005). The most popular algorithm for doing this was developed

by Rubio-Ramírez et al. (2010): (1) generate a draw for Ω from the posterior distribution

resulting from an uninformative Normal-inverse-Wishart prior for Φ and Ω; (2) ﬁnd the

Cholesky factorization Ω = PP′ ; (3) draw an orthonormal matrix Q from a Haar-uniform

distribution; (4) propose PQ as a candidate draw for the value for the impact matrix; and

(5) keep the draw if it satisﬁes the sign restrictions.

      Researchers typically report the median of the set of accepted values as the most plausible

estimate of structural objects of interest and bands around the median containing 68% or

90% of the accepted values as if they were credible sets or error bands. Online Appendix C

provides a list of close to a hundred representative studies that have all done this.

      To illustrate our concern with this method, consider a simple 3-variable macroeconomic

model based on the output gap, inﬂation, and fed funds rate. Suppose our interest is in

what happens to the output gap s quarters after a monetary policy contraction that raises

the fed funds rate by 25 basis points. We calculated the answer to this question using the

Rubio-Ramírez et al. (2010) algorithm with one important departure from usual practice—

we did not impose any sign restrictions at all, but simply kept every single draw for PQ

from step (4) as a potential answer to the question.1     Panel A of Figure 1 shows the median

along with a band that contains 68% of the generated draws at each horizon. The graph

raises a troubling question. The solid line seems to suggest that we have an estimate of the

  1
      See Appendix A for details of the algorithm.



                                                     2
likely eﬀect and the shaded regions seem to summarize our conﬁdence in this conclusion.

How can we claim to have done this if we have not made any assumptions?

   Panel B clariﬁes what is going on by plotting the histogram of the draws for the eﬀect at

horizon s = 0. The randomness of this distribution comes from two sources. The ﬁrst is the

distribution across diﬀerent draws of Ω in step (2). This randomness comes from uncertainty

about the value of Ω because we have only observed a ﬁnite number of observations on yt .

If we had an inﬁnite number of observations, this distribution would collapse to a point

mass at the maximum likelihood estimate Ω̂. The second source of randomness results from

random draws of the orthonormal matrix Q in step (3).       The randomness of this second

distribution is something introduced by the algorithm itself and has nothing to do with the

data.

   Panels C and D of Figure 1 clarify the respective contributions of these two sources of

randomness by shutting down the ﬁrst one altogether. To generate these panels, we simply
                                                                                      ′
ﬁxed Ω at the maximum likelihood estimate Ω̂ with Cholesky factorization Ω̂ = P̂P̂ , and

generated 50,000 draws of Q, keeping every single draw of P̂Q. The randomness in panels

C and D comes only from the distribution of Q and has nothing to do with uncertainty

from the data. Panel D is virtually identical to Panel B. Baumeister and Hamilton (2015,

equation (34)) showed that this is a Cauchy distribution with location and scale parameters

known functions of Ω̂.

   Nevertheless, every draw for P̂Q by construction ﬁts the observed data Ω̂ equally well.

If we let h denote the magnitude on the horizontal axis in panel D, for any h ∈ (−∞, +∞),



                                             3
there exists a value of Q for which that value of h would be perfectly consistent with

the observed Ω̂.       If we claim (as the median line and error bands in Panel C seem to)

that some values of h are more plausible than others, what exactly is the basis for that

conclusion? Since there is no basis in the data for choosing one value P̂Q over any other,

any plot highlighting the median or 68% credibility sets of the generated P̂Q is relying on

an implicit Bayesian prior distribution, according to which some values of h were regarded

a priori to be more plausible than others. If that is the researchers’ intention, then their

use of 68% credibility bands would be ﬁne. But none of the papers listed in Appendix C

openly acknowledge that a key reason that certain outcomes appear to be ruled out by their

credibility bands is because the researcher simply ruled them out a priori even though they

are perfectly consistent with all the observed data.2

       In the last two panels of Figure 1 we perform a slightly more conventional application of

the method and only keep the draw from step (4) if it implies that a contractionary monetary

shock raises the fed funds rate and lowers output. Panel E looks more like something one

might try to publish. But Panel F clariﬁes that it is simply a truncation of the distribution

in panels B or D, numerically shifting the median and all quantiles of the distribution down.

There is again no basis in the data for choosing one point in this distribution, or some subset

of this distribution, over any other.3

   2
      Arias, Rubio-Ramírez, and Waggoner (2018) acknowledged that their prior over (Φ, Ω, Q) implies a
prior over (A, D, B), but did not mention the fact that the bounds for 68% error bands for functions of
(A, D, B) that emerge from their procedure depend fundamentally on giving an informative role to the
distribution used to generate Q.
   3
     Song (2014) noted that if we have a minimax loss function, it might be reasonable to report the midpoint
of the identiﬁed set. However, this is not the same as the median draw and moreover does not exist in the



                                                     4
       There are two ways one can try to do this correctly. One is to remain faithful to the

idea that we know absolutely nothing besides the sign restrictions. If this is the goal, then a

researcher should not be reporting point estimates or quantiles of a distribution, but should

instead describe the complete set of values in which a parameter of interest θ could be,

known as the “identiﬁed set.” For Panel B the identiﬁed set is the real line, while for Panel

F it is the set of all negative real numbers.4          But the plotted error bands in Panels A and

E give the misleading impression that we somehow know more than this on the basis of the

sign restrictions alone.5      Moon et al. (forthcoming) and Gafarov et al. (2018) developed

algorithms to estimate the identiﬁed set or its bounds using a frequentist approach, while

Kline and Tamer (2016) discussed Bayesian posterior inference about the identiﬁed set in

a general context. Giacomini and Kitagawa (2015) and Gafarov et al. (2016) noted that

the identiﬁed set could be interpreted and calculated as robust Bayesian posterior inference

across the set of all possible Bayesian prior distributions.

       But the fact that nearly a hundred prominent studies listed in Appendix C have summa-

rized results based on a strict subset of the identiﬁed set suggests to us a need to clarify the

conditions under which such a practice could be justiﬁed. In this paper we demonstrate that

such a justiﬁcation could come from Bayesian optimal statistical decision theory. Suppose
two examples in Figure 1 in which the identiﬁed set is unbounded.
   4
     For some questions that the researcher might ask the identiﬁed set may be bounded by deﬁnition. For
example, the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality implies that the absolute value of the eﬀect of a one-standard
deviation shock to structural equation j on variable i cannot exceed the unconditional standard deviation
of the innovation to the reduced-form residual for variable i; see Baumeister and Hamilton (2015, p. 1973).
   5
     As one imposes additional restrictions the identiﬁed set may become bounded and therefore potentially
interesting to report, though often diﬃcult to characterize analytically. See Amir-Ahmadi and Uhlig (2015)
for an analysis of how the size of the identiﬁed set can shrink with additional restrictions.



                                                    5
we were willing to let our inference be guided not just by prior information about signs

but also about magnitudes.     For example, it seems pretty unlikely that a 25-basis-point

interest-rate hike would lead to a decline in output as large as 1% and even less likely that

it could lead to a 5% decline. There is a sensible statistical inference in such a setting that

comes from weighting the diﬀerent elements in the identiﬁed set by their prior plausibility.

This implicitly is what researchers are doing with existing methods, with one very important

diﬀerence— they do not claim that the distribution in Panel B is a reasonable representation

of prior information or even acknowledge that prior information like this has had an inﬂuence

on the summary statistics they report.

   As noted by Baumeister and Hamilton (2015, 2017), using Bayesian priors to assign

plausibility to diﬀerent magnitudes within the identiﬁed set can also be regarded as a strict

generalization of full identiﬁcation. For example, Cholesky identiﬁcation can be viewed as

a dogmatic prior in which certain elements of A are known with certainty to be zero. This

can be generalized with an informative prior that those elements of A are likely to be close

to zero, though we’re not completely certain they are exactly zero.

   In Section 2 we demonstrate that for typical loss functions, the optimal estimate of a

structural impulse-response function in an unidentiﬁed model with an informative prior can

be obtained from the Bayesian posterior mean or posterior median, calculated pointwise for

each horizon. This provides a formal justiﬁcation for the procedure typically adopted by

users of sign-restricted SVARs, provided they are willing to acknowledge the role played by

an informative prior.    Our analysis also addresses the concern raised by Fry and Pagan



                                              6
(2011) that the posterior median impulse-response function from a sign-restricted SVAR is

not consistent with any ﬁxed value for θ.

    Analogous results hold for calculating the contributions of individual structural shocks to

a given historical episode of interest. To our knowledge, every application of sign-restricted

SVARs prior to ours simply plotted the median paths for historical decompositions with

no error bands. We show that it is straightforward to characterize both an optimal point

estimate and posterior conﬁdence in this estimate as long as the prior used in the analysis

is explicit.

    Section 3 illustrates these methods using a three-variable macroeconomic model.        We

show how information about either the structural coeﬃcients in A or the equilibrium impacts

of structural shocks (A−1 ) can be used to inform structural conclusions. We ﬁnd no strong

evidence of an eﬀect on output lasting beyond a few quarters, and monetary policy shocks

typically make only a modest contribution to economic ﬂuctuations.

    Section 4 demonstrates that our key conclusions do not change if we were to throw out

completely any one of the individual sources of information from which our prior is built.

Section 5 shows how the approach could be applied to larger dimensional systems, while

Section 6 brieﬂy concludes.


2     Inference in the presence of doubts about the iden-
      tifying assumptions.

 Let YT = (y1′ , y2′ , ..., yT′ )′ denote the vector of observed data.   Given a distributional

assumption for the structural shocks in equation (1), the likelihood function p(YT |θ) can be

                                                7
calculated. For example, if ut ∼ N(0, D),


      p(YT |θ) = (2π)−T n/2 | det(A(θ))|T |D(θ)|−T /2 ×

where | det(A)| denotes the absolute value of the determinant of A. Given a prior distrib-

ution p(θ), the Bayesian posterior distribution is

                                                       p(YT |θ)p(θ)dθ

      From the reduced-form VAR in (2) we can calculate the nonorthogonalized impulse-

response function at horizon s,

2.1     Inference and credibility sets for impulse-response functions.

Typically researchers are interested in the dynamic eﬀects of the jth structural shock given

by the jth column of

                                               Hs = Ψs A−1 .                                      (8)

Let hsij (θ) be the (i, j) element of this matrix and consider the (S × 1) vector hij (θ) =

                           S−1
(h0ij (θ), h1ij (θ), ..., hij  (θ))′ . According to Bayesian statistical decision theory, the estimate

of this (S × 1) vector should be the value ĥij that minimizes the expected loss where this

expectation is taken with respect to the posterior distribution of θ:


                             ĥij = arg         g(hij (θ), h̃ij )p(θ|Y T )dθ.                     (9)
                                    min h̃ij


Here g(hij , ĥij ) summarizes the loss if our estimate of the function is ĥij but the true value

is hij . A leading example is the quadratic loss function:


                         g(hij (θ), ĥij ) = [ĥij − hij (θ)]′ W[ĥij − hij (θ)]                 (10)


for W a positive deﬁnite (S × S) weighting matrix. More importance to the rth element

of hij is represented with a larger value for (r, r) element of W, while the (r, s) oﬀ-diagonal

term allows an error in term r to inﬂuence the marginal beneﬁt of getting term s correct.

   Let h∗ij denote the posterior mean of hij :


                                    h∗ij =       hij (θ)p(θ|Y T )dθ.




                                                     9
It turns out7 that the vector of posterior means is the solution to (9): ĥij = h∗ij . In other

words, the point-by-point posterior means of each individual element of the impulse-response

function represent the values we should use even when our interest is in the entire function

hij regardless of the value of the weights W. Note that this optimal estimate can easily be

calculated pointwise from the set of posterior draws, namely

                                N                          N                                  N
            ĥ′ij = N −1        ℓ=1   h0ij (θ(ℓ) ), N −1   ℓ=1   h1ij (θ(ℓ) ), · · · , N −1   ℓ=1
                                                                                                     S−1
                                                                                                    hij  (θ (ℓ) ) .


Ninety-ﬁve percent posterior credibility regions can be calculated from the upper and lower

2.5% quantiles of hsij (θ (ℓ) ).

              ∂ ĥsij

which equals zero when ĥsij satisﬁes Pr hsij (θ) ≤ ĥsij |YT = 0.5.

estimate ĥij is the posterior median of hsij (θ(ℓ) ).9

       To relate this conclusion to the Fry and Pagan (2011) critique, consider the special

case of a univariate AR(1), yt = θyt−1 + εt .                   Suppose that our object of interest is the

impulse response at horizons 1 and 2: h(θ)′ = (∂yt+1 /∂εt , ∂yt+2 /∂εt ) = θ, θ2 . Suppose for

illustration that the posterior distribution is Gaussian: θ|YT ∼ N(µ, σ 2 ). Then


                               h∗′ = E(θ|YT ), E(θ 2 |YT ) = µ, µ2 + σ 2 .                                         (11)


It might seem odd at ﬁrst that the optimal estimate of the second element, µ2 + σ 2 , is

not the square of the estimate of the ﬁrst element, µ, given that the second element of h

for any ﬁxed value of θ is always the square of the ﬁrst. But this diﬀerence between the

optimal estimates of ∂yt+1 /∂εt and that for ∂yt+2 /∂εt is a necessary implication of Jensen’s

inequality given that the elements of the impulse-response function are nonlinear functions

of the underlying parameter θ. An estimate such as h̃′ = (µ, µ2 ), would result in a higher

value for the expected loss than does the vector h∗ given in (11). This is because h̃ gives

a worse estimate of the second element of h and no better estimate of the ﬁrst element

compared to h∗ .

       Some researchers have proceeded as if their loss function for choosing θ̂ is

                                                                ′
                                  g(θ, θ̂) = [h(θ) − h(θ̂)] W[h(θ) − h(θ̂)]                                        (12)

by a given value of θ on top of each other for i, j = 1, ..., n. Unlike (10), the solution θ̂
                                                                                           ∗                  ∗
   9
     That is, for each individual i, j, and s, we order the draws such that hsij (θ(ℓi,j,s +1) ) > hsij (θ(ℓi,j,s ) ) and
                       ∗
take ĥsij = hsij (θ (ℓi,j,s ) ) for ℓ∗i,j,s = N/2.

to this problem will depend on the weights W and will have the property for the AR(1)

example that
                                                          2
                                        h(θ̂)′ = θ̂, θ̂       .                           (13)

Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) proposed constructing estimates of θ directly

from this loss function, and Fry and Pagan (2011) and Inoue and Kilian (2013) argued for

the importance of the apparent internal consistency provided by (13). From the perspective

of statistical decision theory, which approach is better depends on whether the loss function

is taken to be (10) or (12). In most applied studies, the emphasis is usually on estimates of

the impulse-response functions h. Indeed, estimates of the parameters θ are typically never

even reported, suggesting that the appropriate loss function is (10) rather than (12). This

means that in most cases researchers would likely want to report the pointwise posterior

means or pointwise posterior medians of h rather than some other estimates.

2.2      Inference and credibility sets for historical decompositions.

Another feature in which applied researchers are often interested is the contribution of dif-

ferent structural shocks to particular historical episodes of interest. If we knew the value of

θ we could write the value of yt+s as a known function of initial conditions at time t plus the

reduced-form innovations between t + 1 and t + s (e.g., Hamilton, 1994, equation [10.1.14])


      yt+s = Ψ0 (θ)εt+s + Ψ1 (θ)εt+s−1 + Ψ2 (θ)εt+s−2 + · · · + Ψs−1 (θ)εt+1 + Gs (θ)xt   (14)


for Ψs (θ) the nonorthogonalized impulse-response matrix in (7) and Gs (θ) the ﬁrst n rows

of the matrix in footnote 6. Conditional on the observed data YT and on knowing θ we

                                                12
would also know the value of each structural shock at each date in the sample with certainty:


                                     ut (θ, Y T ) = Ayt − Bxt−1 .


Using (4) we could then write the contribution of structural shocks between t + 1 and t + s

to the value of yt+s as


              H0 (θ)ut+s (θ, YT ) + H1 (θ)ut+s−1 (θ, YT ) + · · · + Hs−1 (θ)ut+1 (θ, YT )


for Hs (θ) the matrix in (8). The contribution to the value of yt of structural shock j over

the most recent s periods is thus given by the (n × 1) vector


              ζ jts (θ, Y T ) = H0 (θ) [ej ⊙ ut (θ, Y T )] + H1 (θ) [ej ⊙ ut−1 (θ, Y T )] +

                                · · · + Hs−1 (θ) [ej ⊙ ut−s+1 (θ, YT )]                               (15)


where ej denotes the jth column of In and ⊙ denotes element-by-element multiplication.

       From a Bayesian perspective, the uncertainty about ζ jts (θ, YT ) conditional on having

observed the full sample of data YT is entirely summarized by the posterior distribution

p(θ|YT ). Thus for a quadratic loss function the optimal estimate of the contribution of the

jth structural shock to the evolution of y between dates t − s + 1 and t is10

                                                   N
                                   ζ̂ jts = N −1   ℓ=1   ζ jts (θ (ℓ) , YT ).                         (16)


A 95% credibility set for the eﬀect on variable i can be obtained by sorting ζ ijts (θ(ℓ) , YT ) in
                                                          ∗
increasing order for each i, j and ﬁnding ζ ijts (θ(ℓijs ) , YT ) for ℓ∗ijs = 0.025N and 0.975N.

  10
     One advantage of the quadratic loss function is that the sum of the means equals the mean of the sums,
so that the sum of the jth elements of (15) exactly matches the observed data.

2.3     Inference and credibility sets for variance decompositions.

It follows from the above analysis of equation (14) that conditional on θ the s-period-ahead

error in forecasting the observable variables can be written as

        yt+s − ŷt+s|t = H0 (θ)ut+s + H1 (θ)ut+s−1 + H2 (θ)ut+s−2 + · · · + Hs−1 (θ)ut+1

whose mean squared error (MSE) is

                                                                      n
                       E[(yt+s − ŷt+s|t )(yt+s − ŷt+s|t )′ |θ] =    j=1   Qjs (θ)

                                                   s−1
                              Qjs (θ) = djj (θ)    k=0   hj (k; θ)hj (k; θ)′

for hj (k; θ) the jth column of Hk (θ) and djj (θ) the (j, j) element of D. The contribution

of structural shock j to the s-period-ahead MSE of the ith element of yt+s is given by the

(i, i) element of Qjs (θ). An estimate of this magnitude could be obtained from the posterior

mean or median across draws of θ(ℓ) , ℓ = 1, ..., N.


3      Bayesian inference in a 3-variable macro model.

Here we illustrate these methods using a commonly studied 3-variable quarterly macroeco-

nomic model11 with yt = (yt , π t , rt )′ , where yt denotes the output gap (100 times the log

diﬀerence between observed and potential real GDP as estimated by the Congressional Bud-

get Oﬃce), π t the inﬂation rate (measured by 100 times the year-over-year log change in the

personal consumption expenditures deﬂator), and rt the nominal interest rate (measured by

the average value for the fed funds rate over the quarter).

  11
     Equations (17)-(19) can be motivated from the 3-variable macro models studied by Rotemberg and
Woodford (1997), Lubik and Schorfheide (2004), Del Negro and Schorfheide (2004), Giordani (2004), Benati
and Surico (2009), and Rubio-Ramirez, Waggoner, and Zha (2010).

where xt−1 = (yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., yt−m , 1)′ and ust denotes a shock to supply, udt the demand shock,

and um
     t the monetary policy shock. We take the number of lags m to be four quarters.
                                                                                   12

In the absence of additional information about the elements of A, the model would be

unidentiﬁed and there would be no basis for drawing conclusions from the data about the

eﬀects of monetary policy. The conventional approach is to impose hard restrictions on the

elements of A, which can be interpreted as a dogmatic prior. Here we propose instead to use

prior beliefs about the underlying economic structure in a less dogmatic fashion, claiming

that we do know something about plausible values for these parameters, but do not know any

of the values with certainty. We follow Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) in writing the prior

the priors p(A), p(D|A) and p(B|A, D) in the following subsections.

3.2    Prior information about contemporaneous structural coeﬃ-
       cients.

Often theoretical macroeconomic models assume a special case of (19) such as


               rt − r̄ = (1 − ρ)ψ y yt + (1 − ρ)ψ π (π t − π ∗ ) + ρ(rt−1 − r̄) + um
                                                                                   t ,         (21)


where ψ y and ψ π describe the Fed’s long-run response to output and inﬂation, π ∗ is the

Fed’s long-run inﬂation target, r̄ is the sum of π ∗ and the long-run real interest rate, and ρ

reﬂects the Fed’s desire to implement changes gradually over time. Taylor (1993) proposed

values of ψ y = 0.5 and ψ π = 1.5. We will represent this information about how monetary

policy may be conducted with a Student t prior for ψ y with mode at 0.5, scale parameter

0.4, and degrees of freedom ν ψ = 3, truncated to be positive.            A Normal distribution is

a special case of the Student t when ν ψ → ∞. Our choice of ν ψ = 3 allows substantially

bigger tail probabilities than the Normal.        This density is plotted as the solid curve in

the lower-left panel of Figure 2.     It assigns an 82% prior probability that ψ y is between

0 and 1 and a 98% prior probability that it is between 0 and 2.               For our prior for ψ π

we used a Student t distribution with mode at 1.5, scale parameter 0.4, and 3 degrees of

freedom, again truncated to be positive.         This density is the solid curve in the bottom

middle panel of Figure 2. For the smoothing parameter ρ we follow Lubik and Schorfheide

(2004) and Del Negro and Schorfheide (2004) in using a Beta distribution with mean 0.5

                                                 16
and standard deviation 0.2 plotted in the bottom right panel.13 Priors for these and other

contemporaneous parameters are summarized in Table 1.

      The joint distribution for the elements in the last row of (20) is thus that of a two-

dimensional random variable characterized by


                                   (ζ y , ζ π ) = ((1 − ρ)ψ y , (1 − ρ)ψ π )                (22)


where ρ, ψ y , and ψ π have the distributions described in Table 1. The parameter ρ will also

give us information about the lagged structural coeﬃcients bm in (19) as we will describe in

Section 3.5.

      The aggregate demand equation (18) is sometimes viewed as the implication of a con-

sumption Euler equation or dynamic IS curve of the form


                                yt = cd + ξyt+1|t − τ (rt − π t+1|t ) + udt                 (23)


where ξ is the weight on the forward-looking component of the IS curve, τ is the intertemporal

elasticity of substitution and yt+1|t and π t+1|t are one-step-ahead forecasts of output and

inﬂation. One option would be to take a completely speciﬁed dynamic stochastic general

equilibrium model, ﬁnd the rational-expectations solutions yt+1|t = φy′ xt and π t+1|t = φπ′ xt ,

substitute these expressions into (23), and get values for β d and γ d from the contemporaneous

coeﬃcients in the resulting equation. These would then characterize the values anticipated

for β d and γ d as a function of all the parameters of a complete model in a generalization

of the technique used to arrive at (22). However, it is much simpler, and more in keeping

 13
      Benati (2008) used a mean of 0.5 and standard deviation of 0.25.

                                                      17
with the less restrictive and more data-based approach favored in this paper, to draw instead

on prior beliefs about the reduced-form coeﬃcients φy and φπ themselves. Our priors for

the reduced-form coeﬃcients are similar to those in Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984) in

expecting that a simple AR(1) process probably gives a decent forecast of most economic

time series; speciﬁcally, yt+1|t = cy + φy yt and π t+1|t = cπ + φπ π t , where our prior expectation

is φy = φπ = φ = 0.75. Substituting these expressions into (23) gives


                   yt = µd + φξyt − τ (rt − φπ t ) + udt = µ̃d − τ̃ rt + τ̃ φπ t + ũdt


where µd = cd + ξcy + τ cπ and τ̃ = τ /(1 − φξ). Benati’s (2008) prior for ξ had a mean

of 0.5.     Benati and Surico’s (2009) prior mode was 0.25, whereas Lubik and Schorfheide

(2004) imposed ξ = 1. A value of ξ = 2/3 would imply τ̃ = 2τ . Many macro models

assume an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of τ = 0.5. These considerations led us

to use a Student t prior for γ d in (18) with mode −1, scale parameter 0.4, and 3 degrees of

freedom, for which we further impose the sign restriction that γ d cannot be positive since we

are certain that higher interest rates do not stimulate aggregate demand. We likewise use

a Student t prior for β d with mode 0.75. We do not impose a hard sign restriction on β d

since its sign will depend on the correct speciﬁcation for forecasts of inﬂation, about which

we do not have strong prior beliefs.

   Finally, for the Phillips Curve (17) we follow Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) in using

a mode for αs of 2, implemented again with a Student t distribution now assumed to be

positive.

3.3    Prior information about impacts of shocks.

Most applications of sign-restricted SVARs have imposed implicit priors not on A but instead

on contemporaneous impacts determined by H = A−1 . Here we show how this can be done

using an extension of the algorithm in Baumeister and Hamilton (2015).

   It is natural for prior information to come from multiple sources. Suppose for example we

were interested in a population mean µ of a Gaussian distribution and had earlier observed

two independent samples each of size T drawn from this population, the ﬁrst with sample

mean ȳ1 and the second with sample mean ȳ2 . If we were relying on just the ﬁrst source of

information, we would use the prior p1 (µ) = φ(µ; ȳ1 , σ 2 /T ) (the Normal density with mean

ȳ1 and variance σ 2 /T evaluated at the point µ). If we were relying on just the second source

of information, we would use p2 (µ) = φ(µ; ȳ2 , σ 2 /T ). But of course the best procedure is to

use both sources of information, and use as our prior for µ the product p(µ) = p1 (µ)p2 (µ).

For this example, we can see analytically that this product amounts to a single uniﬁed

N ((ȳ1 + ȳ2 )/2, σ 2 /(2T )) prior distribution for µ. In more complicated settings, we do not

need to solve the problem analytically but can simply calculate the product of the densities

that summarize diﬀerent independent sources of information. Here we show how information

about H beyond the information previously used about A can be used to generate a combined

prior for A (expression (30) below) that has the most mass at values of A that are most

consistent with all the various sources of information.

We have imposed the sign restrictions αs > 0, γ d < 0, ψ y > 0, ψ π > 0, and (1 − ρ) > 0.

These guarantee the signs of some but not all the elements of H̃:

In addition, the sign of det(A) is not determined. The latter is a potential concern because

it means that in some allowable regions of the parameter space, elements of A−1 become

inﬁnite before ﬂipping signs. If we were to impose the additional restriction that


                               h1 (θ) = β d + γ d (1 − ρ)ψ π < 0,                      (27)


it would guarantee both that det(A) > 0 and that the (1,1) element of H̃ is positive, that

is, a favorable supply shock raises output and lowers inﬂation.

                                                20
       In keeping with our theme of relying on partial identifying assumptions that are a strict

generalization of previous approaches, we will not impose the inequality (27) dogmatically,

but instead will incorporate the prior information that h1 is probably negative. This proba-

bility can be brought arbitrarily close to unity depending on the parameters used to represent

the researcher’s conﬁdence in the prior information about the signs of impacts.

       To do this we introduce a new family of densities that we will refer to as an asymmetric

t distribution.14     Let φ̃v (x) denote the probability density function of a standard Student

t variable with ν degrees of freedom evaluated at the point x,15 and let Φ(x) denote the

cumulative distribution function for a standard N (0, 1) variable. Consider a random variable

h ∈ (−∞, ∞) with the following density, which has location parameter µh , scale parameter

σ h , degrees of freedom parameter ν h and shape parameter λh ,

                             p(h) = kσ −1
                                       h φ̃vh ((h − µh )/σ h )Φ(λh h/σ h ),                           (28)

where k is a constant to make the density integrate to one. The parameter λh governs the

asymmetry of the distribution. If λh = 0, then Φ(λh h/σ h ) = 1/2 for all h and (28) becomes

the density of a symmetric Student t variable with location parameter µh , scale parameter

σ h , degrees of freedom ν h , and with the integrating constant k = 2. This becomes the further

special case of the N (µh , σ 2h ) distribution when ν h → ∞ and the Cauchy distribution when

ν h = 1. When λh > 0 the density in (28) is positively skewed and when λh < 0 it is negatively

  14
     The asymmetric t is a straightforward adaptation of the ideas in Azzalini and Capitanio (2003), though
to our knowledge the particular density (28) has not appeared previously.
  15
       That is,
                                                                       −(ν+1)/2

                                φ̃v (x) =                    1+                   .
                                            (νπ)1/2 Γ(ν/2)        ν

skewed. As λh → ∞, Φ (λh h/σ h ) goes to 0 for any negative h and goes to 1 for any positive

h. Thus when λh → ∞, (28) becomes a Student t (µh , σ h , ν h ) variable truncated to be

positive. When λh → −∞, (28) becomes a Student t (µh , σ h , ν h ) truncated to be negative.

Thus for example we could include the marginal prior for an impact coeﬃcient constrained to

be positive that is implicit in the traditional Haar prior on rotation matrices as a special case

when λh → ∞, ν h = 1, and µh and σ h are known functions of the reduced-form covariance

matrix Ω.

   Our proposed alternative to the implicit Haar prior is instead to rely directly on prior

information about structural parameters to specify likely values for a magnitude like h1 . To

do this, we drew values for β d , γ d , ψ π , and ρ from the distributions summarized in Table 1

to get a draw for a value for h1 . We used the average value of the simulated h1 to set the

value µh1 = −0.1 and the standard deviation of the draws to determine σ h1 = 1. We set

ν h1 = 3 and λh1 = −4, which strongly nudge the data in the direction of h1 < 0, but still

allow a 6.5% chance that h1 > 0. This density is plotted in Panel A of Figure 3.

   The proposal is then to take the log of the prior speciﬁed in Table 1, namely


             log p(αs ) + log p(β d ) + log p(γ d ) + log p(ψ y ) + log p(ψ π ) + log p(ρ)


and add to it the term


                 log p(h1 ) = ζ h1 [log φ̃vh1 ((h1 − µh1 )/σ h1 ) + log Φ(λh1 h1 /σ h1 )]    (29)


where h1 = β d + γ d (1 − ρ)ψ π and ζ h1 governs the overall weight put on the prior for h1 .

When ζ h1 = 0 the information about h1 is ignored altogether. We set ζ h1 = 1.

                                                   22
       The algorithm in Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) does not require the prior p(A) to inte-

grate to one since the constant of integration is calculated implicitly through the simulation.

Note that as a result of adding (29), the resulting prior p(A) is no longer independent across

the individual elements of A, but includes some joint information about their interaction,

favoring combinations of parameters that imply h1 < 0 over those that do not.

       Another place we might want to draw on additional information is the (3,3) element of

H̃. Note that the prior as speciﬁed so far does not impose that a monetary contraction

results in a higher interest rate once equilibrium feedback eﬀects are considered. Here we

illustrate how one can use prior information about the sign and plausible magnitude of the

eﬀect of monetary policy. Note from (26) that the response of the output gap to a monetary

contraction that raises the fed funds rate by 1 percentage point is

                                                     αs γ d
                                             h2 =            .
                                                    αs − β d

We would expect h2 < 0, but do not impose this, and use instead λh2 = −2 as a more modest

way of favoring parameter combinations that result in an impact of the expected sign. We

set µh2 = −0.3, a prior expectation that output would fall by 0.3%, with σ h2 = 0.5, ν h2 = 3,

and ζ h2 = 1. This prior is plotted in Panel B of Figure 3. It allows a 6.6% probability that

h2 is in fact positive, that is, that output increases in response to a monetary contraction.16



  16
    This is also in the spirit of Uhlig (2005), who challenged the conventional wisdom of the real eﬀects of
monetary policy.




                                                    23
   Our baseline speciﬁcation thus uses


      log p(A) = log p(αs ) + log p(β d ) + log p(γ d ) + log p(ψ y ) + log p(ψ π ) + log p(ρ)

                       + log p[h1 (β d , γ d , ψ π , ρ)] + log p[h2 (αs , γ d , β d )]               (30)


                log p(h2 ) = ζ h2 [log φ̃vh ((h2 − µh2 )/σ h2 ) + log Φ(λh2 h2 /σ h2 )].
                                                 2



3.4    Prior information about structural variances.

We follow Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) in using a natural conjugate form for the prior

p(D|A), which turns out to be the product of independent inverse-gamma distributions.

The mean of the prior for d−1                    ′
                           ii is taken to be 1/(ai Sai ) where S is the variance matrix of


univariate autoregressions for the elements of yt , with the weight on the prior given by

κi = 2, which gives our prior about the same inﬂuence as 4 observations on yt and xt−1 ; see

Appendix B for details.

3.5    Prior information about lagged structural coeﬃcients.

Prior beliefs about the lagged structural coeﬃcients B are represented with conditional

Gaussian distributions, bi |A, D ∼ N (mi , dii Mi ):

                                                           n
                                       p(B|D, A) =         i=1   p(bi |D, A)                         (31)

                             1
    p(bi |D, A) =                             exp[−(1/2)(bi − mi (A))′ (dii Mi )−1 (bi − mi (A))].   (32)
                    (2π)k/2 |d   ii Mi |
                                        1/2


Here mi and Mi are parameters summarizing the researcher’s prior information about the

lagged coeﬃcients in the ith structural equation.                   The vector mi denotes our best guess

before seeing the data as to the value of bi , where b′i denotes row i of B. The matrix Mi

                                                         24
characterizes our conﬁdence in these prior beliefs. A large variance would represent much

uncertainty. Our values for mi come from two diﬀerent sources, the ﬁrst being a “Minnesota

prior” as in Doan, Litterman, and Sims (1984) and Sims and Zha (1999), and the second

from speciﬁc information about the lagged coeﬃcients in the monetary policy equation.

       The Minnesota prior maintains that the single most useful variable for predicting yi,t+1

is typically going to be the value of yit . Insofar as some other variable yjt also helps, its

most recent value is likely to be more useful than its earlier values. Doan, Litterman and

Sims suggested using random walks for the prior means, that is, a prior expectation that the

reduced-form coeﬃcient relating yi,t+1 to yit is likely to be unity. However, for our variables

(the output gap, inﬂation, and interest rates) there is more of a tendency for mean reversion

and so we instead use AR(1) processes with autoregressive coeﬃcients φ = 0.75. Speciﬁcally,

our prior expectation is that elements of bi after the ﬁrst lag are likely to be 0 while the

ﬁrst 3 elements of bi should be close to φai .17 We place increasing conﬁdence in these prior

beliefs for coeﬃcients on higher-order lags, weighting our prior expectations for the ﬁrst lag

coeﬃcients roughly equivalent to 5 observations and for the fourth lag coeﬃcients equivalent

to about 20 observations.          We put practically no weight on prior information about the

constant term (the last element of bi ); for details see Appendix B.

       We also make use of direct prior knowledge about the lagged coeﬃcients in the Taylor

Rule (19), reﬂecting a belief that this equation should be similar to the popular speciﬁcation

  17
     As in Sims and Zha (1998), note that if the ith structural equation took the form a′i yt = φa′i yt−1 + uit ,
then stacking the structural equations gives Ayt = φAyt−1 + ut . Recalling (3), we obtain the reduced form
by premultiplying by A−1 : yt = φyt−1 + εt .




                                                       25
(21). This would mean that the third element of bm should equal ρ and all other elements

of bm (other than the last element associated with the constant term) are zero. The weight

on this prior is governed by a parameter Vi , which we set to 0.1, giving the prior a weight

roughly equivalent to 3 observations; again see Appendix B for details.       Using ρ in this

way to inform estimation of the dynamic coeﬃcients also helps identify the long-run Taylor

parameters ψ y and ψ π .

3.6    Impulse-response functions implied by the prior.

Table 2 summarizes implications of our prior for the structural impulse-response functions,

with columns 1, 3, and 5 reporting the prior probability that each of the three structural

shocks would increase each of the three variables for periods t, t + 1, and t + 2 following a

shock in period t. Our prior places a very high probability that the eﬀects have the expected

signs on impact. But we have much less conﬁdence that these eﬀects persist into horizons

s = 1 or 2. The red dashed lines in Figure 4 plot the median of our prior distribution for

impulse-response functions through s = 20. Although the medians of our prior distribution

for structural impulse-response functions die out fairly quickly, the uncertainty we associate

with this prior information grows signiﬁcantly as the horizon increases. For example, for

the eﬀect on inﬂation of a monetary shock, the width of a set around the median containing

90% of the prior probability is 39 basis points for s = 0, 115 basis points for s = 4, and 731

basis points for s = 20. Thus posterior inferences about the eﬀects at longer horizons are

almost all coming from the data and not the prior.




                                             26
3.7    Empirical results.

Our analysis is based on quarterly data on yt with the fourth-order VAR estimated over

the period of the Great Moderation (t = 1986:Q1 to 2008:Q3). We used the algorithm in

Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) to generate N = 1 million draws {A(ℓ) , D(ℓ) , B(ℓ) }N
                                                                                    ℓ=1 from


the posterior distribution p(A, D, B|Y T ).

   Posterior distributions for the 6 contemporaneous coeﬃcients are plotted as histograms

in Figure 2. The data turn out to be quite informative about the values of β d , ψ y , and ρ

but cause more modest revisions in our beliefs about other parameters.

   Posterior impulse-response functions are plotted in Figure 4. The solid blue lines plot

the median of the posterior distribution for any given horizon. Note that with informative

priors, there is no ambiguity about reporting these solid lines as optimal point estimates

despite the fact that the model is only set-identiﬁed.      The shaded regions in Figure 4

represent 68% posterior credibility regions and the dashed lines indicate 95% regions.

   The ﬁrst column of Figure 4 summarizes the eﬀects of a supply shock. This raises output

and lowers inﬂation but has an unclear eﬀect on interest rates. The data have been very

informative about all three magnitudes, as can be seen by comparing the prior and posterior

probabilities in columns 1 and 2 of Table 2. The second column of Figure 4 gives the eﬀect

of a demand shock, which raises output, inﬂation, and the interest rate. Eﬀects on output

and inﬂation of supply and demand shocks are quite persistent, with conﬁdence about the

signs of eﬀects lasting well beyond one year. The third column in Figure 3 summarizes the

eﬀect of a one-unit increase in the monetary policy shock um
                                                           t on each of the three variables.
                                                                                            18




                                              27
  These eﬀects are small and do not seem to persist, and indeed the posterior median for

the eﬀect on output becomes positive after 1 year.

       The ﬁrst row of Figure 5 displays the historical decomposition of the output gap in terms

of the contributions of the separate structural shocks.                The dashed line is the observed

value for the output gap (in deviations from the sample mean). The solid line in the (1,1)

panel is the posterior median contribution of supply shocks over the 10 years prior to the

indicated date,19 while the (1,2) and (1,3) panels give the contributions of demand and

monetary policy shocks, respectively.             The shaded regions and dashed lines denote 68%

and 95% posterior credibility regions, respectively.               To our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst

paper to report such error bands in the very large literature using SVARs that are only set-

identiﬁed.       The high level of economic activity in the late 1980s is attributed primarily to

strong demand, whereas the boom at the end of the 1990s is judged to be primarily driven by

supply. Monetary policy seems to have typically played a minor role in output ﬂuctuations.

       The second and third rows of Figure 5 report the decompositions for inﬂation and interest

rates. Again the rising inﬂation of the late 1980s seems to have been driven by demand, while

the low inﬂation of the late 1990s was primarily a supply-side development. The response

of monetary policy to output and inﬂation as a result of exogenous shocks to demand, as

     Note that if there were no immediate eﬀects of the policy on output or inﬂation, the fed funds rate
would rise by 1% as a result of a monetary policy shock of one unit. However, our speciﬁcation assumes that
higher interest rates cause output and inﬂation to fall on impact, and these feed back into the interest rate.
The Taylor Rule equation shifts up by 100 basis points, but within the quarter the economy moves along
the new Taylor Rule equation with output falling 0.38% and inﬂation falling 0.17%, as a result of which in
equilibrium the fed funds rate is only 67 basis points higher in the immediate response to the shock.

opposed to deviations of the Fed from its traditional monetary policy rule, appear to be the

primary cause of interest rate ﬂuctuations.

   We can summarize the average contribution of diﬀerent shocks using variance decom-

positions.   Table 3 reports the contribution of each of the three structural shocks to the

mean-squared error of a one-year-ahead forecast of each of the three variables.       Demand

shocks account for 71% of the variance of interest rates and supply shocks account for about

2/3 of the variance of inﬂation. Demand shocks account for 60% of the variability of output

and supply shocks another third. Monetary policy shocks account for less than 5% of the

variability of output and inﬂation.

   The conclusion that monetary shocks account for a modest fraction of output ﬂuctuations

goes back to Leeper et al. (1996). However, Faust (1998) found that monetary shocks

could account for as much as 30% of the variance of output under plausible alternative

identiﬁcations. Our posterior distribution allows a 1% probability that the share could be

larger than 23%. Why do we assign a low probability to eﬀects of this size? Of the posterior

draws that imply a contribution greater than 23%, the average value of ψ y , the Fed’s response

to the output gap, is 2.5, or ﬁve times the value consistent with Taylor’s parameterization.

Demand is also very sensitive to interest rates (average γ d = −1.6) in this tail, as is output

to inﬂation (αs = 3.6). Under such a conﬁguration of parameters, the Fed would be so

vigilant and eﬀective in mitigating the eﬀects of demand shocks on output that demand

shocks would play a signiﬁcantly smaller role and monetary shocks a correspondingly larger

role in accounting for output ﬂuctuations.     However, such a conﬁguration of parameters



                                              29
is diﬃcult to reconcile with standard descriptions of how the Fed behaves, leading us to a

similar conclusion as Leeper et al.


4        Sensitivity analysis.

Critics of the Bayesian approach sometimes question whether the prior information is “cor-

rect.” Formally this can be explored by changing the parameters that summarize the relia-

bility of the information.

       The dotted blue line in Figure 6 plots the Student t distribution (µ = 0.75, σ = 0.4, ν = 3)

that we used to represent prior information about β d . If we regarded this information as

less reliable, we would use a bigger value of σ. For σ = 10, the prior information is regarded

as completely unreliable and the prior for β d would have no inﬂuence on the posterior

inference. As σ → 0, the prior information is treated as perfectly reliable. If we set µα =

µγ = 0, σ α = σ γ = 0, and σ β = σ ψy = σ ψπ = 10 we would obtain the traditional Cholesky

identiﬁcation as a special case of the general approach followed here.20          The concern that

prior information may not be correct is not a criticism of Bayesian methods but instead is a

criticism of the traditional identifying assumption that σ = 0. Indeed, it is precisely because

prior information is not perfectly reliable that researchers need to use Bayesian methods!

       Since our application draws on information from a number of sources, we can investigate

how the inference would change if we completely wipe out the inﬂuence of any one element

of the prior.

  20
     In Baumeister and Hamilton (2017) we demonstrated this by numerically replicating an inﬂuential
analysis of the economic determinants of oil price ﬂuctuations that had used a Cholesky identiﬁcation.



                                                  30
    The upper left panel of Figure 7 shows the estimated eﬀect of a monetary policy shock

on output if we replaced σ α = 0.4 in the baseline speciﬁcation (shown in dashed red for

comparison) with σ α = 10 (shown in solid blue), holding all other elements of the prior

ﬁxed. We would draw essentially the same conclusion about the eﬀects of monetary policy.

Figure D1 in online Appendix D shows the way this change would aﬀect our inference about

the eﬀects of all the shocks on all the variables.        The (1,2) panel of Figure 7 returns to

σ α = 0.4 but now takes σ β = 10. The next three panels throw out the contribution of the

priors about γ d , ψ y , and ψ π , respectively.   For ρ we replace the Beta(2.6, 2.6) prior with

a uniform prior over (0, 1). Panel (3,1) sets ζ h1 = ζ h2 = 0 (ignoring all information about

equilibrium impacts, while panel (3,2) sets λ0 = 109 , which eliminates any contribution of

the Minnesota prior on lagged coeﬃcients. Captions in the ﬁgure report the fraction of 1-

year-ahead output movements attributed to monetary shocks under those alternative priors.

No single element of the prior has any material inﬂuence on our broad conclusions about the

eﬀects of monetary policy.


5     Inference in larger-dimensional systems.

Often researchers may be interested in larger systems for which detailed prior information

like we have used here may not be available. We illustrate how this could be approached

in a 6-variable system in which we have added the yield spread between Baa corporate and

10-year Treasury bonds along with 100 times the year-over-year log changes in the CRB

commodity spot price index and average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory

The original 3 structural equations are a special case of this system when a∗14 = · · · = a∗36 =

0. We use Student t priors for all the new a∗ij parameters centered at 0 with a relatively

uninformative scale parameter of 1. We also keep the original priors from Table 1 for aij

(i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}) as well as the same asymmetric t priors for h1 = det(A∗ ) and h2 the ratio of

the (1,3) to the (3,3) element of adj(A∗ ).21 These priors center the 6-variable system around

values expected for the 3-variable system. We supplemented this with prior knowledge that

a monetary contraction raises the interest rate and the spread but lowers all other variables

on impact.22          The estimated eﬀect of a monetary contraction on the output gap (lower

right panel of Figure 7) is consistent with our other speciﬁcations. Appendix D reports full

results for the 6-variable speciﬁcation.

       Namely µh1 = 0.1, σ h1 = 1, ν h1 = 3, λh1 = 4, ζ h1 = 1, µh2 = −0.3, σh2 = 0.5, ν h2 = 3, λh2 = −2, ζ h2 = 1.
  22
     We did this with asymmetric t distributions with µ = 0, σ = 1, ν = 3, λ = ±5000, ζ = 1 for each of the
6 elements of the third column of (A∗ )−1 .

6    Conclusion.

Structural inference is only possible if we have prior information about the underlying eco-

nomic model and mechanisms.      The traditional approach to identiﬁcation acts as though

this prior information enables us to know some features of the structure with certainty. In

this paper we have proposed generalizing this approach to acknowledge doubts about the

prior information.   In making this generalization, the model becomes only set-identiﬁed.

But we can still form an inference based on what we do know and incorporate uncertainty

about the model itself into any statistical conclusions. In this paper we investigated sta-

tistical inference about impulse-response functions, historical decompositions, and variance

decompositions in such a setting using Bayesian statistical decision theory, and showed that

for reasonable loss functions these can be estimated pointwise from the Bayesian posterior

mean or median of the relevant magnitudes.       We noted that this is implicitly what has

been done by hundreds of researchers using sign-restricted VARs, but argued that the meth-

ods only make sense when the prior is explicit rather than implicit. We illustrated these

methods using a simple macroeconomic model, and concluded that monetary policy shocks

played a relatively minor role in inﬂuencing output and inﬂation during the period of the

Great Moderation.

            Appendix A. Traditional sign-restriction algorithm.

   Here we describe the sign-restriction algorithm developed by Rubio-Ramírez, Waggoner,

and Zha (2010) that was used to generate the impulse responses and histograms of the

impact eﬀect of a contractionary monetary policy shock in Figure 1.

   Let K denote an n × n matrix whose elements are random draws from independent

standard Normal distributions. Take the QR decomposition of K such that K = QR where

R is an upper triangular matrix whose diagonal elements have been normalized to be positive

and Q is an orthonormal matrix (QQ′ = In ). Let P be the Cholesky factor of the reduced-

form variance-covariance matrix Ω (so that Ω = PP′ ) and generate a candidate impact

matrix H = PQ.

   In the absence of any sign restrictions, keep every draw of H and compute impulse
            ∂yt+s
responses    ∂u′t
                    = Ψs H ≡ Hs for Ψs the matrix in equation (7). Absent any identifying

assumptions, the impulse responses of variable yi after any one-standard-deviation structural

shock uj are the same (see Baumeister and Hamilton, 2015, equation (33)), so that it does

not matter which column of Hs is selected for the monetary policy shock. To obtain the

dynamic eﬀect of a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate on the output gap,

divide the entire impulse response of the output gap by the contemporaneous response of

the fed funds rate, and scale this response by multiplying it by 0.25; then sort the draws

and compute the median and the 16th and 84th percentiles.

   To impose only the sign restrictions that a monetary policy shock moves the output gap

and the federal funds rate in opposite direction, we keep the matrix H if the (1,1) and (3,1)


                                             A-1
elements of H are of opposite sign, and throw out H and draw a new matrix if they are of

the same sign. For the accepted draws we compute the impulse responses in the same way

as described above.

   Following Uhlig (2005, p. 410), we account for estimation uncertainty of the reduced-form

VAR parameters by taking draws for (Φ, Ω) from a Normal-inverse Wishart posterior and

apply the QR algorithm to each reduced-form posterior draw until we have 50, 000 accepted

draws.

where dii denotes the row i, column i element of D. The parameters κi and τ i characterize the

researcher’s prior beliefs about structural variances, with κi /τ i giving the analyst’s expected

value of d−1
          ii before seeing any data, while κi /τ i is the variance of this prior distribution.


Small conﬁdence in these prior beliefs would be represented by small values for κi and τ i .

     We set κi = 2, which gives our prior about the same inﬂuence as 4 observations of

yt and xt−1 , and chose τ i (A) to generate a value for τ i (A)/κi equal to the variance of a

univariate autoregression for a′i yt . Speciﬁcally, let êit denote the residual of a fourth-order

autoregression for series i and S the sample variance matrix of these univariate residuals
              T
(sij = T −1   t=1 êit êjt ).   We set τ i (A) equal to the ith diagonal element of κi ASA′ .

     Baumeister and Hamilton (2015) showed that the mean m∗i and variance dii M∗i of the

posterior distribution p(bi |A, D, YT ) for the lagged coeﬃcients of the ith structural equation

can be found from an OLS regression of Ỹi in their equation (47) on X̃i in equation (48).

For the current application these take the form

where a′i denotes the ith row of A in (24). Prior information about lagged structural coeﬃ-

cients comes from two sources. Information about the reduced form gives us an expectation

that bi could be similar to mi = 0.75η ′ ai where


                                        η    =     I3      0      .
                                    (3×13)       (3×3)   (3×10)



Our conﬁdence in this prior information about the reduced form is captured by Pi , which

we speciﬁed as a diagonal matrix whose value associated with the coeﬃcient on the ℓth

lag of variable j is ℓλ1 sjj /λ0 where sjj is the estimated innovation standard deviation of a

univariate fourth-order autoregression ﬁt to variable j. We set λ0 , the parameter controlling

the overall tightness of the prior, equal to 0.1, and set λ1 , which governs how quickly the

prior for lagged coeﬃcients tightens to zero as the lag ℓ increases, equal to unity. The last

diagonal element of Pi , which is the reciprocal of the standard deviation of the prior for the

intercept in the ith structural equation, is taken to be 1/(λ0 λ3 ), where we set λ3 = 100.

   In addition we have direct beliefs about the lagged structural coeﬃcients as captured by

the terms ri and Vi in equations (34) and (35).           This added information is used only for

i = 3, the monetary policy rule, where the expectation is that the third element of b3 should

be close to ρ. This is implemented by taking ei in equation (35) to be column 3 of I13 and ri

in equation (34) equal to ρ. Our conﬁdence in this prior information is captured by the value

of Vi which we set to 0.1, with a smaller value for Vi representing greater conﬁdence in the

prior information. Note that the additional implication of equation (21) that coeﬃcients on


                                                 B-2
yt−2 , yt−3 , yt−4 are zero is already implied by the Minnesota prior, as is the expectation that

each reduced-form equation might look like an AR(1) with autoregressive coeﬃcient φ.23

  23
    Speciﬁcally, these implied a prior expected value for the coeﬃcient on yt−1 of −φ(1 − ρ)ψy , on πt−1 of
−φ(1 − ρ)ψπ , and on rt−1 of φ.
