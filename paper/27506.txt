                                           ABSTRACT

The Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake (1908) was the deadliest earthquake and arguably the
most devastating natural disaster in modern European history. It occurred when overseas mass
emigration from southern Italy was at its peak and international borders were open, making
emigration a widespread phenomenon and a readily available option for disaster relief. We use this
singular event and its unique and important context to study the effects of natural disasters on
international migration. Using commune-level data on damage and annual emigration, we find
that, despite massive destruction, there is no evidence that the earthquake had, on average, a large
impact on emigration or its composition. There were, however, heterogeneous and offsetting
responses to the shock, with a more positive effect on emigration in districts where agricultural day
laborers comprised a larger share of the labor force, suggesting that attachment to the land was an
impediment to reacting to the disaster through migration. Nonetheless, relative to the effects of
ordinary shocks, such as a recession in the destination, this momentous event had a small impact
on emigration rates. These findings contribute to literatures on climate- and disaster-driven
migration and on the Age of Mass Migration.

1     Introduction

How do major natural disasters affect international migration? Interest in this question has grown recently,

in part due to increased attention to the dangers of climate change. But the answer is both theoretically and

empirically ambiguous (e.g., Berlemann and Steinhardt 2017; Black et al. 2013; Mahajan and Yang 2020).

International migration can serve as an adjustment mechanism and provide relief in the face of negative

economic shocks (e.g., Mahajan and Yang 2020; Ó Gráda 2019; Ó Gráda and O'Rourke 1997). On the

other hand, disasters might hinder migration by tightening liquidity constraints (Cattaneo and Peri 2016),

generating remittances or other financial inflows to affected areas (Yang 2008a), or creating exigencies or

economic opportunities at home (Halliday 2006). Indeed, a number of studies have found that international

migration may be unaffected or reduced by natural disasters (e.g., Beine, Noy, and Parsons 2019; Beine

and Parsons 2015; Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Nawrotzki and DeWaard 2018). But this evidence comes

almost entirely from studies of events occurring in recent decades--a period of stringent legal restrictions

on international migration. A complete understanding of the effect of natural disasters on international

migration in the absence of such barriers is still lacking.

    In this paper we study, for the first time, the effect of a major natural disaster on international migration

in a unique and historically important setting of open borders and pre-existing mass migration. The Messina-

Reggio Calabria Earthquake of 1908 was the most deadly and destructive earthquake, and arguably the most

devastating natural disaster of any kind, in modern European history,1 killing as many as 120,000 people

and causing massive destruction to buildings and infrastructure throughout Sicily and Calabria (Dickie

2008; Dickie and Sayer 2005; Parrinello 2015; Risk Management Solutions 2008). The historical importance

of this shock is compounded by the unique setting in which it struck. The earthquake occurred at the

peak of the Age of Mass Migration (1840­1914), during which over 50 million Europeans migrated to the

New World (Abramitzky and Boustan 2017; Hatton and Ward 2019; Hatton and Williamson 1998), enabled

by open borders and drawn by high expected returns (Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson 2012).2 Italy

was a leading country in this movement, sending hundreds of thousands of emigrants each year to North

and South America, as well as to other countries in Europe, in what amounted to one of the largest free

flows of international migration in world history (Foerster 1919; Gomellini and Ó Gráda 2013; Spitzer and

Zimran 2020). The earthquake-affected regions of Sicily and Calabria had just come to the forefront of

   1 Another candidate would be the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which is estimated to have killed between 10,000 and 100,000

people, with most estimates in the lower range (Pereira 2009, p. 468).
   2 Of these, about 30 million were bound for the United States (Abramitzky and Boustan 2017; Hatton and Williamson

1998).


                                                           1
this movement, with average annual emigration rates of about 2.6 and 3.6 percent, respectively, in the four

years prior to the earthquake. The region thus had sufficient prior exposure to migration to develop thick

networks of prior migrants (Spitzer and Zimran 2020). These factors made international migration a familiar,

attractive, and relatively easy option of disaster relief for the affected population. We ask whether and under

what circumstances this option was used.

    Our analysis is based on a dataset of annual emigration rates for every commune in Italy for the pre-

World War I period, and we focus on the period 1905­1912.3 This dataset is based on two complementary

sources--passenger manifests of Italians arriving at the Port of New York (Spitzer and Zimran 2018) and

official Italian emigration data (Spitzer and Zimran 2020). We combine these data with commune-level

measures of damage from the earthquake (Guidoboni et al. 2007) and district-level data on the Italian

labor force from the 1901 Italian census.4 We use difference-in-differences and event study specifications to

determine whether the emigration trends of severely damaged communes in Sicily and Calabria differed from

those of other communes in those regions following the earthquake.5

    Our main finding is that there is no evidence of a large impact of the earthquake on emigration from

affected communes as a whole. Similarly, we find no evidence of an impact of the earthquake on the

demographic composition (i.e., age and gender) of migrants. Our preferred point estimates suggest a small

and transitory decline in emigration of about 8 percent in the first year after the shock in communes

experiencing severe damage relative to other communes in Sicily and Calabria; in the four years after the

earthquake, the average severely damaged commune experienced a decline in emigration of less than six

percent. While limited statistical power prevents precise estimation of this effect, the standard errors of our

estimates are sufficiently small to enable us to conclude that the impacts of the earthquake were, in fact,

small as compared to some relevant benchmarks. For instance, the Panic of 1907, which led to a recession in

the United States and sharp declines in US immigration, was associated with at least a 75-percent decline in

emigration in the year prior to the earthquake. We can easily rule out such a magnitude for the estimated

effect of the earthquake. Our estimates are also small when compared to the estimated impacts on migration

of other natural and man-made disasters, such as modern hurricanes (Mahajan and Yang 2020), pogroms

(Boustan 2007; Spitzer 2016), and the Dust Bowl (Long and Siu 2018).6 This negligible impact is striking

   3 That  is, the data areat the level of the Italian comune, of which there were approximately 8,000 in the study period.
   4 We  use the term "district" to refer to the Italian units of circondario or distretto. These were the next highest administrative
unit above the commune, and there were 284 such units in Italy in the study period. The earthquake-affected regions had only
circondari.
    5 We also present analyses in which the sample includes all of Italy, and in which the unit of analysis is the district or

province rather than the commune.
    6 We also compare our estimates to those of Ager et al. (2020), Boustan, Kahn, and Rhode (2012), Boustan et al. (2017),

Lange, Olmstead, and Rhode (2009), and Sichko (2020), who study the effects of natural disasters on migration in other


                                                                  2
in light of the extreme toll of the earthquake in lives and capital, the disruption of economic activity that it

induced, the large (but short-lived) internal refugee movement that it created, the slow reconstruction that

followed it, and the ubiquity of mass migration in the affected regions.

   We do, however, find evidence of heterogeneous and offsetting effects of the earthquake on emigration

from areas with different labor market compositions. In particular, we find that communes from districts

with a greater share of the labor force employed as agricultural day laborers experienced a greater increase

in emigration in response to the earthquake.7 Though we cannot definitively rule out that this result reflects

heterogeneity with respect to employment in agriculture more generally (rather than of employment in

agricultural day labor specifically) on emigration responses, our finding of heterogeneous responses with

respect to employment in agricultural day labor is robust to controlling for different earthquake reactions

by areas with different shares of labor in agriculture of any form (i.e., owners, renters, sharecroppers, etc.).

This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the earthquake generated migration by individuals who

(among the agricultural classes) were most weakly attached to the land, but reduced it among individuals

with a greater attachment, such that attachment to the land acted as an obstacle to adjusting to the shock

through migration. This mechanism is also consistent with the "greater exigencies" explanation for reduced

migration after natural disasters (Halliday 2006), which would tend to incentivize those more attached to

the land to remain due to greater returns to labor devoted to reconstruction within the household or the

commune.

   This paper contributes to three main literatures. Most narrowly, it adds to the literature on the effects

of the Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake. Given its significance in Italian history, this event has been

the object of repeated scholarly investigations over more than a century (e.g., Dickie 2008; Dickie and Sayer

2005; Mercalli 1909). Debates continue regarding the toll of the earthquake in lives and damage, as well

as on the magnitude of population movements in its wake (e.g., Caminiti 2009; Mortara 1913; Parrinello

2012; Restifo 1995). But to our knowledge, international migration in response to the disaster--a potentially

important margin of response in this context given the high levels of migration prior to the shock--has not

been studied. Understanding the reaction of international migration in response to the shock is fundamental

to a complete history of this important event.

   This paper also adds to the literature on the Age of Mass Migration, which has expanded in recent years

as new data have been brought to bear on fundamental questions of the economics of migration.8 However,

contexts.
    7 Although our analysis is at the commune level, the district is the finest level at which occupational distributions are

available.
    8 See Abramitzky and Boustan (2017) and Hatton and Ward (2019) for surveys of this literature.




                                                             3
advances in understanding the determinants of migration in this context have been more limited (c.f., Gray,

Narciso, and Tortorici 2019; Karadja and Prawitz 2019; Spitzer 2016; Spitzer and Zimran 2020). We

advance the literature on this front by studying the role of sudden shocks to the home economy in generating

emigration. This paper also contributes to the important but long-dormant debate over whether migration

during the Age of Mass Migration was primarily shaped by push factors inherent to the home economy or by

pull factors inherent to the destination (e.g., Gould 1979). By showing that even an enormously destructive

shock to the origin had a small impact relative to business-cycle variation in the destination, we add to the

body of evidence supporting the primacy of pull factors (e.g., Boustan 2007; Hatton and Williamson 1998;

Jerome 1926; Kuznets 1958).

    Finally, this paper contributes to the literature on the effects of natural and man-made disasters on

migration, and thus to the broader literature on climate- and disaster-driven migration (Myers 2002). Our

finding that a shock as cataclysmic as the Messina-Reggio Calabria earthquake had no meaningfully positive

impact on international migration, despite the availability of this option and the absence of legal restrictions

to migration, is an important addition to the recent accumulation of evidence demonstrating no or negative

effects of natural disasters and other climatic shocks on international migration (e.g., Beine and Parsons 2015;

Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Gröschl and Steinwachs 2017; Halliday 2006; Hunter, Murray, and Riosmena 2013).

But our focus on a context of open borders and ubiquitous pre-shock mass migration enables us to conclude

that this lack of an effect was likely the product of incentives and not of political or economic barriers to

migration. Indeed, if ever there were a case in which a natural disaster would be expected to generate

migration, it is in the context that we study of easy and widespread migration and a devastating shock.

Our finding of the absence of a large effect is important in forming expectations regarding the potential for

population movements after natural disasters, which is a particularly pressing question given the anticipated

increase in the frequency of natural disasters due to climate change: the effects of these shocks may be more

nuanced than simple intuition would suggest.



2     Background

2.1    The Earthquake and its Aftermath

The Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake struck on December 28, 1908. The magnitude 7.1 earthquake

shook the Strait of Messina and its surroundings, including the twin cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria

on either side. A severe tsunami hit the coastline shortly thereafter with waves as high as 40 feet (Risk


                                                       4
Management Solutions 2008). The scale of the damage was unprecedented, causing the earthquake to be

regarded as one of the most destructive natural disasters in modern European history (Dickie 2008). The

area's main cities, Messina and Reggio Calabria, were almost entirely destroyed (Baratta 1910); in Messina,

for instance, over 90 percent of buildings were demolished (Dickie 2008). Estimates of the number of deaths

caused by the earthquake and tsunami range from 90,000 to 120,000,9 most of which were concentrated in the

two urban centers along the Strait of Messina. In the municipality of Messina alone, an estimated 30,000 to

60,000 inhabitants were killed relative to a 1901 population of just under 150,000 (Dickie 2008).10 Countless

more were injured or lost their homes. The damage was so unprecedented in its severity that Giuseppe

Mercalli, the renowned seismologist who created the widely used measure of material damage caused by an

earthquake, added a new intensity degree to his eponymous scale to describe the damage--XI, catastrofe

(e.g., Tertulliani 2014).

    Outside of the major urban centers, many smaller communities were also reduced to rubble. Figures for

Sicily are lacking, but detailed data are available on damage for all communes in the province of Reggio

Calabria. In the average commune there (excluding Reggio Calabria itself), about 23 percent of buildings

were completely destroyed and another 24 percent were heavily damaged, with more severe damage in the

district of Reggio Calabria than in the districts of Palmi and Gerace Marina (Baratta 1910, pp. 198­207); see

Figure 1 for a map of districts in the affected area. Some case studies for which more anecdotal information

is available are illustrative. For instance, Palmi, a smaller Calabrian commercial center near the Tyrrhenian

coast (pop. 13,346 in 1901), and Sant'Eufemia d'Aspromonte, a nearby uphill town (pop. 6,285 in 1901),

were "dead," according to the Bishop of Palmi (Liberti 1993): Palmi had an estimated 700 dead and 1,000

wounded; out of 2,221 buildings, 445 houses were completely destroyed, 1,189 irreparably damaged, and 387

more lightly damaged; Sant'Eufemia d'Aspromonte had 839 dead; out of 1,200 buildings, only 100 survived

(and were badly damaged) and the rest were destroyed (Baratta 1910, pp. 198­207).

    The earthquake also led to considerable population displacement. At least 66,000 refugees are estimated

to have left Messina in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake,11 traveling mainly to other large Sicilian

cities and to Naples: according to the official refugee census conducted in January and March 1909, there were

about 20,000 refugees in Catania, 11,000 in Palermo, 2,600 in Syracuse, and 8,000 in Naples (Parrinello 2012).

But there are indications that this flow was short-lived, as Restifo (1995, p. 562) reports that "immediately
   9 Caminiti  (2009), Guidoboni and Mariotti (2008), Parrinello (2012), and Restifo (1995, 2008) provide a deeper investigation
of these estimates. The uncertainty is primarily a result of the conflicting estimates of the death toll in Messina, which we
discuss in further detail below.
   10 In comparison, the death toll caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake is estimated at around 3,000 individuals (Ager

et al. 2020).

                                                               5
following the exodus from the scene of the disaster, a counter-exodus began." We discuss evidence below

that supports this view of a rapid return to the affected area, and the ways in which internal displacement

may affect the interpretation of our results.

    Reconstruction after the earthquake proceeded slowly. The new anti-seismic urban regulation plans for

the cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria were only approved in 1911. As a result, in 1911, more than 60,000

people in Messina still lived in temporary housing; even by 1922 this figure was more than 70,000 for people

on either side of the Strait. Messina and Reggio Calabria were in many ways still large construction sites

even after World War I (Farinella and Saitta 2019), and by the early 1920s, only about 1,500 buildings in

Messina had been rebuilt (Saitta and Oriti 2013). Delayed reconstruction also appears to have been the

norm in smaller towns in the area. In Palmi, for instance, there were difficulties in obtaining the materials

to construct temporary shelters, and the distribution of reconstruction resources was reportedly stifled by a

patronage system that was prone to misallocation. In some cases, the frustration with slow reconstruction

led to protests and riots, which turned deadly in the case of the town of Sinopoli (Teti 2008).

    Despite the sluggish reconstruction, the population of the cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria rebounded

quickly (Parrinello 2012; Restifo 1995). According to census figures for 1911, their immediate population

loss through deaths and refugee flight had been largely reversed. As shown in Table 1, Messina in 1911 had

126,557 inhabitants relative to 149,778 in 1901 and Reggio Calabria had 43,162 in 1911 relative to 44,415

in 1901. Thus, any immediate outflow of refugees appears to have returned relatively quickly. According

to the traditional view of the Messinesi, this rapid recovery was largely due to an inflow of people from the

hinterland attracted by the demand for reconstruction labor. Indeed, Messinesi call their hometown "a city

without memory," in reference to the destruction of almost all historical buildings and to perceptions that

internal migrants seeking reconstruction labor completely replaced the pre-earthquake population (Dickie

and Sayer 2005). A more detailed examination of Italian census figures from 1901 and 1911, however, reveals

that this local myth is untrue.12 Table 1 presents data on the population of the cities of Messina and Reggio

Calabria by place of birth from 1901 and 1911 population census data.13 Two years after the disaster, 83.8

percent of Messina's 126,557 residents were listed as natives of the city, whereas only 6.2 percent were born

elsewhere in the province of Messina (even less than their share in 1901), 4.9 percent were born elsewhere

in Sicily, and 1.9 percent were born in the region of Calabria; figures for Reggio Calabria in Table 1 also

indicate a general persistence of population, though the fraction locally born did decline from 83.7 percent

   12 We are not able to rule out a situation in which the residents of the city center were replaced by migrants from outlying

frazioni, or villages, within the commune of Messina--that is, movement from the outer districts of the city to the city center.
   13 Unfortunately, similar data are not available for smaller towns in the affected areas.




                                                               6
in 1901 to 75.4 percent in 1911, indicating that internal migration was more important in Reggio Calabria

than in Messina.14

    These figures also indicate that any flow of internal migrants from Messina's hinterland after the earth-

quake into the city paled in comparison to the size of international emigration flows. In particular, even the

stock of internal migrants in Messina was small when compared to an average of over 15,600 international

emigrants per year from the province of Messina over the period 1905­1908 (of which over 13,000 per year

were from communes other than Messina).15 Thus, local folk history notwithstanding, internal migration

and the demand for reconstruction labor in the two major cities of the area was not sufficiently large to ab-

sorb flows that would have constituted a positive international migration response had they been redirected

abroad.

    Finally, the figures in Table 1 make us skeptical of the higher range of the estimates for deaths in Messina.

Table 1 shows that 84.8 percent of Messina's residents in 1901 were born in Messina. If the 60,000 deaths were

randomly allocated by place of birth, this implies 50,880 deaths of Messina-born individuals, leaving 76,137

Messina-born individuals alive. Table 1 also shows that in 1911 there were 106,025 residents of Messina who

were born in that commune--a gain of 29,888 individuals. This number is far too large to be explained by

new births, particularly given the fact that there were only about 37,000 individuals aged 0­15 in Messina

in 1911 and that subsequent deaths and the departure of refugees and emigrants have not been accounted

for in this calculation.16

    Surprisingly, very little is known about international migration as a response to the earthquake, despite

the fact that the area was in the midst of an unprecedented mass emigration at the time of the shock. As

we argue below, this option potentially provided cheap and readily available access for relief to the tens of

thousands of inhabitants who had lost their homes and their livelihoods. Indeed, according to a survey of

refugees from Messina in Naples in April 1909, half of the 1,000 respondents indicated an intention to migrate

(either internally or overseas), "especially [to] the United States" (Parrinello 2012, p. 39). Importantly, there

is no evidence that the earthquake itself posed a direct obstacle to migration by disrupting travel: although

Messina was the sixth most important maritime hub in Italy in terms of yearly traffic, its importance as

a point of embarkation for transatlantic migration paled in comparison to that of Palermo, Naples, and

   14 The Movimento dello Stato Civile also shows evidence of an increase in internal migration to the province of Reggio

Calabria after 1908, but a decline in internal migration to the province of Messina.
   15 In Reggio Calabria, 75.4 percent of the 43,162 residents in 1911 were natives of the city, whereas 11.3 percent were born

elsewhere in the province of Reggio Calabria, 1.7 percent were born elsewhere in Calabria, and 4.2 were born in Sicily, as
compared to over 14,300 international emigrants per year over the period 1905­1908.
   16 Of course, this calculation cannot account for return migration from abroad and elsewhere in Italy, but the fact that the

Movimento dello Stato Civile counts only 10,862 immigrants to the entire province of Messina from 1909­1911, suggests that
such internal migration was of limited importance.

question with important implications for a complete understanding of this event and for the economics of

disaster-induced migration.


2.2    Natural Disasters and Migration: Theory and Evidence

Natural disasters can affect migration incentives in a number of conflicting ways. Among other channels,

disasters may affect the operation of markets for labor and goods; household decisions on consumption,

saving, and insurance; financial flows; private and public investment; and technological change. Despite the

simple intuition that negative shocks are bad for the local economy and therefore should strengthen push

factors, economic theory does not clearly indicate either positive or negative effects of natural disasters on

migration. Consequently, much of our understanding of the effects of natural disasters on migration depends

on the empirical evidence, most of which comes from a literature motivated by the goal of understanding

the effects of climate change on population movements in developing countries in recent decades (see surveys

by Berlemann and Steinhardt 2017; Black et al. 2013). This literature has identified several important

mechanisms by which natural disasters have been shown to affect migration and the evidence in the literature.

   The simplest mechanism for an effect of natural disasters on migration is by augmenting push factors. By

destroying productive capital, buildings, and infrastructure and by displacing labor, natural disasters hamper

productive activity and trade. This can translate into a reduction in wages and household income in the place

of origin (Baez and Santos 2008; Banerjee 2007; Cai et al. 2016; Gröger and Zylberberg 2016). More broadly,

there is evidence that these shocks have persistent long-run negative effects on individual standards of living

(Caruso 2017), on regional economic trajectories (Hornbeck 2012), and on national economic growth (Hsiang

and Jina 2014; Skidmore and Toya 2002). The destruction of residential capital--probably the most notable

feature of the Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake outside of the loss of life--is a shock to standards of living

and a major wealth shock; moreover, it is a wealth shock that is shared within the community, which makes

it harder to cope by employing local informal insurance mechanisms. With wages reduced, homes damaged

or destroyed, and lacking the financial safety provided by the value of private residential real estate, the

option of staying becomes less attractive. Indeed, there is ample evidence that natural disasters and climatic

shocks have the capacity to cause massive displacement--short-term and short-distance internal migration--

much like the well documented but short-lived stream of internal refugees in the wake of the Messina-Reggio

Calabria Earthquake (e.g., Gray and Mueller 2012; Gröger and Zylberberg 2016; Penning-Rowsell, Sultana,
  17 From the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation data that we describe below, were were able to determine that only

about 4 percent of Italians arriving at Ellis Island between 1904 and 1908 embarked in Messina.


                                                            8
and Thompson 2013; Robalino, Jimenez, and Chacón 2015), and permanent long-distance internal migration

(Boustan, Kahn, and Rhode 2012; Hornbeck 2012; Hornbeck and Naidu 2014; Sichko 2020). Some studies

have also found similar positive effects on international migration (e.g., Drabo and Mbaye 2014; Reuveny

and Moore 2009). The most comprehensive evidence for such a positive effect comes from a worldwide study

of the effect of hurricanes on US immigration over the period 1980­2000 (Mahajan and Yang 2020).

    However, it is far from clear that these positive effects on international migration are a common feature

in all contexts of major natural disasters. A number of studies have found negative or no-migration effects,

at least for large segments of the population (e.g., Beine and Parsons 2015; Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Gröschl

and Steinwachs 2017; Halliday 2006; Hunter, Murray, and Riosmena 2013; Yang 2008b). This is a common

finding even for internal migration (Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Gignoux and Menéndez 2016; Nawrotzki and

DeWaard 2018; Paul 2005; Penning-Rowsell, Sultana, and Thompson 2013). This frequently observed lack of

a positive effect of shocks on migration raises the notions of "trapped populations" (Nawrotzki and DeWaard

2018) and an "immobility paradox" (Beine, Noy, and Parsons 2019)--a state in which poor populations

would have wanted to react by migration, but are locked in by liquidity constraints that are exacerbated by

the shock. The role of liquidity constraints in masking or reversing an otherwise positive effect on migration

is consistent with findings of heterogeneous effects of shocks on migration with respect to income, wealth, or

human capital, with a greater increase in migration after a shock among better-off households, regions, or

countries (Beine and Parsons 2017; Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Gröschl and Steinwachs 2017; Nawrotzki and

DeWaard 2018; Sichko 2020; c.f., Halliday 2006).

    Another possible mechanism that could counteract the push effect is that reconstruction may increase

local labor demand after a shock and generate a negative or no-migration effect. Part of this effect would

be realized through self-employment within the household. Consider the typical commune in the District of

Reggio Calabria, where roughly half of the buildings were severely damaged or destroyed by the earthquake.

For many households, repairing or rebuilding their own property would have been a high-net present value

project. Such "greater exigencies" at home have been cited by Halliday (2006) as the most likely explanation

for the negative effect of the 2001 El Salvador earthquakes on migration to the United States (although this

is disputed by Yang 2008b). The effect might also come through changes in the labor market. Indeed, in the

wake of earthquakes in Calabria prior to the one that we study, there is evidence of an increase in construction

wages (Caputo 1908).18 Moreover, reconstruction efforts are often fueled by remittances and other forms of
   18 Moreover, Pereira (2009) documents such a rise in wages after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Interestingly, however, Kirch-

berger (2017) finds that following the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake in Indonesia, there was no overall change in wages in the
worst hit places, but there was greater increase in wages and hours worked by workers who had previously been employed in
agriculture, possibly due to a movement of workers from agriculture to construction. It is nevertheless puzzling that a labor


                                                              9
financial flows to the affected places (Bettin and Zazzaro 2018; David 2011; Mohapatra, Joseph, and Ratha

2009; Paul 2005; Yang 2008a; c.f., Lueth and Ruiz-Arranz 2008). Beyond the recovery period, post-disaster

reconstruction may even produce positive economic effects that persist in the long run by bringing about a

wave of (literal) creative destruction (Barone and Mocetti 2014; Gignoux and Menéndez 2016; Hornbeck and

Keniston 2017), which may induce more people to stay by strengthening protections against similar future

events (Boustan, Kahn, and Rhode 2012), or by hastening institutional reform (Pereira 2009).

   Two issues in the rich literature on the relationship between natural shocks and migration highlight

the contribution of our study of the Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake. First, as mentioned above, the

literature has largely focused on climatic shocks. Most of these, such as extreme weather events, are relatively

small in comparison to the scale of the devastation wrought by the Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake.

Evidence on the effects of disasters at the scale of the Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake is scarce.19

Second, virtually all studies dealing with international migration have explored events that have occurred

since 1960--a period characterized by stringent restrictions on labor mobility across international borders

(Hatton and Williamson 2005).20 The Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake occurred in an area that was

heavily exposed to overseas migration at a time in which the migration choice was unhindered by legal

restrictions, and, moreover, could have been aided by large networks of prior migrants. If, for example,

poorer populations are more likely to be incentivized to move overseas by a disaster, but are also less likely

to be able to overcome the legal restrictions of migration, then the estimates on the effects on the underlying

demand for international migration, which is the unobserved measure that really reflects incentives, will be

downward biased. This raises the question of whether the "trapped populations" are not merely trapped

by poverty or entrenched by shock-related incentives, but are in part also "banned" populations. Our case

study is unique in focusing on a massive shock whose survivors were familiar with a relatively cheap option

of overseas migration, were linked to a large proportion of their communities that had already relocated

abroad and could assist their migration, and, in most cases, undoubtedly did have a legal path to migrate.


2.3     Italian Emigration

Italy was a latecomer to international mass migration. Whereas Britain, Germany, and Ireland were already

the sources of large numbers of migrants as early as the 1840s, Italy, along with other countries in the
demand shock that originated in the construction sector would be more than offset by the ensuing transition of labor out of
agriculture.
   19 The most obvious exceptions are the studies of earthquakes by Gignoux and Menéndez (2016), Halliday (2006), and Yang

(2008b).
   20 Karadja and Prawitz (2019), who use frost shocks as part of an instrument for migration to the US from Sweden during

the 1860s, provide evidence from a period of unrestricted migration, but the magnitude of the shock is considerably smaller.


                                                            10
southern and eastern European periphery, did not begin to experience large-scale international migration

until the late 1880s (Hatton and Williamson 1994; Spitzer and Zimran 2020) even though the United States

had maintained an effectively open border to European immigration throughout this period. Once Italian

emigration began, however, it accelerated rapidly. The rate of emigration from the entire country exceeded

15 per thousand by 1901, and peaked in 1913 at over 25 per thousand (Hatton and Williamson 1998, p.

97).21

    Italian migration was mostly divided between three major destinations--North America (primarily the

United States), South America (primarily Argentina and Brazil), and Europe (primarily Austria-Hungary,

Germany, Switzerland, and France). But the composition of destinations varied across the country, with

northerners primarily traveling across the Alps and southerners to North America. In the regions of Sicily

and Calabria, the rate of migration to North America regularly exceeded 20 per thousand after 1900. In

total, 69 percent of migrants from these regions traveled to North America between 1900 and 1914. The next

largest major destination was South America, with just under 24 percent of migrants from these regions.

    Three important patterns characterized the Italian migration. First, a relatively large share of this flow

consisted of repeat and temporary migrants, or "birds of passage" (Gomellini and Ó Gráda 2013). Bandiera,

Rasul, and Viarengo (2013) argue that over 70 percent of Italian migrants to the United States between

1900 and 1910 returned to Italy.22 Spitzer and Zimran (2018, Table 2, p. 231) find that 44.3 percent of

Italians arriving at Ellis Island during the period 1907­1925 had already lived in the United States prior to

the observed migration. This may be important in the context of a response to a natural disaster because

there is reason to believe that temporary migration might be more responsive to a natural disaster than

permanent migration (Bohra-Mishra, Oppenheimer, and Hsiang 2014).

    The second feature, which was shared by migratory flows from virtually all European countries, was

the considerable year-to-year fluctuation in migration rates in response to business cycles in the destination

countries (Hatton and Williamson 1998, ch.4; Spitzer 2015). Most importantly in the context of the Messina-

Reggio Calabria Earthquake, the Panic of 1907--a financial crisis in the United States that caused a recession

in late 1907 and 1908--caused a decline in total immigration to the United States from nearly 1.2 million

to under 700,000 between fiscal years 1907 and 1908. Immigration remained low in fiscal year 1909 before

resurging to over 925,000 in fiscal year 1910 (Barde, Carter, and Sutch 2006). Italian emigration to the United

States followed this trend, falling from over 300,000 in calendar year 1907 to about 130,000 in calendar year
   21 Ferenczi and Willcox (1929), Foerster (1919), Gomellini and Ó Gráda (2013), and Spitzer and Zimran (2020) also describe

the trends in Italian migration.
   22 According to Hatton and Williamson (1998, p. 97), the national emigration rate from Italy net of returns was below 5 per

thousand after 1901.


                                                             11
1908, before resurging to 289,000 in calendar year 1909.23 To evaluate the effects of the earthquake on

migration, it is crucial that we account for this volatility, which generated a nationwide surge in emigration

in the year after the earthquake. This fluctuation in migration in response to the Panic of 1907 also provides

a yardstick to which the effects of the earthquake can be compared.

    The third important pattern in Italian migration is its spatial expansion (Gould 1980). Spitzer and

Zimran (2020) show that mass migration from Italy to North America began in a few distinct districts in

the late 1870s and early 1880s and spread from there in a process of spatial diffusion to the rest of Italy

through immigrants' social networks.24 In Sicily and Calabria, the nearest "epicenter" district was Corleone

in the province of Palermo, from which the area experiencing mass migration expanded. By the time of the

earthquake, the regions around the Strait of Messina had already achieved high rates of emigration. In a

radius of 150 kilometers from the earthquake's epicenter, the average commune experienced an average annual

emigration rate of over 35 per thousand in the period 1905­1908--an extraordinarily high rate by historical

standards. We interpret this as having passed a point of saturation--a previous migrant stock large enough

that it was likely that virtually all residents had a connection to prior migrants, and therefore had the option

of migration and could be aided in migration by prior migrants.25 Notably, however, southeastern Sicily

(the provinces of Syracuse and Catania) lagged behind the rest of Sicily and Calabria, achieving saturation

about a half decade later than the rest of the area. This meant that the emigration trend of this area was

rising relative to others in the time period that we analyze (Spitzer and Zimran 2020). In other words, there

was an external reason for differential trends in emigration in the regions affected by the earthquake, which

is an important factor to consider in our difference-in-differences analysis.

    The composition of the flow of Italian migration is also potentially important to understanding the impact

of the earthquake. Roughly three-quarters of Italian migrants were male (Hatton and Williamson 1998, p.

102), an imbalance exceeding that of almost any other group of migrants during the Age of Mass Migration.

Spitzer and Zimran (2018) show that migrants from southern Italy, including those from Sicily and Calabria,

were largely positively selected into migration on the basis of average height, a proxy for human capital.

This selection was particularly strong for Calabria (Spitzer and Zimran 2018, Fig. 2, p. 234). The flow of


   23 The Italian emigration statistics are from our transcription of the Statistica della Emigrazione Italiana per l'Estero, which

we discuss in more detail below. In the original sources, the US data are reported in fiscal years whereas the Italian data are
reported in calendar years. According to tne NBER measures, the contraction associated with the Panic of 1907 lasted from
May 1907 to June 1908, approximately overlapping with fiscal year 1908 (National Bureau of Economic Research 2020).
   24 There were similar patterns for migration to South America and to Europe, but with different initial "epicenters" and

starting points in time.
   25 Spitzer and Zimran (2020) show that connections to networks of prior migrants were the first-order determinant of mass

emigration in Italy at the district and commune level from 1876­1920. Spitzer (2016) shows that pogroms in the Russian Empire
did not push a significant number of Jews from the affected regions so long as they were not exposed to prior migration.


                                                                12
migration also consisted primarily of individuals employed in unskilled occupations (Federico et al. 2019;

Pérez 2019; Spitzer and Zimran 2018). According to official Italian emigration statistics, in 1905­1908, 49.9

percent of Calabrian migrants and 38.1 percent of Sicilian migrants were employed in agriculture.26 As we

will show below, the occupational distribution of the affected areas bears heavily on their responses to the

earthquake.

    Internal migration within Italy may also have been an important margin of response to the earthquake,

and would potentially constitute a substitute for international migration. However, at least in southern

Italy, this was a far less common phenomenon than was international migration prior to the earthquake.

As discussed above and as shown in Table 1, there is no evidence of a large inflow to the cities of Messina

and Reggio Calabria. More generally, such flows were largely temporary and were dwarfed by international

migration, especially after 1900 (Gallo 2012), probably because returns to migration and employment op-

portunities were far greater in overseas destinations. More broadly, the 1911 census indicates that 93.9

percent of Sicilan-born individuals living in Italy in 1911 and 94.1 percent of Calabrian-born individuals

living in Italy in 1911 lived in their province of birth, of which 85.0 percent of Sicilians and 84.6 percent of

Calabrians lived in their commune of birth.27 There is little doubt that the primary outside option for the

earthquake-affected population was overseas migration.



3     Data

3.1     Sources and Construction

Data on earthquake severity are taken from Guidoboni et al. (2007), a source based largely on descriptions of

earthquake damage provided by Baratta's (1910) state-of-the-art study. This source reports Mercalli severity

scores for various latitude-longitude pairs in the affected region. Whereas the more commonly referenced

Richter scale is based on the actual shaking experienced during an earthquake, the Mercalli scale is defined

on the basis of the damage suffered.28 It ranges from I (not felt) to XII (extreme); in some cases, our data
   26 As we discuss in footnote 65 below, there is reason to believe that a substantial fraction of these were agricultural day

laborers. In the relatively urbanized provinces of Reggio Calabria and Messina, however, the plurality of migrants were employed
in construction, accounting for 43.0 percent and 45.5 percent of migrants from each province, respectively. For comparison, 28.3
percent of Sicilian migrants and 32 percent of Calabrian migrants in the period 1905-1908 were employed in construction. These
figures are from Table IV of the 1904­1905, 1906­1907, and 1908­1909 volumes of the Statistica della Emigrazione Italiana per
l'Estero.
   27 These figures are from Table IX.C of the 1911 Italian census. The district-level data from Table IX.B also support this

notion, with the fraction of the population of each district that was born in its commune of residence ranging from 83.35 percent
in Reggio Calabria to 90.19 percent in the district of Mistretta in the province of Messina.
   28 For instance, an VIII (severe) on the Mercalli scale is defined as "Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable

damage in ordinary substantial buildings with partial collapse. Damage great in poorly built structures. Fall of chimneys,
factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned." An XI (extreme) is defined as "Few, if any, (masonry)


                                                                 13
include intermediate measures such as IX­X or X­XI, which we score as 9.5 or 10.5. The description of

actual damage is helpful in our case, as this is a more direct measure of the impact of the earthquake than

the magnitude of shaking, which may translate differently into damage in different areas. Guidoboni et al.

(2007) also provide information on the number of reported deaths at each latitude-longitude pair.29

    To prepare these data for analysis, we first assigned the point-based severity measures to the communes

into which they fall. Because we do not have a map of Italian communes for the early 20th century, we

rely on a map of commune borders on January 1, 2018, which resulted in a small number of historical

communes being combined with one another to form larger communes, primarily through the incorporation

of adjacent communes into the city of Messina. In cases where a modern commune has multiple points of

severity measures, we first attempt to identify the city center;30 in other cases, we use the maximum severity

recorded in the commune. Our benchmark treatment variable is a binary indicator for severe damage from

the earthquake: we assign a commune to the "severe" group if its severity score is VIII or higher,31 and

assign all other communes to the "non-severe" group.32

    We use two sources of migration data. The first is the Ellis Island arrival records database, which was

provided by the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation and is described in detail by Spitzer and Zimran

(2018). This dataset contains the records of all passenger arrivals at the Port of New York for the period

1897­1924, comprising the vast majority of all arrivals in the United States during the latter decades of

the Age of Mass Migration in general and in our study period in particular.33 In total, there are records

of 4.8 million passengers with Italian origin or nationality from the complete Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island

Foundation database. The data are compiled from passenger manifests, which were completed by shipping

companies upon passengers' embarkation in the port of origin, and which were subsequently verified by

immigration agents at Ellis Island. In the case of Italian passengers, the information provided in these

manifests is likely to be highly accurate as a result of the requirement by Italian authorities to travel abroad

structures remain standing. Bridges destroyed. Broad fissures in ground. Underground pipe lines completely out of service.
Earth slumps and land slips in soft ground. Rails bent greatly" (US Geological Survey 2019).
   29 As discussed above, these estimates remain the subject of debate to the present, particularly in the case of the city of

Messina (e.g., Caminiti 2009; Parrinello 2012; Restifo 1995). Nonetheless, they provide the best estimates available of the death
toll of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, and so we present results below both using and not using these data. The total
deaths figure that we use for Messina (which in our data includes some outlying towns that have since been incorporated into
it) is 67,307.
   30 That is if there are several observations for Messina, we use the measure for the city of Messina itself rather than for

surrounding frazioni, or villages, within the same municipality
   31 This is also the cutoff that corresponds to a Richter scale reading of 7.0 (US Geological Survey 2019).
   32 For communes with no severity measures, we use an inverse-distance-weighted imputation of Mercalli scores. In practice,

all communes for which we impute a severity measure fall into the non-severe category (i.e., their imputed Mercalli scores are
below VIII), which is consistent with the lack of severity information indicating little or no earthquake damage and with the
inclusion of all severely affected areas in the damage data.
   33 Spitzer and Zimran (2018, Table D.1) compare the total inflows in this source to those of official statistics of arrivals of

Italians to the United States, finding that the coverage of the Ellis Island passenger manifests is nearly complete.


                                                               14
with a passport, which was an official document identifying migrants' communes of origin.34

    To identify the last place of residence of each passenger arriving at Ellis Island, we used an automated

geo-location algorithm, previously used by Spitzer and Zimran (2018), which converted the textual (and

often misspelled or incomplete) transcription of the last place of residence in the dataset into latitude and

longitude pairs. Spitzer and Zimran (2018) show that this algorithm is highly accurate (i.e., in at least 92

percent of cases in which an individual is assigned to a location that location is correct), that at least 79.3

percent of records with complete information could be geo-located (with a higher probability of successful

geo-location after 1900), and that this subset of individuals whose location could be determined from the

algorithm is representative of all passengers. In total, the data include 1,879,365 individuals arriving in the

United States in the years 1905­1912 with a listed last place of residence that was determined to possibly

be in Italy. Specific latitude and longitude coordinates could be assigned to 1,445,096 passengers and were

linked to a commune of last residence. For the same reason discussed above, we assigned individuals to the

modern commune (as of January 1, 2018) in which their coordinates fall. We then used a variety of sources

to determine the historical district and province to which this modern commune belongs.35 The ultimate

product is an annual count of passengers from each commune. The passenger lists also contain a limited

number of individual migrant characteristics, including age and gender.36 We use these data to construct

each commune-year's average emigrant characteristics, as well as a count of prime-aged male passengers (i.e.,

males 18­65), who may have been more responsive to the labor market consequences of the shock.

    Our second and complementary source of migration data is the official commune-level emigration counts

published in the Statistica della Emigrazione Italiana per l'Estero.37 This source, which was digitized and

described in detail by Spitzer and Zimran (2020), indicates the number of international emigrants from each

commune based on the issuance of passports, which were compulsory for international travel after 1901

(Foerster 1919; Hatton and Williamson 1998). Although these data add information relative to the Ellis

Island records and provide coverage of all destinations (rather than just the United States) and ports of

entry (rather than only New York), there are some disadvantages. First, they do not enable us to determine


  34 On   the Italian passport system, see Foerster (1919, pp. 10­22).
  35 More   details of this component of the data cleaning process are presented in Online Appendix B.
   36 The records contain additional personal information, such as height and occupation. But these variables were not digitized

for the entire collection of passenger records. Spitzer and Zimran (2018) digitized a sample that enables cross-province com-
parisons, but the additional transcription required to enable a cross-commune-year comparison of individuals characteristics is
infeasibly large. Therefore, we restrict our analysis to the variables that are available for all individuals.
   37 We keep these data at the level of the historical commune at which they are reported, which leads to some minor differences

relative to the Ellis Island data described above; however, their geographic location (and thus their earthquake severity) is based
on modern borders. This is particularly relevant in the case of communes that have been incorporated into other communes
over time; in such cases, the location is based on the location of the modern commune to which they have been incorporated.
More details of this data cleaning are provided in Online Appendix B and by Spitzer and Zimran (2020).


                                                                15
the type of migrant (e.g., age or gender) or the destination of the migrant. Second, data for the districts of

Palmi (in the province of Reggio Calabria) and Messina (in the province of Messina) for the fourth quarter

of 1908 were destroyed by the earthquake and were imputed based on 1907 figures.38 There is also the

possibility that the earthquake may have disrupted travel plans, leading to a discrepancy between passport

issuances and actual emigration. Therefore, we use the Ellis Island data for our benchmark specification,

while reporting the same results using the alternative emigration data. The two sources are largely consistent

with each other, and so are the outcomes of the empirical analysis.

    One concern with both sources of migration data is whether internal refugees who eventually migrated

were reported as coming from their hometowns or from their place of refuge. Unfortunately, we cannot be

certain that displaced persons were indeed listed according to the town in which they had been living at the

moment the earthquake struck. We are reassured, however, by the evidence that refugees rapidly returned

to affected areas (Restifo 1995) and that internal migration rates as documented in the 1911 census were

low. Further reassurance is provided by sampling and inspecting passenger lists for a mismatch between the

last place of residence and the place of birth.39 This search yields no systematic evidence of Messina-born

individuals listing somewhere else as the last place of residence.40

    Finally, we use data from the 1901 Italian census of population. This source provides commune-level

population counts (the last before the earthquake),41 which enable us to compute rates of emigration. It also

provides district-level occupational distributions. Most of the workers were employed in agriculture, and we

are particularly interested in the distribution of the different types of their contractual attachment to the land.

The least attached were the agricultural day laborers (giornalieri di campagna ). Other categories include

sharecroppers (mezzadri ), contracted laborers (contadini obbligati ), renters, lessees, and owner-occupiers.

We use these data to compute two measures--the fraction of the male labor force in the district employed

in agriculture (of all types of tenure) and the fraction of the male labor force employed as agricultural day

laborers. We focus on the latter group because they were the least attached to the land and we therefore

suspect that they may have been more responsive to shocks than others.42

    38 The original source states, "Per gli emigranti partiti dai comuni del circondario di [Messina/Palmi] mancano i dati del

quarto trimestre 1908, perchè il registro dei passaporti andò disperso nel disastro causato dal terremoto; si è perciò completata
la statistica, sostituendovi i dati relativi al quarto trimestre 1907."
    39 The latter field is available in the original manuscripts, but was not transcribed, and so this comparison requires a manual

examination.
    40 We randomly sampled a small number of individuals and manifest pages in the passenger manifests emigrating in January,

February, and March 1909 whose last place of residence was in the province of Catania, which was the closest and most significant
refuge for the displaced Messinesi. We then manually inspected these records and found no instance of a Messina-born individual

                                                                16
3.2     Summary Statistics

Table 2 presents summary statistics for severely damaged and non-severely damaged communes in Calabria

and Sicily, as well as for the whole of Italy. The data for the non-severely damaged communes in Sicily and

Calabria are shown for all communes (columns 2, 5, and 7) and for communes within 150 kilometers of the

earthquake epicenter (column 3).43 The Table first presents data on the damage caused by the Earthquake.

Unsurprisingly, severely damaged communes were closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, and by definition

they experienced more damage as measured by the Mercalli score. By contrast, the average non-severely

damaged commune in the regions of Sicily and Calabria had a Mercalli severity of about VI ("Felt by all,

many frightened. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster. Damage slight.").44 Severely

damaged communes also registered considerably more deaths per capita, though the average was still far

lower than Messina's 44 percent death rate, which was the exception rather than the rule. Figure 2 maps the

data on damage from the earthquake. Panel (a) presents the Mercalli score for each commune (excluding

those without data in Guidoboni et al. 2007). Panel (b) maps the indicator for whether each commune

experienced damage of a Mercalli severity of VIII or greater, along with a circle indicating a 150-kilometer

radius from the earthquake epicenter. As expected, the communes experiencing a severe shock are those

closer to the epicenter (indicated by the large dot).

   Table 2 also presents various measures of emigration. The rates of emigration according to the Ellis

Island data are approximately half those according to the official data, reflecting the incomplete coverage of

the Elis Island data in terms of international destinations (e.g., migration to South America is not captured

by the Ellis Island data) and ports of entry to the United States. Reassuringly for treatment balance, the

pre-earthquake emigration rates in the severely and non-severely affected communes in Sicily and Calabria

were similar, though there is some imbalance within regions. We provide a formal study of pre-trends in our

main results below.

   Figure 3 presents the spatial distribution of our main outcome variable--average annual emigration rates

at the commune level according to the Ellis Island data.45 Panel (a) reports average annual emigration rates

for the pre-earthquake period 1905­1908. The main pattern evident from this panel is the lower emigration

rates from southeastern Sicily relative to the rest of the island and relative to Calabria, consistent with the

late arrival of mass migration in this area, as discussed above and by Spitzer and Zimran (2020). Panel (b)


  43 The farthest severely damaged commune from the epicenter of the earthquake was 101.6 kilometers.
  44 Put another way, US Geological Survey (2019) maps a Mercalli severity of VI to a maximum Richter scale reading of 5.9,
and a severity of VIII to a minimum Richter scale reading of 7.0--a greater-than-10-fold difference in intensity.
  45 Online Appendix Figure A.1 presents analogous figures based on the Italian official statistics,

reports the change in emigration after the earthquake (the ratio of the average annual emigration rates for

1909­1912 relative to those for 1905­1908). Consistent with the expansion of migration to the southeast

of Sicily, the greatest increase over time appears to have been in these areas with previously low migration

rates.46 There is little apparent evidence of an impact from the earthquake, apart from a decline in emigration

rates in the cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria and some of their adjacent communes.47

    Figure 4 further reinforces the view of a limited impact of the earthquake relative to other forces affecting

migration. Using both the Ellis Island (panel a) and the official emigration data (panel b) for the period

1905­1912, this Figure plots the ratio of the post-to-pre emigration rates against the pre-earthquake average

annual emigration rates, separating the severely damaged and non-severely damaged communes. These

figures both show that any impact of the earthquake was of secondary importance as compared to the

patterns of convergence in emigration rates. There is, however, a clear downward slope in the plots, reflecting

 -convergence in migration rates. This pattern is present in both the severe and non-severe group, with little

difference between the lines for the two groups.48

    Figure 5 provides additional support for the view that any effect of the earthquake was of second-order

relative to other causes of emigration, plotting the average annual commune-level emigration rate over the

period 1905­1912 for four different subsets of communes in the sample--severely damaged, not severely

damaged, not severely damaged within 150 kilometers of the epicenter, and all of Italy. Panel (a) uses the

Ellis Island data and panel (b) uses the official emigration statistics. The dominant pattern in these trends

is the large decline in average emigration rates in 1908 in response to the Panic of 1907, from over 15 per

thousand to about 5 per thousand in the Ellis Island data and from over 40 per thousand to about 20 per

thousand in the official statistics over 1906­1908. Conversely, the trends for both the severely damaged and

other communes in Sicily and Calabria appear similar both before and after the earthquake at the end of

1908, further suggesting that on average, the effect of the earthquake on a severely damaged commune's

emigration rate was minimal, and certainly so relative to temporal fluctuations in migration.


   46 In the official emigration statistics, the average annual emigration rates for the southeastern provinces of Syracuse and

Catania in the period 1905­1908 were 24.6 and 22.7 per thousand--high by external standards, but the lowest of any provinces
in Sicily or Calabria in this period. While Catania (along with every other province in the area except Syracuse) experienced a
decline in average annual migration rates in the period 1909­1912, Syracuse experienced an increase in average annual emigration
rates by a factor of 1.16 over this period.
   47 This decline is not mirrored in the official statistics of Online Appendix Figure A.1.
   48 Spitzer (2016) and Spitzer and Zimran (2020) perform similar analyses. There is a natural concern that the negative

correlation comes from the fact that the pre-earthquake emigration rate appears on the x-axis and also inversely on the y -axis.
To address this concern, we follow Spitzer (2016) and Spitzer and Zimran (2020) in also reporting the correlation between the
ratio and the post-earthquake emigration rate. If the negative relationship were solely mechanical, then we would expect a
positive correlation in this case of the same magnitude as the negative correlation. As evident in the notes to the figures, there is
such a positive correlation, but it is smaller than the negative correlation between the ratio and the pre-earthquake emigration
rates. Thus, there is evidence that some but not all of the negative relationship in Figure 4 is spurious.


                                                                 18
    Were severely damaged communes similar to the non-severely damaged ones? The descriptive statistics

in Table 2 show that there were some differences between the treatment and the control group. It appears

that within 150 kilometers of the epicenter, severely damaged communes were somewhat more populous than

others in 1901, likely reflecting the greater exposure of the two main urban areas in the area of the Strait of

Messina. There was also a slightly lower share of agricultural day laborers and employment in agriculture in

severely damaged communes, though the differences are small. Table 2 also presents information from the

Ellis Island data on pre-earthquake average migrant characteristics. The severely damaged communes had,

on average, older and more male migrants, but restricting the radius of attention to within 150 kilometers

of the earthquake epicenter blunts this difference. Such imperfect balance is an issue that we will directly

address in our analysis by including commune fixed effects in all regressions and by explicitly examining

pre-trends.



4     Empirical Strategy

Our empirical analysis is based on emigration data at the commune-year level for the period 1905­1912.

Because the earthquake occurred in the last days of 1908 (December 28), it is natural to define 1908 as the

last year of the pre-treatment period and 1909 as the first year of the post-treatment period. The length of

the period that the analysis covers is motivated by the prior expectation that the impact of the earthquake

might evolve over several years. Our event study specifications explore the sensitivity of the findings to

changing the duration of the experiment window. We limit our benchmark sample to communes in the

regions of Sicily and Reggio Calabria, in which the affected communes are located. We also include results

in which we limit attention to communes within 150 kilometers of the epicenter to more closely focus on the

affected region, as well as specifications including all communes in Italy.

    Our benchmark empirical approach is the generalized difference-in-differences equation with non-parametric

province-specific time trends,


                              log(eit ) = pt + i + (si  qt ) + (di  qt ) + "it ,                            (1)


where eit is the emigration rate of commune i in year t, pt are province-year fixed effects, and i are

commune fixed effects. The commune fixed effects capture time-invariant differences in emigration rates

across communes. The province-year fixed effects capture province-specific year-to-year variations, addressing

annual volatility in migration rates and the potential variability of this volatility across the study area. The


                                                      19
coefficient of interest in these regressions is , which is the coefficient on the interaction of an indicator for

whether a commune was severely damaged by the earthquake (si ) and an indicator for years 1909 and later

(qt ). We cluster standard errors at the district level, which captures the possibility of spatial correlation

between the errors of nearby communes, even across different years. Equation (1) also includes an interaction

of the logarithm of distance from Corleone (di )--the nearest emigration "epicenter" from which migration

spread--and the "post" indicator qt . We include this interaction in all of our difference-in-differences analyses

to account for differential trends stemming from distance from the early sources of emigration, which, as

discussed above, is an important source of potentially non-parallel trends.49 Identification is based on the

degree to which severely damaged communes deviated in the post-treatment period from the trend of other

communes in the same province, beyond deviations implied by their distance from Corleone. We also use this

specification with alternate outcomes reflecting the average migrant characteristics of each commune-year.

    In all of our analyses we weight each commune equally rather than by its population, its share of aggregate

emigration, or some other measure of size. Each commune thus constitutes a separate instance. Importantly,

this implies that the cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria, despite their large population, death toll, and

refugee streams, are treated as just two of many communes. Weighting by population would cause us to

derive much of our identification from the cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria, in which the effects of

the earthquake may have been idiosyncratic and unrepresentative.50 This approach corresponds to the

motivation to understand how a typical commune was affected by the earthquake rather than to quantify

the total effect of the earthquake.

    Our preferred emigration outcome variable is the logarithm of the emigration rate as measured in the Ellis

Island data. We also examine alternative outcome variables, representing different aspects of emigration.

These alternatives include an Ellis Island-based measure of migration of prime-aged (18­65) males, which

we take as the group that was the most likely to react to labor market incentives, and total emigration rates

from the Italian official statistics. We also estimate specifications in which we adjust the emigration rate in




   49 For the all-Italy specifications, we control for year-specific functions for the logarithm of the distance from the nearest

emigration "epicenter" for migration to North America as identified by Spitzer and Zimran (2020). These are Corleone in the
province of Palermo, Sala Consilina in the province of Salerno, Isernia in the province of Campobasso, Pozzuoli in the province
of Naples, and Chiavari and Albenga in the province of Genoa.
   50 Because of their importance in the economy of the affected area and the extent of the damage, much of the attention of

the authorities at the time of the disaster, and subsequently of the historical literature and of the popular memory of the event,
has focused on the experience of these cities, and especially of Messina. But these cities were just two of the many affected
(and 109 severely damaged) communities, whereas the responses of the remaining smaller communes is poorly documented and
understood. Shedding more light on the aftermath of the earthquake beyond the major cities is an additional contribution of
this paper.

the post-earthquake period according to the estimated death toll.51

     Finally, to provide a test of the parallel trends assumption inherent in equation (1), to better understand

the dynamics of the response (if any) to the earthquake, and to determine if the results are driven by the

definition of the experiment window, we also adapt equation (1) into an event study specification. Specifically,

we estimate an equation of the form


                                              log(eit ) = pt + i +        t si   +   t di   + "it ,                           (2)


where all terms are defined analogously to equation (1) and the coefficients                          and   are permitted to vary

by year.



5       Results

5.1       Aggregate Effects of the Earthquake

Our benchmark results point toward the null hypothesis, that there was no meaningful effect of the earthquake

on subsequent emigration flows. Table 3 presents the results of estimating the generalized difference-in-

differences specification of equation (1) for a variety of geographic scopes and definitions of the outcome.52

Our preferred estimates, which use the Ellis Island data with no adjustments and include all of Sicily and

Calabria, are in column (1) of Panel A. The estimated coefficient of -0.056 is statistically insignificant

and points to a small decline in emigration from affected areas of less than six percent.53 The remaining

specifications of Table 3 show that this qualitative result of a small and statistically insignificant effect is

not driven by the choice of dependent variable or geographic scope; almost all of the estimated treatment

effects are negative, small, and statistically insignificant.

    51 Specifically,   we compute the alternative emigration rate e ~it as

   52 In Online Appendix A, we include several alternative versions of these results. Online Appendix Table A.1 repeats the

results using the actual Mercalli score or an imputation where the score is not available as the measure of treatment rather than
the discrete severe-not severe indicator. We do not prefer this dose-response specification because there is no reason to believe
that the Mercalli scores are cardinal and because there is little basis on which to believe that the imputation of Mercalli scores
is correct (though as discussed above it does appear that all severely damaged communes were included in the survey). Online
Appendix Table A.2 uses the negative of the logarithm of the distance from the epicenter as the measure of treatment. In all
cases the results are qualitatively similar to those in Table 3
   53 That is, a decline in the average annual emigration rate from about 15 per thousand (the pre-earthquake average, as shown

in Table 2) to about 14 per thousand.


                                                                     21
   Figure 6 presents year-specific treatment effects from the event study specification of equation (2) with

a variety of dependent variables. As in Panel A of Table 3, the sample includes all communes in Sicily and

Calabria. First, these specifications provide a clear test of the parallel trends assumption underlying the

difference-in-differences analysis. They also show how any effect of the earthquake in the post-earthquake

period evolved over time. Our preferred results are presented in panel (a), which uses emigration counts from

Ellis Island with no adjustments. Although the standard errors for each year's treatment effect are naturally

larger, the point estimates show no evidence of meaningfully different behavior of severely affected and

other communes prior to the earthquake, as evidenced by the small magnitude of the coefficients in the pre-

treatment period. After the shock, there was a slight (just under 0.08 log points) but statistically insignificant

decline in emigration in the severely damaged communes in 1909, the first year after the earthquake. This

decline then disappeared within a year, and in subsequent years the severely damaged communes followed

the same trends as the unaffected communes. The lack of a clear impact of the earthquake is not due to

an idiosyncrasy of our choice of how to measure emigration: the results using alternative outcome variables

are largely similar, though the precise magnitudes and patterns differ between them. On the whole, based

on these results and those of Table 3, there appears to have been no statistically significant effect of the

earthquake, and at most, the point estimates indicate a small and short-lived decline in emigration from

affected communes.54

   To evaluate the effect of the earthquake on the demographic composition of emigration, we repeat the

estimation of equation (1) using some simple characteristics of migrants, presenting the results in Table

4. This estimation asks whether the average immigrant characteristic of a commune was affected by the

earthquake. For all four characteristics--age, male, prime-aged male, and child (i.e., less than 16 years

old)--and all five geographic scopes that we study, we find no evidence of a statistically significant effect

of the earthquake. The point estimates are small and relatively precisely estimated. For instance, column

(2) of panel A indicates that there was a 1.5 percentage-point decline in the fraction of migrants who were

male in response to the shock relative to a pre-earthquake mean of over 85 percent in the severely damaged

communes. These results further strengthen the conclusion that there is no evidence of a strong effect of the

earthquake on migration.




   54 Online Appendix C provides additional evidence of little to no effect of the earthquake based on a linkage of passenger

records to a census of refugees.

5.2       Statistical Power and Economic Significance

A challenge to our interpretation of these results as indicating a lack of an effect of the earthquake is that

the estimates for the effects on migration rates are statistically imprecise. In our preferred specification in

column (1) of Panel A of Table 3, the 95-percent confidence interval for the earthquake effect ranges from

a decrease in emigration of 0.33 log points to an increase of 0.22 log points. This raises the question of

whether we can rule out that an economically significant response to the earthquake occurred. In part, this

is a matter of how to define economic significance. To be sure, a 20-percent response may not be negligible,

but it is important to keep in mind the magnitude of the disaster, which was among the worst in centuries

of European history, and the ubiquity of international migration in the affected region. If there were any

case in which we expect a clear and large effect of a natural disaster on emigration, it is this one.

    Moreover, even the extremes of the confidence interval of our estimates allow us to rule out several

important benchmark magnitudes for the effect of the earthquake. One yardstick is the decline in emigration

resulting from the Panic of 1907, just one year before the earthquake. There is a wide agreement in the

literature that this short-lived recession greatly reduced US immigration from all European origin countries

(Hatton and Williamson 1998, ch. 4), and southern Italy was no exception. Communes severely damaged by

the earthquake experienced a decline in average migration rates from 1907 to 1908 from 15 per thousand to

4 per thousand (panel a of Figure 5)--a decline of 1.293 log points.55 Our 95-percent confidence interval for

the impact of the earthquake can easily rule out a decline of this magnitude.56 Conversely, the maximum

range of the confidence interval also allows us to rule out a change of the magnitude of the aggregate change

in migration from 1908­1909, when recovery from the recession led to a resurgence of emigration of almost

the same magnitude as the prior decline. It follows a fortiori that the effect implied by our point estimate

is extremely small relative to this benchmark effect of US business cycle fluctuations.

    This particular comparison also bears on the "push-pull" debate of migration (e.g., Gould 1979; Hatton

and Williamson 1998; Jerome 1926; Kuznets 1958), which considers whether the size of migratory flows was

primarily determined by conditions in the origin or destination countries. Although this specific case does

not permit the drawing of more general conclusions, the small impact of an undoubtedly cataclysmic event

in Italy on migration, in particular as compared to the much larger effect of a transient shock outside Italy in


  55 In   the official data, the decline over 1906-1908 is from over 45 per thousand to just over 20 per thousand--a decline of
0.79 log points. Over 1907­1908, the decline is from about 34 per thousand to just over 20 per thousand, a decline of 0.49 log
points. But the confidence interval for the estimated effect of the earthquake on emigration rates is also smaller when using the
official statistics, ranging from a decline of 0.21 log points to a rise of 0.10 log points.
    56 The 1907­1908 change also exceeds the bounds of our confidence interval for the one-year impact of the earthquake, as

evident in panel (a) of Figure 6.


                                                               23
the form of a US recession, points strongly to pull factors in the United States as being key drivers of the size

of the migratory flow from Italy to the United States. Notably, the small impact of the earthquake relative

to that of the business cycle is similar to Boustan's (2007) finding that the Russian Jewish emigration to the

United States was primarily determined by the state of the US economy and that pogroms had at most a

second-order effect.

    Other useful yardsticks can be derived from prior studies estimating the effects of natural and man-

made disasters in other contexts. The Age of Mass Migration provides a few such examples. Spitzer (2016)

estimates the effect of a pogrom on the emigration of Russian Jews from another "migration-saturated"

region--the Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire around 1905. He finds that exposure to a pogrom

led to an increase in emigration of about 20 percent. Although this estimate is within the bounds of our

95 percent confidence interval for the effect of the earthquake, it is close to the upper extreme, allowing us

to be reasonably confident that the Messina-Reggio Calabria earthquake did not have a larger impact. The

Great Irish Famine of 1846­1850 is another useful comparison, in the sense that it was a disaster that had

had an immense toll in lives and has been linked to subsequent mass migration (Ó Gráda 2019; Ó Gráda

and O'Rourke 1997). Although the effect of the famine has not been formally quantified, the large impact

of the shock is evident in the fact that the number of Irish immigrants to the United States more than

doubled between 1846 and 1847 (Barde, Carter, and Sutch 2006) when the famine intensified, even as the

base population declined dramatically. We can easily rule out changes of this magnitude in our context.

    Another analysis of the link between natural disasters and international migration is provided by Mahajan

and Yang (2020), who focus on the effects of hurricanes on migration to the United States. The benchmark

estimate that they provide is that a so-called "one-standard-deviation" hurricane (a smaller shock than the

Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake) increased migration by 11.8 percent of the mean--an estimate within

the bounds of our confidence interval. Mahajan and Yang (2020) also find that the effect of a hurricane on

migration is increasing in the size of the existing migrant stock from the country of origin in the United States.

We estimate that in 1908, the Italian migrant stock in the United States was about 3.8 percent of the Italian

population.57 This estimate provides a lower bound on the previous migrant stock in the United States of

the earthquake-affected region, where emigration rates to the United States were considerably higher: in the

period 1900­1914, the emigration rate to North America from Sicily and Calabria was about 2.4 times that
  57 In 1900, the stock of Italian-born individuals in the United States was 484,027; by 1910, this figure was 1,343,125 (Haines
2006). To estimate the stock in 1908, we use information from Barde, Carter, and Sutch (2006) on Italian arrivals in the
United States. Based on the fact that 1,830,340 arrivals in 1901­1909 corresponded to an increase in population of 859,098
from 1900 to 1910, we assume that the 1,647,122 arrivals from 1901­1908 corresponded to a (proportional) population increase
of 773,102, making our estimated stock of Italians in the United States after 1908 1,257,129, which is 3.8 percent of the 1901
Italian population of 32,965,504.


                                                              24
of Italy as a whole, implying that a previous migrant stock of as much as 9 percent in the United States is

not unreasonable.58 According to the estimates of Mahajan and Yang (2020, Table 1), a previous migrant

stock of 3.8 percent corresponds to an estimated effect of a "one-standard-deviation" hurricane of about 10

percent of the mean; this estimate is again within the bounds of our confidence interval, though if we accept

an estimate of a prior migrant stock of 9 percent, the implied estimate is at the extreme of our confidence

interval. Arguably, the most appropriate comparison given the open borders of the period we study, however,

is Mahajan and Yang's (2020) estimate of the effect of a hurricane conditional on the stock of US citizens

(rather than simply prior migrants) from the country of origin. This is because these individuals are able to

support migration of individuals from their country of origin with the least interference of policy, as would

have been the case for Italians in the United States in the open border period of the Age of Mass Migration.

Applying the estimates of Mahajan and Yang (2020, Table 3) to a citizen stock of 3.8 percent of the origin

population yields an estimated effect of a shock of 43.9 percent of the sample mean--well outside the bounds

of our confidence interval.

    Instances of disaster-induced internal migration in the United States also provide useful points of compar-

ison. A close analog to the event that we study is the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, which, despite its

salience as a shock of the same type, was far less destructive than the Messina-Reggio Calabria earthquake.

Ager et al. (2020, Table 1) find that this earthquake had no impact on out-migration rates. Importantly,

however, whereas southern Italy in 1908 was the center of mass emigration, the American west in 1906 was

the destination of many in -migrants from abroad and from the rest of the United States. Ager et al. (2020,

Table 1) find that a one-standard deviation increase in earthquake intensity reduced the in-migration rate

over the period 1900-1910 by 11 percentage points relative to a mean of about 52 percent, or about a 20

percent decline. This magnitude is close to the upper bound of the confidence interval of our estimate,

making it unlikely that the effect of the Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake was equal or stronger.

    Another important natural disaster in US history was the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Long and Siu (2018,

Table 2, p. 1009) show that Dust Bowl counties experienced an increase in inter-county emigration rates

from 47.2 percent to 51.6 percent from the 1920s to the 1930s while the rest of the country experienced a

decline in inter-county migration rates. Though this is a crude comparison, this increase of about 23 percent

is at the upper extreme of our confidence interval.59 In another natural disaster in the United States,

Lange, Olmstead, and Rhode (2009, pp. 713­714) find that the boll weevil caused a decline of population
   58 A lack of information on within-country place of origin in US censuses prevents us from performing a similar calculation

to that of footnote 57 regarding the stock of prior migrants for the earthquake-affected region.
   59 A crude difference-in-differences that compares this increase to the decline in migration in the rest of the country only

strengthens this conclusion.


                                                              25
of 30 percent in five years (i.e., an average annual out-migration rate of 6 percent or higher from areas that

previously were not engaged in considerable internal migration) in the counties most reliant on cotton prior

to the shock. More generally, Boustan et al. (2017) study natural disasters in the United States in the 20th

century. They find that a "super-severe" disaster in a county led to an increase in its out migration rate by

3 percentage points relative to an average out migration rate of 1 percentage point (Boustan et al. 2017,

Tables 1 and 2)--substantially larger than the one that we estimate.

    In sum, although our estimates are statistically imprecise, hindering our ability to definitively conclude

that there was no meaningful effect of the earthquake on international migration, our standard errors are

nevertheless sufficiently small to conclude that any effect that may have existed was small as compared to

those of similar or weaker shocks that have been studied in prior research.


5.3     District- and Province-Level Analysis

The preceding analysis has focused on the commune as the unit of analysis. While studying the smallest

administrative unit in Italy is appealing and provides more observations, a concern is that the no-spillovers

assumption inherent in the difference-in-differences and event study analyses may be violated if, for instance,

the shock to the urban labor markets of Messina and Reggio Calabria changed the migration incentives for

individuals in communes that were not severely damaged. If these spillovers led the unaffected communes'

emigration to be affected in the same direction as that of affected communes, this bias would push our

estimates toward zero, limiting our ability to conclude that any effect of the earthquake on migration was

small. To gauge whether such spillover effects biased the magnitude of the estimated effects, we expand the

unit of analysis to the district (of which there were 284 in Italy, including 11 in Calabria and 24 in Sicily)

or the province (of which there were 69, including 3 in Calabria and 7 in Sicily). Specifically, we estimate

versions of equation (2) in which the unit of observation is the district-year or the province-year, the province-

year fixed effects are replaced with region-year fixed effects (there were 15 regions, or compartimenti ), and

the control for distance from Corleone is removed.60 An important caveat in this analysis is that focusing

on larger administrative units considerably reduces the number of observations. For this reason we focus on

a specification that includes all Italian districts or provinces in the sample.

    We classify a district or province as "treated" if at least 40 percent of its population lived in a commune

that was severely damaged by the earthquake. In practice, this results in the five closest districts to the

epicenter (Castroreale and Messina in Sicily and Gerace Marina, Palmi, and Reggio Calabria in Calabria) and
   60 The reduced granularity of the data and the greater importance of non-US destinations in a country-level analysis limits

the degree to which we can capture diffusion.


                                                             26
the two closest provinces to the epicenter (Messina and Reggio Calabria) being treated. The small number

of treated units in such an analysis raises issues of inference (MacKinnon and Webb 2020). To address this

concern, we use a randomization inference approach that builds on the one used by Arthi, Beach, and Hanlon

(2019). We randomly chose 500 points in Italy, assigned the five closest districts or the two closest provinces

as treated, and estimated the adapted versions of equation (2). We then ask whether our estimates using

the actual treated areas stand out relative to those with these alternative treated areas.

   We focus these results, which are presented in Figure 7, on the unadjusted official statistics because they

provide more complete coverage of areas outside of southern Italy, which are included in these specifications.

In these areas, migration to destinations other than the United States was considerably more important,61

implying that the loss of information arising from focusing only on migration to the United States--as

the Ellis Island data require--may be more severe.62 In these results, there is no evidence of differential

pre-trends between affected and unaffected districts, at least from 1906. The point estimates for 1909 are

consistent with a transient effect, if any, of the earthquake on emigration, this time a positive one. In all

cases, any difference between affected and unaffected districts or provinces vanishes by 1910. Moreover, the

randomization inference bands indicate that the documented increase in emigration from affected districts

and provinces does not stand out relative to the placebo effects from the 500 randomly placed "epicenters."

Although these results are limited by the small number of observations available to analyze trends at the

province and district level, we view them as providing supportive evidence for our findings above that any

aggregate effect of the earthquake on emigration was minimal and short-lived.


5.4    Labor Force Composition and Heterogeneous Responses to the Earthquake

Focusing on aggregate impacts of the earthquake may mask heterogeneous and offsetting responses across

communes. These responses might have been meaningful in magnitude and duration in many places; yet given

the results above, any such heterogeneous responses evidently cancelled each other out in the aggregate. As

discussed above, there could be several factors that might make a prospective migrant more or less responsive

to the shock. The size of the network, typically measured as a function of past migration, is surely a crucial

factor (Mahajan and Yang 2020). In Online Appendix D, we explicitly check for heterogeneous responses

according to a commune's pre-1908 stock of prior migrants but find no evidence for its existence.63 This

   61 In the northern regions of Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia Romagna, over 77 percent of migrants in the period

1900­1914 traveled to other European countries.
   62 Results for alternative dependent variables are presented in Online Appendix Figures A.2 and A.3.
   63 We also check for heterogeneity according to exposure to another earthquake in 1905 and according to a commune's

district-level share of labor in construction in 1901. There is no clear evidence of heterogeneity in this dimension.


                                                           27
finding is consistent with Mahajan and Yang's (2020) finding of an interaction between the level of migration

and the stock of past migrants because we have specified the outcome variable in logarithmic terms, which

makes the estimated effect proportional to the base rate of migration.

    Another obvious suspect for a potential source of heterogeneity in response to the earthquake is an

individual's socio-economic status. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient individual-level data to study

changes in migration by occupation.64 But we do have data on the composition of the local labor force by

industry at the level of the district, and in particular on the share of agricultural workers, who were about 60

percent of the labor force (Table 2). More specifically, we observe the shares of different types of agricultural

workers, divided into several categories. The different types of agricultural workers differed in both their

standards of living and in their level of attachment to the land. Renters, lessees, and owner-occupiers, who

had a stake in cultivating the land to which they were attached, could not abandon it costlessly on short

notice and would have experienced the "greater exigency" of an incentive to rebuild after the shock. Day

laborers, who were about half of the agricultural labor force (Table 2) may or may not have been more

likely to migrate in general,65 but relative to other agricultural workers, they were unfettered by contractual

obligations or vested capital and, for this reason, potentially were more prone to quickly react to unexpected

shocks. To evaluate the heterogeneity of the response with respect to socio-economic status and to the degree

of attachment to the land, we test whether in fact areas where agricultural day laborers were a greater share

of the labor force were more responsive to damage from the earthquake.

    Our empirical approach is to adjust the difference-in-differences specification of equation (1) to the form


                 log(eit ) = pt + i + (si  qt ) + (di  qt ) + (xi  qt ) +  (si  xi  qt ) + "it ,                              (3)


where xi is some characteristic of commune i and  is the interaction coefficient of interest. Similarly, we

adjust the event study specification of equation (2) to the form


                             log(eit ) = pt + i +        t si   +    t xi   + t ( s i  x i ) +   t di   + "it .               (4)



    64 Spitzer and Zimran (2018) transcribed occupation and literacy data for a limited sample of migrants in the Ellis Island

passenger lists, but this sample is too small to analyze changes in commune-year averages.
    65 There is reason to believe that agricultural day laborers made up the bulk of the flow of immigrants from Italy as a whole,

although it is impossible to positively verify this. In Spitzer and Zimran's (2018) sample, 47.8 percent of male migrants over age
22 reported an unskilled job, with another 37.1 percent reporting a farming occupation. However, given the age distribution,
it is very likely that some or even most of those listed as farmers were, in fact, farm laborers. That farmers were the shortest
occupational group (Spitzer and Zimran 2018, Table A.2, p. 243) is consistent with this. Moreover, it is very likely that those
listing an occupation of "laborer" were in fact farm laborers; see also Pérez's (2019, pp. 13­14) argument that the distinction
between farmers and unskilled laborers in passenger manifests is not particularly informative.


                                                                    28
We begin by focusing on results with xi as the 1901 district-level share of employment as agricultural day

laborers, which we adjust to have mean zero and standard deviation one in the sample.

    Table 5 presents the results of estimating equation (3) for unadjusted emigration data for Sicily and Cal-

abria.66 Columns (1)­(4) use the Ellis Island data while columns (5)­(8) use the official statistics. Columns

(1) and (5) repeat results from Table 3 for comparison. Our main results for heterogeneity by employment

in agricultural day labor are in columns (2) and (6). These results indicate a small and statistically insignif-

icant reaction of communes at the mean to the earthquake. But they also show that there is a statistically

significant relationship between a district's share of employment in agricultural day labor and the response

of communes in that district to the earthquake shock. In column (2), we find that a commune with an

agricultural day labor share one standard deviation above the mean experienced an increase in emigration

of over 35 percent in response to the earthquake shock. It is important to note, however, that even this rela-

tively large response of areas with a higher agricultural day labor share was small relative to the fluctuation

in migration rates in response to the Panic of 1907.

    To more easily see the different reaction of communes with different agricultural day labor shares to

the earthquake, Figure 8 estimates equation (4) over the same sample using an indicator for being above

the sample median in terms of the agricultural day labor share as xi . Panel (a), which uses the Ellis

Island data, shows clear evidence of a differential reaction to the earthquake in terms of the composition of

local labor force. Whereas communes in both above- and below-median districts show no pre-trend, there

is a readily apparent (and statistically significant) divergence in the effect of the earthquake on affected

districts.67 Communes in districts with an above-median share of agricultural day laborers show an increase

in emigration in response to the earthquake of 23 percent in 1909, whereas communes with a below-median

share show a decrease in 1909 of 46 percent. After 1909, there remains a divergence between the two groups

of communes, though the difference is smaller--an increase of about 10 percent and a decrease of about 17

percent in 1911, both statistically insignificant. The event-study results with the official statistics in panel

(b) are less dispositive, however, requiring us to treat these results with some skepticism.68

    Was this heterogeneity indeed linked to the structure of the agricultural labor force, or merely to its size

relative to that of other sectors? In columns (3) and (7), we estimate equation (3) with the share of a district's

male labor force employed in agriculture in 1901, standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one

in the sample, as xip . In column (3), the coefficient is weaker than for the purely unattached agricultural labor
  66 Results  for other dependent variables and geographic scopes are presented in Online Appendix Table A.3.
  67 As  with our analysis of the aggregate effects above, there is concern that spillovers may lead to a bias in this analysis. But
these spillovers would tend to work against our finding in this section of an effect of the earthquake.
   68 Results for alternative dependent variables are presented in Online Appendix Figure A.4.




                                                                29
force, but is still large and statistically significant;69 in column (7), the estimate is similar to that for column

(6). Columns (4) and (8) allow for heterogeneous earthquake responses by both characteristics, effectively

"horse-racing" the two.70 In column (4), the coefficient on the interaction with general agricultural labor

is considerably reduced relative to column (3) and is statistically insignificant. Conversely, the coefficient

on the interaction with the share in agricultural day labor is only slightly reduced and remains statistically

significant. This suggests that the positive effect is indeed specific to the unattached agricultural labor.

   Again, performing the same exercise with the official statistics (column 8) gives less conclusive results.

In this case, neither the interaction with the agricultural day laborer share nor with the general agricultural

labor share is statistically significant, though the magnitude of the coefficient on the interaction of the

agricultural day laborer share remains similar, but is less precisely estimated, as compared to column (6).

Thus, the results of column (8) cannot definitively differentiate between the role of general and unattached

agricultural labor. On the whole, however, we conclude that the results of Table 5 and Figure 8 show strong

evidence of a heterogeneous impact of the earthquake on emigration according to employment in agriculture,

and suggest that it is specifically the unattached portion of the agricultural labor force that is associated

with a positive migration response to the disaster.


5.5     Discussion

In light of the devastation wrought by the Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake and the ubiquity of mass

migration in Sicily and Calabria at the time of the shock, our finding that there was no discernible positive

impact on migration from the average commune is surprising. It is, however, consistent with economic theory

and with findings of no effect or a negative effect of natural disasters on migration in other contexts (e.g.,

Beine, Noy, and Parsons 2019; Beine and Parsons 2015; Cattaneo and Peri 2016; Gröschl and Steinwachs

2017; Halliday 2006; Hunter, Murray, and Riosmena 2013; Nawrotzki and DeWaard 2018; Yang 2008b),

though unlike these cases, our results cannot be attributed to legal restrictions on international migration.

   This literature has proposed a number of explanations for this so-called "immobility paradox." The main

explanation is that the devastation from the disaster led to a tightening of liquidity constraints. While we do

not have the data with which to directly test for this mechanism, the lack of a sustained decline in migration

rates in severely damaged areas--either relative to other areas (Figure 6) or relative to pre-existing trends

(Figure 5)--is on its face inconsistent with such a mechanism. Moreover, since day laborers were likely the

poorest of the agricultural classes, an increase in migration where they were most common is inconsistent
  69 Results    for other geographic scopes and dependent variables are presented in Online Appendix Table A.4.
  70 Full   results are presented in Online Appendix Table A.5.


                                                               30
with the tightening of liquidity constraints as a factor affecting migration in response to the earthquake.

    A rise in reconstruction labor demand as the explanation for our results is also inconsistent with the lack

of a significant inflow of labor from the hinterland to the heavily damaged cities (Table 1) and with the

delays in reconstruction documented above. It is also inconsistent with our findings of higher responsiveness

of areas with more agricultural day laborers. These individuals, instead of migrating abroad, could have

migrated to the urban areas in search of reconstruction labor, but evidently did not do so. However, a lack

of detailed data on internal migration and wages prevent us from formally testing this mechanism.71

    Another possible explanation for the lack of a migration response is that natural disasters are one-time

shocks that do not affect the long-term attractiveness of a location.72 But the lack of a response to the

Messina-Reggio Calabria Earthquake cannot be explained in this way. As described above, the effects of

the earthquake on the affected areas were long lasting, with reconstruction continuing even after World War

I. The earthquake thus did constitute a long-term change to the attractiveness of areas along the Strait of

Messina.73 A lack of networks in potential destinations (e.g., Mahajan and Yang 2020; Spitzer 2016) may also

have limited the ability of individuals to respond to the earthquake through overseas emigration. However,

as discussed above, extremely high rates of migration prior to the earthquake imply that this cannot be

an explanation for a lack of response to a shock. Additionally, Bohra-Mishra, Oppenheimer, and Hsiang

(2014) suggest that temporary migration may be more responsive than permanent migration to shocks. As

discussed above, however, the largely temporary nature of the Italian migration also rules out this potential

explanation. Finally, Bettin and Zazzaro (2018), David (2011), Mohapatra, Joseph, and Ratha (2009), Paul

(2005), and Yang (2008a) attribute such results to remittance flows and other financial inflows to the affected

area. We have not been able to locate data on remittances that would enable us to test this mechanism. But

there is evidence from the historical literature that governmental financial inflow to the area, though initially

present,74 were limited. For instance, only 866 of 30,000 businesses that applied were granted subsidies in

the first four months after the earthquake (Di Paola and Savasta 2005), and the head of the relief committee

forbade the allocation of funds to individuals (Bosworth 1981).

    Instead, the explanation for a lack of response of migration to this shock may lie in our findings on


   71 Arcari (1936) provides province-level information on wages of various classes of agricultural workers, including agricultural

day laborers beginning in 1905 (see also Federico, Nuvolari, and Vasta 2019). There is a general upward trend in wages in
Messina, with no discernible deviation after the earthquake. However, the lack of more geographically detailed data prevents
any stronger conclusion.
   72 There is stronger evidence in some settings of an effect of changing temperatures--a longer-term change in the attractiveness

of a location--on emigration (e.g., Bohra-Mishra, Oppenheimer, and Hsiang 2014; Cattaneo and Peri 2016) than of an effect of
single shocks.
   73 In Online Appendix D, we also show that the evidence of responsiveness to repeated earthquake shocks is limited.
   74 Parrinello (2015) indicates that the equivalent of about 82 million current Euros by the end of February 1909.




                                                                31
the heterogeneous response of areas of different labor market compositions, that there were effects that

differed across parts of the affected area and offset one another. That these effects varied on the basis of

the share of employment in agricultural day labor is consistent with the "greater exigencies" theory, as the

agricultural day laborers, not owning or occupying any land, would be least affected by the new incentive

for reconstruction of damaged property. This finding indicates that attachment to the land may have been

an important determinant of responsiveness to such shocks.



6    Conclusion

How does a large shock to an area already experiencing mass migration affect migration? Does migration

provide relief, as in many other cases? Or does the damage, destruction, and recovery hinder emigration?

This paper answers these questions in the context of the most devastating earthquake to strike modern

Europe, and arguably the most destructive natural disaster in modern European history, which occurred

in the midst of the Age of Mass Migration in one of the areas most affected by this phenomenon. Using a

dataset of emigration rates at the commune level for the period 1905­1912 (Spitzer and Zimran 2018, 2020),

we find that on aggregate there was no more than a negligible and short-lived effect of the earthquake on

emigration from affected communes. But this does not imply that the earthquake had no effect at all on

emigration. Instead, we find that weaker attachment to the land was associated with increased migration--a

result consistent with the "greater exigencies" mechanism of natural disasters reducing migration, and with

attachment to the land acting as a barrier to responding to shocks through migration.

    The results of this paper add to the large recent literature on the Age of Mass Migration, and to the

debate over the impact of push and pull factors on migration in this context (Gould 1979; Hatton and

Williamson 1998), pointing to a weak role for push factors relative to pull factors. More importantly for

current international migration, we shed light on the question of how migration is affected by natural and

man-made disasters. As a changing climate has increased the likelihood of natural disasters (Intergovern-

mental Panel on Climate Change 2012), in particular in the developing world, concern has grown over the

degree to which individuals will be displaced (World Bank 2018). It remains an open question whether and

under what circumstances individuals in the affected region can find relief through migration, and moreover

whether such shocks will lead to an influx of refugees to developed countries. However, the results of this

paper show that in areas with a high rate of pre-disaster migration struck by a devastating shock need not

produce migration in response, even when borders are open.

 Notes : Standard deviations in parentheses. Observations are at the commune-year level. Mercalli measures are imputed where missing. Observation numbers
are the minimum with observations for all variables in the Ellis Island-based dataset. Commune numbers are the number of distinct communes among these
observations. Emigration rates are expressed per thousand population for clarity, but we use the (logarithm of the) decimal rate for analysis.

All regressions include commune fixed effects, province-year indicators, and log distance from
Corleone-times-post, except for the results for all of Italy, which include log distance from the
nearest emigration epicenter times post. Observations limited to 1905­1912.

 Significance levels : a p<0.01, b p<0.05, c p<0.1
 Notes : Sample includes all communes in the regions of Sicily and Calabria. Dependent variable is unadjusted emigration rate
relative to 1901 population from the source listed in the column header. Standard errors clustered on the district level are in
parentheses. Ag Share is defined as the fraction of the 1901 male labor force in agriculture at the district level, and is standardized
to have mean zero and standard deviation one. Ag Lab Share is the share of the 1901 male labor force in agricultural day labor
(giornalieri di campagna ) at the district level and is standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one in the sample.
All regressions include commune fixed effects, province-year indicators, and log distance from Corleone-times-post. Observations
limited to 1905­1912.

Note: The large dot indicates the earthquake epicenter. Panel (a) presents the Mercalli scores derived from Guidoboni et al.
(2007), as described in text. Darker colors indicate higher Mercalli severity; white communes have no data. Panel (b) presents
the severity indicator, which takes a value of one for communes with Mercalli severity of at least VIII. Communes with no
Mercalli data have their severity based on an inverse-distance-weighted imputation; in practice all missing communes have an
imputed Mercalli score less than VIII and thus are not considered "severely damaged." The red circle in panel (b) marks a
radius of 150 kilometers from the earthquake epicenter.

Note: "Severe" indicates communes experiencing severe damage from the earthquake. "Not Severe" indicates all communes in

the period 1905­1908 to 1909­1912 (i.e., the ratio of the latter to the former) against the average annual emigration rate for
1905­1908 at the commune level using data from Ellis Island. Communes that more than tripled their migration (27 in panel
a and 2 in panel b) are omitted from the scatterplots (but not the non-parametric regressions) for clarity. One commune in
panel (a) with a 1905­1908 migration rate over 0.08 is also omitted from the scatter plot for clarity.

Note: Sample includes all communes in the regions of Sicily and Calabria. All event studies control for a year-specific function
of distance from Corleone and have 1907 as the base year. Bars indicate 95 percent confidence intervals clustered on the
district level. The division into "below median" and "above median" is based on the distribution of the share of employment in
agricultural day labor in the sample. The measure on the y -axis is the effect in log points.
