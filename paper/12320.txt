This introduction to a special issue of EINT surveys a collection of ten papers that study various
aspects of innovation and knowledge management and their impact on performance at the firm level
for a number of countries. These studies have been conducted using data drawn from innovation
surveys combined with data from a number of other sources. The issue illustrates the value of these
surveys in improving our understanding of innovation in firms and raises a number of questions for
future work in this area.

                      EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF INNOVATION

                   IN THE KNOWLEDGE DRIVEN ECONOMY

                                             Introduction

                               Bronwyn H. Hall and Jacques Mairesse



During the past decade a number of countries in Europe and elsewhere have

implemented enterprise-based surveys of innovative activity in an effort to broaden our

collective understanding of the knowledge production and diffusion processes beyond

what can be learned from the long-established analyses that mainly use R&D

expenditures and patent counts as indicators of the input and output of innovation. The

ten studies collected in this special issue all make use of the data collected in such

surveys, in many cases combined with a variety of other data sources, to give a richer

picture of innovative activity at the firm level and of the ways in which knowledge is

generated and transmitted within and between firms.3



These papers fall naturally into two groups. The first group presents five papers

applying a model of the R&D, innovation, and productivity interrelations at the firm

level, more or less similar to that of Crepon, Duguet, and Mairesse (1998) paper

(henceforth CDM) for France, to countries as different as Chile, Sweden, China and the

Netherlands, and to a comparison of seven European countries. The second group



3
    This paper is the introduction to a special issue of Economics of Innovation and New Technology. Most

of the papers in the volume were first presented at a conference organized by Almas Heshmati and Hans

Lööf in Stockholm, Sweden, in January 2001, and have since been substantially revised. A Table of

Contents for the volume is given at the end of the paper.


                                                     2
consists of a number of studies that concern more directly various aspects of firm

knowledge management. We discuss each of these two groups of papers in the next two

sections of the introduction.



ECONOMETRIC MODELS OF R&D, INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY

In an influential article, Griliches (1979) laid out a framework for the analysis of

innovation and productivity growth in the form of a flow chart that showed the path by

which investment in research generated knowledge and the outputs and indicators of

that knowledge. In Figure 1, we reproduce an elaboration of this figure from CDM, an

elaboration that explicitly incorporates the elements used in the first group of papers in

this special issue. The square boxes denote measurable quantities and the oval boxes

unmeasured concepts for which we usually only have rather coarse proxies. Note the

central roles played by the unobservable “knowledge” capital and innovation output in

this graph. Various links in the structure exhibited by this figure have been studied by

many researchers in the past.



The CDM paper accomplished three things with respect to understanding the channels

linking investment in knowledge to productivity growth. The first was to pull together

the important but largely separated lines of empirical research that had evolved since

Griliches’ original conception into an encompassing model that had a structure similar

to his original conception. The strands were studies of the determinants of R&D

investment, patent or innovation production functions, and production function

estimation using R&D (or occasionally innovation or patents) as an input. The second

contribution was to make use of the new information provided by the European

Community Innovation Surveys, in particular the share of sales of innovative products,


                                            3
as an alternative, possibly more appropriate, measure of innovation output than patents.

These surveys also contained a number of potentially useful and interesting qualitative

indicators on the innovation activities of firms such as the sources of innovation and

whether the firm was more strongly influenced by technological changes or user

demand.



The final contribution of the CDM paper was the development of an explicit modelling

framework, in order to use appropriate estimation methods in the presence of sample

selectivity (due to the firm’s choice of whether or not to undertake R&D), potential

endogeneity of some of the right-hand side variables, and the partially qualitative nature

of some of the dependent variables (binary or categorical). In performing these three

tasks, the paper set up a relatively simple framework on which others could build,

varying or improving the economic specification, data used, and econometric

identification and estimation. The several papers in the first part of this volume have

tried to do just this, in a number of different ways and to varying degrees.



The closest to the original CDM approach is that by Jose Miguel Benavente, who used

data from Chile and obtained results that were somewhat different from CDM while

using a model that is almost identical to the original. We will briefly outline the model

used by Benavente, as it can serve as a basis for discussion of all the papers in the first

group. There are three basic equations set up in a recursive manner, one that explains

research investment (R&D per worker), a second that explains innovation (proxied by

innovative sales) using R&D intensity, and a third that translates innovation into

productivity differences (measured as valued added per worker). In some of the other

papers patents were available and are used instead of or in addition to innovative sales.


                                             4
Note that this recursive setup contains no feedback from productivity to innovative

activities, although we might expect such a feedback to exist, either for Schumpeterian

reasons or because of omitted variations in individual firm skills.



Econometrically there are three issues in estimating this kind of model: first, R&D is

undertaken by only a subset of the firms, so consistent estimation requires using a

generalized Tobit model that allows for correlation of the level of R&D with the

decision to undertake R&D. Second, innovation sales is measured as a share of sales,

bounded between 0 and 1, so that it is convenient to model it with a logit transform to

make it normally distributed.4 Finally, there are the usual endogeneity problems due to

the presence of R&D and innovation sales on the right-hand side of some of the

equations. As in CDM, the method of estimation in Benavente is asymptotic least

squares (where the first and second moments of the data are treated as sufficient

statistics for the underlying probability distribution), a consistent but not efficient

estimator. As instruments for R&D in the innovation sales equation, he uses the firm’s

market share and diversification; the instruments for innovation sales in the productivity

equation are simply the determinants of R&D. Demand pull and technology push

indicators are controlled for in both R&D and innovation equations, and industry and

size in all three equations.



Benavente finds that larger firms and firms with higher market shares in their industry

have higher R&D intensities and that larger firms have a higher percentage of

innovative sales. These findings are familiar from other countries, and confirm the


4
    In some cases the responses to this question are categories such as <10%, 10%-25%, and so forth. In

these cases the appropriate model is an ordered probit model of some kind.


                                                      5
Schumpeterian view of innovation as an activity undertaken by larger monopolistic

firms. But contrary to the findings in several of the other papers, he also finds that R&D

did not contribute to innovative sales nor do innovative sales contribute to productivity

for these Chilean firms (once size, capital per worker, industry and demand

pull/technology push is controlled for). This may perhaps be a reflection of the very

differing circumstances in a developing Latin American economy as compared to

Western Europe. In particular it may be more important to specify the dynamic linkages

between R&D, innovation and productivity in a developing economy than a developed

one, for which it is more likely that the cross-sectional estimates of a CDM type model

can reflect long-run relations.



The paper by Gary Jefferson, Bai Huamao, Guan Xiaojing, and Yu Xiaoyun adds an

equation for profitability as well as productivity to the model used by Benavente and

estimates it on 20,000 large and medium-sized Chinese firms. As in the previous case,

controls for size, industry, and the nature of ownership (private, foreign, or government)

are included in all equations. Industry concentration (rather than the market share of the

particular firm), lagged firm profitability, and lagged R&D intensity are used as

instruments for R&D intensity in the new product sales equation. There are no

additional instruments for new product sales except for the firm’s age.



Unlike Benavente, Jefferson et al find that controlling for industry eliminates the

relationship between R&D intensity and size or concentration. This may be because

they have included lagged R&D intensity in their equation, which will tend to reduce

the explanatory power of any other variables due to the widely observed persistence of

R&D (Hall, Griliches, and Hausman 1986). In the case of Chinese firms, R&D intensity


                                            6
does influence new product sales, although it exhibits decreasing returns that are related

to foreign ownership of the firms. In addition innovative sales is associated with greater

productivity and profitability, especially in larger state-owned firms and local

government collectives, suggesting that innovation can make a big difference in this

sector, which is viewed as having an increasingly declining share of output. Jefferson et

al go on to compute the total returns to R&D, finding that they are 3 to 4 times that for

ordinary investment in Chinese firms.



The paper by Hans Lööf and Almas Heshmati applies a version of the CDM model to

Swedish data for the mid-1990s on both manufacturing and service firms. Because they

matched the results of the CIS survey for Sweden to business register data, they are able

to explore the sensitivity of their results to a number of different changes in

specification and variables. In particular, they use a number of variables to measure the

success of innovative output: value added per employee, sales per employee, profit

before and after depreciation, all in logarithmic levels and growth rates, and the sales

margin, in levels. An important difference between their paper and those described

earlier is that their measure of innovation input is more comprehensive than R&D

expenditure, as it includes spending on non-R&D based innovation activities, the

purchase of outside services, machinery, and equipment for innovation activities,

industrial design expense related to producing new products, education directly related

to innovation activities, and some marketing expense. They are also able to include a

number of variables describing the human capital of the employees, the sources of

knowledge available to the firm, their strategies toward cooperation with outside

partners, and the innovation obstacles they face as instruments.




                                            7
The results of their analysis show that selection bias is less important for these Swedish

data than it was for the original CDM study, but that simultaneity between innovation

output and input produces a downward bias on the innovation coefficient in the

productivity (sales or value added) equation. Like many previous researchers, they find

that the likelihood of innovating rises with firm size and capital intensity in both

manufacturing and services. However they find that after controlling for industry and

obstacles to innovation investment, innovation intensity is not constant but falls

significantly with size. The productivity of such investment in terms of innovative sales

also suggests diminishing returns, with an elasticity of about one half. An interesting

result is that for service firms, but not for manufacturing firms, the productivity of

innovation investments is positively related to the interaction with scientific research via

access to journals and professional conferences. Finally, for Swedish firms, both in

manufacturing and in services, the elasticity of productivity with respect to the share of

innovation sales is very similar to that previously obtained by CDM, around 0.1. That

is, when the share of innovative sales goes up ten per cent, value added increases one

per cent, other things equal, while sales and profits show larger increases of about two

per cent.



As in the base model of Lööf and Heshmati, the usual implementation of the CDM

model measures the final output of innovation as value added per worker deflated by a

broad economy level or industry level deflator, in essence assuming that innovation is

cost-reducing rather than demand-shifting.5 George Van Leeuwen and Luuk Klomp


5
    This is not true in actual implementation, since value added is seldom deflated by a firm-specific

deflator, implying that the demand-shifting effect of innovation is also included in the variable.

Nevertheless, the usual interpretation of the coefficients of the standard model implicitly assumes no


                                                       8
depart from this specification to estimate a model that explicitly incorporates the

demand-shifting effects of innovative output by using revenue (sales) per worker as the

productivity measure and including a term for process R&D as well as innovative sales

on the right-hand side. They apply this model to data on approximately 3000 Dutch

firms drawn from the second CIS, and estimate it using methods that control for

selectivity into the sample. They find that using revenue per worker as the productivity

measure yields better results than value added per worker, and that the return to

innovation investment is sensitive to the technological environment in which firms

operate. They also find that the estimation method matters, with a complete structural

model in the style of CDM being preferred.



The paper by Pierre Mohnen, Jacques Mairesse, and Marcel Dagenais illustrates the

idea of an accounting framework for innovation, using micro-aggregated firm data for

seven countries from the European Community Innovation surveys and measuring

innovation intensity as the share of innovative sales due to improved or new products.

They define “innovativity” as that part of innovation intensity which is not explained by

a model that incorporates the usual predictive variables such as firm size, R&D

intensity, and industry. That is, “innovativity” is the residual from an innovation

production function, corresponding to the idea of productivity in standard production

analysis. They find that they are more able to predict firm innovation propensity and

intensity in the high-tech sectors than in the low tech-sectors, and that there are

important differences in innovativity across countries, Italy and Germany appearing to

be respectively the least and the most innovative countries. This paper represents an


market power for the firm on the demand side. See Klette and Griliches (1996), Griliches and Mairesse

(1984, 1998) and Mairesse and Jaumandreu (2005) for further discussion of this model.


                                                   9
initial foray into this kind of measurement and the concluding remarks of the paper

make suggestions for further work.



EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

It is probably safe to say that empirical study of knowledge management at the firm

level is still in its infancy, partly because of lack of the kind of detailed data or even

measurement concepts to describe the object of study (Foray and Gault 2003). The

studies in this special issue represent some preliminary investigations into the subject.

They are based on a variety of surveys recently conducted in a number of countries

(specifically Finland, Denmark, and France for the papers presented here) which have

attempted to obtain information about the knowledge management practices and

knowledge networking behaviour of individual manufacturing and service firms. For a

study that explores the impact of these practices on productivity, see Kremp and

Mairesse (2003).



The term knowledge management is used to refer to the practices, implicit or explicit,

used by a firm to acquire new knowledge, and to rearrange and diffuse existing

knowledge within the firm. It also includes strategies that are intended either to prevent

the firm’s own knowledge from “leaking” out or to encourage the diffusion of its

knowledge to partner firms and others from whom the firm might benefit in reciprocal

knowledge exchange. Although knowledge management is not identical to innovation,

the two are often viewed as closely connected, in the sense that innovation can be

viewed as the production of new knowledge, implying that firms which innovate will

also be those that are more concerned with the management of the knowledge thus

produced. This particular idea is strongly supported by a number of the correlations


                                           10
reported in this special issue, such as those between the use of knowledge management

and the size, R&D intensity, and sector of the firm.



Why is knowledge management of concern to economists and others who study

innovation by business firms? Knowledge related to a firm’s products and processes,

both current and future, can be thought of as an asset, which therefore should be

managed strategically to obtain the highest possible returns, as in the case of other

assets of the firm such as its plant and equipment, or brand names. The traditional asset

management questions are when, how much, and what to invest (in), when to stop

investing in a particular asset, and when to divest or sell an asset off. To these

traditional questions, knowledge management adds others that arise from the particular

properties of knowledge: 1) the fact that it is often embedded in employees; 2) its partial

public good nature; and 3) the frequent difficulty of buying it in the market. We discuss

each of these ideas in turn.



Much of the knowledge created by a firm’s activities is embedded to some extent in the

human capital of its employees, who acquire it consciously as a part of their duties or

unconsciously along with the other activities they perform. This fact has several

implications for knowledge management: first, human resource management (HRM)

practices will become quite important because current employees are not simply

interchangeable with those outside the firm. Second, protecting firm rather than

employee ownership of such knowledge may require active management of the

transformation of tacit forms of knowledge (that in the heads of employees) to codified

forms that can be transmitted to other employees (Cowan, David, and Foray 2000).

Third, an important aspect of knowledge management within the firm is clearly the


                                            11
“absorptive capacity” identified by Cohen and Levinthal (1989) as the ability of the firm

to acquire and make use of the results of others’ R&D activities; this ability is again

strongly related to the human capital of a firm’s employees.



These employee-related aspects of knowledge management are highlighted in two

papers in this volume. Anker Lund Vinding’s paper examines the role of the human

capital of a firm’s employees in determining absorptive capacity, using survey results

from 1500 Danish firms in manufacturing and services in the mid-1990s. He confirms

that firms with a greater share of share of highly educated employees are more likely to

introduce products or processes new to the world (to innovate), and also that the use of

modern human resource management (HRM) practices and the development of closer

relationships with both vertically related firms and external knowledge institutions is

positively related to innovation and negatively to imitation. Here innovation is defined

as the introduction of products or processes new to Denmark or to the world, whereas

imitation is an introduction that is merely new to the firm. The argument is that

education, HRM practices, and external links are signs of higher absorptive capacity and

that this in turn improves the firm’s innovative performance. Although the links are

tenuous, the results are suggestive.



Using a survey of French firms conducted by the Service des Etudes et Statistiques

Industrielles (SESSI) in 1997, Francis Munier explores the use of codified procedures

for a variety of knowledge creating and product development activities, finding that

they are relatively more common in analyzing client relationships and product

satisfaction, and relatively less common for the management of R&D and the

acquisition of technical information, both external and internal. Codification is only


                                           12
very weakly related to the technological intensity of the firm’s sector and somewhat

more strongly related to firm size, suggesting that it becomes more important as

employee functions become more specialized and interactions among them are more

likely not to be face-to-face. Thus it does not appear from this survey evidence that

technological orientation itself generates greater codification of procedures within the

firm.



The public good nature of knowledge, which implies that it is both non-rival and non-

excludable (at least not easily excludable), means that knowledge managers must

consider both the positive and negative aspects of diffusing the knowledge created by

their firm. Benefits flow to the firm from monitoring the discoveries and new products

of other firms, but at the same time, there are costs associated with too rapid diffusion

of one’s own discoveries, for example, due to competition from imitators. How firms

manage this problem is the subject of Stéphane Lhuillery’s paper in this volume, which

uses the previously mentioned SESSI survey along with the French versions of the

Community Innovation Surveys and R&D data collected during the 1990s. Lhuillery

correlates a number of qualitative measures of knowledge disclosure or leakage with

firm characteristics, and finds that knowledge disclosure is more common among large,

R&D intensive firms in high technology sectors, and that it is correlated with patenting

by the same firms, which may provide a modicum of protection from imitation arising

from disclosure. He also finds that firm innovative performance is higher when the firm

has a policy of permitting the diffusion of non-confidential technologies via publication

or other means, controlling for R&D intensity and sector.




                                           13
A final aspect of the conduct of R&D and innovative activity is that it is difficult to

purchase needed inputs “off the shelf,” or even to identify at the outset exactly which

inputs will be needed. That is, many modern technologically complex products require a

greater variety of inputs than can be produced by a single firm, even if it is large. This is

especially true of “network” industries such as mobile telephony, where the products

must work together in order to enhance consumer demand for them. The solution

adopted by most firms in technologically intense sectors is to form R&D alliances and

joint ventures with firms that specialize in complementary technologies, but this in turn

requires considerable knowledge management effort, both of the alliance itself and in

order to minimize unwanted spillovers and acquire the necessary technological

knowledge for production. Several papers in this volume (those by Munier, Leiponen,

and Lhuillery) look at the relationship between alliance participation and knowledge

management strategies.



Munier’s evidence on this topic confirms the previous not very surprising findings in

the literature that participation in R&D alliances is more likely if a firm is large or in a

high technology sector. He then goes on to present evidence that codification of

procedures associated with joint R&D activity is no more likely than for other activities,

and in fact somewhat less likely than for the management of client relationships. This is

perhaps somewhat unexpected given the prior discussion of the employee-specific

nature of tacit knowledge, but may reflect the speed and uncertainty under which such

alliances are conducted. When technology is rapidly changing and developing, it may

not be productive to spend a great deal of time codifying what has been learned. In

addition, Lhuillery presents evidence that firms participating in R&D alliances are more




                                             14
likely to allow external knowledge disclosure by their engineers, implying generally

more openness to the outside and perhaps a need to transfer tacit knowledge.



Aija Leiponen’s paper focuses on a different aspect of knowledge management: how to

structure contracts with customers when the product itself is knowledge. She uses a

survey of approximately 200 Finnish business service (industrial design, advertising,

engineering, management consulting, and R&D services) firms that was conducted in

2000 and argues that these firms need to align the control rights in their contracts with

the nature of their knowledge base, which is characterized by their service and learning

strategies. She finds that firms providing expert skills that are not R&D-intensive and

which report learning incrementally are less likely to retain the control rights to their

output, whereas if they provide package solutions, or are more R&D and training

intensive, they are more likely to retain control rights. She suggests that this is because

control rights are less valuable when the knowledge being provided is tacit and non-

replicable (as in the case of expert services).



Most of the papers discussed in this section focus on a descriptive analysis of the

relationship   between     various   knowledge    management      techniques    and   firm

characteristics. Lhuillery and Vinding also provide some preliminary indications on the

relationship between knowledge management and innovative performance. On the other

hand, Duguet’s paper centers on a traditional measure of performance, total factor

productivity, and examines the contribution of innovation and spillovers to this

measure. He provides interesting evidence that innovative firms can be characterized as

belonging to one of two different regimes: radical innovators rely strongly on firm-level

spillovers, including the licensing of patents and formal internal research while


                                             15
incremental innovators rely mostly on the adoption of new equipment goods

accompanied by their own informal research. Analyzing the two groups of firms

separately, he finds that only radical innovators contribute significantly to TFP growth.



CONCLUDING DISCUSSION

This brief tour of the papers in our special issue has attempted to give some indication

of the richness of the data and analysis to be found within them – the reader is

encouraged to refer to the papers themselves for a much fuller discussion of their

methods and results. Looking at the collection as a whole, however, several conclusions

can be drawn. First, considerable progress has been made in modelling and the use of

appropriate econometric estimation methods using the innovation survey data,

following the path laid out by CDM. Second, it is clear that many of the most

interesting results are obtained when researchers are able to combine the survey data

with census-type information on the accounting data for the firms. Such matching

enables the measurement of final outcomes in the form of profitability and productivity,

rather than merely the intermediate step of product and process innovation. Third, many

aspects of innovation and knowledge diffusion are not well captured by our

conventional quantitative measures such as R&D spending, patents, and productivity,

and surveys such as the Community Innovation Surveys can contribute a great deal to

our understanding of the innovative process.



In looking over the results and questions raised in these papers, we would have several

recommendations for future work in this area. The first would be to draw the link

between the Knowledge Management practices of the firms studied in the second group

of papers with the CDM framework for the structural analysis of the path from R&D


                                           16
and innovation to firm productivity and profitability used in the first group. Some steps

in this direction have been taken by Duguet, among others, but much more work can be

done in this area. For example, to what extent does the use of good HRM practices or

the nature of knowledge disclosure to others actually increase the innovative capacity of

a firm, and to what extent are these factors simply signs of successful management in

the same way that innovation is? That is, what are the feedback loops and what policy

levers will be effective if we wish to increase innovative activity among firms? Much of

what we have learned already from this collection of papers is suggestive of correlation,

but causality is a more elusive goal.



To answer these kinds of questions it will be necessary to have survey data that can be

matched to accounting data, and that is comparable across country and over time.6 In

particular it would be desirable to construct panels of firms that have been resurveyed at

different time periods. This would allow better control for the problems of unobserved

heterogeneity such as “good management,” although naturally it would bring with it the

usual problem of exacerbated measurement error, perhaps increased to some extent due

to the qualitative nature of some of the data. Nevertheless, this seems to us a useful goal

to pursue.



In addition to data comparability across time and country, we would also argue that

comparability in specification and method is an area where progress could be made.


6
    In this regard it might be helpful and informative if the largest innovative economy, the United States,

had a survey that was comparable to the ones analyzed here. Although some private efforts exist (Levin et

al 1987; Cohen et al 2000), there does not yet exist a broad-based government administered innovation

survey in that country.

There is an understandable (and even desirable) tendency for each group of researchers

to “go its own way” in analyzing these data in order to focus on a specific question of

interest to them. But this sometimes sacrifices our ability to learn from the comparisons

across studies and countries. To choose an example from the papers collected here, does

innovation really contribute little to Chilean productivity and a great deal to Chinese

productivity or are the differences in results due to the considerable difference in the

specification of the models used for the two countries? Or, what exactly are the

differences between using R&D spending to measure innovative investments and using

a broader measure? To answer these kinds of questions, a great deal of attention needs

to be paid to the precise specification and estimation methods used to ensure that the

same ones are applied to data from different countries. We hope that some future

researchers will be inspired by these papers to explore more thoroughly the cross-

country comparison of the firm-level innovative process using a common framework, as

is done in the Mohnen et al. paper.
