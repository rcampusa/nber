Social Frictions to Knowledge Diffusion: Evidence from an Information Intervention

                                            ABSTRACT

Does knowledge about antipoverty programs spread quickly within poor communities or are there
significant frictions, such as due to social exclusion? We combine longitudinal and intra-household
observations in estimating the direct knowledge gain from watching an information movie in rural
India, while randomized village assignment identifies knowledge sharing with those in treatment villages
who did not watch the movie. Knowledge is found to be shared within villages, but less so among
illiterate and lower caste individuals, especially when also poor; these groups relied more on actually
seeing the movie. Sizable biases are evident in impact estimators that ignore knowledge spillovers.

1.      Introduction

        The literature on antipoverty programs has often stressed the informational constraints
facing policy makers in reliably knowing who is eligible. However, another information problem
looms large: that facing potential beneficiaries of such programs. The spread of information
about development programs within communities is one factor relevant to the success of those
programs. If information disperses quickly then the program will be better able to function,
including in recruiting eligible participants. If there are significant frictions to knowledge
diffusion—such as due to weak communication links or strategic behavior in whether or how
information is conveyed—then the program will work less well, and (in extreme cases) local
development efforts may be stalled. There is some supportive evidence from various settings for
the view that lack of information is a decisive factor inhibiting successful action by poor people
to influence local decision making processes and access the services to which they are entitled. 2
Recognizing this concern, information campaigns are often used by public authorities and non-
governmental organizations in conjunction with their main program. 3
        This paper uses an information campaign to identify key aspects of how knowledge is
shared within communities, as one element in understanding program efficacy. The paper’s
premise is that knowledge diffusion about public programs is not an automatic and socially
neutral activity but an integral part of the same social and economic processes that perpetuate
poverty and inequality. There are foundations for this premise in the literature. It has often been
argued that poor minority groups are disadvantaged in the labor market due to their lack of
information on job opportunities and weak connections to sources of better information. 4
Economic models have been proposed to explain how this situation can persist, even when
efforts are made to equalize opportunities (Loury, 1977). Sociological writings have often
emphasized lack of access to knowledge about social programs in creating and maintaining
social exclusion (see, for example, Tilly, 2007).

2
  “Ignorance” has often been identified as a reason why poor people do not get services intended for all; see, for
example, Daponte et al. (1999) with reference to the take up of food stamps in the U.S. Strong “network effects” are
often evident in program take-up, and information diffusion is a common explanation. However, also see Aizer and
Currie (2004), who find that information sharing played only a limited role in explaining the network effects
observed for a U.S. maternal health program.
3
  Useful overviews of the arguments and evidence on factors relevant to the role of information and information
campaigns in developing countries can be found in Keefer and Khemani (2005), Khemani (2007) and Mansuri and
Rao (2012). The review by La Ferrara (2015) focuses specifically on entertainment media (“edutainment”).

  See, for example, the discussions in Narayan et al. (2009), World Bank (2011) and Mansuri and Rao (2012).

          These issues are relevant to how knowledge about public programs spreads in rural India.
The density of a typical village gives ample scope for people to meet and talk about what they
have learnt about some new public program. However, social frictions to knowledge diffusion
are also likely. Anecdotal observations suggest that knowledge about an initiative coming from
outside the village is often controlled by the local elites (who are typically the first contact point
in the village) and that they tend to spread knowledge through filters consistent with their own
interests. Widespread illiteracy in poor areas supports this selective learning process. In rural
India, caste creates special frictions in social interaction and (hence) information diffusion,
especially in rural areas. Dalits (also called Scheduled Castes) have faced a long history of
discrimination and exclusion; for example, in the majority of Indian villages today, Dalits are not
allowed to share food with non-Dalits. 5 It is rare for lower and upper caste families to be close
neighbors within the village, and the “Dalit only” area of the village is typically quite well
defined and known to all, with strong social pressures (including possible violence) when lower
caste people step too far into the domains of other caste groups. The degree of social and
political connectivity in this context is greater for more advantaged castes (see, for example,
Desai et al., 2010).
          In such a setting, knowledge about a new antipoverty program may diffuse rather poorly
by word-of-mouth, especially if the information enters via the local elite. Unless a poor, lower-
caste, individual comes into direct contact with the source of new information she may come to
know little about a program intended to help people like her. Strategic behavior may even act to
worsen the information flow. For example, if the program has potentially adverse impacts for the
village elite, who are better connected to knowledge sources than the poor, then misinformation
may be spread for strategic reasons. Similarly, eligible participants who anticipate rationing of
the opportunities announced in an information campaign may rationally choose not to spread the
word. Holding a public meeting as part of the campaign might well do a better job of knowledge
diffusion than (say) an official letter to the village leader, but it remains unclear just how
effective this will be, also noting that socially non-neutral selection processes are likely to be at
work in terms of who attends such a meeting and who influences its agenda and discussions; pre-
existing inequalities are unlikely to vanish in such a public meeting (Heller and Rao, 2015).



5
    A graphic account of the treatment of Dalits in much of rural India can be found in Human Rights Watch (2007).

                                                          3
       These observations beg a number of questions: Does information about a public program
in rural India spread reliably beyond those who learn about it directly? Does it flow more easily
among some groups than others? In particular, are the poor within the village sufficiently well
connected socially to tap into the flow of knowledge, or does poverty come with social
exclusion, including exclusion from information about programs designed to help poor people?
       As this paper shows, an information campaign can throw light on the extent to which
information is shared within villages, and so address these questions. The campaign studied here
used an entertaining fictional movie to teach people their rights under India’s National Rural
Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). NREGA created a justiciable “right-to-work” for all
rural households in India. The most direct and obvious way NREGA tries to reduce poverty is by
providing extra employment in rural areas on demand. This requires an explicit effort to
empower poor people, who are encouraged to take deliberate unilateral actions to demand work
on the scheme from local officials. The stipulated wage rate for the scheme is often above the
local market wage rate for similar work. Naturally, such a program is seen as a potential threat to
the landholding elites in traditional (primarily agricultural) villages; in particular, if the program
worked well then it would put upward pressure on local wage rates, reducing the profits of those
with larger landholdings.
       The setting for this study is rural Bihar—a relatively poor state of about 100 million
people in the Northeast of India. In previous research, it was found that most men and three-
quarters of women had heard about NREGA, but most were unaware of their precise rights and
entitlements under the scheme (Dutta et al., 2014). With the aim of promoting better knowledge
about NREGA in this setting, the movie was randomly assigned to sampled villages, with a
control group not receiving the movie. Knowledge about NREGA was assessed in both treatment
and control villages. Residents were encouraged to watch the movie, but not (of course)
compelled to do so. Some watched it and some did not. A previous paper studied the “intent-to-
treat” impacts of the movie on knowledge, perceptions and outcomes for program participation
(Ravallion et al., 2015). The present paper goes more deeply into the impacts on knowledge, and
the channel of that impact—notably whether it was purely through the direct effect of watching
the movie or whether it was through knowledge sharing within villages.
       The main methodological challenge is how to identify the knowledge gains (if any) for
those in the assigned villages who did not actually watch the movie. Such spillover effects are

                                                   4
known to be a source of bias in evaluations of public programs given that one of the key
assumptions made in classic evaluation methods is that the comparison group used to infer the
counterfactual is not also impacted by the program. 6 As a general proposition, biases can be
anticipated for certain impact estimators when this assumption fails to hold. A specific instance
is relevant to the evaluation of geographically assigned programs, as studied in this paper. Here
the concern is not spillover effects between areas but within them. Many social programs take
the form of an individually-assigned intervention (such as a health program, a transfer payment
or access to credit). Some people within well-defined geographic areas take up the program and
some do not. In evaluating such programs, a seemingly attractive option is to randomly assign
access to the program across geographic areas. Take up within areas is endogenous but the
randomized assignment across areas can be used as the instrumental variable (IV). Spillover
effects are an obvious threat to the validity of this approach and there are various examples in the
literature. 7 To the extent that those within an assigned area who do not directly participate in the
program are affected (positively or negatively), the exclusion restriction required by the IV
estimator will not hold and the estimates will be biased. If the investigator can do a double
randomization then the problem can be avoided (Baird et al., 2014).
        Methodologically, the paper proposes a solution to the problem of distinguishing the
direct effect from the spillover effect through knowledge sharing when double randomization is
not a feasible option. 8 We postulate that there is a latent process of knowledge diffusion among
households within the village. An individual’s knowledge reflects both this process and a latent
individual effect representing the individual’s “connectedness.” The latter is assumed to be time
invariant, as it depends on long-standing networks of association between people, reflecting how
each individual fits within the village social structure including caste positions and the ability of
that individual to process the new information.
        The essential idea is to combine a specific double difference method to estimate the direct
impact (allowing for endogenous take up), with randomized assignment across villages, which

6
  This is sometimes called the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) following Rubin (1980).
7
  Spillover effects have been identified for: (i) health treatments within schools (Miguel and Kremer, 2004); (ii)
schooling in the neighborhoods of transfer recipients (Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009; Bobonis and Finan, 2009:
Bobba and Gignoux, 2014); (iii) local government spending in response to geographically assigned programs (Chen
et al., 2009); (iv) crime displacement (Yang, 2008); and (v) a women’s empowerment program to encourage child
immunization (Janssens, 2011).
8
  For an overview of (experimental and non-experimental) methods for estimating spillover effects see Angelucci
and Di Maro (2015). The method used in the present paper is not one of those reviewed by Angelucci and Di Maro.

                                                        5
then identifies the spillover effect. For the purpose of identifying the direct effect, the survey
design combined a standard T=2 panel structure with two separate adult interviews to collect
data on personal knowledge about NREGA. Having two observations within each household
allows us to obtain an estimate that is robust to latent heterogeneity in household factors,
similarly to the sibling-difference estimator that has been used in the literature to eliminate a
confounding household effect in studying outcomes for children. 9 By exploiting the differences
over time, our non-experimental estimator is also robust to time varying individual effects, such
as latent social connectivity within the village.
        The paper finds evidence of spillover effects, which account for about one third of the
average impact of the information campaign. While knowledge sharing is evident, poorer people,
by various criteria, appear to be less well connected, and so benefit less from the spillover
effect—relying more on direct exposure to the intervention. Methodologically, we find that there
is a substantial bias in the IV estimator of the average treatment effect on the treated due to a
failure of the exclusion restriction, stemming from knowledge spillovers.
        The following section describes the setting and data. Section 3 outlines the proposed
econometric method. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 concludes.

2.      The setting and data

        Bihar is one of the poorest two or three of India’s larger states. Based on official Planning
Commission poverty lines for 2009/10, 55% of its rural population of 90 million lived below the
poverty line. Although one would hope that NREGA worked well in India’s poorest states
(where it is presumably needed most), Bihar has one of the lowest participation rates of any state
(Dutta et al., 2014). The scheme that implements NREGA in Bihar is the Bihar Rural
Employment Guarantee Scheme (BREGS). 10
        The survey data: The data were collected explicitly for the purpose of evaluating the
scheme’s performance, as documented in Dutta et al. (2014). Two survey rounds were done
spanning 150 randomly chosen villages in rural Bihar. 11 The first round (R1) was implemented

9
   Early examples of the sibling difference method of addressing household heterogeneity in estimating models for
child outcomes include Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1988) and Duncan et al. (1998).
10
   The corresponding national program is called the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
Scheme.

   The survey instrument is available to readers online at http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/mr1185/. The data
are available for replication purposes from the authors.

between May and July of 2009 and the second (R2) during the same months one year later. The
timings were chosen for being lean periods for agricultural work, and were thus expected to be
peak periods for BREGS. The survey collected information at household and individual levels on
a range of characteristics including caste, demographics, asset ownership, consumption,
employment and wages, as well as information on BREGS participation, knowledge of NREGA
rights and rules, process-related issues and questions related to perceptions about the scheme in
the specific village context.
         The two-stage sampling design was based on the 2001 Census list of villages. In the first
stage, 150 villages were randomly selected from two strata, classified by high and low BREGS
coverage based on administrative data for 2008/9. In the second stage, 20 households per village
were randomly selected, drawing from three strata based on an initial listing of all village
members and a few selected attributes. 12 All summary statistics reported in the study are
weighted with appropriate sample weights to be representative at state level and the regressions
allow for the survey design.
         Our estimation method (discussed in detail in Section 3) requires that we focus on the
subsample of panel households in which two members were interviewed in both rounds. This
“2x2” subsample has 2,376 individuals. The fact that we exclude households for which only one
adult was available for interview suggests the possibility of sample-selection bias. The 2x2
subsample differs from the full sample in some respects. For example, the two-adult panel is
more likely to be male headed, less likely to have a widowed respondent, and more likely to be a
larger household. 13 We test whether the sample selection affects our results for those evaluation
parameters that do not require the balanced panel, which gives a sample of 4,792 individuals.
         It is of interest to test for heterogeneity in the direct and spillover effects in the R1 data,
though recognizing that stratification comes with a loss of power. In one case we stratify by three
groups of households defined by actual or desired BREGS participation in R1, before the
information campaign. First, there are the actual participants in BREGS. Second, we identify a
group of “excess demanders,” defined as those who said they wanted BREGS work but did not
get it; past research has indicated substantial un-met demand for work on the scheme (Dutta et

12
   With numbers in parentheses, the three strata were those with at least one member who had done public works in
the last year (7), those with a member who had engaged in other (non-public works) casual work (7) and all other
households (6).
13
   This was tested using a probit for whether the individual was in the balanced panel using covariates from R1. The
probit is available from the authors.

al., 2014). The remainder forms the third group, identified as those who were not interested in
participating. We expect the information intervention (discussed further below) to have more
impact on the second group, since they express a desire to participate—which presumably
motivates learning—but are not participating.
        We also stratify by four socioeconomic indicators: caste, literacy, landlessness and
consumption poverty. Two caste groups are distinguished; the first is the less advantaged
group—the Scheduled Castes comprising Dalits and Mahadalits (a local Bihar category,
recognized by the state government). The second is mainly Other Backward Castes and the
general caste group (not one of the commonly identified poorer caste/tribal groups).
“Landlessness” is defined as owning no cultivatable land. “Poverty” is identified by a household
consumption per person below the R1 median (which closely accords with the official poverty
measure for Bihar). The sample is clearly not evenly spread across the combinations of these
dimensions, as can be seen from Table 1, which gives the number of sample points in each cell
combination. Of those who are both in the lower caste grouping and consumption poor, 86% are
landless, and in 57% of cases both persons are also illiterate. Among those who are in our upper
caste grouping and not consumption poor, we find that in 41% of cases at least one of the two
persons is literate and the household has some land. But the associations are far from perfect; for
example, the instances of both adults being illiterate are similar for the two caste groups. Also
note that the counts for some cells are quite low, raising the need for caution about inferences for
these cells.
        Knowledge: In both R1 and R2, the respondents were asked whether they had heard of
NREGA and, if so, they were asked 12 questions testing their knowledge of the scheme’s
functioning and their rights. We call this the NREGA quiz. This was administered separately to
one male and one female member of each sampled household when feasible.
        As an overall measure of knowledge about the scheme’s employment aspects we
calculate an “employment knowledge index” as the number of correct answers to the eight
employment and wage related questions in the NREGA quiz. The average scores on employment
knowledge in R1 is 2.6 for men and 1.5 for women (out of a maximum of 8).
        A second measure can be created for knowledge of the facilities and amenities that the
scheme mandates must be provided at work sites (daycare, drinking water, shade and first aid
kits). Respondents were asked to identify what facilities were supposed to be provided. We call

                                                 8
this the “facilities knowledge index.” The mean number of correct answers on the facilities test
in R1 was 1.4 and 1.0 for men and women respectively out of a maximum of 4. Clearly
knowledge about these aspects of the program is deficient. However, there can be little doubt
that knowledge about employment and wages is more important to the lives of poor people in
this setting than knowledge about facilities.
         It is not easy to do interviews of individuals on their own in this setting. So some cross-
effect can be expected. Nonetheless, the scores generally differed between the two respondents,
which motivates our identification strategy. In R1, the scores on the employment quiz differed in
68% of cases, though falling to 44% for the facilities knowledge index; Table 2 gives the
frequency distribution of the difference in scores. It is clear that the spread is quite large. So
there is ample scope for explaining the differences within households in terms of whether the
respondent watched the movie, though this is less so for knowledge about facilities than for
employment and wages.
         Table 3 gives the breakdown of mean scores on our knowledge tests between the three
groups. Participants scored better than either excess demanders or others. Participants may well
have learnt by participating, so one cannot conclude from Table 3 that knowledge was the cause
of participation. We also see from Table 3 that the participants and excess demanders are more
likely to be illiterate and to have completed less schooling. There is an association with caste;
participants are more likely to be Mahadalits, and the third group (neither participants nor excess
demanders) are more likely to be general caste members. There are also signs that BREGS
participants tend to have better political connections, as indicated by responses to survey
questions on whether the respondent was “close to” each of a series of designated local officials.
         The information campaign: The majority of adults are illiterate, so a movie in the local
language makes sense as an information tool. Dutta et al. (2014) report pilot tests of alternatives,
such as reading a summary of NREGA provisions in gender-specific focal groups, which did not
show much promise. But a pilot film (based on TV advertisements for NREGA) did show
promise, judged by audience reaction and subsequent discussion in focal groups. 14




14
  Videos have also proven effective in agricultural extension efforts, including in Bihar; see, for example, Kaushal
(2015).

                                                          9
        So a 20 minute movie was produced to explicitly convey information about rights and
entitlements under BREGS. 15 The movie was tailored to Bihar’s specific context and program
guidelines. Professional actors performed in an entertaining and emotionally engaging story-
based plot whose purpose was to provide information on how the scheme works, who can
participate and how to go about participating. The movie stresses the fact that all adults are
eligible for the scheme and that potential workers need to demand work in order to get it, in
addition to providing information on guidelines for time-bound responses from the government
on providing work or an unemployment allowance, and for paying wages.
        The story line is centered on a temporary migrant worker returning to his village from the
city to see his wife and baby daughter. He learns that there is BREGS work available in the
village, even though it is the lean season, so he can stay there with his family and friends rather
than return to the city to find work. It was intended that the audience would identify strongly
with the central characters. While the lead actor is a man, and the main focus is on him
throughout, the story line includes a deliberate flow of supporting actors, including women who
indicated that the scheme is open to women who are supposed to receive the same wages as me
for equal work.
        The information campaign was conducted in February-March 2010 in 40 villages
randomly selected from the baseline sample of 150 villages. Compliance at the village level was
complete. The intervention was done 2-4 months prior to the follow-up survey (R2), so that
information had a reasonable time to spread within the treated villages. Given the timing of the
seasons and the nature of the program, the expectation was that if the intervention had impact it
should be evident within this time period, given that this coincided with the lean season, when
demand for BREGS should be high. Around the time that many people would be in need of extra
work, the intervention tells them how to go about getting that work. It is also a season in which
forgone income from watching the movie is likely to be relatively low.
        Double randomization was not feasible. In some settings one could imagine randomly
assigning tickets for seeing the movie. However, that was not considered a reasonable approach
in this context. There would be (justifiable) concerns within a treatment village about why some
people got a ticket and some did not. There was no plausible reason for rationing, such as due to


15
  The movie was commissioned by Dutta et al. and was produced by the local NGO, Praxis—the Institute for
Participatory Practices. The movie can be seen here.

                                                      10
budget or capacity constraints. And most villages lack a venue that allows exclusion based on not
having a ticket.
        The treatment and control samples are well balanced. The differences in sample means of
the village variables used in the analysis (including village means of household and individual
variables) are only statistically significant at the 5% level for three variables out of the 70 tested;
Ravallion et al. (2015) provides details. 16
        There was negligible spillover effect on the control villages; only 12 households (0.4%)
in the R2 sample from control villages reported that they were aware that a film on BREGS had
been shown elsewhere. However, spillover effects within the treatment villages are likely.
        The movie was shown in two separate locations in each treatment village over one or two
days. Typically, it was projected in common areas, such as an open ground, school building, or
community hall. The screenings were in an open space about half the time; school buildings were
the venue for about half the remainder. At each location, the film was screened twice, followed
by a question and answer session and distribution of one-page flyers that pictorially illustrated
the main entitlements and processes under NREGA. On arriving in each village, efforts were
made to announce and advertise the upcoming screenings in advance. Local officials such as the
Mukhiya and Sarpanch, opposition leaders and local BREGS officials were invited to attend.
        The movie was a big event in the treatment villages. On average, about 365 people
attended either screening, roughly evenly split between the two screenings. About two-thirds of
those attending were men. Only in 11% of the showings did people say that the information
provided was not new. The average discussion time after the movie was 38 minutes and the
movie was deemed by the facilitators to have generated a “lot of discussion” in 29% of the
showings. Based on our survey, 86% of men and 77% of women in the treatment villages were
aware that the movie had been shown. 55% of men in the sample had actually seen the movie, as
compared to 43% of women. 27% of men and 33% of women had not seen the movie but
reported that they had discussed it with others in the village.
        Table 4 provides descriptive statistics for the balanced sample of individuals in treatment
villages on knowledge of the movie and the incidence of watching the movie broken down by
BREGS participation status, caste, literacy, landholding and poverty, all measured in R1. 85%


16
  Of course, some significant differences using conventional “one-at-a-time” tests are to be expected by chance
even when fully randomized.

knew about the movie, and this varies little across the groups. 42% decided to watch the movie,
and this varies with individual, household and village characteristics. BREGS participants in R1
were more likely to do so; illiterate individuals were less likely to do so.

k ijvt . The baseline survey is at t=1, including the NREGA quiz. The movie is then shown and the

re-survey, with the quiz, is done at t=2. The movie is randomly assigned to villages, with the
assignment denoted M vt , with M v 2 = 1 if village v got the movie and M v 2 = 0 otherwise; by
definition, M v1 = 0 for all v. The incidence of watching the movie is denoted mijvt with mijv 2 = 1 if

person i in household j and village v saw the movie and zero otherwise; obviously mijv1 = 0 .

       The task of the empirical analysis is to identify how this information intervention affected
knowledge about NREGA, and how the movie’s impact varied by socioeconomic group. The
latter is one element of the time-invariant individual characteristic, denoted δ i . The individual

effect δ i can be taken to reflect how much each individual is able to tap into the general spread
of knowledge given his or her social position. One can think of this as the person’s “social
connectivity” within the village. Some relevant characteristics are observed (such as the person’s
caste or education) and some are not (such as the person’s cognitive ability). We also postulate
the existence of a latent household and village effect, η jvt , that influences knowledge. Similarly

to the individual effects, some of these variables are observed and some are not. Household
wealth and education variables fall under this heading. (These can vary over time, such as due to
household income shocks.)
       Combining these observations we postulate a knowledge production function of the form:
                        k ijvt = k ( mijvt , M vt , δ i ,η jvt )                                  (1)

Notice that M vt appears here to reflect knowledge spillovers, i.e., knowledge gains for someone
who lives in a village where the movie was shown, but did not necessarily watch the movie. Our
task is to estimate a linearized version of equation (1). We treat δ i and η jvt as unobserved,

although we will use the stratifications described in the last section when studying the



                                                                   12
heterogeneity in the impact of the movie on knowledge; specifically we will study whether the
knowledge effects of mijvt and M vt vary with certain observable dimensions of δ i and η jvt .

        Consider any δ i that increases knowledge. How might it alter the impact of the movie on
knowledge? The direction of such “cross-effects” is theoretically ambiguous. We might
reasonably expect education (say) to enhance knowledge generally and to enhance the impact of
a new source of information on knowledge. 17 By contrast, as argued in the introduction, greater
social inclusion—more connections within village networks—is likely to enhance knowledge but
presumably diminish the knowledge gain from watching the movie; it will be the socially
excluded for whom watching the movie will bring the greater gains in knowledge.
        Watching the movie is, of course, a matter of personal choice so it is potentially
endogenous to knowledge about NREGA. There can be a direct utility gain from watching the
movie—its entertainment value—in addition to the benefit from the knowledge gained. (A
person may watch the movie solely for its entertainment value.) In deciding whether or not to
watch the movie a person weighs the expected benefit against the cost. The expected benefit
depends on a set of fixed personal characteristics not all of which are observed. So we can write
the utility function as:
                              uijvt = u ( mijvt , k ijvt , δ i ,η jvt )                                                        (2)

When δ i is low the person will have a higher expected benefit from watching the movie, but a
lower level of knowledge about programs such as NREGA. The benefits also depend on the
time-varying household and village characteristics. The cost of watching the movie is mainly the
opportunity cost of time, which will tend to be lower for the poor, and especially the
underemployed poor, who are likely to be interested in NREGA. There can also be idiosyncratic
factors that influence the costs of watching the movie (such as the need to attend to a sick family
member). For the present purpose, we can think of the cost of watching the movie as including
an additive random variable with distribution function Fijvt . The probability of watching the

movie is then a function of the utility gain, which depends on M vt , δ i and η jvt , namely:

         Pr( mijvt = 1) = Fijvt [u(1, k (1,1, δ i ,η jvt ), δ i ,η jvt ) − u(0, k (0,1, δ i ,η jvt ), δ i ,η jvt )] for M vt = 1 (3.1)

                          = 0 for M vt = 0                                                                                     (3.2)

17
  For example, it was found that those amongst poor workers randomly assigned access to a training program who
had more education tended to gain more from the training (Galasso et al., 2004).

                                                                          13
Later we will use a probit motivated by this model in one of the comparison impact estimators.
        Our main task is to estimate the direct and indirect effect of the movie on knowledge, as
represented in equation (1). On linearizing the knowledge production function k(.) we have a
switching regression for t=2:
                  k ijv 2 = (α 1 + βmijv 2 + δ i + η jv 2 + ε ijv 2 ) M vt
                  + (α 0 + δ i + η jv 2 + ε ijv 2 )(1 − M vt )                                              (4)
                  = α 0 + (α 1 − α 0 ) M v 2 + βmijv 2 + δ i + η jv 2 + ε ijv 2

For t=1, we have:

                  k ijv1 = α 0 + η jv1 + δ i + ε ijv1                                                       (5)

Given that the movie screenings are randomly assigned across villages it can be assumed that
Cov ( M v 2 ,η jv 2 ) = Cov ( M v 2 , δ i ) = Cov ( M v 2 , ε ijvt ) = 0 (for t=1, 2) A key identifying assumption is

that the endogeneity of watching the movie stems solely from the two effects, δ i , and η jvt .

Specifically, we assume that Cov( mijv 2 , ε ijvt ) = 0 but that Cov( mijv 2 ,η jv 2 ) ≠ 0 and

Cov ( mijv 2 , δ i ) ≠ 0 (given equation (3)).


        Clearly the η jvt effect cannot be eliminated using individual panel data alone. Our

identification strategy exploits the fact that we have two observations of individual knowledge
within the sampled households, as well as panel data. This feature of the study design was
introduced to obtain a consistent estimate of the effect of an individual watching the movie. We
can then net this effect out of the data on knowledge and exploit the randomized assignment of
M vt to identify the external effect of the movie on knowledge amongst those who need not have

seen the movie. Taking the difference over time ( ∆ ) eliminates the individual knowledge effect,
but still leaves the time-varying household-village knowledge effect:

                  ∆k ijv 2 = η jv 2 − η jv1 + (α 1 − α 0 ) M v 2 + βmijv 2 + ∆ε ijv 2                       (6)

(Noting that 𝑀𝑣1 = 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣1 = 0.) Taking the difference between the two adults interviewed in
each household:



                                                              14
                 ∇∆k ijv 2 = β ∇mijv 2 + ∇∆ε ijv 2                                                  (7)

Here ∇ denotes the difference between two adults in the same household. Recalling that it is
assumed that Cov( mijv 2 , ε ijvt ) = 0 (and hence Cov(∇mijv 2 , ∆∇ε ijv 2 ) = 0 ), OLS applied to (7) gives

a consistent estimate of β , denoted β̂ . On replacing β by β̂ , equation (7) becomes:

                 k ijv 2 − βˆm ijv 2 = α 0 + (α 1 − α 0 ) M v 2 + η jv 2 + δ i + ε ijv 2            (8)

Given that the movie is randomly assigned, we can then estimate (8) consistently by OLS to
obtain α 0 and α 1 , and (hence) identify the knowledge spillover effect.
        Notice that the fact that our balanced panel comprises one male and one female in almost
all households means that we cannot meaningfully identify the gender difference in the direct
impact of watching the movie, though we can test for a gender difference in the spillover effect.
        We define the following evaluation parameters based on the above model:

              𝐴𝑇𝐸𝑇 = 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 1, 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 = 1� − 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 0, 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 = 0�

                                               = 𝛼1 − 𝛼0 + 𝛽                                        (9.1)

                𝑆𝐸 = 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 1, 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 = 0� − 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 0, 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 = 0�

                                               = 𝛼1 − 𝛼0                                            (9.2)

                               𝐼𝑇𝑇 = 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 1� − 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 0�

                                     = 𝛼1 − 𝛼0 + 𝛽𝐸�𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 1�                                 (9.3)

These are standard parameters adapted to the existence of spillover effects. ATET is the impact
on knowledge of watching the movie relative to the control villages where the movie was not
shown. This combines the effect of seeing the movie (𝛽) and living in a village where the movie
was shown (𝛼1 − 𝛼0 ). SE is the indirect effect alone—the knowledge spillover. ITT is the usual
intent-to-treat parameter.
        We will compare our estimates with a number of other approaches found in the literature.
One of these is the OLS regression model motivated by the switching regression in (4). We will


                                                             15
do this with and without controls. Another is propensity score matching (PSM), which makes
fewer assumptions than OLS—in particular it does not assume a linear parametric model for
knowledge. PSM has been used often in estimating ATET and it is proposed by Angelucci and
De Giorgi (2009) as a candidate for estimating spillover effects. We can write the PSM
estimators for 𝑆𝐸 and 𝐴𝑇𝐸𝑇 as:
𝑆𝐸 = 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 1, 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 = 0, 𝑝(𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑣2 )� − 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 0, 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 = 0, 𝑝(𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑣2 )�          (10.1)

𝐴𝑇𝐸𝑇 = 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 1, 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 = 1, 𝑝(𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑣2 )� − 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 0, 𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 = 0, 𝑝(𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑣2 )� (10.2)

where 𝑝(𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑣2 ) is the conditional probability for an individual in movie villages to watch the
movie as a function of a vector of round 1 individual, household and village characteristics,
𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑣2. (This can be motivated by (3.1) and (3.2) but replacing δ i ,η jvt by the vector of observables

𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑣𝑡 .) This estimator differs from the naïve OLS with controls but relies on the same
assumption that the endogeneity issue can be fully addressed in controlling for observed
characteristics. Assuming that part of the decision to watch the movie is actually due to
unobserved characteristics a bias will remain in the matching estimate.
       Another estimator of interest is:

                               𝐿𝐴𝑇𝐸 = 𝐼𝑇𝑇/𝐸�𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 1�                                     (11)

This is the usual local average treatment effect; in this case, it is equivalent to estimating the
average treatment effect of watching the movie using the randomized assignment at village level
as the IV. This might help address the endogeneity issue, but it is expected to deliver biased
estimates in the presence of knowledge spillovers in movie-villages.
       Before implementing our preferred method, we ran a Monte-Carlo simulation to test the
identification strategy and the estimation procedure on artificial data for which we know the true
values of the parameters of interest. Full details are given in Appendix 1. The results give one
confidence that the proposed method is to be preferred when there are both an endogeneity issue
and spillovers. Next we apply it to our data.




                                                  16
4.       Results
         Column (1) Table 5 gives our preferred estimates for the employment knowledge scores,
with βˆ from estimating equation (7) and 𝛼�1 − 𝛼�0 from (8). We find significant effects of the
movie on knowledge and these effects are both direct ( β > 0 ) and indirect ( α1 − α 0 > 0 ). The
total effect (ATET) is slightly more than one correct answer on the employment questions
(𝛼�1 − 𝛼�0 + 𝛽̂=1.14), which represents about a one third increase in the number of correct
answers in the control group ( αˆ 0 = 3.46 ). 18 About two thirds is the direct effect of watching the
movie and one third is indirect, via the intra-village knowledge spillovers.
         For comparison, Table 5 gives results for various alternative estimators. Column (2) gives
the naïve estimator, using OLS on the switching regression (equation 1). This method incorrectly
attributes the impact fully to the direct effect of watching the movie, and substantially
overestimates that effect ( βˆ = 1.55 ). Column (3) gives the naïve estimate with controls for
individual and household characteristics; this is similar to the results for Column (2).
         Column (4) gives the PSM estimates. We use a probit to predict the probability of
watching the movie, 𝑝̂ (𝑋), for all individuals in movie and non-movie villages. In Appendix 3,
we report the coefficients of the probit; the estimates reveal some reasonably intuitive selection
mechanisms. In Figure 1 we provide the densities of the predicted propensity score in movie and
non-movie villages which have a large region of common support. We insure common support
by dropping individuals 𝑗 in non-movie villages such that 𝑝̂ �𝑋𝑗 � < min�𝑝̂ (𝑋𝑖 )� for 𝑖 in movie

villages, and individuals 𝑖 in movie villages such that 𝑝̂ (𝑋𝑖 ) > max �𝑝̂ �𝑋𝑗 �� for 𝑗 in non-movie

villages. We then match nearest neighbors in term of 𝑝̂ (𝑋𝑖 ). We do this by matching one-by-one
each individual watching the movie with one counterpart in non-movie villages, and then
matching each individual not watching the movie in a movie village with one counterpart in the
                                    � and 𝐴𝑇𝐸𝑇
non-movie villages. We then compute 𝑆𝐸     � reported in Tables 5 and 8. The PSM
estimates are quite similar to OLS. Neither method accords well with our preferred method.



18
  All estimates of ATET are based on the sum 𝛼�1 − 𝛼�0 + 𝛽̂ . In the case of our preferred estimate we report
bootstrapped standard errors for 500 replications given that the coefficients come from different regressions on
different samples. For OLS estimates we report the s.e. and p values for a t test of the coefficients linear
combination.

                                                         17
       Column (5) gives the IV estimate of the internal effect ( βˆ ) assuming no spillovers, and
using the randomized assignment at village level as the IV. This is similarly biased to the OLS
estimate. Column (6) gives the ITT estimate.
       Recall that we are constrained to using the balanced panel of two individuals per
household. To test for sample selection bias, we re-estimated ITT, the naïve OLS, the naïve OLS
with controls, the PSM and the IV estimator on the full sample. The detailed results are reported
in Appendix 2. The estimates are very similar to those we obtained for the selected subsample of
two panel individuals.
       Now we turn to the stratified results. In Table 6 we stratify the results for βˆ , 𝛼�1 − 𝛼�0

and ATET (𝛼�1 − 𝛼�0 + 𝛽̂ ). First, we give a split by gender. As noted, we cannot differentiate the
direct effect by gender given that we rely on having two individuals interviewed in each
household, typically one male and one female. We can, however, differentiate the spillover
effect. We find that this is almost identical between men and women.
       Next, Table 6 gives the results by R1 participation status—namely BREGS participants
in R1, excess demanders in R1 (who wanted work on BREGS but did not get it) and the rest. We
find that the significant direct effect of watching the movie is confined to the excess demanders,
and for them it entails an extra two correct answers to the questions on employment provisions of
the scheme. The spillover effect is not, however, found in this group but in the other two. In
further calculations (not reported but available on request) we also found that the naïve estimator
performs quite well for the excess demanders, capturing 90% of the direct effect of watching the
movie on employment knowledge. The IV estimator does less well. However, we found that the
naïve estimator performs poorly for the other two groups, substantially overestimating the direct
effect, and underestimating the spillover effect.
       Table 6 gives stratifications by the various poverty indicators. Considering caste first, we
find that the direct effect is among the “lower caste” (Mushar/Mahadalit/SC/ST) group, not
among the other castes, while the spillover effect is found for the latter. The weaker spillover
effect for the lower caste group is consistent with the hypothesis that they are less well connected
to the information flows within the village.
       Similarly, illiterate, landless and consumption-poor individuals had strong direct effects
of watching the movie, but saw far weaker spillover effects. Interestingly ATETs are not very


                                                    18
different between the two caste groups. But this hides a marked difference in how much the
impact is direct versus indirect.
       Given that these poverty dimensions are correlated it is of interest to also see the
parameter estimates for the various combinations of characteristics. As we saw in Table 1, some
cell combinations are sparse. Four cells have less than 33 observations, although all the rest have
about 100 or more. We dropped the four cells with few observations (one quarter of the
combinations)—all of which were lower caste households with land, which is unusual (Table 1).
       Table 7 gives the key parameter estimates for each combination of the four poverty
dimensions (excluding the four cells with too few observations). The direct effect of watching
the movie is especially strong for the consumption poor when they are also of lower caste (by
our grouping). The positive spillover effect is especially strong for non-poor upper caste
individuals who are not landless; knowledge appears to be shared well within this more
advantaged group. A significant negative spillover effect emerges for many of those who are
both illiterate and landless. This is suggestive of the presence of strategically placed
misinformation for these groups.
       Table 8 gives the results for the facilities knowledge score (corresponding to Table 5 for
employment). Our preferred estimates in Column (1) do not indicate any significant direct or
indirect effect of the movie on knowledge about facilities. By contrast the OLS and PSM
estimators suggest a significant positive effect of watching the movie, although this vanishes
once one addresses the endogeneity using the randomized village assignment as the IV.
       When we stratify by the three aforementioned participation groups we again find a
significant direct effect for the excess demanders but not others (Table 9). We find no difference
according to caste. Given these results, we do not provide the analogous table to Table 6 for the
facilities index. The only notable point was that we found a significant spillover effect on
facilities knowledge for poor, lower-caste, landless households when at least one of the two
individuals interviewed was literate.

5.     Conclusions
       The extent to which information about public programs is shared within villages can
matter greatly to access to a program and hence its impact. The paper has proposed a method of
identifying such knowledge spillover effects for an individualized treatment when double


                                                 19
randomization is not feasible. Differences in learning between individuals within the same
household are used to identify the direct impact of the campaign while randomized assignment at
village level is used to identify the spillover effect.
           We have applied this method to data on the use of an entertaining “information movie”
that aimed to teach poor people in rural Bihar their rights under India’s National Rural
Employment Guarantee Act. We find that about one third of the average impact on knowledge
about the key employment and wage aspects of NREGA was due to the knowledge spillover—
the knowledge gains to people who did not actually watch the movie but lived in a village where
it was shown. We find substantial biases in impact estimation methods that ignore spillover
effects.
           A key finding is that the knowledge diffusion process is far weaker for disadvantaged
groups, defined in terms of caste, landholding, literacy or consumption poverty. For poor people,
it appears that the direct effect of watching the movie is all that really matters to learning about
NREGA. There is also some indication of negative spillover effects for illiterate and landless
households, suggesting the spread of misinformation. These results are consistent with the view
that poverty persists in part at least through weak social connectivity, leading to limited gains to
poor people from knowledge diffusion—including knowledge about public programs intended to
help make them less poor. Public information campaigns in this setting need to be targeted to
poor groups, rather than relying on existing knowledge diffusion processes within villages.

Appendix 1: Simulations to test the estimation method

       We simulate 𝑘�
                    𝚤𝚥𝑣2 using the following data generating process:


               𝑘�
                𝚤𝚥𝑣2 = 𝛼0 + (𝛼1 − 𝛼0 )𝑀𝑣2 + 𝛽𝑚𝑖𝑗𝑣2 + 𝜂. 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑣2


                          𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣1 = 𝛼0 + 𝜂. 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑣2

Where 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑣2 ~𝑁(0, 𝜎 2 ) is a random draw in each replication, 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 is 1 for male and -1 for

female, such that 𝐸[𝜂. 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑣2 ] = 0, and (for the purpose of the simulation) it is

assumed that neither the gender nor 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑣2 is observed by the econometrician. The values of

𝛼0 = 𝐸�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 0�, 𝜎 2 = 𝑉𝑎𝑟�𝑘𝑖𝑗𝑣2 �𝑀𝑣2 = 0� and 𝛽 = 1 are fixed over the following
simulations:

       Simulation 1: no spillover and no endogeneity: 𝛼1 = 𝛼0 , 𝜂 = 0

       Simulation 2: no spillover and endogeneity: 𝛼1 = 𝛼0 , 𝜂 = 2

       Simulation 3: spillover and no endogeneity: 𝛼1 = 𝛼0 + 2, 𝜂 = 0

       Simulation 4: spillover and endogeneity: 𝛼1 = 𝛼0 + 2, 𝜂 = 2

       For each of these simulations we did an OLS estimate of the intention to treat effect
(ITT), our preferred estimator (𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑓), the naïve OLS estimate (𝑛𝑎ï𝑣𝑒), the omniscient OLS
estimate where one is able to control for the unobserved source of endogeneity (𝑜𝑚𝑛𝑖), and the
LATE, for a 2SLS IV where the dummy “watched the movie” is instrumented by a randomly
assigned dummy variable, “movie shown in the village”. These were compared to the true
values of 𝛽, 𝑆𝐸 and 𝐴𝑇𝐸𝑇. For each simulation we ran 500 replications.
       The following table gives the results. Simulation 1 indicates that, in the absence of
spillover or endogeneity, all strategies give good estimates. Our preferred estimate had a larger
standard error, which is to be expected since we are estimating it on a sample of size N/2 (noting
that the first stage is a household level regression). From Simulation 2 we found that, in the
absence of a spillover effect but with endogeneity, the naïve estimate is biased, while our
preferred estimator, the IV and omniscient estimates are all unbiased. With a spillover effect but


                                                24
no endogeneity, the IV estimate is upward biased, while our preferred estimate, the naïve
estimate and the omniscient are all unbiased. Finally, Simulation 4 indicates that with a spillover
and endogeneity, the IV and naïve estimates are biased, while both our estimate and the
omniscient estimate are unbiased.
