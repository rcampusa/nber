Congestion plays a central role in urban and transportation economics. Existing estimates of congestion
costs rely on stated or revealed preferences studies. We explore a complementary measure of congestion
costs based on self-reported happiness. Exploiting quasi-random variation in daily congestion in Beijing
that arises because of superstitions about the number four, we estimate a strong effect of daily congestion
on self-reported happiness. When benchmarking this effect against the relationship between income
and self-reported happiness we compute implied congestion costs that are several times larger than
conventional estimates. Several factors, including the value of reliability and externalities on non-travelers,
can reconcile our alternative estimates with the existing literature.

        Traffic congestion is a leading quality-of-life issue in most urban areas. Conventional
estimates of traffic congestion costs aggregate the value of lost time and wasted fuel due to
congestion. In the United States (US) these estimates total $121 billion per year (Schrank,
Lomax, and Eisele 2012), and the costs are particularly large in urban areas. For example, the
Los Angeles metro area accrued $10.8 billion of congestion costs in 2011, representing 3%
of income or 14% of housing costs. Congestion costs in other countries may be larger as a
share of income; Creutzig and He (2009) estimate that congestion costs in Beijing represent
4% to 7% of municipal gross domestic product (GDP).
        A critical element in determining congestion costs is motorists’ value of time. Most
estimates set the value of time at a fraction of the hourly wage (Liu et al. 2009), with the
fraction typically determined by results from stated preferences (SP) studies or, less often,
revealed preferences (RP) studies. Two recurring patterns in the literature are that SP
estimates are often smaller than RP estimates and that motorists report a higher value of
time in congested conditions than in free-flow conditions. These patterns suggest that the
costs of traffic congestion are highly salient – motorists may not fully appreciate them until
they directly experience them – and that driving in traffic entails some degree of psychic
disutility. A related literature on travel reliability finds that motorists value reliability
improvements – typically measured in standard deviations or interquantile differences of
travel time – as much as they value reductions in mean travel time (Small 2012). These
factors suggest that even reliable estimates of in-vehicle value of time are insufficient for
calculating congestion costs.
        In this work we estimate the effects of traffic congestion on subjective well-being in
Beijing, China. In response to heavy congestion and pollution, Beijing restricts vehicle usage
on the basis of license plate numbers. On any given weekday, private vehicles with plates
ending in one of two digits may not drive within the 5th Ring Road from 7 am to 8 pm. As a
result each vehicle is restricted one day per week. However, superstitions regarding the
number four – which is homonymous with “death” in Chinese – dramatically reduce the
proportion of vehicles with license plates ending in four. We thus expect, and find, large
increases in traffic congestion on days on which plates ending in four are restricted. We
combine data on congestion with data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) to
estimate the effect of daily congestion levels – instrumented using a measure of the share of
plates that are restricted each day – on self-reported happiness.
        To further interpret our estimates we apply an alternative method for valuing
congestion costs. This method, based on self-reported levels of happiness, is novel to the


!                                                  1
transportation literature but has seen application in other contexts involving public goods or
externalities. Our method compares the happiness effects of quasi-random daily changes in
congestion levels to the happiness effects of additional income. If we treat happiness as a
proxy for utility, this comparison reveals the utility-constant tradeoff between congestion
and income. The method has both advantages and disadvantages vis-à-vis existing methods.
It leverages quasi-random variation in congestion levels to estimate effects on subjective
well-being. In this sense it avoids a frequent problem in RP studies, the potential
confounding of travel-time differences with unobserved attributes. It measures subjective
well-being for a random sample of the entire population, allowing inferences about the value
of congestion costs for non-marginal individuals and individuals who are not travelers. It
draws its outcome from a survey unrelated to transportation topics, avoiding SP-specific
issues of framing bias, strategic response bias, or lack of information on the part of
respondents.
        There are natural disadvantages to the method as well. It treats subjective well-being
as a proxy for utility. If it is a poor proxy – in particular if there is a systematic error term
relating utility and subjective well-being – then our estimates will be biased. A related issue,
endemic to many studies applying this method, is the lack of clearly exogenous wealth
variation in our sample. Finally, to the extent that happiness is mean-reverting over the long
run – i.e. individuals habituate to new life circumstances – comparisons between short-run
changes in congestion and long-run changes in income may overstate the marginal rate of
substitution between congestion and income. For these reasons we view our research design
as complement to conventional approaches, and we note that shortcomings of the different
approach are in general orthogonal to each other.
        These caveats notwithstanding, we find that traffic congestion has a large negative
effect on self-reported happiness. This “reduced form” result strongly suggests that
congestion is a major determinant of quality-of-life, even in countries with moderate levels
of GDP per capita. If we treat subjective well-being as a reasonable proxy for utility, our
results imply that Beijing motorists’ WTP to avoid an hour of congestion substantially
exceeds the hourly wage rate. Although our WTP estimates are higher than those from the
existing literature, several factors – including the value of reliability and potential external
effects of congestion on non-travelers – can reconcile the two sets of estimates. Consistent
with the large impact of congestion on quality-of-life, our estimates suggest significant
potential welfare gains from congestion pricing.

     I.      Background
             Congestion plays a central role in urban and transportation economics. The primary
cost of congestion is lost time, and the value of travel time is a critical input in many
transportation models. A rich literature – summarized in several meta-analyses and reviews –
estimates this value across a variety of contexts (Zamparini and Reggiani 2007; Shires and
De Jong 2009; Abrantes and Wardman 2011). Two types of studies, stated preferences and
revealed preferences, populate this literature. SP studies present respondents with
hypothetical scenarios and poll their WTP for specific goods or attributes. These studies
offer the researcher precise control over the good or attribute in question and are helpful for
valuing goods that are not traded on an open market. Nevertheless, they are subject to
several types of biases: strategic bias, in which a respondent misreports to advance his own
agenda; framing bias, in which a respondent’s answer depends on how the surveyor frames
the question; and information bias, in which respondents may not understand a scenario’s
details and have no incentive to figure them out.
             In contrast to SP studies, RP studies examine individuals’ actual choices. For
example, an RP study might observe that commuters choose a transport mode that costs $1
more than an alternative but is 0.1 hours faster and conclude that commuters’ value of time
is at least $10 per hour. This methodology avoids biases specific to SP studies, but it can
suffer from potential confounding of unobserved attributes with travel time differences. For
example, if the faster transport mode is also more comfortable, it is unclear how much of the
observed WTP accrues from lower travel times and how much accrues from increased
comfort. RP estimates are also challenging to generalize beyond individuals at the margin of
choosing different modes.
             Several patterns emerge in meta-analyses of the value of travel time. First, estimates
from RP studies are consistently higher than estimates from SP studies. Shires and De Jong
(2009), for example, analyze 1,299 estimates of the value of time and find that estimates
based off SP methods are significantly smaller. Second, estimates of the value of time in
congested conditions are significantly higher than estimates of the value of time in free-flow
conditions. This finding suggests that motorists dislike the higher workload associated with
driving in congested conditions or find these conditions frustrating in general. Finally, the
elasticity of value of time with respect to GDP per capita is less than 1, suggesting that
congestion may be a larger problem (as a share of income) in less developed countries.1
However, there are very few estimates of value of travel time in low- or middle-income
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1   Abrantes and Wardman (2011) report a GDP elasticity of 0.9, with a tight confidence interval.

countries (Shires and De Jong, for example, report that their sample includes “only a few”
middle-income countries and no low-income countries).
             Given the limitations of many SP and RP studies, some of the cleanest estimates of
the value of travel time come from studies of tolled highway express lanes. These studies
leverage RP designs that are unlikely to be confounded by unobserved attributes, because the
only difference between an express lane and a regular lane is the speed of traffic. Small,
Winston, and Yan (2005) study the California SR91 express lanes and find an average value
of time and average “value of reliability” (with reliability defined as the 90th minus 50th
percentile of the travel-time distribution) each approximately equal to the hourly wage, or
almost double the average of most value of time studies. They also find evidence of
considerable heterogeneity in value of time and value of reliability. Devarasetty, Burris, and
Shaw (2012) study toll lanes on Houston’s I-10 and find a value of time savings of $51 per
hour, or 1.5 times the hourly wage.2
             The overall picture that emerges from this literature is that individuals value travel
time but find congestion costly along dimensions beyond simple loss of time. They appear to
have trouble anticipating the additional costs in hypothetical scenarios, suggesting a high
degree of salience to the costs. Furthermore, costs are heterogeneous and grow less rapidly
than per capita income. These patterns suggest an incomplete picture of total congestion
costs in highly congested cities, particularly in developing or middle-income countries. In
this context we view our happiness-based approach as providing complementary evidence
on the costs of congestion in one of the world’s largest cities.
             Two other strands of literature relate to our study. First, a series of papers use
subjective well-being measures to estimate tradeoffs in the provision of non-market goods in
other contexts. These goods include inflation (Di Tella, MacCulloch, and Oswald 2001),
airport noise (Van Praag and Baarsma 2005), terrorism (Frey, Luechinger, and Stutzer 2009),
air pollution (Luechinger 2009), health (Finkelstein, Luttmer, and Notowidigdo 2013), and
medical residency attributes (Benjamin et al. 2014). The paper closest to ours in this
literature is Levinson (2012), which compares the happiness-constant rate of substitution
between short-run changes in air pollution and higher incomes. A related literature examines
the high-frequency time series relationship between happiness and daily activities. Of
relevance to our study, Kahneman et al. (2004) find that, of 16 major daily activities
(including work), individuals report the lowest positive affect levels during commuting. Over
longer time horizons, Stutzer and Frey (2008) find that people with longer commutes

systematically report lower subjective well-being. These findings suggest that most people
find driving, particularly in congested conditions, to be a distasteful activity.
             Finally, several papers study license plate restrictions in Beijing and other cities.
Eskeland and Feyzioglu (1997) and Davis (2008) study a driving restriction scheme based on
license plate digits in Mexico City and find no effect on gasoline demand and air quality
measures respectively. Sun, Zheng, and Wang (2014) study the current Beijing license plate
restrictions and find no relationship between PM10 and the number of plates restricted on a
given day. Viard and Fu (2015) study the introductions of the Beijing license plate restriction
schemes and find significant declines in PM10 immediately following their introductions.
While these two sets of results may seem contradictory, they do not necessarily measure the
same policy effects. Viard and Fu estimate whether the license plate restrictions cause an
immediate drop in pollution in the days following their introductions, while Sun et al.
estimate whether the share of plates restricted affects pollution after the program has been
running for a year or more. The Sun et al. result, which we confirm in our own data, suggests
that air pollution is not a likely mechanism for any relationship we find between the share of
vehicles restricted and self-reported happiness.


    II.      Data
             Our study combines four data sets: a daily data set of congestion measures, an air
quality data set, a weather data set, and the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). The
congestion data consist of a transportation performance index (TPI) from the Beijing
Municipal Commission of Transport (BMCT).3 The TPI ranges from 0 to 10, with larger
values indicating worse traffic congestion. It is based on speeds observed across a large fleet
of taxis using satellite navigation and wireless technology. The BMCT assigns weights to
different roads and calculates the TPI as a weighted average across a large area.
             Table 1 illustrates the relationship between the TPI and the needed travel time.
Roughly, for TPI values between two and eight, a one unit increase in the TPI corresponds
to a 15% increase in travel time relative to uncongested conditions. However, when the TPI
reaches its upper limits, the marginal increase in travel time associated with a change in TPI
can become very high. Our version of the TPI covers the area within the 5th Ring Road (i.e.
the area subject to the license plate restriction) during the morning and evening peak hours
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3 Our data are different from the publicly available data published online by the BMCT. The BMCT has
modified the TPI formula over time to improve the index. The public data are not updated to include the
modifications and thus are not consistently estimated with the same formula. We calculate our indices by
feeding the raw data into the improved formula, so they are consistent over time.

(7 am to 9 am and 5 pm to 7 pm). We average the morning and evening indices to generate
the daily TPI.
             We have two indices for air quality. One is the daily average Air Pollution Index
(API) for the entire Beijing area, published by the Beijing Municipal Environmental
Monitoring Center.4 The API counts PM10, SO2, and NO2 as its main pollutants. Its value
can range from 0 to 500. The other index is the PM2.5 index published by the US Embassy in
Beijing. The PM2.5 monitor is located in the office space of the US Embassy, which is
between the 3rd and 4th Ring Roads and is thus covered by the license plate restriction policy.
The original data contain 24 hourly measurements per day, but to construct a daily index we
take the average of the measurements between 7 am and 9 pm. This range of the hours
limits us to times at which the license plate restriction policy is in effect and reduces the
frequency of missing observations.
             The weather variables come from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service
System. They include daily average rain, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, hours
of sunshine, maximum wind speed, and wind direction. Weather may affect driving behavior,
air quality, and mood. To control for its influence on air quality, we interact wind speed with
the four cardinal directions to get the wind speed from the north, east, south, and west. The
upper panel of Table 2 presents the summary statistics for TPI, API, PM2.5, and the weather
variables from 2010 to 2012.
             Our happiness data come from the Chinese General Social Survey conducted by
Renmin University of China. The question on happiness reads, when translated to English,
“Generally speaking, do you think whether you are happy?” Possible answers are: 1 very
unhappy; 2 unhappy; 3 in-between; 4 happy; and 5 very happy. Besides happiness, the survey
also asks about basic demographics, including gender, age, household income, education,
CPS (Communist Party of China) membership, marital status, household size, and home
ownership. The CGSS also documents the date on which it was conducted. We use this date
to merge the CGSS data with the daily data on TPI, API, PM2.5 and weather. The survey
seeks to cover representative samples for the mainland area, and for our purpose we focus
on the Beijing samples in 2010, 2011 and 2012. We restrict our sample to observations with
non-missing information on happiness, gender, age, household income, and the survey date.
This leads to a final sample of 1,195 observations – 75% of surveyed individuals – shown in
Table 2. The lower panel of Table 2 reports summary statistics for the final sample. The

Therefore, for simplicity we use the city average API.

average level of happiness is 3.9, and 65% of respondents report being “happy”. The next
most common answers are “very happy” (16%) and “in-between” (13%). Only 1% of the
respondents reported being “very unhappy”. Females account for 55% of the sample, and
the average age is 49. The average annual household income per capita is 31,000 Yuan
(approximately 5,000 US dollars), but the variance in income is larger than the mean. The
average education is about 12 years (high school graduate), and household size ranges from
one to nine with an average of 2.8 persons. Sixty percent of respondents own the house in
which they live.


III.         Empirical Strategy
       On any given weekday, the once-per-week driving restriction forbids cars with license
plates ending in two different digits from driving in areas within the 5th Ring Road.5 For
convenience we refer to the last digit on a license plate as the “tail number.” The once-per-
week policy began on 11 October 2008, as an extension of traffic management policies
introduced during the 2008 Summer Olympics. The weekday on which a given digit is
restricted rotates every month from 11 October 2008 to 10 April 2009, and then every 13
weeks thereafter. For example, on Mondays the restricted digits are 1 and 6 between 11
October 11 2008 and 10 November 2008, 2 and 7 between 11 November 2008 and 10
December 2008, and 3 and 8 between 11 December 2008 and 10 January 2009. Table 3 lists
the restricted digits on each weekday over time.
       Table 4 shows the percentage of cars with license plates ending in each digit. The
distribution is largely constant over the years, but the percentages differ remarkably across
numbers. The digits – 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 0 – are each associated with about 10% of all cars,
which is a “fair” share as there are ten digits. The digits 6, 8 and 9, which are traditionally
considered lucky numbers, are each associated with 12% to 13% of cars. Most strikingly, the
digit 4 accounts for only 1% to 3% of cars. In Chinese, four is homonymous with death, and
people tend to avoid four in many aspects of the daily life, including floor number, door
number, mobile phone number, and license plate number (as demonstrated here).6
       The strong avoidance of the number four restricts only 14% of vehicles from driving on
days when the tail numbers 4 and 9 are targeted, while 20% to 22% of cars are restricted on

5 All cars may drive within the 5th Ring Road on weekends and holidays. Emergency vehicles, taxis, postal
vehicles, and embassy vehicles are exempt from the license plate restrictions, but these vehicles comprise a
small fraction of the total vehicle fleet.
6 Shum, Sun, and Ye (2014) show that Chinese favor eight, and that apartments on the 8th floor of buildings are

sold faster or at higher prices.

other dates. We define a variable, tailpctdt, which equals the percentage of cars allowed on the
road on date t. On weekends and holidays, the value is 100. On weekdays, tailpctdt varies from
an average of 77.4 (when tail numbers 3 and 8 are restricted) to 85.9 (when tail numbers 4
and 9 are restricted).
      Traffic congestion correlates with economic activity, weather, major events, transit
disruptions, and any other factors that determine travel demand and supply. Since many of
these factors may also affect individuals’ moods, direct regressions of self-reported
happiness on TPI are unlikely to estimate causal effects. The TPI is also an imperfect
measure of any given individual’s congestion experience and thus may be subject to
measurement error. As an alternative research design we instrument for congestion,
measured through the TPI, using variation in the percentage of cars allowed on the road,
tailpctdt. Since we control for day-of-week effects (thus eliminating variation caused by
weekends and holidays), this strategy is similar to using an indicator for days on which the
tail numbers 4 and 9 are restricted as the instrument, since those days are the main source of
weekday variation in tailpctdt. Indeed, using a simple binary instrument produces very similar
results, but with slightly wider confidence intervals. Our main specifications take the form:


      !"#!" = !! + !! !"#$%&!!" + !!"# !! + !!" !! + !!" !! + !! + !!"#                               (1)


      !!"# = !! + !! !"#$!"# + !!"# !! + !!" !! + !!" !! + !! + !!"#                                  (2)


      ℎ!"# = !! + !! !"#!" + !! !!"# + !!"# !! + !!" !! + !!" !! + !! + !!"#                          (3)


      We estimate both equations using observations on survey respondent i on day-of-week d
on date t.7 Equation (1) represents the first-stage relationship between the share of cars
allowed on the road (tailpctdt) and congestion (TPI). Although TPI only varies at the daily
level, we assign each individual a TPI value in order to run the regression. Equation (2)
represents the first-stage relationship between education (educdit) and income (yidt). We
instrument for income to address endogeneity concerns that we discuss below. Equation (3)
represents the second-stage relationship between TPI and self-reported happiness (h); the
coefficient of interest is !! . The coefficient on predicted income, !! , is also of interest in
interpreting the magnitude of !! . The vector x idt includes predetermined individual level
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7Despite the appearance of both i and t indices, the data do not have a panel structure because we do not
observe the same individual more than once. Rather, the data are effectively many repeated cross sections.


!                                                          8
covariates: gender and a quadratic in age.8 These covariates are not necessary to reduce bias
as long as survey sampling is random, but they can be helpful in increasing precision. The
vector w dt contains weather and air pollution variables discussed in Section II, and the vector
!!" contains month-of-sample indicators.9 The vectors !! , !! , and !! represent day-of-
week effects, with an additional effect included for holidays.
      Critical to our research design is the assumption that survey dates are random (more
precisely, survey dates may be fixed, but the assignment of households to surveys dates
should be random). If this is true, then after controlling for day-of-week effects household
characteristics affecting happiness should be uncorrelated with the survey date and thus with
the share of cars allowed on the road, tailpctdt. This identifying assumption has the testable
implication that household covariates should be uncorrelated with tailpctdt. To test this
hypothesis we estimate regressions of the form:


      !!"#$ = !!! + !!! !"#$%&!!" + !!" + !!"#$                                                     (4)


      In these regressions, !!"#$ represents household characteristic k, !!" are day-of-week
effects for characteristic k, and other variables are as previously defined. If our research
design is valid, then !!! should not be significantly different than zero. Table 5 reports
results from estimating Equation (4). There is no statistically or economically significant
relationship between tailpctdt and any of our eight observable household characteristics. In
separate regressions we also confirm a null relationship between weather and tailpctdt (see
Appendix Table A1).
      Equation (3) estimates the “reduced form” effect of traffic congestion on self-reported
happiness, but !! , the coefficient on congestion, does not have a direct economic
interpretation. To interpret the magnitude of !! we compare it to the estimated relationship
between per capita household income and self-reported happiness, represented by !! . If

8 We also have data on education, CPS (Communist Party of China) membership, marital status, household size,
and home ownership. These covariates are uncorrelated with tailpctdt, as we demonstrate in Table 5, and their
inclusion or exclusion has no meaningful effect on our estimate of !! . However, we do not include them as
controls in Equation (3) because they are potentially endogenous to income and could thus bias our estimate of
!! .
9 The survey does not occur continuously throughout each year, and start and end dates are not contiguous

with the first or last day of the month. When generating the month-of-sample indicators we thus combine four
observations in late July 2010 with the August 2010 observations, and four observations in late November 2011
with the December 2011 observations. Our results are not sensitive to these coding choices.

utility-constant tradeoff between congestion and income. Estimating !! requires an
instrument for household income. Instrumenting in this context is important for two
reasons. First, income – particularly permanent income – is measured with error.10 This
means that OLS estimates of the coefficient on income will be attenuated. Second, income
may be confounded with unobserved determinants of happiness – for example, hours
worked, psychological disposition, or workplace environment. These confounders could bias
the OLS coefficient on income in either direction.
      Several previous happiness-based studies have used industry and occupation wage
differentials as instruments for income (Luttmer 2005; Levinson 2012). We lack detailed data
on industry and occupation of survey respondents, so we must instead use education (educdit)
as an instrument for income. While instrumenting with education resolves some issues,
including measurement error and the mechanical relationship between income and hours
worked, it does not address all endogeneity concerns. In particular, we may think that
education has a direct effect on happiness independent of income, or that people who are
predisposed to be happy are more or less likely to be highly educated. It is thus reassuring
that our estimates of the elasticity of happiness with respect to income are of the same
magnitude as those found in previous studies using alternative instruments for income.11


IV.          Results
      Table 6 reports our “first stage” estimates from Equation (1). These coefficients reveal
the effect of the percentage of cars allowed on the road on traffic congestion and air
pollution. The first column of Table 6 estimates the effect on congestion (TPI) with day-of-
week effects, month-of-sample effects, and weather variables as controls. The coefficient is
highly significant (t = 5.9) and implies that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of cars
allowed on the road increases the congestion index by 1.59 units, or 30% of the mean. In
terms of travel delay relative to uncongested conditions, a 10 percentage point increase in the
share of cars allowed on the road increases travel delay by approximately 34%. The second
column adds controls for respondent characteristics. The coefficient is virtually unchanged
and remains highly significant (t = 5.9). The third column expands the sample to include
days on which the CGSS is not conducted; the unit of observation changes from the

Zimmerman 1992; Mazumder 2005).
11 For example, Levinson (2012) estimates that a one-unit increase in log income is associated with a 6%

increase in average self-reported happiness. We estimate that a one-unit increase in log income is associated
with a 7% increase in average self-reported happiness.


!                                                          10
individual-by-day to the day. This increases the number of days in the sample by almost a
factor of 10. While we cannot use these additional days to estimate happiness regressions,
they are useful in increasing the precision of our first-stage estimates. The regression
coefficient is close to the estimate in Column (1), but the t-statistic increases to t = 16.2.
      The relationship between the percentage of cars restricted and travel delay is
approximately what we might predict from theory. Standard congestion models specify
driving delay as a power function of traffic volume, with an exponent – and thus an elasticity
of delay with respect to volume – in the range of 3 to 4 (Parry and Small 2009). In
comparison we find an implied elasticity of travel delay with respect to share of cars allowed
of 2.7.12 This is slightly lower than previous estimates, but there are two reasons to expect
this. First, some vehicles, such as taxis, emergency vehicles, and postal vehicles, are exempt
from the restrictions. Second, there may be imperfect compliance with the restrictions.13
Both of these factors imply that the proportionate increase in traffic volume is less than the
proportionate increase in the share of cars allowed.
      The last six columns of Table 6 present results from versions of Equation (1) in which
we replace the TPI with air quality measures. Columns (4) through (6) report results for the
air pollution index, while Columns (7) through (9) report results for PM2.5. In all cases there
is a small and statistically insignificant relationship between air quality and the share of cars
allowed on the road. The estimates in Columns (6) and (9), which include days on which the
CGSS does not occur, are relatively precise. For example, we can reject the hypothesis that a
10 percentage point increase in the share of cars allowed raises the API by more than 6.3%
or PM2.5 by more than 4.6%. While these results may seem surprising, they are consistent
with the findings in Sun et al. (2014), and it is notable that only 17% of PM2.5 concentrations
in Beijing come from vehicle exhaust (Yu et al. 2013). A modest change in vehicle volumes is
thus unlikely to generate any detectable change in air pollution. These results suggest that air
pollution is not a likely mechanism for any effect of the share of vehicles allowed on
happiness.
      Table 7 reports results of estimating Equation (3), two stage least squares (2SLS)
regressions of happiness on congestion and income. Column (1) regresses happiness on the
TPI (instrumented for using tailpct) and controls for day-of-week effects, month-of-sample

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12 Approximately 80% of cars are allowed to drive on any given weekday, so a 10 percentage point increase in
cars allowed represents a 12.5% increase from baseline levels. Travel delay increases 34%, so the implied
elasticity is 0.34/0.125 ≈ 2.7.
13 Wang, Xu, and Qin (2014) estimate that up to 48% of regulated vehicles on any given day may be driven

“illegally” within the 5th Ring Road between 7 am and 8 pm.

effects, and weather. A one-unit increase in the TPI, which corresponds to about a 15%
increase in travel delay, reduces self-reported happiness by 0.146 units (t = 2.5), or
approximately 0.2 standard deviations. Column (2) adds controls for respondent gender and
age; the point estimates and statistical significance on the TPI coefficient are virtually
unchanged. Column (3) regresses happiness on log household income (instrumented for
using years of education), controlling for day-of-week effects, month-of-sample effects,
weather, and respondent gender and age. An approximate doubling of household income
increases self-reported happiness by 0.268 units (t = 3.3), or approximately 0.4 standard
deviations. Column (4) includes both congestion and household income in the 2SLS
regression simultaneously. Since our two instruments – share of cars allowed on the road
and respondent education – are orthogonal to each other, we do not expect joint estimation
of the two coefficients of interest to yield significantly different estimates, and the jointly
estimated coefficients are similar to the estimates in Columns (2) and (3) and retain the same
significance levels. Column (5) limits the sample to weekdays, since this is when all of the
usable variation in our instrument occurs. The coefficient declines slightly in magnitude but
remains statistically significant. The last column further limits the sample to only 2010 and
2011; in 2012 the CGSS occurred during a brief period during which the weekday on which
each digit was restricted did not rotate. The coefficient and standard error both increase, but
the estimate remains statistically significant.
         Table 8 reports the effects of congestion and income on the probability of reporting
each of the five possible happiness categories. In each column j, we replace the dependent
variable with an indicator for whether an individual reports a happiness level of j. Although
precision is limited, we see that congestion significantly reduces the share of people that
report being “very happy” and appears to increase the share of people that report being
“very unhappy”. The latter coefficient is only marginally significant, but it is double the
average share that reports being “very unhappy”. Additional household income decreases the
share of people that report being “unhappy” – with a significant point estimate that is
double the average share that reports being “unhappy” – and increases the share of people
that report being “very happy”.


    V.      Discussion
         Our preferred estimates for the effects of TPI and log household income are –0.138 and
0.268 respectively (Columns (2) and (3) of Table 7). These estimates leverage the full sample
of available CGSS observations, include the same controls, and are slightly more precise than


!                                                 12
the joint estimates in Column (4) of Table 7. One possible explanation for the TPI
coefficient is that it represents changes in activities due to plate restrictions rather than
changes in congestion. For example, people may be more likely to work on days when fewer
plates are restricted, and work may have a negative effect on happiness. However, back-of-
the-envelope calculations suggest that this explanation – which represents a violation of the
exclusion restriction – is implausible. A one unit change in the TPI corresponds to an 8%
increase in vehicles allowed to drive. The change in labor supply would be much less than
8% since many workers do not drive or could find alternate transportation arrangements.
Even a 5% increase in labor supply, however, would require the effect of working on
happiness to be on the order of –2.8.14 This represents a change of nearly four standard
deviations in happiness and is implausibly large.
      We now consider the implied WTP to avoid travel delays. The simplest comparison is to
consider the change in congestion that would offset the happiness effect of a 10 percent
increase in household income. A 10 percent increase in income raises happiness by 0.027
units, and offsetting this increase requires a rise in the TPI of 0.2 units, or about 4% of the
average travel delay. The average per capita household income in our sample is
approximately 5,000 US dollars, suggesting that individuals are willing to pay approximately
34 US cents per day to decrease travel delay by 1%.15 The implied happiness-constant
elasticity of substitution between income and travel delays is 2.5, which may seem high.
However, the effects of congestion that we measure are not necessarily limited to travelers;
they may include schedule disruption and dissatisfaction among family, friends, or colleagues
of individuals who arrive late or in an unpleasant mood. We refer to these effects as non-
traveler externalities (note that an individual’s status as a traveler is dynamic; an individual
who is a traveler at one time of day is likely a non-traveler at other times of day).
      To tie our findings to the existing literature on congestion costs we consider the implied
value of travel time and reliability relative to the wage. To do this we note that approximately
half of our CGSS respondents report working in the past week and that, among those that
do work, the average hours worked per week is approximately 40. A 10% increase in income
is, on the margin, equivalent to granting the average individual an additional 1.8 hours of

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14 The estimated effect of TPI on happiness is –0.14. If this effect is running through a change in labor supply,
and labor supply increases by only 5%, then the average effect of working on happiness for those whose labor
supply changes must be –0.14/0.05 = –2.8. This calculation is actually a lower bound since it ignores the fact
that some CGSS respondents are in household where no one works (e.g. they may be retirees).
15 At 365 days per year, 10% of average per capita household income equates to $1.37 per day. Since 10% of

average income has an equivalent effect to a 4% change in travel delay, WTP to decrease travel delay by 1%
should be approximately 34 US cents.


!                                                          13
leisure per week, or 0.25 hours per day. The hours lost to a 4% change in travel delay – the
happiness-constant equivalent of a 10% change in income – depend on the average level of
travel delay in Beijing. Creutzig and He (2009) estimate an average weekday per capita delay
– across cars and buses – of 0.74 hours in 2005. Vehicle registrations approximately doubled
from 2005 to 2011, and bus ridership grew 12%. A conservative estimate for per capita
weekday travel delay circa 2011 is 1.22 hours, 4% of which is 0.05 hours.16 This implies that
individuals are willing to trade off 0.25 hours of leisure for 0.05 hours of travel delay, or a
ratio of approximately 5 to 1.
      A value of travel delay equivalent to five times the wage is considerably higher than
previous estimates of value of travel time from SP studies. Zamparini and Reggiani (2007),
for example, report an average value of travel time savings equal to 83% of the wage rate
across 90 studies, and previous studies in Beijing have valued travel time savings at
approximately 140% to 170% of the average wage (Beijing Transportation Research Center
2005). Nevertheless, several factors combined can reconcile our results with the existing
literature on value of travel time. First, the elasticity of value of time (VOT) with respect to
income appears to be less than one; Zamparini and Reggiani find an elasticity with respect to
income of 0.7. Since incomes in Beijing are lower than incomes in the US and Europe, we
should expect the ratio of the VOT to the hourly wage to be up to 50% higher in Beijing.17
Second, as noted above, our outcome measures the impact of delays on travelers and non-
travelers. If delays affect non-travelers as well as travelers – i.e. if schedule disruptions
generate externalities on non-travelers – then our estimated effects should be larger than
simple value of travel time savings would suggest. Third, drivers display a higher VOT in
congested conditions than in free-flow conditions; Abrantes and Wardman (2011) report
that time in congested conditions is valued 54% more than time in free flow conditions.
Finally, our congestion instrument captures variation in both travel time and reliability. Since


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16 Creutzig and He report 1.81 billion hours of total delay, with 0.81 billion hours of annual auto delay (0.64
billion hours for drivers and 0.17 billion hours for passengers) and 1 billion hours of annual bus passenger
delay. Across 9.8 million residents within the 6th Ring this implies 185 hours annually per capita or 0.74 hours
per capita per weekday. Total vehicle registrations had increased 93% by 2011 and private automobile
registrations had increased 177%; since it is unclear which measure is preferable we take the geometric mean of
these two figures, or 131%. Increasing the auto delay by 131% to 1.87 billion hours and increasing the bus
delay by 12% to 1.12 billion hours generates a per capita weekday delay of (1.87 + 1.12)/(0.0098*250) = 1.22
hours per capita per weekday. This estimate is conservative in that it assumes traffic management policies have
been sufficient to keep traffic speeds from declining further since 2005.
17 In 2011 the average US wage was approximately four times higher than the average Beijing wage. An

elasticity of 0.7 implies that US VOT should be 40.7 = 2.64 times higher than the Beijing VOT. Thus the ratio
of VOT to wage should be 1/(2.64/4) = 1.52 times higher in Beijing than in the US.


!                                                          14
the value of reliability (VOR) is often estimated to be as high as the VOT, we may expect
our estimates to be up to twice as high as the value of time alone.
      A simple model of scheduling costs is helpful in understanding how VOT and VOR
factor into our results. Vickrey (1969) postulates a model of scheduling costs involving
“alpha-beta-gamma” preferences, with the parameters referring to the per minute cost of
travel time (!), the per minute cost being early (!), and the per minute cost of being late (!).
The conventional choice of parameters is ! = 2! = 4!, implying that the cost of being late is
double the cost of travel time (Small 2012). This model generates a sizeable VOR because,
when faced with unreliability, travelers must either bear the risk of being late or pad their
schedules and incur the (expected) cost of being early. In our study, if many commuters are
not aware that days on which the digit 4 is banned experience higher congestion, or cannot
precisely forecast how much delays increase on these days, then much of the additional
travel delay will materialize as lateness – which individuals value at double the VOT.
      Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that these factors can plausibly explain the
high costs of congestion that we find. Recall that our results imply that individuals value
additional delay at 500% of the wage. Assume that the average VOT in the US or Europe is
80% of the wage. Given the lower per capita GDP in Beijing we might expect the Beijing-
specific VOT to be 120% of the wage and the cost of being late to be 240% of the wage. A
50% penalty to VOT in congested conditions raises the average travelers’ delay cost to 300%
of the wage, implying that external costs should be approximately two-thirds as large as
travelers’ costs in order to fully explain our results.18 Note that an individual’s status as a
traveler is not fixed over time; travelers during one part of the day may be non-travelers
experiencing external costs during other parts of the day.
      Our results demonstrate a clear negative effect of congestion on quality-of-life. The
implied tradeoff between travel delay and income is large but not inconsistent with a range
of estimates from the existing literature on valuing travel time. Nevertheless, several caveats
are worth noting. First, to the degree that self-reported happiness is a poor proxy for utility,
comparisons of the coefficients on congestion and income will not reveal the utility-constant
tradeoff between the two goods. Second, since we do not have an ideal instrument for
income, the coefficient on income may not represent a causal effect. Third, although our
research design allows us to theoretically measure effects for non-marginal travelers and

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18We assume that the 50% penalty in congested conditions applies to the VOT (120% of wage) rather than the
value of being late. Thus the penalty is 0.5*1.2 = 60% of the wage. If external costs are two-third of travelers’
costs, then they will add an additional 0.67*3 = 200% of the wage, and total costs will be 500% of the wage.


!                                                          15
non-travelers, it does not allow us to disaggregate these effects into their individual
components.
      Finally, our estimates compare the effects of short-term, potentially unanticipated
changes in congestion to the effects of long-term differences in income. In both cases the
time scale of the variation that we leverage may affect our coefficient estimates. If travelers
do not anticipate the increased congestion on days on which tail number four is banned,
they will not adjust their departures in anticipation of the increased congestion. In that sense
our estimates represent an upper bound on the effects of an anticipated increase in
congestion (as opposed to unanticipated fluctuations in congestion). Likewise, the coefficient
on income may not represent the effect of a sudden change in income. In particular, if
individuals “adapt” to higher levels of income over time, then the effect of a recent change
in income on happiness may be larger than the effects of long-term cross-sectional
differences in income on happiness (Oswald and Powdthavee 2008; Kimball, Nunn, and
Silverman 2015).


VI.      Conclusion
      Although our happiness-based estimates come with significant caveats, they represent a
complementary tool to traditional SP and RP studies for valuing congestion costs.
Importantly, their shortcomings are generally orthogonal to the issues that affect most SP
and RP studies. Thus, to the degree that we can reconcile our estimates with the existing
literature, it should make us more confident in both sets of estimates. Unlike most
conventional approaches, our methodology also allows us to include costs of non-marginal
travelers and non-travelers.
      Our estimates have several clear policy implications. First, congestion strongly impacts
quality-of-life, as represented by self-reported happiness. Interpreting this “reduced form”
result requires fewer caveats than our other results and underscores the potential social gains
to congestion pricing. Second, the implied happiness-constant tradeoff between income and
congestion is quite large. When interpreted as a fraction of the wage, it suggests that existing
estimates of congestion costs may be lower bounds. Finally, the structure of the license plate
program itself appears to have some shortcomings. By unintentionally restricting an uneven
share of plates on different days, the system introduces unnecessary variability in trip time
into the Beijing transportation system. A system that restricted an equal share of plates on
each day would result in more consistent trip times. At a minimum, publicizing the

consistent relationship between the digits restricted and trip times would allow travelers to
plan accordingly.
