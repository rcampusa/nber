Electricity Consumption and Durable Housing: Understanding Cohort Effects

                                            ABSTRACT

We find that households living in California homes built in the 1960s and 1970s had high electricity
consumption in 2000 relative to houses of more recent vintages because the price of electricity at the
time of home construction was low. Homes built in the early 1990s had lower electricity consumption
than homes of earlier vintages because the price of electricity was higher. The elasticity of the price
of electricity at the time of construction was -0.22. As homes built between 1960 and 1989 become
a smaller share of the housing stock, average household electricity purchases will fall.

       Residential buildings represented 21% of total electricity consumption in the United

States in 2007. Since 1970, residential retail electricity sales per housing unit increased by 58

percent.1   Relative to the nation, California stands out as an exception as its residential retail

electricity sales per housing unit increased by only 33 percent between 1970 and 2007.2

Explanations for this divergence, called the Rosenfeld curve (named after Arthur Rosenfeld of

the California Energy Commission), have focused on California’s energy policies, in particular

its increasingly strict building and appliance codes, as well as its milder climate, household

demographic trends, and its higher energy and land prices which have made its homes smaller

(Dan Charles 2009).


       We use micro data from the 2000 Census to document the electricity consumption of

California homes of different vintages and to establish how the price of electricity at the time

when a home was built determines its later electricity consumption. At any point in time, the

average home’s electricity consumption is a weighted average of that of different cohorts of

homes in which the weights are the vintage’s share of the total housing stock. Because housing

is a durable and because we find that the real price of electricity at the time when a home is built

is an important determinant of its later electricity consumption even when 40 years have passed,

inefficient cohorts have a long-run effect on the average home’s electricity consumption at later

points in time.


Empirical Framework and Data



1
  Total retail electricity sales are from the Energy State Data System (SEDS) of the Energy
Information Administration http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/states/_seds.html . The number of
housing units are estimated from the 2006 American Community Survey and from United States
Department of Commerce (1993).

A home’s electricity consumption depends on how it was built, who lives in the home, what

durables are installed in the home and how the household uses these durables for its day to day

activities. Below, we will control for attributes of the household living in the home. Our focus is

the home itself and the building codes and energy prices when it was constructed.


        A house is a long-lasting durable. At its birth, building codes and decisions made by the

developer affect the home's energy efficiency. A developer’s decisions depend on building

codes, technology, and energy prices at the time of construction. Houses built during years of

low electricity prices may be less energy efficient because consumers demand less efficient

houses. We seek to understand the differences between vintages.


        We use a sample of California owner-occupied, single family homes from the 2000 5%

IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Sample) to examine the effect of electricity prices in the year the

home was built on current energy expenditures. Respondents were asked their annual electricity

expenditures. We restrict to households in which the head is ages 30-65. The Census reports

expenditure on electricity, the household’s attributes, the home’s attributes and provides a

geographical identifier called a “PUMA”. Such PUMAs are aggregates of adjacent census tracts

and tend to have roughly 100,000 people within them.


        Using the 2000 IPUMS we compare houses built in different years in the same PUMA at

the same point in time. We specify the log of annual household electricity expenditure, E, as a

function of the logarithm of the mean price of electricity in the electric utility district in the

building vintage year (P), a vector of house year built dummies (Y), a vector of house

characteristics (H), including electric heat and number of rooms, a vector of socioeconomic and




                                                                                                     4
demographic statistics (S), geographical fixed effects (F) called “PUMAs” in the Census data,

and an error term ( ):


    1                                                                                             .


The PUMA fixed effects proxy for local climate conditions and current electricity prices. The

coefficient on price,    , is thus equivalent to the price at construction elasticity of total electricity

consumption.


         We estimate equation (1) using OLS to test for differences in energy expenditure as a

function of the home’s year built. We restrict our sample to single family homes built between

1960 and 2000. Because of data availability our year built dummies are less than 2 years old

(after 1998, the omitted category), 2-5 years ago (1995-1998), 6-10 years ago (1990-1994), 11-

20 years ago (1980-1989), 21-30 years ago (1970-1979), and 31-40 years ago (1960-1969). Our

socioeconomic and demographic variables include the logarithm of household income, the

Duncan Socioeconomic Index (a measure of the household head’s occupation which we view as

a proxy for permanent income), race, the number of persons in the household, and the age of the

household head.     In addition, we control for the home’s number of rooms, an electric heat

indicator and we include the year built dummies listed above.


         Both building codes and electricity prices at the time of construction will affect vintage

year dummies. Real electricity prices in California were falling in the 1960s and 1970s and only

began to rise in the 1980s, peaking in the early 1990s in 4 out 5 utilities (see Figure 1).

California prices were similar to the rest of the nation in 1970 but consistently higher after 19853.

We would expect that homes built in the 1970s would be less energy efficient than earlier and

later homes. An increased prevalence of heating and cooling systems with ducts (a source of

energy leakage) might reduce the energy efficiency of homes built in the 1970s relative to earlier

years.

Notes: The data were kindly provided by Tom Gorin and are in 1977 dollars. We present the

         The California Energy Commission (CEC) requires that new construction meet a specific

energy budget in terms of energy consumption per square foot of floor space and that certain

standards, e.g. for insulation, are met. The CEC instituted energy efficiency building codes in

1978 and subsequently strengthened the codes in 1984, 1992, and 1998. However, building

codes could be ineffective if there is a “rebound” effect leading consumers to increase electricity




                                                                                                  6
usage (e.g. cranking up the air conditioning) or if builders do not effectively implement the code

(e.g. they install poor insulation).


        Using data from a large California public utility with information on home

characteristics, including square footage and the exact year built, and on homeowner

characteristics, Dora L. Costa and Matthew E. Kahn (2010) found that homes built after 1983 use

less electricity than home built before 1960, coincident with stricter building codes. However,

they found that homes built in the 1970s and early 1980s use more electricity than homes built

before 1960 despite the introduction of building codes. In the 2000 IPUMS data the 1998, 1992,

1992 or 1984, and 1984 or 1978 codes governed year 1998 and later, 1995-98, 1990-94, and

1980-1989 homes, respectively. For the most part, codes did not affect 1960-1979 construction.


        We estimate equation (1) with and without average electricity prices at the time when the

home was built.     We use the Mable Geocorr mapping file to map PUMAs to counties. For

each major utility district in California for each year from 1960 until 2000, we have data on the

real price per kWh of residential electricity.4 Our price data set covers the major California

electric utilities: SCE, PG&E, SMUD, LADWP, and SDG&E.


        Erin Mansur provided us with a bridge file that allowed us to assign each county to a

specific utility. The IPUMS data reports a home’s year built in roughly ten year categories.

Using this information and the home’s PUMA location we merge the average real electricity

price to each record. For example, suppose that in the year 2000, there is a home built between

1960 and 1970 in the Sacramento area. Using the Mansur data, we will assign this home as

being part of SMUD’s service area. We take the SMUD real annual price data and average it

from 1960 to 1970 and merge this average SMUD price to this Sacramento home to reflect the

price of electricity when it was “born”. When a county was served by more than one utility (such

as Los Angeles County), we averaged across the two utility’s prices. We cluster the standard

errors by electric utility/built year interval since the average electricity price does not vary within

this category.


       Our data are only for California because this is the state for which we have been able to

collect historical data by decade by electric utility. A novel feature of these data is that two

different homes in the same PUMA will have different “birth” electricity prices if they were built

in different time periods and two homes built in the same year will have different “birth

electricity” prices if they are located in different electric utility zones. We exploit both sources of

variation below.


Results


       We find a non-monotonic relationship between electricity consumption and vintage year

(see Table 1). When we do not control for the price of electricity at the time of construction, we

find that compared to homes built in 1998-2000, homes built in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, early

1990s, and mid-1990s consume 14, 15, 13, 8, and 3 percent more electricity, respectively.

When we control for the price of electricity at the time of construction, we find that homes built

in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, early 1990s, and mid-1990s consume 12, 9, 13, 12, and 5 percent

more electricity, respectively, than homes built in 1998-2000. Past prices thus explain 42% of

the difference between in electricity consumption between 1970-79 and 1998-2000 homes and

15% of the difference between 1960-69 and 1998-2000 homes.           Controlling for electricity

prices we find that homes built in the 1980s and early 1990s consume as much electricity as

homes built in 1998-2000. Lower electricity usage in early 1990s homes thus can be fully

explained by price effects. Only in the second half of the 1990s did homes start to consume less

electricity controlling for prices at time of construction.

homes in which the household head is ages 30-65 and the home is 40 years old or less. See
Equation 1 in the text. The dependent variable is logarithm of annual electricity expenditures.
The mean of annual electricity expenditures is $889. The standard errors (in parentheses) are
clustered on electric utility/built year categories. Additional control variables are a dummy for
electric heat, the logarithm of household income, the Duncan Socioeconomic Index, a dummy if
the head of the household is white, the number of rooms, and the number of persons in the
household, the age of the household head. The constant term is not shown. The symbol ***
indicates significance at the 1 percent level.

       We estimate an elasticity of electricity prices at the time of construction of -0.22. When

we drop the year built dummies in the specification, we estimate a price elasticity of -0.194 (

0.024). Our estimated elasticity of the price at the time of construction is higher than Koichiro

Ito’s (2010) estimate of the elasticity of current average price of -0.112.


                                                                                                    9
       Low electricity prices at the time of construction encourage the building of electric heat

homes; we found that electricity expenditure is 21.9% (       1.1) higher for owners of electric

heat homes relative to comparable non-electric heat homes. Estimates from a probit model

showed that a dollar decrease in the price of electricity at the time of construction (controlling for

PUMA fixed effects) increased the probability that a home was an electric heat home by 0.058

( =.019). However, because we include an electric heat dummy in all of our cross-sectional

specifications the pattern that we observe in the year built dummies cannot be explained by

whether a home is an electric heat home.


       Homes built in the 1970s are not high electricity cost homes because of aging effects.

We recognize that in a single cross-section that we cannot disentangle birth cohort effects from

aging effects. Costa and Kahn (2010)’s panel analysis of a large sample of California homes

from a major electric utility district covering the years 2001 to 2009 showed that each 10 years

of aging increases a home’s electricity consumption by 1%. This very small aging effect

increases our confidence that the estimated effects in Table 1 reflect vintage effects.


       Given that homes are extremely long lived durables, energy inefficient cohorts will affect

overall average household electricity consumption for decades. Table 2 shows that the share of

“brown” vintages built in the 1970s has fallen as population has grown and new homes have

been constructed. In Table 2, we report the birth year vintage distribution by calendar year for

California. To construct this table, we have taken Census micro data from 1980, 1990 and 2000

and data from the 2006 American Community Survey and tabulated the birth year by calendar

year. The columns sum to 1. In 1980 homes built in the 1970s represented 23% of the stock

while by the year 2006 this cohort’s share had shrunk to 15%.

Conclusion


       Low electricity prices at the time of construction are an important determinant of a

home’s electricity consumption even years after its birth. This finding resembles results from

the induced innovation literature (see Richard Newell, Adam B. Jaffe, and Robert N. Stavins

1999) for air conditioners and vehicles. During times of high energy prices, producers market

more energy efficient versions of the differentiated product. As homes built between 1960 and

1989 become a smaller share of the housing stock and new homes are built under existing or
