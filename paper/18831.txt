The boats that did not sail: Asset Price Volatility and Market Efficiency in a Natural Experiment

                                            ABSTRACT

What explains short-term fluctuations of stock prices? This paper exploits a natural experiment from
the 18th century in which information flows were regularly interrupted for exogenous reasons. English
shares were traded on the Amsterdam exchange and news came in on sailboats that were often delayed
because of adverse weather conditions. The paper documents that prices responded strongly to boat
arrivals, but there was considerable volatility in the absence of news. The evidence suggests that this
was largely the result of the revelation of (long-lived) private information and the (transitory) impact
of uninformed liquidity trades on intermediaries' risk premia.

What drives the short-run volatility of stock returns? Prices move signi…cantly on a day-to-

day basis and it is often unclear why. An extensive literature, going back to Schwert (1981,

1989), Roll (1984a, 1988), French and Roll (1986), and Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1989),

o¤ers two possible explanations: (1) the arrival of public news and (2) the impact of the

trading process, which can capture privately informed trading, liquidity trades or shifts in

investor sentiment.

   Distinguishing between these two explanations, however, is not straightforward. Trading

and the arrival of news usually go together. Moreover, news arrives continuously to the

market and modern textual analysis notwithstanding it is often unclear what information

a news item actually contains. It is therefore di¢ cult to identify price movements that are

unrelated to the arrival of new information, let alone what such price changes re‡ect.

   The purpose of this paper is to shed more light on what drives short-term asset price

movements. Speci…cally, it uses a natural experiment where information ‡ows are easily

observable and where, for exogenous reasons, the market is starved from news for days in a

row. The paper aims to (1) identify how much markets move in the presence and absence

of news and (2) to explain asset price movements that are unrelated to the arrival of new

information.

   The natural experiment is provided by the Amsterdam market for English securities in the

18th century. At that time, a number of English securities were traded on the Amsterdam

exchange. While the main market for these stocks was in London, Dutch investors held

between 20% and 30% of English securities (Bowen (1989), Wright (1999)). This gave rise

to active trade in Amsterdam. Importantly, for the periods under study (1771 to 1777

and 1783 to 1787) virtually all relevant information about these securities originated in the

                                             1
British capital. This information was transmitted to Amsterdam through o¢ cial mail packet

boats that departed twice a week. These were sailing ships, and adverse weather conditions

(especially Eastern winds) led to frequent delays and in turn news blackouts in Amsterdam

that could last for multiple days. This exogenous variation in the ‡ow of information makes

it possible to study stock returns in the absence of news. At the same time, …nancial markets

had long been established and functioned in a way similar to today.

   I …rst document that the Amsterdam market reacted to the arrival of boats from London

as one would expect. Prices in Amsterdam responded strongly right after the arrival of news.

The variance of stock returns was signi…cantly higher when boats from England arrived. At

the same time, volatility in the absence of boats was signi…cant: the ratio of the “no-boat”

versus “boat”return variance was between 0.40 and 0.58.

   Next, I decompose these asset price movements into their constituent parts. Two factors

can explain almost all of the volatility unrelated to the arrival of public news. The …rst is

private information. English packet boats brought in not only public information, but also

private signals in the form of trading orders from England. The evidence suggests that these

trading orders were spread out over time and a¤ected returns on both days with and days

without the arrival of packet boats. As a result, prices in Amsterdam and London moved

(slowly) in the same direction, even when there was no direct information sharing. The

covariance of returns in London after the departure of a boat and returns in Amsterdam

after its arrival provides a measure of the importance of private information.

   The second factor that can help explain the volatility not related to the arrival of public

news is local liquidity shocks. The evidence suggests that, just as today, liquidity in the

market was …nite and uninformed trades had (transitory) price impact. This is identi…ed

                                              2
through the covariance of returns within the Amsterdam market.

   The estimates indicate that public news explains more than 50% of the return variance

on days ships arrived in Amsterdam and around 40% of the overall return variance. Private

information explains about 25% and 35% of volatility on days with and without boats,

respectively. Liquidity shocks explain up to 30% of the overall return variance for most

securities. The exception is the British East India Company, for which liquidity seems

to have been particularly good. A large fraction of returns remains unexplained for this

security, speci…cally on no-boat days. This may be an indirect result of the presence of

private information. Due to the arrival of private signals from London, adverse selection

costs may have been particularly high after the arrival of boats, leading uninformed agents to

concentrate their liquidity trades in periods without any boat arrivals (Admati and P‡eiderer

(1988)). It is impossible, however, to di¤erentiate this possibility from other explanations

that emphasize the importance of sentiment shocks or the divergence of beliefs during periods

without recent information from England.


   This paper is related to an extensive literature quantifying the impact of news on stock

price volatility. Early studies such as Berry and Howe (1994), Mitchell and Mulherin (1994),

Andersen, Bollerslev and Cai (2000), and Kalev et al. 2004) generally …nd a weak relation

between the arrival of news and stock market volatility.1 Recent contributions using textual

analysis to identify the impact of di¤erent types of news such as Antweiler and Frank (2006),

Demers and Vega (2006), Tetlock (2007), Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky and Macskassy (2008),

Gri¢ n, Hirschey and Kelly (2010), Davis, Piger and Sedor (2012), and Boudoukh et al.

(2013) …nd greater explanatory power of news. Studies that analyze weather-sensitive assets,


                                              3
for which it is easier to measure information ‡ows and identify causality, …nd an important

role for public information (Roll (1984a), Fleming, Kirby and Ostdiek (2006), Boudoukh et

al. (2007)). Nevertheless, an important fraction of volatility remains unexplained, especially

“out of season.” Related to this point, Yermack (2014) shows that stocks are less volatile

when CEOs are on vacation and news announcements are delayed.

   This paper is also related to a literature that examines periods during which information

arrives as usual but markets are closed (French and Roll (1986), Barclay, Litzenberger and

Warner (1990), Ito and Lin (1992), Ito, Lyons and Melvin 1998)). These studies …nd that

return variance is surprisingly low when trade is restricted. This result suggests that the

arrival of news itself is relatively unimportant and that trading activity (capturing privately

informed trading, liquidity trades or something else) explains the majority of returns.

   In addition, this paper is related to studies on cross-listings, speci…cally papers that

examine how the price of a foreign security is a¤ected when its home market is open or

closed. Security prices are more volatile when the home market is open. Nevertheless, a

large share of price discovery takes place outside these hours (Harvey and Huang (1991),

Forster and George (1995), Werner and Kleidon (1996)). It is unclear whether this is driven

by public news originating in the host market or whether this is caused by the trading

process.

   Relative to this literature, the current paper’s main contribution lies in the identi…cation

of news ‡ows. In Amsterdam, when no boats arrived, there was no public news from London,

and thus no new material public information on English securities. To the best of my

knowledge, this paper is the …rst to analyze a market that continues to operate while public

information ‡ows are shut down. This setting provides a unique opportunity to identify

                                              4
the importance of public news, especially since the ‡ow of information (in the form of boat

arrivals) is directly observable. In most existing studies it is di¢ cult to know whether all

relevant sources of public news have been identi…ed.

   It is important to acknowledge that the current paper’s setting also has a potential

drawback: the mail packet boats could have transmitted more than just public news and

private information. In particular, boats conveyed information about London stock prices

that, in addition to fundamental information, may have re‡ected liquidity (or sentiment)

shocks. These boats also carried English trading orders that were possibly motivated by the

same nonfundamental reasons. Similar to informed trades, these could have been spread out

over time. I test extensively for these alternatives and …nd no evidence that they played an

important role. Most importantly, prices in Amsterdam do not appear to have responded to

transitory shocks in London.

   This paper is also related to a literature that uses historical settings to study asset price

volatility (for example Elmendorf, Hirshfeld, and Weil (1996), Silber (2005), Brown, Mul-

herin, and Weidenmier (2008), particularly studies of the 18th century securities markets in

Amsterdam and London.2 In seminal work, Neal (1987, 1990) documents that the Amster-

dam and London markets were well integrated. Neal relies on daily data for London, but on

price data with a frequency of two observations a month for Amsterdam (originally collected

by Van Dillen (1931)). Dempster, Wells, and Wills (2000) use Neal’s data set to provide

more evidence on the integration of the Amsterdam and London capital markets. Harrison

(1998) studies the properties of returns in London and Amsterdam (again using Neal’s data)

and …nds that both the shape of the return distributions and the autocorrelation patterns

are very similar to those of modern markets. Finally, Koudijs (2014) uses the same historical

                                               5
setting to test the Kyle (1985) model of strategic insider trading, and …nds strong evidence in

favor of this model. Relative to the above literature on …nancial markets in the 18th century,

this paper is the …rst (1) to employ data on the arrival of packet boats to measure informa-

tion ‡ows, and (2) to use Amsterdam price data at a relatively high frequency (that is, three

observations a week). Furthermore, this paper goes beyond market integration and general

characteristics of the return process to identify the deeper sources of asset price volatility.

   The paper proceeds as follows. Section I provides historical background and summary

statistics. Section II presents two examples of the paper’s approach. Section III evaluates

whether all relevant information originated in England, and whether packet boats conveyed

material information as opposed to transitory shocks to liquidity of sentiment. In Section IV

I present baseline estimates of the return variance in periods with and without the arrival

of a boat. I then discuss potential explanations for volatility in the absence of news, in

particular private information and local liquidity shocks, and quantify their impact. Section

V concludes. Additional information and results are presented in the online Appendix.3


                     I.    Data and Historical Background

   In this section I …rst describe the Amsterdam market itself: how developed was it, and

to what extent can it serve as a useful comparison for markets today? Next, I summarize

how news was transmitted between London and Amsterdam. Third, I discuss the assets that

were traded and the price data that are available. Finally, I provide a number of descriptive

statistics.




                                               6
A. Market Structure


   Amsterdam and London were the most important securities markets in the 18th century.

The Dutch started to invest in English securities in the early 1700s (Wilson (1941)), as

doing so provided a good opportunity to diversify domestic portfolios at relatively low cost.4

Unlike today’s Anglodutch “Siamese twins,” the English securities traded on both sides of

the North Sea were identical. The historical record indicates that there was active trade

in English securities on the Amsterdam exchange (Van Dillen (1931), Van Nierop (1931),

Wilson (1941)). Although volume data are unavailable for the period, some inferences can

be made about the size of the market for English stocks in Amsterdam. Bowen (1989) and

Wright (1999) show that during the 1770s around one-third of the shares of British companies

were in the hands of Dutch investors. During the 1780s this fell to around one-…fth.

   The Amsterdam market was organized in a way similar to today. Trade took place in

a centralized location. Around noon two o¢ cial trading hours were held in the entrance

hall of the Exchange building (Spooner (1983), Hoes (1986)).5 There were no o¢ cial market

makers. Trade was based on limit orders; a group of approximately 40 o¢ cial brokers (and

an unknown number of uno¢ cial brokers) convened to execute as many of their principals’

orders as possible. Regulation prohibited these brokers from trading on their own account

(Smith (1919), Van Nierop (1931)). At the end of the afternoon, a committee of so-called

sworn brokers reported the going price of the day (Smith (1919), p. 109). Investors used

this information to monitor their brokers ex post (Polak (1924), Hoes (1986)).

   Apart from spot trade, a large fraction of trading activity was related to futures and

options. Derivatives were introduced in the 17th century and their use and trade was fully


                                              7
institutionalized (Petram (2011)). Futures were actively used for shorting.6 Every three

months, future and option positions were cleared during periods of “rescontre” (Van Dillen

(1931)). There were no formal margin requirements and the market was mainly based on

reputation.

   Similar to today, there was a developed market for margin loans. This system had been

developed in the early 17th century (Gelderblom and Jonker (2004)) and was actively used

in the 18th century to fund (spot) positions in the English securities (Smith (1919); Wilson

(1941)). These margin loans usually ran for six months and had margin requirements. The

legal terms of the contracts are broadly similar to today (Koudijs and Voth (2014)).

   The historical evidence suggests that the sophistication of market participants was con-

siderable. Temin and Voth (2004) document investor strategies during the South Sea bubble

of 1720 that were very similar to those observed during the recent tech bubble. Frehen, Goet-

zmann and Rouwenhorst (2013) suggest that in 1720, market participants were perfectly able

to di¤erentiate between systematic and idiosyncratic risk.


B. News Flows


   How did news from England reach Amsterdam? Since 1660, England and the Dutch

Republic had been connected through a system of sailing ships between Harwich (England)

and Hellevoetsluis (Dutch Republic), an important harbor close to Rotterdam. These packet

boats were speci…cally designed for the route and ensured a swift and regular ‡ow of infor-

mation between the two countries. Since Amsterdam did not have a direct connection with

the North Sea (boats had to sail past the island Texel), this was the fastest way information

from London could reach Amsterdam (Hemmeon (1912), Stitt Dibden (1965), Ten Brink

                                             8
(1969)).7

   The packet boats were scheduled to leave Harwich on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The

median sailing time was two days (including the day of departure). It took additional time

to carry the news over land. Roads were particularly bad and rivers had to be crossed by

ferry. Even though the news was carried on horseback, transport from London to Harwich

and from Hellevoetsluis to Amsterdam added two days to the total travel time, making a

total of four days (including the day of departure). Section I of the Internet Appendix has

more details.

   The packet ships often encountered adverse winds and as a result news could be sig-

ni…cantly delayed for days, sometimes even weeks. Around a third of the crossings from

England to Holland were delayed. During such periods of bad weather no news could be

transmitted across the North Sea. Indeed, the Tatler, an English newspaper of the time,

noted that there could be a news blackout in London “when a West wind blows [...], keeping

news on the other side of the Channel” (quoted in Dale (2004), p. 17). The same was true

for Amsterdam when the wind was blowing from the east.

   The packet boat system was the main channel through which news from England reached

investors in Amsterdam. The Dutch newspapers of the time all relied on the packet boat

service to receive news from England. All articles with new information from London can be

traced to the arrival of a speci…c packet boat. During periods of particularly bad weather,

news from England would arrive in Amsterdam through the harbor of Ostend in today’s

Belgium, which had a regular packet boat service with Dover in England. This occurred

nine times during the sample periods. The Dutch newspapers meticulously reported these

episodes, which allows me to take them into account in the empirical analysis.

                                            9
   The packet boat system was also the main channel for private letters. This is borne out

by the English correspondence from Hope & Co. during the sample periods. One of the

biggest Dutch banking houses of the period, Hope had strong connections in England and

was active in the stock market. All correspondence with their English counterparties took

place through the packet boat system (see Section I in the Internet Appendix for details).

Thus, important individuals received (public) news at the same time as the market as a

whole. Even Nathan Rothschild, who famously was the …rst in London to receive news

about the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, received this information only a few

hours before the general public (Dale (2004), p. 17).8

   What was the content of the news transmitted from London to Amsterdam? Investors

in Amsterdam received all public information available to English investors, as each packet

boat brought newspapers and other newsletters that contained information about recent

developments in London, including the most recent security prices. The packet boats also

brought private letters from London correspondents.9


C. Data, Sample Period, Sources, and Descriptive Statistics


   I examine all English securities cross-listed in London and Amsterdam for which frequent

price data are available for the Dutch market. This includes three stocks and two government

debt issues: the British East India Company (EIC), the Bank of England (BoE), the South

Sea Company (SSC), and 3% and 4% annuities. The three companies were involved in a

number of business activities. The EIC was a trading company that held large possessions

in India. The company’s prospects were determined by conditions in the East and political

developments in England (Sutherland (1952)). Both the BoE, which wasn’t a central bank

                                             10
yet, and the SSC helped …nance the British government debt.10 The BoE also provided

large-scale credit to the EIC and discounted commercial bills (Clapham (1944)).

   I focus on two periods: September 1771 to December 1777, and September 1783 to

March 1787. These periods represent the intersection of two sets: (1) periods for which

all relevant information is available in the historical sources, and (2) periods of peace on

the European continent, with an absence of severe …nancial crises. The latter consideration

ensures that important information about the English stocks originated in England – an

important condition for the clean identi…cation of news arrival. The starting point of the …rst

period, September 1771, is determined by data limitations. This period ends in December

1777, a few months before tensions between England and France increased, leading to a

declaration of war in March 1778.11 In 1780 war also broke out between the Dutch Republic

and England.12 The second sample period starts in September 1783, right after the signing of

an o¢ cial peace treaty between France and England and a preliminary peace treaty between

England and the Dutch Republic. This sample period ends in March 1787. Domestic tensions

in the Netherlands increased in April 1787 (on April 24 there was a dramatic change in city

government in Amsterdam), eventually leading to domestic con‡ict in May 1787 and an

intervention by the Prussian army in September 1787.

   Amsterdam price data are hand-collected for the entire period between September 1771

and March 1787 and come from the Amsterdamsche Courant, and where necessary are sup-

plemented by information from the Opregte Haerlemsche Courant). For each stock, these

data contain three observations per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). London price

data, available at a daily frequency for the EIC, BoE, and 3% annuities, come from Neal

(1990), and necessary are supplemented with data from Rogers (1902).13 In both Amsterdam

                                              11
and London, prices are reported in Pound Sterling (normalized as a percentage of the nom-

inal or par value). Returns are adjusted for dividend or coupon payments. Information on

dividends comes from Clapham (1944) and Bowen (2007), and information about ex-dividend

and ex-coupon dates comes from Rogers (1902) and the Amsterdamsche Courant.

   London prices refer to spot transactions. By the second half of the 18th century, a

signi…cant fraction of trade in the English stocks in Amsterdam was concentrated in the

futures market (Van Dillen (1931)). As a result, all available price data for the Amsterdam

market refer to futures prices. To facilitate comparison between London and Amsterdam, I

convert all Amsterdam future prices into spot prices, using a …xed cost-to-carry rate. See

Section I of the Internet Appendix for details. A future contract had four possible expiration

dates: February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15. The newspaper reported prices

for the future contract ending on the nearest date. This means that the maturity of a

future contract was never longer than three months. It is unlikely that ‡uctuations in the

short-term interest rate contributed signi…cantly to the volatility of returns. For example,

an instantaneous increase in the cost-to-carry rate of 100 bps would lead to a log return of

0.05% (0.10%) on a future contract with a median (maximum) maturity of 1.5 (3) months –

this is at the 6th (21st ) percentile of the distribution of absolute EIC returns meaning that

94% (79%) of returns were larger in size. Furthermore, results in Section V.B of the Internet

Appendix indicate that price changes of futures with a longer time to maturity (for which

changes in the cost-to-carry rate should be more important) were not more volatile.

   Data about boat arrivals in the Dutch Republic come from the Rotterdamsche Courant

(see Section I of the Internet Appendix). The sailing schedule allowed for two boat crossings

a week. Arrival data in England were hand collected from several English newspapers:

                                             12
General Evening Post, Lloyd’s Evening Post, Lloyd’s Lists, London Chronicle, and Middlesex

Journal. Due to the time-intensive nature of this part of the data collection process, I only

collected this information for the two periods of interest.

   Table I reports descriptive statistics for the Amsterdam market. Panel A provides in-

formation on returns between 1771 to 1787, both inclusive and exclusive of the war period

between 1778 and 1783. There are three prices a week for the Amsterdam market (Mon-

day, Wednesday, and Friday). I calculate percentage log returns over two-day (Monday-to-

Wednesday and Wednesday-to-Friday) or three-day periods (Friday-to-Monday), indexed by

subscript t, using   pAM
                      t
                         S
                           = 100 log (pt =pt 1 ).14 The results show that the return variance

between 1771 and 1777 and 1783 and 1787 is considerably lower than during the 1771 to

1787 period as a whole. The di¤erence is statistically signi…cant and re‡ects the fact that

security prices were highly volatile during the war period. The exception is the EIC, for

which the di¤erence between return variances is relatively small. For comparison, Panel B

provides information for the entire 1723 to 1794 period, for which Amsterdam security prices

are available roughly every two weeks (Van Dillen (1931)). In particular, Panel B reports

the variance in two-week returns for 1771 to 1777 and 1783 to 1787, and the full period. The

results suggest that the two sample periods are largely representative of the 18th century as

a whole.15 For the BoE and 3% annuities, the return variance is roughly the same. For the

EIC, the return variance is somewhat higher during the sample periods.

   [Table I about here]

   Panel C focuses on the boat arrival data. These data can be divided in subperiods based

on the arrival of boats. During the two sample periods, there were 681 such between-boat

periods, more than half of which were long enough that, in addition to a price observation

                                              13
re‡ecting an incoming boat, there was also a price observation that did not re‡ect the

arrival of English news. The median length of a between-boat period is three days, but the

distribution has a fat right tail. The 95th percentile is seven days and the maximum is 21

days. The maximum number of price observations per period is eight.


                                   II.    Examples

   Figure 1 illustrates the paper’s approach with two concrete examples. Panel A illustrates

how public information was transmitted. On November 18, 1783, English Prime Minister Fox

declared that the British East India Company’s (EIC) …nances were in a “deplorable state”

(Sutherland (1952), p. 375)16 and the company’s stock price in London fell dramatically

from 136 to 120. The vertical/diagonal black lines in the …gure indicate how and when the

packet boats transmitted this news to Amsterdam. In the days following the decline on the

English exchange, weather conditions were unfavorable and the packet boat could not cross

the North Sea. As a result, prices in Amsterdam did not adjust. After wind conditions

improved, a packet boat reached the Dutch Republic on November 28, 10 days after Fox

gave his speech. Prices in Amsterdam fell sharply in response.

   [Figure 1 about here]

   Panel B illustrates the importance of private signals and factors unrelated to new infor-

mation. During the winter of 1775 to 1776 weather conditions were particularly unfavorable,

and thus news from England reached Amsterdam with long intervals. This period fell in the

middle of the American Revolution, and on December 27 an envoy arrived in London with

secret dispatches from the Revolutionaries, report of which reached Amsterdam on January

2. Over the subsequent two weeks there was a news blackout in Amsterdam due to especially

                                            14
strong eastern winds.17 When, on January 15, the English news (dated January 4) …nally

arrived, it only contained rumors: the contents of the American dispatches had not been

disclosed yet. At the same time, the London EIC stock price had increased from 165.75 to

167.75. Interestingly, the EIC price in Amsterdam had gone up as well during the blackout.

Later, it turned out that the American dispatches contained a serious peace proposal –po-

tentially good news for the EIC. It is possible that privately informed agents traded on this

information in both markets, causing prices to go up. The …gure suggests that such private

information was not incorporated into prices right away.

   After January 4, prices in London fell in response to the news that the English were

not prepared to accept the American terms for peace. Then, on January 11, the London

EIC price rose from 166.5 to 168.5 for no apparent reason. When Amsterdam learned of

this on January 23, the market only partially responded. In the subsequent blackout period

that lasted more than two weeks, the Amsterdam EIC price fell from 167.25 to 166.75,

only to recover to its previous level after the arrival of English news on February 7. The

factors driving these price movements were probably unrelated to information and may have

re‡ected liquidity shocks or changes in sentiment.


                          III.    Validation Experiment

   Before turning to the paper’s main results, in this section I discuss the historical setting

in greater detail. First, I take a closer look at the direction of news ‡ows. I examine

whether relevant information about the English securities originated in England. Next, I

provide evidence that the packet boats carried material information that moved stock prices.

The results suggests that the transmission of transitory liquidity shocks was less important.

                                              15
Finally, I provide suggestive evidence that trading volume on no-boat days was considerable.


A. Direction of News


     The identi…cation strategy of this paper relies on the assumption that relevant informa-

tion about the English stocks originated in England. While I focus on two sample periods

for which this is likely the case, ultimately whether this assumption is correct is an empirical

question. To shed light on this question, I …rst analyze the ‡ow of information between

London and Amsterdam using a simple econometric framework that takes into account vari-

ation in communication lags and the discrete arrival of the packet boats. Figure 2 illustrates

this approach. As noted above, log returns in Amsterdam are calculated over two- or three-

day periods that are indexed by t. Those returns re‡ect either the arrival of a packet boat

( pAM
   t
      S;boat
             ) or no arrival of a boat ( pAM
                                          t+d
                                              S;no   boat
                                                            ). There can be multiple “no-boat” re-

turns between the arrival of two ships; this is indicated by d. Table I shows that there are

at most seven no-boat returns per between-boat period and thus d 2 [1; 7]. With the arrival

of a boat, market participants in Amsterdam observed the change in the London price since

the last boat departure, which captures (possibly among other things) all new information

that reached the London market during this between-boat period. This price change is given

by    pLN D
       s 1 , where s stands for a speci…c period between two boat departures. London re-


turns,    pLN
           t
              D
                , are calculated over the same two- or three-day periods.         pLN
                                                                                   t
                                                                                      D;boat
                                                                                             re‡ects

the arrival of a boat from Amsterdam, and the Amsterdam return transmitted by this boat

is given by   pAM S
               s 1 .

where the coe¢ cients   1   and   1   capture the response of Amsterdam and London, respectively,

to price changes in the other market between boat departures. These price changes also

respond to past returns from the other market. To reduce attenuation bias, I include these

past returns in the regressions; with a slight abuse of notation these are denoted by      pAM
                                                                                            s 2
                                                                                                S



and   pLN D
       s 2 .


   Table II presents the results. Since detailed London price data are available only for the

EIC, BoE and 3% annuities, results are available only for these three securities. The table

shows that London price changes had strong explanatory power for prices in Amsterdam.

There is some evidence for an e¤ect in the other direction as well, but the R2 s are virtually

zero, and the coe¢ cients are seven to eight times smaller and only borderline statistically

signi…cant (for the BoE, the coe¢ cient is insigni…cant altogether). These results con…rm that,

at least for the paper’s speci…c sample periods, most relevant new information originated in

London.

   [Table II about here]

   Next, I perform a similar analysis using a vector error correction model (VECM). The

advantage of a VECM is that it explicitly takes into account that Amsterdam and London

prices were co-integrated. The disadvantage of this approach is that one cannot account

for the variation in lag lengths and the discrete arrival of boats. Details on the estimation


                                                     17
and impulse response functions are presented in Section II of the Internet Appendix. The

results again show that innovations in prices in London have strong predictive power for

Amsterdam returns, not the other way around. Since the VECM estimates do not rely on

actual boat arrivals, I can also perform this analysis for the period of international con‡ict

between January 1778 and August 1783, during which time information on boat arrivals is

not available. Not surprisingly, for this period there is strong evidence that price changes

in Amsterdam had an important e¤ect on prices in London. The results are summarized

in Table III in the form of Hasbrouck (1995) information shares. During the two sample

periods characterized by peace, between 92% and 99% of relevant information originated in

London. For the intermediate period characterized by international con‡ict, this drops to

between 58% and 77 %. This result highlights the importance of restricting the paper’s main

analysis to the 1771 to 1777 and 1783 to 1787 periods.

   [Table III about here]

   I also test whether returns on English securities in Amsterdam are related to ‡uctuations

in the price of Dutch securities. Changes in general economic conditions in the Nether-

lands, such as movements in the interest rate, should have a¤ected both Dutch and English

securities. Table IV presents results from the regression



                             ptAM S;no   boat
                                                =   0   +   1   AM S t + ut ,



where AM S is a vector of percentage log returns on three Dutch securities: VOC (Dutch

East India Company), WIC (Dutch West Indies Company) and bank money. Two di¤er-

ent currencies circulated in Amsterdam: cash and bank money, which represented current


                                                    18
accounts at the Bank of Amsterdam (Quinn and Roberds (2007)). Fluctuations in the ex-

change rate between these two “types”of money might convey information about aggregate

risk aversion, investment opportunities, and the availability of liquidity.18 . I estimate the

equation above for days without boat arrivals. The results show that there is virtually no

correlation between English and Dutch assets on days without news. Returns on VOC stock

have some predictive power, but the coe¢ cients are small and statistically insigni…cant. An

exception is the BoE, for which the (economically small) coe¢ cient is marginally statisti-

cally signi…cant. The corresponding R2 s are close to zero. These results con…rm that general

economic conditions in the Netherlands had limited impact on the pricing of the English

securities.

   [Table IV about here]

   In Sections III.A and III.B of the Internet Appendix I examine whether relevant news

from England could have arrived through other channels, speci…cally, other types of ships or

carrier pigeons. The evidence suggests that these channels did not play an important role.

In Section III.C of the Internet Appendix I investigate whether relevant news could have

originated in a third place, like France, the U.S., or the East Indies. The results suggest

that news from Paris played only a limited role, and that relevant information from the U.S.

and the East Indies reached London, before being transmitted to Amsterdam. In Section

IV of the Internet Appendix I use an instrumental variables approach to examine whether

the arrival of news might have been endogenous to developments in the stock market (or

economic conditions in general). The evidence suggests that this is not the case.




                                             19
B. Boat Arrivals and News


   To what degree did the arrival of a packet boat result in the transmission of actual

news? Following Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1989) and Fair (2002), in Section V.C of

the Internet Appendix I analyze the 25 largest returns on EIC stock and the 3% annuities

(as a representative of the other four government related securities).19 In both cases, 22

of the 25 largest returns occurred following the arrival of a packet boat. For the EIC,

the arrival of a boat coincided with the transmission of relevant information in 20 cases.

This information contained news about, for example, signi…cant events in India or decisions

in Parliament a¤ecting the company. For the 3% annuities a boat arrival resulted in the

transmission of material information in 21 of the 22 cases, re‡ecting news about the national

debt, developments in the U.S. revolutionary war, or the situation in Ireland. For the largest

returns, the most important drivers of the variance estimates, there seems to be a close link

between the arrival of a boat and the transmission of relevant information.

   Next, I examine the general relation between the return variance and speci…c news con-

tent. As there were no formal disclosure requirements, it is impossible to isolate events such

as earnings announcements. In addition, no press specialized in publicly traded companies.

The only English security frequently mentioned in the Dutch newspapers was the EIC. I test

whether the Amsterdam stock price moved more when the EIC was mentioned in the press.

In addition, I interact the mentioning of the EIC with three sets of keywords that were po-

tentially relevant for the company: (1) …nancial terms such as “dividends”or “capital,”(2)

geographic locations or relevant persons in the East Indies, and (3) references to the Cape

(of Good Hope) Colony, as ships arriving from India would dock at the Cape to allow the


                                             20
crew to recover and a regular news service with England transmitted the most recent news

brought in by these ships.

   Note that the quality of the printed copy is not good enough to apply machine reading

techniques to the full text of the news articles. However, one Dutch newspaper, the Leydse

Courant, capitalized keywords during the 1771 to 1778 period to signal the topics covered,

and it is feasible to impute those by hand. To verify that the capitalization of keywords in the

Leydse Courant does not re‡ect something other than the actual topics covered, I include

a fourth category of words that signal (stale) background information rather than break-

ing news (words such as “declarations” or “proclamations”). Section V.C of the Internet

Appendix provides more details on the di¤erent news categories.

   Table V presents the results. Column (1) shows that a reference to the EIC is associated

with higher return volatility, especially if it is mentioned more than once.20 In the 28

instances in which the EIC was mentioned at least twice, the return variance was more than

three times higher than the benchmark. As a comparison, this is at the 75th percentile of

news to no-news ratios estimated for modern securities (Boudoukh et al. (2013)). Financial

terminology and references to the Cape are associated with return variance that is about

2.5 times higher than the benchmark, although only the former is statistically signi…cant.

There is no relation with the mentioning of the East Indies. Words signaling background

information are associated with signi…cantly lower volatility. It is likely that, due to space

limitations, this information was published only when there was no other news …t to print.

The adjusted R2 of the regression is 0.05. This is about as high as what Gri¢ n, Hirschey,

and Kelly (2010) …nd for developed countries using modern data.

   In columns (2) to (6) I interact the di¤erent news components with the EIC news dummies

                                              21
to unpack the e¤ects. Column (2) shows that if an article uses …nancial terminology and

contains more than one reference to the EIC, the return variance increases substantially.

This e¤ect, though (borderline) statistically insigni…cant and based on a limited number of

observations, almost fully explains the predictive power of the …nancial terminology dummy

and one-third of the EIC (>1) dummy. Column (3) indicates that the interaction with

the India dummy is not associated with higher volatility. Column (4) shows that there is a

large and statistically signi…cant interaction e¤ect between the EIC (>1) and Cape dummies

(again based on a limited number of observations). This fully explains the predictive power

of the Cape dummy and about a third of the e¤ect of the EIC (>1) dummy. Column

(5) shows that references to the EIC are not associated with higher volatility if they are

accompanied by background stories. The speci…cation in Column (6) includes all interaction

terms together and has an adjusted R2 of 0.11 (0.08 if estimated on absolute rather than

squared returns). In sum, I …nd a statistically signi…cant relation between the arrival of

certain types of news and EIC returns.

   [Table V about here]


C. Boat Arrivals and Transitory Shocks


   The above results con…rm that the packet boats transmitted relevant information about

the English securities. It is of course possible that in addition to this news, the boats

also transmitted English trading orders that a¤ected volatility in Amsterdam. Suppose, for

instance, that a party in London wanted to sell (or buy) for uninformed liquidity reasons.21

Suppose further that this trade had a (transitory) price impact (Grossman and Miller (1988)).

Then it is possible that the London agent executed part of his orders in Amsterdam, or that

                                             22
the price impact he caused in London was transmitted to Amsterdam through arbitrage.

   I evaluate the impact of English liquidity shocks in two ways. First, I test whether Dutch

liquidity shocks a¤ect prices in England. The Dutch held between 20% and 30% of the En-

glish securities, and unless arbitrage worked in a dramatically di¤erent way, Dutch liquidity

shocks should have a¤ected prices in England in a similar way. To test this conjecture, I

compute the variance of security returns in London on days with or without boat arrivals

from Amsterdam. The results, reported in Secion V.D of the Internet Appendix, show no

signi…cant di¤erence. If anything, volatility is lower on days with news from Amsterdam.

   Second, I use the fact liquidity shocks are transitory and revert over time (Hendershott

and Seasholes (2007), Du¢ e (2010), Tetlock (2010), Nagel (2012)). If liquidity shocks were

transmitted from London to Amsterdam (having a transitory price impact in both markets)

we would expect London returns to predict subsequent reversals in Amsterdam. To test this

conjecture, I run the following regression:



                                 pAM S
                                  t+T =       0   +    1   pLN D
                                                            s 1 + "t ,




where    pLN D
          s 1 is the London return observed in Amsterdam at time t, and         pAM S
                                                                                 t+T is the


subsequent Amsterdam return over period T , where T ranges from two or three days to four

weeks (estimates for longer horizons yield similar conclusions). This period excludes the

immediate response to news from London (see Figure 2). Tables VI to VIII, Panels B report

the results. Note that the results are restricted to the EIC, BoE and 3% annuities, the only

securities for which frequent price data in London are available. None of these three stocks

exhibit (negative) predictability across markets over any of the time horizons considered.


                                                  23
This suggests that liquidity shocks (or any other sort of transitory price changes) were not

transmitted from London to Amsterdam.

   The above statistical tests may have limited power. It is ex ante unclear over what horizon

returns should revert and the slow execution of liquidity trades could lead to momentum in

the short run, attenuating the reversal estimates. For comparison, Panels A and C of Tables

VI to VIII present estimates of predictability within the Amsterdam and London markets.

For the BoE and 3% annuities, there is evidence of within-market reversals for up to one

week. This result suggests that the tests for reversals have reasonable power. The reversal

estimates are surprisingly similar in magnitude to modern estimates (Tetlock (2010), Table

1 reports a coe¢ cient of around    0:10). There is no evidence of reversal in EIC returns.

   [Tables VI to VIII about here]

   These …ndings seem inconsistent: if it was possible to arbitrage between markets, why

did liquidity shocks only have an impact in the home market? The answer lies in the fact

that, due to communication delays, arbitrage was imperfect. It took at least seven days (the

duration of a round trip) to complete an arbitrage operation. If liquidity shocks a¤ecting

one market were expected to revert within this period (as suggested by the results in Tables

VI to VIII), they should not have a¤ected the other market. Moreover, arbitrage was risky

as prices could change signi…cantly within a week. To illustrate these points, in Section V.E

of the Internet Appendix I examine the distributions of price di¤erences between London

and Amsterdam. The results indicate that price di¤erences narrowed after the arrival of a

boat (more mass around zero) but remained signi…cant. In summary, although it is possible

that English (uninformed) order ‡ow occasionally a¤ected returns in Amsterdam after the

arrival of a boat, the empirical results indicate that in general the e¤ect was small.

                                              24
D. Transaction Data


   It is possible that investors in Amsterdam traded signi…cantly less on days without news.

This would imply that liquidity was signi…cantly lower on days without news and that

minor order ‡ow imbalances could have led to large price reactions. While volume data for

this period are not available to test this conjecture, detailed information is available for a

small sample of transactions in the Amsterdam market, roughly equally divided between

EIC, BoE and SSC stock and the 3% annuities.22 Of the 32 total transactions, only four

transactions, or 12:5%, took place on days with news (9% when value weighted). The average

transaction size of   $1; 500 translates into $150; 000 in today’s money. On average, news

from London reached Amsterdam two times a week. If market participants were indi¤erent

between trading on days with or without news, we would expect that on average 28:6% of

transactions would take place on days with news. This means that there seems to have

been a tendency to trade on days without news. The di¤erence between these percentages is

signi…cant, with a p-value of 0:028 (based on a binomial distribution and a one-sided test).


          IV.     Explaining Volatility in The Absence of News


A. Baseline Estimates


   The results in Table II reveal that Amsterdam responded very strongly to returns in

London after the arrival of a boat. How big was the impact of these boat arrivals on the

volatility of English security returns in Amsterdam? In Section V.F of the Internet Appendix

I present the kernel densities of boat and no-boat returns for the …ve English securities.23

The …gures clearly show that returns are more volatile after the arrival of new information.

                                             25
The distribution of news returns has considerably more mass in the tails.

      Table IX presents the …rst four moments of the return distributions for periods with

(Bt = 1) and without (Bt = 0) a boat arrival. Importantly, the variance of returns is higher

after the arrival of a boat. This results holds for all …ve securities. In addition, the fraction

of zero returns is signi…cantly higher during no-boat periods. The ratio of return variances

var      pAM
          t+d
              S;no   boat
                            =var   pAM
                                    t
                                       S;boat
                                              , is between 0:40 and 0:58 (depending on the security)

and is statistically signi…cantly di¤erent from one.24 Average returns are considerably higher

during periods with a boat arrival, especially for the EIC. This result is consistent with boat

returns being more volatile and thus more risky. The di¤erence in returns is not statistically

signi…cant, however.

      [Table IX about here]

      The volatility of returns in the absence of boats did not depend on whether a no-boat

period was expected. On average there were two boat crossings a week and three price

observations. This means that many no-boat periods were expected. Results in Section

III.A of the Internet Appendix indicate that volatility was no di¤erent if the absence of a

boat was not anticipated.25 In Section V.G of the Internet Appendix, I examine whether

returns in the absence of boats were more volatile if the most recent news from London was

relatively old. This could potentially re‡ect aversion to ambiguity. This is not the case.

Average returns did not di¤er signi…cantly.


B. Roadmap


      What can explain the volatility in the absence of news? The remainder of this section

discusses three possible explanations: delayed response to public news, privately informed

                                                   26
trading, and local liquidity shocks. Before turning to the tests, I brie‡y discuss how these

di¤erent alternatives can be identi…ed.

   To test for the delayed response to public news, I examine the time series properties of

returns in Amsterdam.26 A slow response to news is usually associated with initial under-

reaction, followed by return continuation or momentum (Hong and Stein (1999)). Private

information is identi…ed by the covariance of returns in Amsterdam with contemporaneous

(but as-of-yet unreported) price changes in London after the departure of a boat. Similar to

the example in Figure 1, Panel B, the idea is that private information caused Amsterdam

and London prices to (slowly) move in the same direction, even when there was no direct

information sharing. Finally, I use the covariance of returns within Amsterdam to identify

the (transitory) impact of local liquidity shocks.

   This section also introduces a simple framework to quantify the e¤ect of these di¤erent

factors on the volatility of stock returns. I analyze both days with and without the arrival of

boats. In this decomposition the immediate response to public news on news days, measured

by the covariance between returns in London before the departure of a boat and price changes

in Amsterdam after its arrival, plays an important role. Table X provides a brief overview

of the (potentially) relevant factors. Public news, private information, and local liquidity

shocks can explain virtually all variation in security returns for all but the EIC, for which a

large fraction of no-boat returns remains unexplained. To investigate this further, I take a

closer look at the patterns of return reversals.

C. Slow Response to Public News


      It is not straightforward to identify a slow response to news through return continuation.

In the presence of liquidity shocks returns, will also have a tendency to revert. Simple

autocorrelation coe¢ cients aggregate the two e¤ects, potentially cancelling them out. A

solution to this problem is to di¤erentiate between the continuation (or reversal) of past

London and Amsterdam returns, where the former approximates news shocks and the latter

picks up liquidity shocks. More speci…cally, I conduct the following test. For all returns

in Amsterdam I determine whether a boat arrived from London during the previous period

(Bt    1   = 0; 1). For the cases in which Bt        1   = 1, I estimate



                       pAM
                        t
                           S

                                                                                S;boat
                                                                                       is the Amsterdam news

                                            s 2 (with a slight abuse of notation) is the London news


return observed in Amsterdam during the preceding period. The coe¢ cient                         1   measures

reversals of news returns in Amsterdam. A slow response to news from London implies that

 2   > 0.27

      Table XI presents the regression results. Because London price data only cover the EIC,

BoE, and 3% annuities, the results are restricted to these three securities. I …nd no evidence

of momentum as         2   is close to zero for all three securities. In contrast, and consistent with

results in Tables VII and VIII, I do …nd evidence of reversals for the BoE and 3% annuities.

D. Private Information


   In addition to public news, private information might have been important as well. Re-

search on current markets indicates that informed trading plays an important role (see for

example Hasbrouck (1991), Easley, Kiefer, and O’Hara (1997). Anecdotal evidence suggests

that the 18th century was no di¤erent. English insiders used the London and the Amsterdam

markets to bene…t from their private signals. In addition to public news, the packet boats

transmitted private letters. London insiders would communicate private information to their

agents in Amsterdam and these agents would trade on the information. The historical record

is rife with examples of informed trading (Sutherland (1952), p. 206-208, 228; Van Nierop

(1931), p. 68, Koudijs (2014)). It is likely that such trades set into motion a process of price

discovery that a¤ected prices both after the arrival of a boat and during subsequent periods

without boats. For example, if insiders traded strategically, it would have taken consider-

able time before prices re‡ected a certain piece of information (Kyle (1985); see Glosten and

Milgrom (1985) for an alternative setup). This could explain some of the return volatility in

Amsterdam on the days no boats arrived from England.

   I test this possibility in the following way. Suppose that, after the arrival of private

signals, the insiders’agents in Amsterdam slowly traded on their information. This would

have a¤ected prices both after the arrival of a boat ( pAM
                                                        t
                                                           S;boat
                                                                  ) and during subsequent no-

boat periods ( pAM
                t+d
                    S;no   boat
                                  ). At the same time, the private information also a¤ected the

contemporaneous (but as-of-yet unreported) price change in London ( pLN
                                                                     s
                                                                        D
                                                                          ). That is, the

private signal was slowly incorporated into prices there as well (Figure 2). The co-movement

between returns in Amsterdam after the arrival of a boat and price changes in London after


                                                 29
the departure of that boat should therefore re‡ect the revelation of private information. It is

important to note that this measure of private information excludes the revelation of short-

lived private signals that immediately a¤ected London prices –from the perspective of the

Amsterdam investor, such signals are part of the public news transmitted by packet boats.

three securities, there is a signi…cant correlation between the returns.

   [Table XII about here]

   It is unlikely that these results are driven by the (slow) execution of English liquidity

trades in the two markets. As before, it is natural to assume that liquidity trades have

transitory price impact. If the London agent, who receives the liquidity shock, splits his

trades across London and Amsterdam, we would expect to see reversals across markets. In

particular, London returns    pLN
                               s
                                  D
                                    that re‡ect this liquidity shock should negatively predict

future price changes in Amsterdam that capture the reversal of this shock. The results in

Tables VI to VIII do not support this conjecture.


   These results support the idea that an important part of the return variance is driven



                                                      30
by private information. The presence of informed trading also a¤ects the estimates of the

importance of public information. I quantify the impact of public and private information

using a simple framework. The intuition can be formalized as follows. London price changes

between the departures of two boats are given



                                                 pLN
                                                  s
                                                     D
                                                       =    s   + "s + u s ,



where     s   and "s are public and private signals revealed in London over period s. Innovation

 s   is unknown to all parties at the beginning of period s and is revealed to the public during

the course of the period. Innovation "s is privately observed by an insider at the beginning

of s. For simplicity, I assume that "s is fully revealed to the public by the end of s.28 Public

and private signals          s   and "s are assumed to be independent and iid. Innovation us is a

residual. Throughout, I assume that all innovations are normally distributed.

     Returns in Amsterdam after the arrival of a boat can be expressed as



                                               pAM
                                                t

The variable      t   is a noisy version of private information "s . The insider’s agent in Amsterdam

trades on the private information he has received from London and, by assumption, his

trades are not fully informative. Instead, he generates a signal                     t;   without loss of generality

                                     >   ".   The term   0 t    captures the response in Amsterdam to this

noisy revelation of private information. The Amsterdam news return also responds to public

information et , which consists of public signal               s 1   and that part of private signal "s    1   not yet

Equations (4) and (5) imply that the covariances between Amsterdam and London identify

the importance of public and private information shocks for the overall return variance.

Table XIV below presents the results. I …nd that public information explains between 47%

and 56% of the variance of boat returns. Private information accounts for between 15%

and 39% of the variance of boat returns and between 27% and 39% of the no-boat return

variance.

                                                             32
E. Trading Costs


   It is possible that the volatility of returns in Amsterdam in the absence of boats was

driven by trading costs. Speci…cally, if market makers face order-handling costs or have

limited risk bearing capacity, trades have an impact on prices (see O’Hara (1997) and Biais,

Glosten, and Spatt (2005) for overviews). This could drive the return volatility in the absence

of news.


                                E.1. Order-Handling Costs


   I …rst consider order-handling costs. The Amsterdam market operated through limit

orders and the Amsterdamsche Courant reported the going price of the day. In theory, the

reported price should not re‡ect these direct transaction costs. Nevertheless, it is possible

that there were de facto market makers who charged a bid-ask spread to cover order-handling

costs. During certain days the market might have cleared at either the bid or the ask. This

would have led to a bid-ask bounce that could have contributed signi…cantly to the volatility

of security returns. To analyze this, I estimate a Roll (1984b) model, where order-handling

costs c are given by
                                        p
                                  c=       cov( pt ; pt 1 ),


The return variance that can be attributed to these trading costs is given by var( pt ) = 2c2 .

   Table XIII presents the results for both boat and no-boat periods. The underlying

assumption is that transaction costs do not depend whether a boat arrives. For comparison,

the table also presents the o¢ cial brokers’fees; they are very close to the Roll measures. For

the EIC, the …rst-order autocovariance is positive and the Roll measure cannot be calculated.

                                              33
I therefore estimated the Roll model using a Bayesian approach advocated by Hasbrouck

(2009) that can handle a positive autocovariance. This yields a Roll measure of c = 0:047

with an implied variance of 0:004. I apply Hasbrouck’s approach to the other four securities

as well. Without exception, the Bayesian approach leads to lower Roll measures (and lower

implied variances) for these securities. For comparison, transaction costs on the NYSE

between 1993 and 2005 were approximately twice as large as the (raw) Roll measures in the

1770s and 1780s (Hasbrouck (2009), Table 2).30

   [Table XIII about here]


                                   E.2. Inventory Costs


   The Roll model abstracts from other sources of transaction costs such as inventory costs,

where intermediaries have to be compensated for taking a position in the asset (because of

risk aversion or inventory management). This could be especially relevant in the limit order

setting of the 18th century. If, for example, there are many transactions on one side of the

market, trades will take place deeper in the limit order book, which a¤ects all transaction

prices during the trading day. Consider the following stylized setup. There is a competitive

group of intermediaries that sets prices according to



                                       pt = f t   It ,                                    (6)



where ft is the log fundamental value of the security with ft = ft     1   + ut and It is the

intermediaries’total inventory in the asset. The parameter    captures market makers’risk-




                                             34
bearing capacity. Returns are given by



                                          pt = ut + qt ,                                   (7)



where qt is either a buy or sell order. In practical terms, this setting di¤ers from the Roll

(1984b) model if it takes time for intermediaries to o¤-load their inventory. In that case,

the initial price impact of qt will dissipate slowly and the autocovariance of returns will be

negative at longer lag lengths. The results in Tables VI to VIII provide evidence of negative

autocorrelations for up to one week.

   To analyze the impact on returns, I simulate a simple inventory cost model. Following

Garman (1976) and Ho and Stoll (1981), I assume that orders arrive following


                                        1 with probability    t
                               qt =                                   ,
                                       1 with probability 1       t




where
                                           1
                          t   = min max      + (ft   1     pt 1 ); 1 ; 0 :                 (8)
                                           2

In other words, the probability of a buy or sell order depends on the log-di¤erence between

the asset’s fundamental value and the market price during the previous period. If the asset

is undervalued, it is more likely that a buy order will hit the market and, as a result, prices

will rise. This process generates negative autocorrelation in the order ‡ow and the return

series: a buy order today will drive up prices, making a sell order tomorrow more likely. The

parameter    captures how fast the market responds to mispricing. A low value implies a

longer time before prices move back to fundamentals, leading to negative autocovariances at


                                               35
longer lag lengths. Section V.H of the Internet Appendix illustrates this with two examples,

where    = 1=2 and    2 f1=4; 3=4g.

   I simulate price paths of 10,000 observations for di¤erent values of   and , and compare

the implied autocovariances cov( pt ; pt l ) over di¤erent lag lengths with the actual ones

in the data, again using both boat and no-boat returns (the …rst 1,000 observations for

each simulated price series are dropped). Lag lengths can vary between one and 12 periods,

l 2 [1; 12], where each lag represents two or three days. The longest lag is equivalent to a

period of four weeks. Table XIII presents, for each individual security, the values of   and

  for which the mean squared error is minimized. Section V.H of the Internet Appendix

presents the actual and model-simulated autocovariances for these parameter estimates. For

the EIC, there is no evidence of a negative autocovariance at the …rst two lags, and     =0

provides the best description of the data. For the SSC, the autocovariance of returns is only

negative at a lag length of one, consistent with a relatively large value for . For the BoE

and the two annuities autocovariances are negative at the …rst three lag lengths, and    has

a relatively small value.

   Table XIII above presents estimates of the return variance that this process generates.

These estimates, which are based on the simulated return series, are somewhat higher than

those of the Roll model. As a cross-validation I check these numbers against the (limited)

transaction data available. Of the 32 individual transactions that I could be identify, nine

took place in the absence of boat arrivals, on days for which prices were listed (Mondays,

Wednesdays, and Fridays), and for future contracts with the same maturity as those reported

in the newspaper. For these nine transactions, the mean squared di¤erence between the

transaction and the reported price is 0.079. This estimate is in the same ballpark as the

                                             36
inventory cost model’s implied variance.


F. Summing Up


   Table XIV summarizes the contributions of the di¤erent factors that drive security re-

turns. On days with a boat arrival, between 47% and 56% of the return variance can be

attributed to the arrival of public information. Private information is also of key impor-

tance, explaining about 39% of returns for the EIC, while it explains between 13% and 20%

of returns for the BoE and 3% annuities respectively. Trading costs are estimated to be zero

for the EIC, while they account for between 22% and 25% of the return variance for the BoE

and 3% annuities. For days without a boat, private information accounts for between 26%

and 39% of the return variance. Trading costs are again estimated to be zero for the EIC

and account for between 38% and 54% of the return variance for the other two securities.

Overall, public news accounts for between 36% and 42%, private information for between

17 and 39%, and trading costs for between 0% and 32% of the total return variance. Taken

together, these estimates explain between 82% and 92% of overall price movements.

   [Table XIV about here]

   There is one case with a relatively poor …t. For EIC returns on days without a boat,

more than 60% of the return variance is left unexplained. To investigate this …nding further,

Table XV presents more detailed information about the EIC’s one-period autocovariance.

where Bt 2 f0; 1g indicates whether new information reached Amsterdam in period t. These

regressions test whether return reversals di¤ered if the previous and/or current period fea-

tured the arrival of a boat. To facilitate interpretation, Table XV sums up the di¤erent

interaction coe¢ cients to calculate the total return reversal for each di¤erent scenario. Col-

umn (1) presents the estimates of equation (9), where boat and no-boat returns are allowed

to revert di¤erently (Bt        1   = 0; 1). Columns (2) and (3) present the estimates of equation

(10), where reversals coe¢ cients are also allowed to be di¤erent depending on whether the

current period features the arrival of a boat or not (Bt = 0; 1).

   Table VI provides no evidence of negative autocovariance for the EIC. In Table XV, I …nd

that there are reversals, but only of no-boat returns (Bt                         1   = 0), and only on on news days

(Bt = 1). For comparison, the table also presents estimates for the BoE and 3% annuities.

For the latter, return reversals are also important for no-boat returns, although returns tend

to revert equally strong regardless of whether a boat just arrived. For the BoE, no di¤erences

in reversals are visible.

   [Table XV about here]

   The unexplained volatility of EIC stock on no-boat days may be due to liquidity trades

and adverse selection costs. The analysis of Section E. suggests that trading costs in EIC

                                                           38
stock were practically zero. These calculations yield incorrect results if liquidity trades were

mainly concentrated in periods without a boat arrival. It is possible that due to the presence

of privately informed agents, uninformed traders concentrated their trades in periods without

a boat arrival (Admati and P‡eiderer (1988)). According to Table XIV, 39% of the EIC

return variance on news days was driven by private information. This is signi…cantly more

than for the other securities. In addition, Table XII suggests that privately informed trading

in EIC stock was approximately twice as important on boat days than on no-boat days.

This would have led to additional adverse selection costs on days boats arrived, in which

case uniformed agents may have decided to cluster their trades in no-boat periods. The

price impact of these liquidity trades would have reversed only after the arrival of the next

boat, when uncertainty was resolved, decreasing the risk premium charged by intermediaries.

This interpretation is consistent with the limited trading data available: each of the 11

transactions in EIC stock took place on no-boat days, which is statistically di¤erent (with a

p-value of 0.025) from a random allocation of trades over days with or without a boat arrival

(based on a one-sided binomial test).

   Alternatively, the unexplained volatility of EIC stock on no-boat days could be the result

of sentiment shocks, rumors, or di¤erences of opinion. Under this interpretation, beliefs

would have converged after the arrival of news from England, leading to return reversals.

Since the EIC was by far the most volatile stock of the period, it is possible that sentiment

shocks were most important for this security (Baker and Wurgler (2006); Tetlock (2007)). It

is impossible to di¤erentiate between these two interpretations. The transaction evidence is

not conclusive, since di¤erences in beliefs are generally also associated with higher trading

volume (Harris and Raviv (1993)).

                                    V.      Conclusion

   What are the roles of public news, private information, liquidity trades, and sentiment

shocks in explaining the short-term volatility of stock returns? It is di¢ cult to answer this

question in today’s world of around-the-clock news coverage and instant, long-distance data

exchange. In particular, with news arriving all the time, it is di¢ cult to separate the impact

of news arrival from the trading process.

   The key contribution of this paper lies in the identi…cation of news ‡ows. I examine the

trade of English securities in 18th century Amsterdam. Communication between England

and the Dutch Republic relied on sailboats. This makes it possible to precisely reconstruct

the arrival of news and study stock price movements in the absence of news. Moreover,

interruptions in information ‡ows were exogenous as delays in boat arrival were the result

of adverse winds and other weather conditions, and the arrival of news was unrelated to

developments in the stock market or general economic and political events.

   At the same time, Amsterdam and London, the markets in question, were already quite

developed in the 18th century. For instance, they share many important features of modern

stock markets: a centralized exchange, trade in derivatives (with the ability to short), and a

well-developed system of margin loans to …nance positions. Harrison (1998) further argues

that the return process has changed little over time, leading him to conclude that 18th

century markets were not so di¤erent from the 1990s. The current paper’s estimates of

trading costs and return reversals are also surprisingly similar to modern …gures (compare

Hasbrouck (2009) and Tetlock (2010)). The fact that communication technology itself was

less developed at the time is not particularly relevant. What matters is how markets respond

                                              40
to information, not how that information arrives to the market.31

   The results indicate that the arrival of public information was important: the variance of

returns in Amsterdam was signi…cantly higher after the arrival of boats. Public news explains

about 40% of the overall volatility in Amsterdam. At the same time, price movements in

the absence of boats were considerable. The results suggest that the no boat return variance

can be almost fully explained by private information and liquidity shocks (in approximately

the same proportions). The exception is the EIC – returns in the absence of boat arrivals

remain largely unexplained for this security. It is possible that, due to adverse selection

costs, uninformed agents concentrated their liquidity trades in periods between boat arrivals,

leading to additional volatility. Alternatively, investor sentiment may have shifted during

periods when no new objective information was available.

Panel A presents descriptive statistics for Amsterdam security returns for the two sample periods (1771 to
1777 and 1783 to 1787) as well as the entire 1771 to 1787 period. Two- or three-day log percentage returns
are calculated as log(pt =pt 1 ). panel B provides descriptive statistics for Amsterdam security returns for
non-overlapping two-week periods, based on the data collected by Van Dillen (1931). The table includes a
Brown-Forsythe test statistic on the equality of di¤erent return variances. Panel C summarizes between-
boat periods for the two sample periods. Periods involving a no-boat return are long enough that there is
at least one price change in the absence of news. ***, **, * denote statistical signi…cance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% level, respectively.

  Correlation Between English and Dutch Security Returns in Amsterdam
This tables presents regressions of English security returns on Dutch security returns in Amsterdam.
Returns are for periods without news from London only. VOC: Dutch East India Company; WIC: Dutch
West Indies Company; and Bank money (agio): return on deposit money at the Bank of Amsterdam
relative to cash. Percentage log returns are calculated over two- or three-day periods. Sample periods:
September 1771 to December 1777 and September 1783 to March 1787. ** denotes statistical signi…cance

             The impact of Di¤erent News Categories on EIC Returns
This table presents regression results relating squared Amsterdam EIC news returns to the publication of
relevant capitalized words in articles with news from England published in the Leydse Courant between
September 1771 and December 1777. EIC : East India Company; Finance: …nancial terminology (excludes
“stocks”); India: reference to regions, towns, and/or persons in the British East Indies; Cape: references
to the Cape (of Good Hope Colony); Background: words signalling background information (Section V.B
of the Internet Appendix provides further details). News related to the EIC is captured by two dummy
variables: EIC (1) takes a value of one if the EIC is mentioned once in an article. EIC (>1) takes a value of
one if the EIC is mentioned at least twice. The other news variables are also included as dummies, where a
dummy takes a value of one if a speci…c category is referenced at least once. The “Obs.”column indicates
for how many observations a certain (combination of) dummy(ies) is turned on. Robust bootstrapped (1000
replications) standard errors are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote statistical signi…cance at
the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

This tables presents descriptive statistics for Amsterdam percentage log returns over two- or three-day
periods (denoted t) with or without a boat arrival (Bt = 1 or Bt = 0). Sample periods: September 1771
to December 1777 and September 1783 to March 1787. The equality of the variance of boat and no-boat
returns is tested using a Brown-Forsythe (B-F) test (H0 : ratio = 1). *** Indicates statistical signi…cance

  Summary of Potential Explanations for Price Movements in Amsterdam
This table summarizes the potential factors in‡uencing stock prices in Amsterdam during periods with and
without boat arrivals, making a distinction between factors originating in London or Amsterdam. “Y/N”:
explanation relevant (yes/no) according to empirical evidence. The table reports that there is no evidence
that liquidity or sentiment shocks from London a¤ected prices in Amsterdam. This statement is based on
the assumption that potential liquidity and sentiments shocks should, noticeably, revert at some time in
the future.

                                              Trading Costs
This tables presents estimates of trading costs. Panel A refers to order handling consts. The “fees”indicate
o¢ cial broker’s fees. Fees were 0.125% of a security’s nominal or par value. To arrive at the fees presented
here, the “nominal” fee is multiplied bypthe average security price. Estimates of Roll’s (1984b) "raw"
trading cost measure are given by c =        cov( pt ; pt 1 ). For the EIC, the raw Roll measure cannot be
calculated since the …rst-order autocovariance is positive. The panel therefore also presents estimates using
Hasbrouck’s (2009) Bayesian estimation. The implied variance is given by var( pt ) = 2c2 . Panel (B) refers
to inventory costs and estimates are based on the simple model presented in the main text: pt = ft +
  qt , where qt = f1; 1g with probability f t ; 1     t g, where t = min fmax [1=2 + (ft 1       pt 1 ); 1] ; 0g.
Estimates of and are based on minimizing the mean squared error of the empirical and model-implied
autocovariances (up to 12 lags; four weeks). Section V.F in the Internet Appendix provides a graphical
presentation of the …t of the data and the parameters that minimize the mean squared error. The implied
variance is calculated from the simulated return series.

       Wilson (1941, Appendices B to D) provides the identities of some of these investors. Most of these individuals also owned

stock in the most important Dutch stock of the period, namely, the Dutch East India Company (Dutch National Archives

1.04.02: 7075-7078).

       Anecdotal evidence suggests that trade continued outside these o¢ cial hours in co¤ee shops and in front of the Jewish

synagogue (Van Nierop (1931)).

       The SSC was originally founded to transport slaves from Africa to the Spanish American colonies. These activities never

materialized and, instead, the company functioned predominantly as an investment vehicle in British government debt (Neal

(1990)).

       There were two minor …nancial crises in the period. In June 1772 the default of London speculator Alexander Fordyce

led to some turbulence in …nancial markets in London and Amsterdam. Furthermore, after Christmas 1772 a consortium

of Dutch bankers who had been bulling the market for English stocks defaulted. This led to a short-lived …nancial crisis in

Amsterdam (Wilson (1941)). Omitting these two episodes does not change the results in an important way.

       Neal (1990) uses data reported by Castaing’s Course of the Exchange. Rogers (1902) uses stock prices reported by various

British newspapers.

       The use of log rather than simple returns is motivated by the fact that log returns have less kurtosis, which facilitates



                                                                66
the statistical analysis. Results using simple returns are virtually the same.

       Note that the three-day period includes the weekend. During the 18th century, trading continued during the weekend.

However, trade on Sunday was limited due to the absence of Christian traders. Likewise, Jewish traders did not participate

on Saturdays (Spooner (1983), p. 21). Section V.A of the Internet Appendix indicates that there is no evidence for more or

less volatility over the weekend. I therefore did not scale the three-day weekend return down.

       Note that this period excludes the South Sea bubble of 1720.

       To illustrate, an English freighter ship that tried to reach the Dutch shore on January 6 was blown all the way back to

Eastbourne on the English Channel, over a distance of 182 miles (Rotterdamsche Courant, February 4, 1776).

       I thank Will Goetzmann for this suggestion.

       This analysis follows Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1989), who …nd that many of the largest 50 daily price changes

between 1946 and 1988 are di¢ cult to attribute to speci…c news events. In a similar vein, Fair (2002) identi…es 220 large

intradaily price changes between 1982 and 1999, of which only 69 can be attributed to the arival of relevant new information.

  20
       Dropping all observations for which the newspaper mentions “stocks” does not change the results.

  21
       I discuss the impact of informed in Section IV.D.

  22
       This is based on two sources. The …rst contains trading records of Abraham Cohen de Lara, a Portuguese-Jewish

merchant based in Amsterdam (City Archives Amsterdam 334: 722-723). The second contains information on the liquidation

of securities pledged as collateral in margin loans (City Archives Amsterdam 5075: 10603-10611).

  23
       The Amsterdam EIC return in response to Prime Minister Fox’s speech on November 28, 1783 is omitted in all density

plots, regression estimates, and variance calculations. The corresponding return of -14% is 18 standard deviations from the

mean of the EIC return distribution. If included, this datapoint would largely drive the variance results of the EIC, in which

case these results would not be representative of the full sample.

  24
       Because the return series are nonnormal (see the kurtosis measures in Table IX), a standard F-test on the equality of

variances is not suitable. I follow Boos and Brownie (2004) and use a nonparametric test based on mean absolute deviation

from the median. In particular, I use a Brown-Forsythe (B-F) test.

  25
       See Table IA.I (de…nition A) in Section III.A of the Internet Appendix for details.

and DellaVigna and Pollet (2009).

       There is one problem with the estimation:   pLN D
                                                    s 2 is not a perfect measure of news because returns in London presumably


re‡ect local liquidity shocks as well. This means that equation (1) su¤ers from attenuation bias. Speci…cally,     2   is biased



                                                               67
downwards. Nevertheless, as long as      pLN D
                                          s 2 conveys relevant information, the coe¢ cient should still be positive.

  28
       This setting can accomodate private information that is longer lived (as long as innovations are iid). The corresponding

identi…cation strategy is slightly more complicated and relies on the covariance of Amsterdam returns with returns in London

that take place further into the future. Empirically, these are small and add little to the simple analysis presented here.

  29
       This is the case in the canonical Kyle (1985) and Glosten and Milgrom (1985) models. In Section VI of the Internet

Appendix, I show that the results go through for the more general case in which cov(     t+d 1 ; t+d )   6= 0 for d 2 [1; 7].

  30
       See Biais and Green (2007) for another example where historical trading costs are lower than modern ones.

  31
       It is possible that the market’s response to information itself may have changed. More advanced information technology

could facilitate more e¢ cient information processing. It is not clear that this is the case, however. Bai, Philippon and Savov

(2013) show that even after decades of rapid technological progress, markets have not become more informative. In addition,

the results of this paper indicate that the Amsterdam market was not slow to respond to information.
