                                               ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effect of marginal price on students’ educational investments using rich administrative
data on students at Michigan public universities. Students facing zero marginal price for credits above
the full-time minimum (i.e., 12 credits) attempt and complete about the same average number of credits
as those whose institutions charge per credit. Zero marginal price induces a modest share of students
(i.e., 7 percent) to attempt up to one additional class (i.e., 3 credits) but also increases withdrawals,
resulting in little impact on earned credits or the likelihood of meeting “on-time” benchmarks toward
college completion. Consistent with theory, the moderate impact on attempted credits is largest among
students who would otherwise locate at the full-time minimum, which include lower-achieving and
socio-economically disadvantaged students.

I. Introduction

       Only slightly more than half of recent college entrants graduate within six years (Shapiro

et al., 2013) and time-to-degree has increased particularly for students from low-income families

(Bound, Lovenheim, & Turner, 2012). Such statistics have propelled those in federal, state, and

local policy circles to call for proposals aimed at increasing rates of degree completion and

shortening time-to-degree among college-goers (e.g., National Conference of State Legislatures,

2010). Indeed, recent proposals from the Obama administration suggest tying federal aid to

graduation rates and timely degree completion (Lewin, 2013).

       In the face of such pressure, many institutions have looked at changes in tuition policies

as a means of generating revenue while also maintaining or improving student success. Marginal

price is one potentially important dimension of institutions’ pricing structures about which little

is known. By marginal price, we mean the price students are charged incrementally for each

additional course (or credit) they take in a given semester. Many students only take the minimum

course load to achieve full-time status (i.e., 12 credits), which at most institutions would translate

to earning a Bachelor’s degree in five years or more. At some institutions, the marginal price of

credits taken above 12 is zero; others have a linear, per-credit marginal price for all credit levels.

Indeed, some institutions have adopted “flat” pricing (i.e., zero marginal cost for credits above

12) in explicit expectation that students will respond by attempting and earning more credits and

graduating faster.

       How individuals react to nonlinear price schedules is central to many areas of economics

and policymaking, as proposals in a variety of domains are predicated on the microeconomic

principle that individuals respond to marginal price. The design of the Earned Income Tax Credit

(EITC), many savings and retirement programs, and public health insurance programs all



                                                  2
incorporate nonlinear price schedules to achieve policy goals, as do pricing schedules in many

consumer markets such as phone and energy services.

         Whether and how individuals respond to these marginal incentives remains largely an

open question with recent empirical evidence from other contexts mixed and no evidence from

the setting of education.1 A weak evidence base has not prevented colleges from touting

nonlinear pricing as one solution to colleges’ goals of increasing timely graduation rates. For

example, Adams State in Colorado recently made such a switch from per-credit (linear) to flat

(nonlinear) pricing, citing this shift as the reason average credit hours have increased in just two

years (Mumper, 2012). Similar policy shifts have been observed at Montana State, the University

of Texas, and many other institutions (Baum, Conklin, & Johnson, 2013). However, whether

nonlinear pricing alters students’ investment intensity as predicted by economic theory is not

known.

         This paper is the first to examine the effect of marginal price on educational investment.

We focus on the effect of exposure to a “flat” pricing scheme at university, wherein the marginal

price of additional credits above the full-time minimum is zero, relative to a linear tuition pricing

scheme. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we add to the growing evidence base on whether

individuals respond to the marginal incentives embedded in nonlinear price schedules, albeit in a

new and policy-important context. As human capital investment is one of the most important

economic decisions individuals make, evidence about whether the standard model applies to this

setting is useful. Second, we exploit variation in the pricing structure faced by similar individuals



1
  Saez (2010) finds that the self-employed respond to the first kink in the nonlinear EITC schedule, but the response
to subsequent kinks and for wage and salary workers is minimal. Ito (2013, 2014) finds that electricity and water
consumers respond to average price, not the marginal price embedded in the nonlinear price schedules they face. For
evidence from other settings, see Hausman (1981) for Federal income tax, Friedberg (2000) for retirement savings
plans, Kowalski (2012) for health insurance, Olmstead, Hanemann, and Stavins (2007) for water, and Borenstein
(2012) for energy services. Moffitt (1990) reviews the early literature on nonlinear pricing.

                                                         3
in very similar choice contexts. Much of the previous literature on nonlinear budget constraints

focuses on contexts in which similar individuals face the same price structure (e.g., the Federal

tax code), which creates numerous econometric problems such as the fact that tax rates (and thus

marginal incentives) are endogenous or that individuals with different marginal incentives may

be quite different.2 Third, we provide the first evidence on the effects of a policy that many

higher education institutions and states have turned to as a way to boost timely degree

completion. Identifying effective policies has become critical as federal and state funding is

increasingly tied to graduation rates and timely degree completion (National Conference of State

Legislatures, 2010; Lewin, 2013). Finally, our study informs the revenue consequences of

institutions’ pricing regimes. Public institutions increasingly rely on tuition revenue to supplant

declines in state appropriations and many have avoided across-the-board tuition increases,

instead altering other features of their pricing policies.

         We assess the effect of marginal price using administrative data on all Michigan public

high school graduates in the classes of 2008 through 2011 who attended one of the state’s public

universities. Michigan is a compelling setting to study, as there is substantial policy variation

across very similar institutions, which is not present in other states. Figure 1 depicts the price

schedule at Michigan’s fifteen public universities. Eight charge students per credit taken, while

students at the other seven pay little additional tuition for courses taken beyond the full-time

minimum.3 The subsidy embedded in this non-linear price structure is substantial: 20 percent of

the direct costs of college among those who take five classes in a semester ($740 to $1,260 for

each additional 3-credit course). Though there are some differences in the characteristics of

  Ito (2013, 2014) are exceptions. Moffitt (1990) reviews several of the econometric problems and Saez, Slemrod,
and Giertz (2012) discuss similar issues in the context of taxable income.
3
  Flat pricing institutions typically charge additional tuition beyond some upper threshold (typically 18 credits) and
two charge very modest additional tuition beyond 12 credits.

                                                           4
students attending institutions with per-credit pricing and those with flat pricing (the latter

students typically being a bit more advantaged), there is considerable overlap between these two

groups. For instance, Central Michigan and Western Michigan Universities have identical

interquartile ranges of student ACT scores and similar levels of resources, though different

marginal pricing policies. We rely on this overlap, along with the assumption of selection on a

rich set of observed characteristics, to identify the causal effect of marginal price on credit

accumulation.

        We find that exposure to flat tuition pricing has small to no effect on the average number

of credits attempted or earned in a semester and our results are precise enough to rule out even

small effects (i.e., of a bit less than 1 credit). When we look at the effects of flat tuition pricing

on the share of students meeting various discrete credit thresholds, we see evidence that flat

pricing induces a modest share of students to attempt a few more credits (i.e., up to one course,

or 3 credits, more). Yet, we find little evidence that these additional attempted credits translate

into more earned credits in a semester. Students facing no marginal price are more likely to

withdraw from or possibly fail at least one course. Accordingly, flat pricing is not associated

with increased cumulative credits earned, greater persistence, or reduced time-to-degree, though

estimates of these latter long-term outcomes are admittedly imprecise. As predicted by theory,

we also find the greatest attempted credit response among students who would take the full-time

minimum under linear pricing (students in the bottom of the achievement distribution and those

economically disadvantaged). There is no evidence to suggest that this pricing structure

influences students’ decisions to enroll part- versus full-time, likely because any marginal

pricing effect is swamped by discontinuities in financial aid eligibility or other considerations.

Various approaches to eliminating observed differences – rich controls, sample restrictions,



                                                   5
propensity score re-weighting, exact matching on observables – all suggest similar qualitative

results.

           Our results suggest that eliminating the marginal price associated with credit intensity

will minimally affect students’ rate of progress towards degree and on-time degree completion

and may thus be a non-distortionary way of raising revenue. However, our analysis does not

fully address other possible effects of marginal pricing, including major choice, interest

exploration, financial burden, or academic performance.

           This paper proceeds as follows. The next section discusses previous literature, with a

focus on the relationship between tuition pricing and progress through college. Section III

provides background on university pricing in the Michigan context. Section IV presents a simple

theoretical framework to guide our empirical work and help with the interpretation of results.

Section V describes the data used in the analyses and our empirical strategy. Section VI presents

results on credit-taking and explores their robustness, while Section VII discusses external

validity. Section VIII concludes.

II. Previous Literature

           There is a large body of evidence showing that students’ enrollment, persistence, and

college choices are influenced by net college price. A consensus estimate is that a $1,000 change

in college price (1990 dollars) is associated with a 3 to 5 percentage point difference in

enrollment rates (Kane, 2006; Dynarski, 2003). Evidence on the effect of college price on

persistence and degree completion is rarer, but most studies suggest that persistence and

completion are modestly responsive to prices for at least some groups (Bettinger, 2004; Turner,

2004; Dynarski, 2008; DesJardins & McCall, 2010; Goldrick-Rab et al., 2011; Castleman &

Long, 2013). Price also appears to be a strong predictor of the specific college students choose to



                                                    6
attend (Long, 2004; Jacob, McCall, & Stange, 2013), institution-level enrollment (Hemelt &

Marcotte, 2011), and major choice (Stange, 2012). While suggestive of price response in

educational investment, this literature does not speak to whether students respond to changes in

marginal, as opposed to average, price.

         We are aware of only one study that examines the relationship between marginal pricing

and student outcomes. In a working paper, Bound, Lovenheim, and Turner (2010) found that 4-

year public institutions with per-credit pricing had lower 4-year graduation rates than institutions

with flat pricing. Further, much of the increase in time-to-degree between 1972 and 1992

occurred at institutions that charge on a per-credit basis.4 While suggestive, this relationship may

have a number of explanations other than the causal effect of marginal pricing on student

progression through college.

         At the same time, a number of interventions have been found to increase students’ credit

loads, either intentionally or inadvertently. For instance, the Promise Scholarship in West

Virginia explicitly tied aid to number of credits (and GPA), and resulted in more students taking

15 credits rather than the full-time minimum (Scott-Clayton, 2010). A similar result was found

for a scholarship program at the University of New Mexico (Miller, Binder, Harris, & Krause,

2011). Yet, work on Georgia’s HOPE scholarship, which tied eligibility and retention of funds to

maintaining a 3.0 GPA, found that HOPE reduced the likelihood that students took full course-

loads and increased their propensity to withdraw from classes and divert credits to the summer

(Cornwell et al., 2005).

         Other conditional aid grant programs (often in conjunction with advising or coaching)

have also had impacts on students’ credit loads. For instance, Richburg-Hayes et al. (2009) found


4
 The analysis of per-credit versus flat pricing appeared in two footnotes and was not central to their main analysis
so was dropped in the subsequent published version of the paper.

                                                          7
that a performance-based scholarship at community colleges in New Orleans increased credit

loads, as did an intervention that combined financial incentives and academic support services at

a Canadian university (Angrist, Lang, & Oreopoulos, 2009). At a large Italian university,

Garibaldi, Giavazzi, Ichino, and Rettore (2012) found that charging students extra for taking too

long to graduate speeds up time-to-degree.

         Together, these studies make clear that particular features of scholarship and grant

programs can have appreciable effects (positive or negative) on students’ credit loads and

progression through college. We look at marginal pricing policy as another potential lever

capable of influencing students’ credit loads – and ultimately their rates of college completion

and average time-to-degree. Since the interventions described above often tie awards explicitly

to credit-taking behavior and also typically target select student subgroups, they may not be

indicative of the broader potential effects of marginal pricing.

III. Background on University Pricing in Michigan

         During the 2011-2012 academic year, eight of Michigan’s fifteen public 4-year

universities charged full-time undergraduate students differently based on the number of credits.

In these schools, tuition is a linear function of the number of credits taken, ranging from a low of

$246 per credit at Saginaw Valley State to a high of $421 at Michigan Technological University.

By contrast, the tuition schedule at the other seven institutions has a flat or near-flat range at full-

time status (12 credits). Students at these institutions pay a per-credit amount if part-time, but

almost no additional monetary cost from taking an additional course once they have reached full-

time status.5 The upper limit for which the zero marginal price applies varies from 16 to 18

credits. While per-credit pricing is generally more common at less selective institutions (all of

5
 Appendix Table A1 includes more details about the pricing practices of the fifteen institutions. Two institutions,
UM-Dearborn and UM-Flint, charge a substantially lower per-credit fee ($80) once students reach full-time status.
We characterize these institutions has having “flat” pricing in our analysis.

                                                         8
the state’s community colleges charge per-credit while the state flagship university, University of

Michigan – Ann Arbor, does not), this is not always the case. Further, some institutions have

explicitly adopted flat pricing models to encourage students to take 15 credits, while others have

switched from the use of flat pricing to charging per credit (e.g., Ferris State in 2008-2009).

       Tuition fees apply to any credits attempted in a semester after the course “drop date,”

regardless of outcome of the course (pass, fail, withdrawal, etc.). Students are generally given

one or two weeks to withdraw from classes while still receiving a full (or near full) refund of

tuition and fees. There does not seem to be any systematic difference in these policies by pricing

practice. Flat-pricing institutions in Michigan do not appear to be disproportionately more

generous (or strict) in their refund polices than do their per-credit pricing peers.

       Marginal pricing is just one feature of pricing policies at these institutions. During the

2011-2012 academic year, seven charged differentially based on undergraduate level and three

charged differently for certain programs or majors (Presidents Council, State Universities of

Michigan, 2011). In this regard, Michigan institutions have pricing policies that are quite similar

to institutions nationally (Cornell Higher Education Research Institute, 2011; Ehrenberg, 2012).

IV. Theoretical Framework

       We adapt a standard static (single-period) labor supply model to our setting in which the

tuition pricing schedule creates a kinked budget constraint on school intensity choice. We also

briefly sketch extensions to this basic model and discuss their implications.

       A. Single-period model

       Individual utility depends positively on lifetime consumption c and on time spent not in

school, n. Thus school attendance incurs effort cost. Individuals choose time spent in school, z, to




                                                  9
maximize utility u(c,n) subject to a nonlinear budget constraint and a standard time constraint.6

The budget constraint states that consumption equals the sum of endowed income (I) and lifetime

earnings minus tuition:                                 . In the single-period model, we simplify things by

assuming that each increment of schooling increases earning potential by a fixed amount w, thus

              . This simplification allows us to abstract from effects of nonlinearities in the returns

to college education and to focus on schooling decisions in a single period.7 Tuition is a

nonlinear function of credit load:

                                                                                       ,

where typically              .8 Together these elements generate the nonlinear budget constraint

depicted by the solid line in Figure 2. Below z* (i.e., the full-time minimum credit load), each

increment of schooling investment increases lifetime consumption by (w -                        ). Above z*, the net

return to each unit of investment is higher and thus the “price” of non-school time is also higher.

The dashed line depicts a linear (per-credit) tuition schedule.

         How individuals respond to nonlinear budget constraints is complex, as reviewed in

Moffitt (1990). One finding is that a policy shift from a linear (dashed) to flat (solid) pricing

schedule will generate quite heterogeneous responses across students. Students that would locate

at z* when facing a linear pricing schedule (denoted by B) experience only a substitution effect

(non-school time has become more expensive) and would be predicted to increase their credit

intensity. However, students initially choosing to enroll beyond the full-time minimum (denoted

by A) also experience an income effect, thus the net effect for this group is ambiguous. Part-time

6
  The time constraint is that total time spent in (z) and out (n) of school equals total time available, H: n + z = H.
7
  Stange (2012) discusses the evidence on and implications of nonlinearities in returns and the dynamic nature of
schooling investment. Ignoring the nonlinearities in returns is like ignoring “career concerns” in labor supply
models, letting us treat schooling decisions made in different time periods independently. We discuss below how
relaxing these assumptions may impact our results.
8
  We also ignore any increased marginal tuition for very high credit loads (typically 17 or 18 credits).

                                                           10
students who would locate below z* when pricing is linear (denoted C) will either remain on the

first segment (zero response) or switch segments by increasing credit loads above full-time.9 This

simple budget set analysis suggests that response may be greatest for students who otherwise

would choose to locate at the full-time minimum. In fact, continuous preferences would predict

we observe a “hole” in the density of students at the non-convex kink B. Our empirical analysis

explores this heterogeneity by stratifying our sample by students’ predicted credits (based on

baseline characteristics) when faced with a linear pricing scheme.

           B. Extensions

           The model described above omits four potentially important features of postsecondary

schooling: investment over time, nonlinear returns, uncertainty, and investment “lumpiness.”

           Investment over time. Extending the analysis to more than one period, by itself, has little

impact on our qualitative predictions. Suppose earnings are linear in total credits accumulated

over multiple periods. If pricing is also linear, then the well-known consumption smoothing

result prevails; students will choose the same credit load in each period. However, the

introduction of nonlinear pricing separately in each period means that three possible outcomes

satisfy the first-order conditions. Some students will choose equal credit loads across all periods

at zlow, below full-time status (on the lower segment of the budget constraint). Others will choose

equal credit loads across all periods at zhigh, above full-time status. Some may also find it optimal

to choose zhigh in one period and zlow in another if this switching equilibrium dominates either of

the constant ones. That is, utility may be maximized by exerting the extra effort cost and

achieving the higher marginal return for one (but not all) periods.10 As with the one-period


9
    Facing the new pricing schedule, there will be some people that are indifferent between the two segments.
10
     A switching optimum with z1 = zlow and z2 = zhigh will satisfy the FOC as long as            . Whether this
dominates the constant-credit outcomes depends on the utility function.

                                                            11
model, switching from a linear to flat pricing schedule will have the greatest impact on credits

taken (in either period) for those who would otherwise locate at the full-time minimum.

         Nonlinear returns. Perhaps the most controversial simplification of the model described

above is that it assumed each course credit increases lifetime earnings by the same increment.

This simplification permitted us to focus on the nonlinearities created by tuition policies.

However, there is evidence that the return to college education is nonlinear due to strong

“sheepskin” effects. The final credit earned to complete a degree has a much higher return than

the first few credits earned toward the same degree. First consider a one-period model where

each increment of schooling increases earning potential by a fixed amount w up to a threshold

level , at which point earnings jump by a discrete amount                  and are constant thereafter. Thus

                                                           . In this case, the nonlinear return will dominate

intensity decisions. Students will bunch precisely at the              since it will never be optimal to choose

a level z       .11 Thus many students (who otherwise choose enough credits to achieve the

nonlinear return) will be unaffected by a shift from linear to flat pricing. However, the shift will

draw more people into the return kink, inducing them to acquire the degree. Again, those on the

margin of graduating should be most impacted by this marginal price change. This same logic

applies to the setting with multiple time periods, nonlinear returns, and no uncertainty. Since

credits earned in different time periods are perfect substitutes in the earnings production

function, students’ choice problem is similar in all periods. Thus decisions will be similarly

sensitive to marginal price in earlier or later time periods.

         Uncertainty. The model assumes that people choose credit loads with perfect foresight

about future preferences (e.g., effort costs), credit completion, enrollment, and degree


11
   If we permit additional credits beyond   to increase earnings, some students will locate at   , but there will
still be a mass of students at .

completion. Uncertainty along these dimensions alters the choice environment as it is resolved

over time. For instance, freshmen may be uncertain about future life events that may cause them

to drop out, enroll part-time, or otherwise switch budget constraint segments next year. Since the

payoffs to current decisions depend, in part, on these uncertain future outcomes, current choices

will be less responsive to price parameters when uncertainty is greatest, such as in the earliest

years. Students in later years of college, facing less uncertainty, should respond more sharply to

changes in price schedule.

         Investment lumpiness. Lastly, the above discussion treats schooling intensity as

continuous, though in practice the number of credits is finite and “lumpy” as most classes are

worth either 3 or 4 credits. Such adjustment costs have been found to mute responses to

nonlinear incentives in other contexts (Chetty et al., 2011).

V.       Data and Empirical Approach

         A. Data and Samples

         We combine student-level data from several different administrative sources. From the

Michigan Consortium for Education Research (MCER), we begin with information on the entire

universe of Michigan public high school graduates from 2008 through 2011. These data include

demographic information (sex, race, ethnicity, free and reduced-price lunch eligibility (FARM),

LEP, special education), 11th grade achievement scores,12 and high school. We then use data

from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) to restrict our sample to students appearing in

college (anywhere up to August 2012).13



12
   For these classes, we use a students’ composite ACT score since the ACT became a mandatory part of Michigan’s
high school testing in 2007.

coverage is quite high (i.e., between 95 and 97 percent), and highest among 4-year public institutions (100 percent).

                                                         13
       To examine credit accumulation at Michigan public institutions, we next merge these

records of college-going Michigan high school graduates onto data from the Michigan Student

Transcript and Academic Record Repository (STARR). STARR contains full, historical

transcript records (course-level data) for all individuals enrolled in 2-year or 4-year public

colleges in Michigan in the 2011-2012 academic year. While the state of Michigan mandated the

collection of the entire transcripts of students enrolled at any Michigan public college during that

year, there is some (small) variation in the degree to which institutions supplied course-taking

information from prior years. Therefore, we focus on STARR data from the Fall of 2011 and

Spring of 2012. These semesters occur at different points in an “on-time” college trajectory for

students, depending on the year of their high school graduation. For example, the 2011-2012

academic year corresponds to the on-time third year of college for the high school class of 2009.

Therefore, we examine whether students’ postsecondary persistence (and relatedly, the

composition of our sample) is related to flat pricing.

       Our main analytic sample includes students from these high school cohorts (i.e., 2008

through 2011) who are enrolled full- or part-time in a Michigan public 4-year institution during

the fall and/or spring of the 2011-2012 academic year. This results in 212,320 student-by-

semester observations (over 112,000 unique students) across all high school cohorts. For some

analyses we restrict our sample to only full-time students (194,391 observations) or to students

not attending the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor (187,707 observations for all students;

170,466 full-time).

       Table 1 presents mean demographic and achievement characteristics, as well as college-

level credit outcomes for this sample by institutional pricing structure. There are some small to

moderate differences in the average characteristics of students attending per-credit versus flat



                                                 14
pricing institutions. Generally speaking, students attending flat pricing schools are more

advantaged (less likely to be eligible for free or reduced-price meals, less likely to be minority)

and have higher college admissions scores. Though, as illustrated by the final two columns in

Table 1, the achievement advantage of students at flat schools is largely driven by the fact that

the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor uses a flat tuition pricing schedule.

        When we look to mean outcomes by pricing policy, we see that on average, credit loads

of students at flat schools are a bit higher than those at per-credit schools. Indeed, the share of

students attempting more than 12 credits in a semester is about 8 to 12 percentage points higher

at flat schools than at per-credit institutions. Some mean differences vary more than others as a

function of the sample: For example, the share earning 15 or more credits in a semester is about

11 percentage points higher at flat colleges; but, when the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor

is excluded from the sample, this difference falls to only 3 percentage points. Obviously, these

raw differences in means do not control for other attributes of students and schools that are likely

correlated with course-taking behavior and progress through college.

        B. Empirical Approach and Identification Strategy

        Our basic approach is to compare the credits taken by students attending “flat” pricing

schools (at which the marginal price is zero for credits above the full-time minimum) to those

attending per-credit pricing schools using a linear probability model estimated via OLS:

                                                                                                    (1)

        In this specification,        is a measure of credits attempted or earned by individual i from

cohort c attending school j during semester t. Our primary outcome variables are total credit load

and indicators for attempting or earning a credit load greater than certain thresholds (e.g., at least

13 credits or at least 15 credits).        is an indicator for whether school j has flat pricing,         is


                                                    15
a vector of student-level measures of achievement and demographics during high school,                       is a

set of semester fixed effects,       represents cohort fixed effects, and            is a stochastic error

term. Some specifications control for a limited number of institution-level covariates                   . The

primary coefficient of interest is       , the effect of flat pricing on student credit-taking. To account

for correlation in the errors among students at the same college, we cluster standard errors at the

institution level.14

        We address three main possible sources of bias in the basic model. First, students

attending “flat” schools may possess different characteristics that are correlated with college

performance than those attending per-credit schools. While this is certainly true overall, it is

worth noting that there is considerable student overlap on observable characteristics across

institutions. Figure 3 depicts the inter-quartile range of ACT scores for all fifteen institutions.

With the exception of the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor (a flat pricing school), every flat

school has several non-flat schools with considerable test score overlap. Further, we control for a

rich array of student-level characteristics. Our sample size permits us to do this extremely

flexibly by, for instance, looking within student groups defined very narrowly by full interactions

between these characteristics. In addition, we estimate models that instrument for pricing

structure using the policy of the nearest university to students’ high schools.

        Second, it is theoretically possible that additional financial aid would offset the additional

tuition and fees associated with additional credits, diminishing the treatment. Grant programs

may explicitly increase in value as number of credits increase or cost-of-attendance could be

adjusted upwards (increasing eligibility) when additional credits are taken. Max Pell amount


14
  Our main estimates account for the potential lack of independence between students attending the same college by
estimating cluster-robust standard errors that generalize the White (1980) heteroskedasticity-robust OLS standard
errors. Given concerns in the literature about the performance of such clustering when the number of clusters is
small (Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller, 2008), we also examine alternative methods for statistical inference.

                                                       16
increases discretely at quarter-time, half-time, three-quarters-time, and full-time, but does not

increase in value beyond 12 credits. Further, most students are receiving the maximum Pell

grant, so increases in their costs of attending will not increase the amount of grant aid for which

they are eligible. We are not aware of any institution, state, or federal programs that explicitly

increase aid for additional credits taken beyond 12.

       Finally, it is possible that schools’ pricing schemes coincide with other college-level

attributes or policies that may influence outcomes, such as resources or advising. Our focus on

one sector in one state eliminates many institutional differences that correlate with pricing

structure nationally, but we cannot entirely rule out this possibility. We have four approaches for

addressing it. First, we include an institution-level control for median ACT composite scores of

incoming freshman or for per-student spending on instruction. Second, we examine differences

in credit-taking among students taking less than a full-time load (whose behavior should be

minimally affected by the pricing scheme for full-time students) as a falsification test. Third, we

exclude University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, which is an outlier both in terms of student

characteristics and institutional resources. Finally, we can identify students eligible to receive the

Kalamazoo Promise scholarship, which pays all tuition and fees at public Michigan institutions.

These students should be insensitive to marginal price and thus serve as a control group in a

difference-in-differences analysis, permitting us to account for other non-price institutional

factors that may be correlated with both marginal pricing policies and credit-taking outcomes.

       It is worth contrasting our simple approach to those employed in other settings with non-

linear pricing. Often similar individuals face the same price structure (e.g., the Federal tax code),

which creates numerous econometric problems. For instance, since tax rates are determined by

income, marginal incentives are endogenous and individuals with different marginal incentives



                                                 17
may be quite different. A number of empirical strategies have been developed for these settings,

such as measuring “bunching” at budget set kinks (Saez, 2010), instrumenting for tax rates using

changes in the tax rate structure (reviewed in Saez, Slemrod, and Giertz, 2012), or structural

approaches (Hausman, 1985). Relative to these other methods, our setting permits a very

transparent comparison between observably identical students that face quite different marginal

incentives.15

VI.      Results

         A. Distribution of Credits Attempted and Earned

         Figure 4 plots the fraction of all students at or above each credit threshold, separately by

pricing policy for our full sample. We see little difference in the distribution of credits taken (and

earned) by part-time students regardless of pricing policy – but, modest differences emerge right

at the point where the marginal price diverges between the two sets of institutions (i.e., 12

credits). Students that face no marginal tuition price of a heavier course load are more likely to

take (and possibly earn) credits beyond the full-time minimum. At first glance, these patterns

suggest that marginal pricing policy may have some impact on course-taking and credit

accumulation.

         B. Main Results

         The raw difference reported in Figure 4 may overstate the true causal effect of flat pricing

because students attending flat pricing schools are slightly more higher achieving and

advantaged, which likely have independent effects on course-taking. Table 2 presents our main

regression estimates, which control for a rich set of individual covariates and median institution-



15
  We assume that students do not choose a university based on the marginal pricing policy conditional on our rich
set of individual controls. A two-stage least squares approach using the pricing policy of the nearest university also
addresses this source of bias, though our 2SLS estimates are imprecise.

                                                          18
level ACT scores.16 In this table and throughout much of the paper we focus on full-time

students. Flat pricing does not appear to impact the decision to enroll full-time (i.e., 12 or more

credits) and the inclusion of part-time students does not meaningfully change our point estimates

for any outcome (columns 4 and 8).17 However, including part-time students reduces precision

by adding residual variation to our outcomes.

         We see minimal evidence of an impact of flat pricing on average credits attempted and

even less evidence that flat pricing affects average credits earned. This conclusion is robust to

institutional controls and excluding University of Michigan – Ann Arbor from the sample.

Further, the estimates are quite precise and our standard errors on these null findings imply that

we could detect an effect of around 0.5 to 0.6 credits attempted or earned.

         However, flat tuition pricing is associated with an increase in the likelihood that students

attempt at least 13 credits (more than the full-time minimum) of about 7 or 8 percentage points

(relative to a base of 80 percent). Since estimates at both the 13 and 15 attempted credit

thresholds are similar, this implies that these students are attempting about 3 additional credits,

or approximately one course.18 Student must earn 15 credits each semester in order to graduate

within four years. However, the impact of flat pricing on earned credits is much weaker (i.e., half

the magnitude or less of the effect on credits attempted), sometimes “wrong-signed,” and


16
   The coefficients on the individual covariates are as expected from previous literature: male, non-white, poor,
limited English, special education, and students with low ACT all attempt fewer credits. Including many subject
tests rather than the ACT composite produces nearly identical results, quantitatively and qualitatively.
17
   The null effect on full-time status also provides as a falsification check: given financial aid and other
discontinuities at the full-time threshold, flat pricing should not induce many part-time students to enroll full-time. If
we were to find an “effect” of flat pricing at this margin, we might be concerned about other unobserved, college-
level attributes correlated with both flat pricing and students’ credits load decisions driving any other results.
18
   We also used the re-weighting approach described by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996) to construct
counterfactuals of the entire distributions of credits attempted and earned, weighting students at per-credit schools to
mirror the observable characteristics of students at flat-pricing institutions. This procedure produces very similar
results: Marginal price has its largest effect on the likelihood of attempting up to 15 credits, but has a much more
modest impact on the likelihood of earning credits. Furthermore, there are only small (and insignificant) differences
in the distribution of credits attempted and earned by less-than-full-time students. These results are available from
the authors upon request.

                                                           19
insignificant. Therefore, additional attempted credits do not appear to translate into more credits

earned.

           The inability to translate attempted credits into earned ones is largely explained by course

withdrawal and, to a lesser extent, course failure. Table 3 examines effects on course withdrawal

and failure, both for all students and just full-time students. In a given semester, flat pricing

increases the likelihood that students withdraw from at least one class by about 7 percentage

points and the likelihood of course failure by 3 to 4 percentage points. Since students at flat

pricing schools do not bear the financial cost of enrolling in a course and withdrawing after the

drop deadline, they appear to do so much more frequently.19 The effect on course failure

suggests one of two things: a) some students may simply stop showing up and never withdraw

from a class, when doing so imposes no direct financial cost (even if course failure has other

consequences); or b) students perform more poorly because of too heavy a credit load. Since

effort is not observed, our data do not permit us to separately identify these two channels.

Regardless, these findings suggest that the increased likelihood of course withdrawal (and to a

lesser extent failure) is what dampens the impact of flat pricing on credits earned.

           C. Robustness

           Table 4 examines the robustness of our main findings to various changes in sample,

specification, institutional controls, and statistical inference. Our full sample includes all college

students enrolled in 2011-2012, including students that have chosen to persist beyond the first

year. This may introduce sample selection bias if marginal price impacts persistence. Yet,

estimates focused on just freshmen (2011 high school graduates) are quite similar (column 2) to

the full sample for all outcomes.



19
     Estimates from models which include UM-AA or do not control for institution-level ACT are similar.

                                                         20
         Having data on the full universe of all students in public universities in the state permits

us to control for individual characteristics quite flexibly. Controlling for individual ACT score

non-linearly (column 3)20 or including separate fixed effects for the large number of

demographic groups defined by the six-way interaction of ACT score (each single point

separately), female, race/ethnicity, FARM, LEP, and special education status (column 4)

produces estimates that are nearly identical to our baseline specification.21

         The next two columns attempt to address the possibility that institutions with flat pricing

may differ along other dimensions that may influence course-taking. Controlling for instructional

spending (rather than institution-level ACT score) does not alter our findings (column 5) on

credits attempted or earned. Specification (6) uses eligibility for the Kalamazoo Promise (KP)

Scholarship to construct difference-in-difference estimates as a way to control for institutional

characteristics (observed and unobserved) that may correlate with pricing policy and students’

credit-taking behavior. Since KP-eligible students do not pay tuition, they should be insensitive

to the marginal pricing structure of the institution they attend, but would be affected by other

college characteristics and policies. Their responsiveness to flat pricing can be used to net out the

effects of these unobserved institutional characteristics.22 The specification includes an indicator

for Not KP-eligible, an interaction between Flat and Not KP-eligible, and institution fixed

effects. Column (6) reports the coefficient on this interaction. Since Kalamazoo graduates are


20
   That is, we include a dummy variable for each individual value of the ACT.
21
   To address the possibility that students may choose to attend flat-pricing institutions based on unobservable
student characteristics, we also estimated 2SLS models in which we instrumented for flat pricing of institution
attended with the pricing policy of the university closest to a student’s high school. Point estimates are about two-
thirds the size of base model estimates (i.e., about a 5 percentage point impact on the likelihood a student attempts
13 or more credits), but substantially less precise (standard errors double). These results are qualitatively in line with
our overall pattern of findings. Results are available from the authors upon request.
22
   As described by Bartik and Lachowska (2012), the KP provides a scholarship that covers up to 100% of all tuition
at public universities and colleges in Michigan, depending on how long a student was enrolled in Kalamazoo Public
School system. The scholarship was announced in 2005, so all students from KPS in our study were potentially
eligible.

                                                           21
quite different in characteristics and the institutions they attend from students generally, the latter

are re-weighted to resemble Kalamazoo graduates (via the use of a first-stage logistic regression

where we estimate the likelihood a student is KPS eligible as a function of our vector of student-

level characteristics and institution fixed effects). For attempted credits, this specification is very

consistent with our earlier results. However, here we find evidence that a modest share of

students translate additional attempted credits into earned ones. Yet, we caution against reading

too deeply into this result as this specification (largely) identifies a treatment effect by comparing

credit-taking behavior of KP-eligible students to non-KP-eligible students at just two institutions:

Michigan State University and Western Michigan University. 23 In addition, Kalamazoo high

school graduates look quite different than the average student in our full sample: they are more

likely to be black and eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Broadly, this specification

assuages fears that our approach to estimating the effects of flat pricing on students’ credits loads

is substantially biased by unobserved, omitted characteristics of colleges that correlate with both

flat pricing and students’ course-taking behavior.

        Finally, we examine alternative inference methods. Clustering standard errors at the

college-by-cohort level increases precision considerably. Implementing the wild bootstrap

procedure suggested by Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) reduces precision for some

outcomes, but not for attempting more than 12 credits or for likelihood of withdrawal.

        D. Heterogeneity

        Our theoretical framework suggests that students who would otherwise locate at the full-

time minimum of 12 credits would be most strongly affected by flat pricing. Such students

experience only a substitution effect (non-school time has become more expensive) and are

23
  Nearly half of KP-eligible Kalamazoo students attend Western Michigan University, representing 64 percent of all
KP-eligible students at flat institutions. Two-thirds of KP-eligible students at per-credit schools attend Michigan
State University.

                                                        22
unambiguously predicted to increase their credit intensity. In fact, we should observe a “hole” in

the density of students at the full-time minimum at flat-pricing schools if credit intensity were

truly continuous. Since we cannot know the credit load that students at flat schools would choose

when faced with linear pricing, we use students at per-credit schools with identical observed

characteristics to form this counterfactual. We create a large number of mutually exclusive

student groups defined by the six-way interaction of ACT score (each single point separately),

female, race/ethnicity, FARM, LEP, and special education status. Within each of these groups

we compare the credits attempted (earned) between students at per-credit and flat-pricing

schools. Figure 5 shows these results graphically (and includes all students, part-time and full-

time).24 Groups are ordered according to the average number of credits attempted (earned) at per-

credit institutions so that those furthest left are the groups most likely to attempt (earn) close the

full-time minimum.25 The vertical distance provides an estimate of the effect of flat pricing for

each group. These comparisons are among very similar students (e.g., among black non-special-

education non-LEP females who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals and scored a 23 on

the ACT).

         Consistent with the theory, we find that estimated treatment effects on credits attempted

are largest for those students closest to the full-time minimum: students at flat schools attempt

about one credit more, on average. Treatment effects diminish somewhat, as we move up the

distribution of average attempted credits. Effects on credits earned are even smaller and close to

zero for all but the bottom third of groups. This suggests that our main results are indeed being

driven by impacts on credits attempted for those students who would locate near the 12-credit


24
  The pictures are similar and the conclusions unchanged if we limit our sample for Figure 5 to full-time students.
25
  The x-axis simply counts the number of student groups graphed where groups are ordered by the average credits
taken in per-credit schools. Only groups containing at least 50 students in each type of school are shown in Figure 5,
though the pattern is unchanged if more groups are included.

                                                         23
threshold under a per-credit pricing scheme. Students in the bottom 20 demographic subgroups

in Figure 5 are overwhelmingly black (90%), FARM (40%), have an average ACT composite

score of 16.4, and attempt 12.1 credits; while students in the top 20 demographic subgroups are

non-black, non-FARM, score an average of 27.9 on the ACT, and attempt an average of 14.3

credits. We repeated our regression analysis separately by quintile of predicted credits attempted

based on student characteristics with similar results.26

         We also explored heterogeneity in our regression framework by explicitly contrasting

effects by observable characteristics, such as sex, eligibility for free or reduced-price meals, and

unique ACT score. This heterogeneity analysis was motivated by evidence of differential effects

of other interventions for women versus men (e.g., Anderson, 2008), the overtaking of men by

women in college entry and completion (Goldin, Katz, & Kuziemko, 2006), and the stronger

response by low-income students to college prices relative to their more advantaged peers (Kane,

1994; Dynarski, 2002). These results (reported in Appendix Table A3) are very consistent with

the pattern depicted in Figure 5: effects of flat pricing remain concentrated along the margin of

attempted (not earned) credits and withdrawal and are largest for poor and male students. These

are precisely the students who disproportionately populate the bottom demographic subgroups in

Figure 5.




26
   These results are presented in Appendix Table A2. To construct quintiles we estimate a first-stage regression
using data only on students at per-credit institutions where the outcome is credits attempted and the only covariates
are student-level characteristics. We use coefficients from this model to predict the number of credits attempted for
all students in our analytic sample and divide students in quintiles based on this prediction. Students in the bottom
quintile are those closest to the 12-credit, full-time benchmark. Given recent concerns about the potential for this
process to introduce systematic errors in the extremes of the prediction distribution, thereby biasing subgroup
treatment effects (Abadie, Chingos, & West, 2013), we only include subgroups with more than 50 students per cell
in Figure 5. In addition, our main sample sizes are quite large, mitigating bias-causing errors due to over-fitting in
this prediction-based approach to exploring heterogeneity (Abadie, Chingos, & West, 2013, p. 4).

                                                          24
        E. Interpreting the Effects of Flat Pricing

        To examine effects of flat pricing on course-taking behavior by subject, we characterize

each course taken into one of 12 broad subject areas based on CIP codes (available at some

institutions), academic department/subject, and/or course title. Figure 6 illustrates our findings

graphically. The left bar depicts the mean number of credits attempted in each subject area by all

students at per-credit schools in the 2011-2012 academic year. The average course load includes

about one course each in Humanities/English and Social Science and two or three other courses

collectively across the other ten subjects. The right bar adds to this our subject-specific estimated

treatment effect of flat pricing. Though students at flat pricing schools do take slightly more

credits in these two main areas, the difference is modest and not statistically significant. Students

at per-credit schools take more credits in Other Professional/Technical subjects, which appears to

be driven by more credit-taking in communications and journalism at these schools. In results

not reported, we found that additional credits are not disproportionately in subjects we categorize

as “non-degree-related” and that there is little systematic substitution from 3- to 4-credit

courses.27 We conclude that the additional courses students are induced to take in response to a

subsidized marginal price are not substantively different than their typical courses and, if

anything, are in the core subjects of Humanities/English and Social Science.

        F. Long-term Outcomes

        We now explore the impact of marginal pricing on the longer-term outcomes of

persistence and credit accumulation. We track entry into and persistence through postsecondary

education using the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). For each member of the high school


27
  Results available from authors upon request. “Non-degree-related” includes CIP codes 31 through 37, including
Parks, Recreation, and Leisure Studies, Basic Skills/Remedial, Citizenship Activities, Health-related Knowledge and
Skills, Interpersonal and Social Skills, Leisure and Recreational Activities, and Personal Awareness and Self-
Improvement.

cohorts of 2008 through 2011, we identify students (of any intensity) that enrolled in a Michigan

public 4-year university in the fall term immediately following high school graduation. 28 Figure

7 plots the fraction of these students enrolled in any college (Panel A) or a MI public 4-year

university (Panel B) over time, separately by high school cohort and the pricing policy of the

first institution attended. Across all institutions, 96% of students attend any college (including

Michigan universities, community colleges, and private colleges) in their second semester,

though enrollment drops to 83% by the start of the fourth academic year. Comparable rates for

enrollment at a Michigan public university are 93.6% and 72%, respectively.

         Rates of persistence beyond the first year at any college are slightly higher for students

starting at institutions with flat (rather than per-credit) pricing. However, rates of persistence at

Michigan public universities are considerably higher among students starting at flat-pricing

schools (Panel B). These raw persistence patterns do not control for the characteristics of

students. When we control for such traits, students at flat institutions have lower rates of

persistence than would be predicted by their individual traits.29 Thus we find little evidence that

flat pricing improves students’ rates of persistence, either overall (at any institution) or at MI

public universities.

         We now directly examine impacts on credits accumulated over several years. Recall that

STARR data contain information about all courses taken in 2011-2012 and in all prior terms,

among students still enrolled in the 2011-2012 academic year. Thus for all students in the 2008,

2009, and 2010 cohorts that persist to 2011-2012, we calculate cumulative credits attempted and


28
   This sample includes 116,581 individuals, approximately 29,000 students from each of these four cohorts. Very
few students enter one of these institutions in the spring term, so the fall enrollment restriction is not too binding.
Students that delay entry into or eventually transfer to a Michigan public university from private or community
colleges are also excluded to ensure that the sample is similar across cohorts, given that later cohorts would
mechanically have few delayed or transfer entrants.
29
   Appendix Table A5 presents regression results that control for individual and college characteristics when looking
at persistence.

                                                          26
earned as of Spring 2012. We make two important sample restrictions. First, we restrict our

analysis to students enrolled (at least part time) in any Michigan public 4-year college in all fall

and spring semesters since high school graduation (as indicated by the NSC).30 This restriction

permits us to abstract from students’ decisions to persist and instead focus on credits

accumulated among those that have decided to persist in all periods.31 Second, we only keep

students with complete consistency between their NSC and STARR records. 32 This restriction

assures we accumulate all credits attempted and earned by an individual.33

         In Table 5 we analyze cumulative credits attempted, cumulative credits earned, and

whether cumulative credits earned are above the threshold for on-time, all as of Spring 2012.

Since these on-time thresholds differ by student level (sophomore, junior, senior), we present

estimates separately by cohort. Overall, we find little evidence that flat pricing encourages

students to attempt or accumulate more credits over time. On average, students have attempted

58.3 credits and earned 54.9 by the end of their second year in college, but there is little

difference between students at per-credit and flat pricing institutions. Nor are students at flat

institutions more likely to have earned 60 credits, a marker for graduating within four years.34

Results for the 2009 and 2008 cohorts are qualitatively similar: the typical student is attempting

and earning fewer credits than the on-time benchmark and there is minimal difference between

students at flat and per-credit schools. Any modest average attempted credit advantage seen
30
   So members of the high school class of 2008 (2009, 2010) must be enrolled in a MI public university for all 8 (6,
4) fall and spring terms since high school graduation.
31
   Further, our intention is to construct markers of on-time credit accumulation that are only relevant for students
that have already chosen to enroll. Given the minimal impact on persistence, we do not believe this restriction
creates grave concerns about sample selection bias.
32
   Though NSC-STARR consistency is quite high in the 2011-2012 academic year (98%, similar for flat and per-
credit schools), it deteriorates in earlier years and becomes slightly worse at per-credit institutions. Thus results for
the 2008 and 2009 cohorts that rely on historical data (such as cumulative credits) should be interpreted with some
caution.
33
   We find similar effects on credits attempted in 2011-2012 with this restricted sample as with the full sample
reported earlier. These results are available from the authors upon request.
34
   Though not reported in the table, we find similar results for cumulative credits across fall and spring terms only
(excluding summer) and if we exclude the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor.

among students at flat pricing institutions is eliminated (and in some cases reversed) when

looking at credits earned.

VII.     External Validity

         Our study focuses on public universities in Michigan because of the availability of rich

transcript data and because the state appears unique in having substantial policy variation among

similar institutions, likely because tuition policy is not set centrally. While focusing on a single

state and sector controls for many possible confounders, it raises the question of external

validity. Unfortunately there is no systematic source of information of the current use of flat or

per-credit pricing across many institutions nationally, so repeating our analysis for a wide range

of schools is not possible.35 As a check on external validity, in Table 6 we examine students at

public universities in the states of Minnesota and Texas using data contained in the 2004 and

2008 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). These states have nationally

representative samples for students in public universities in both these years and, importantly,

have some variation in pricing practices across institutions and over time.36

         Within the University of Minnesota System, the Duluth and Crookston campuses

transitioned from per-credit to flat pricing between 2004 and 2008, while the Twin Cities and

Morris campuses were flat throughout. Three of the Minnesota State Universities had flat pricing

and four had per-credit pricing in 2004, with one (Southwest State) going from per credit to flat

between 2004 and 2008. Though cross-sectional models suggest a positive association between

35
   Standard sources such as the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) by the U.S. Department
of Education and the Annual Survey of Colleges by the College Board ask institutions to report the price for a
typical full-time student, but do not currently report whether this price varies with credit load. This is a point also
made by Baum et al (2013). IPEDS does contain an indicator for flat or per-credit pricing in 1993, but data from this
period would have limited applicability to the external validity of our results in 2011.
36
   Other states with representative or large samples in NPSAS in 2004 and 2008 lack adequate variation in pricing
practices across institutions. For instance, all public four-year universities in California, New York, Ohio, and North
Carolina have flat pricing structures, as do most in Georgia. Flat pricing in Illinois is confined to the two most
selective institutions (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and University of Illinois Chicago) with no change,
making credible comparisons difficult. All public universities in Florida charge per credit hour.

                                                          28
flat pricing and credit intensity, including institution fixed effects eliminates this pattern. Though

the Duluth and Crookston campuses adopted flat pricing, their students did not gain on those at

the Twin Cities and Morris campuses where pricing policy was unchanged.37 In Texas, flat

pricing was introduced at five campuses in the wake of tuition deregulation in 2003: the

University of North Texas (2007), UT Austin (2005), UT Arlington (2006), UT Brownsville

(2006), and Texas A&M (2009). Prior to that, all institutions charged per credit. Again we find

little evidence that credit intensity increased appreciably following the adoption of flat pricing,

whether we examine the entire sample or restrict analysis to the UT System.

VIII. Discussion and Conclusions

        As public colleges and universities replace lost state support with tuition revenue from

students, many have re-examined the common practice of charging a flat rate regardless of

students’ credit load, level, or program. At the same time, pressure from policymakers and the

public has compelled institutions to find ways to improve student progress and reduce time-to-

degree. These twin objectives appear to be at odds: raising prices may generate revenue but

could also deter enrollment, slow student progress, and ultimately reduce the number of college

graduates. Charging full-time students differentially based on the number of credits taken –

pricing at the margin – is one practice about which similar institutions have articulated different

views. Some have stressed the detrimental effects of marginal price on student success by, for

instance, reducing the marginal price to zero in order to get students to “Finish in Four,” as

Adam’s State’s plan is called. Others see marginal pricing as an equitable way of raising revenue

from students who consume more resources; “flat” pricing is viewed as a subsidy to students


37
  Some cautions are warranted, however. The samples are very small and not representative at a school-level. Also,
data cleaning measures used in 2008 eliminate 87% of the sample of students at the seven Minnesota State campuses
during that year. These observations are dropped from all analysis and preferred specifications do not use Minnesota
State campuses in 2008.

                                                        29
who would have taken large course loads anyway. These divergent views are unsurprising given

the dearth of evidence on the subject.

       This paper provides the first evidence on whether students’ educational investments

respond to these marginal price incentives. Using rich administrative data on all in-state students

at the 15 public universities in Michigan, we estimate that marginal price (above the full-time

minimum) has no detectable effect on the average number of credits attempted or earned in a

semester. We find that exposure to flat pricing compels about 7 percent of students to attempt

about one class more (i.e., up to 3 additional credits). This impact appears to be driven by

relatively stronger effects among low-income, minority, and lower-achieving college students

(i.e., point estimates are nearly twice as large for such groups). Yet, we see little evidence that

these additional attempted credits translate into more credits earned in a semester or

cumulatively, greater persistence, or reduced time-to-degree, though estimates of these longer-

term outcomes are admittedly less precise. We argue that this disconnect between additional

credits attempted and earned is due to the increased propensity of students exposed to flat-pricing

to withdraw from (or fail) classes.

       Based on these results, marginal pricing may be a non-distortionary way for institutions

to raise revenue. Additional revenue could be used to finance other interventions with a stronger

track record of improving student success, to increase financial aid, or possibly to lower the

average tuition price faced by students taking lower credit loads.

       Our null finding stands in contrast to the rather large literature that documents substantial

student responses to price in other choice environments, such as the decision to enroll or the

choice of college. Our results suggest a need to dig deeper into the choices students make after

entering college, as price responsiveness at the enrollment margin does not appear to imply a



                                                  30
comparable responsiveness once students are enrolled. Policies designed with large student price

elasticities in mind (informed by the enrollment and college choice literature) may not translate

well to the problem of supporting and hastening student progress with marginal incentives.

           There are several possible explanations for this difference. First, it is plausible that the

intensive credit-taking decision environment is quite different than at the extensive margin.

Students may perceive more constraints on their credit-load choices than on their college

choices. Second, the marginal price of intensity may simply be less salient than the overall

(average) price, which determines enrollment and college choice. In Michigan, we see some

variation in the salience of pricing policies (and its relation to cost savings and time-to-degree)

across institutions. For example, Lake Superior State University exclaims in large, bold font at

the top of its webpage on costs: “LSSU offers a flat tuition rate for those taking 12 to 17 credits.

This means you can take 17 credit hours for the price of 12, a savings of over $4,100 per year,

and over $16,400 in four years!”38 Other colleges simply state the overall and/or per-credit

tuition prices, sometimes buried in tables on registrar webpages. Lastly, it is possible that

students respond to some other feature of price than marginal price, such as average or expected

marginal price, as has been observed in other settings (Ito, 2013). A task for future work is to

separate these explanations, possibly through an experimental information intervention along the

lines of Chetty and Saez (2013). There are also several other possible effects of marginal price

that we have not yet explored, namely major choice, financial burden, or interest exploration.

These too are important questions for future research.

                                    Per-credit (actual)      Flat = Per-credit + estimated treatment effect


Notes: Per-credit mean is for all cohorts during 2011-2012 academic year. Flat (counterfactual) mean is per-credit
mean plus estimated effect of flat pricing on average credits taken in subject. Model includes indicators for each
unique term (e.g., Fall 2011), individual controls, institution-level ACT score, and cohort fixed effects. Sample
includes only FT students and excludes University of Michigan – Ann Arbor. Estimates for other samples are
similar. Standard errors (not reported) are clustered by institution. Significance of difference between flat and per-
credit schools denoted: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: Figures plot the fraction of students enrolled in any college (Panel A) or a MI public university separately by
high school cohort and pricing policy of first institution. Restricted to MI public high school graduates from 2008 to
2011 that enrolled in a MI public 4-year university in the fall immediately after high school.

Notes: Each cell reports the coefficient on indicator for "Flat Pricing" from a separate regression. Sample is restricted to
students enrolled (part-time or full-time) in all fall and winter semesters since high school graduation and for which NSC and
STARR data agree on enrollment history. Cumulative credits includes credits taken during summer terms. All models include
dummies for female, black, Hispanic, other race, LEP and FARM and composite ACT score of individual, midpoint ACT of
the institution, and exclude UM-Ann Arbor. Robust standard errors clustered at the college level appear in parentheses: ***

Notes: Each cell reports the coefficient on indicator for "Flat Pricing" from a separate regression. Students are grouped into quintiles based on their predicted
number of credits attempted from a regression model applied to students at per-credit schools. All models include dummies for unique cohort and term, dummies
for female, black, Hispanic, other race, LEP and FARM and composite ACT score of individual, midpoint ACT of the institution, and exclude UM-Ann Arbor.

Notes: Each cell reports the coefficient on indicator for "Flat Pricing" at first institution attended from a separate regression. Sample is restricted to MI public high school
graduates from 2008 to 2011 that enrolled in a MI public university in the fall immediately after high school graduation. All models include cohort fixed effects. Individual
controls include dummies for female, black, Hispanic, other race, LEP and FARM and composite ACT score. Robust standard errors clustered by first college appear in
parentheses: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
