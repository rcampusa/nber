Immigrant and Native Responses to Welfare Reform
Robert Kaestner and Neeraj Kaushal
NBER Working Paper No. 8541
October 2001
JEL No. J2



                                               ABSTRACT


        In this paper, we investigate the effect of federal welfare reform on the employment, hours of
work and marriage rates of three groups of low-educated women: foreign-born citizens, foreign-born non-
citizens and native-born citizens. Among non-citizens, we investigate whether the behavioral response
to welfare reform differed by recency of immigration. Finally, because some states created programs to
insure that all legal immigrants remained eligible for benefits under the Temporary Assistance to Needy
Families (TANF) program and others did not, we compare the response of foreign-born non-citizens
between these states to investigate whether the immigrant provisions of federal welfare reform legislation
had a “chilling” effect. The results suggest that welfare reform induced native-born citizens and foreign-
born non-citizens to increase their employment and attachment to the labor market. TANF appears to
have had a larger effect on the least educated native-born women and among foreign-born non-citizens,
a larger effect on more recent arrivals. The “chilling” hypothesis that has received so much attention in
the popular press is not supported by our results. Finally, our estimates indicate that TANF had no effect
on native- and foreign-born citizens’ marriage decisions. TANF was associated with a decrease in the
marriage rates of foreign-born non-citizens.

Introduction

        It was rumored that on the day President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work

Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, the Statue of Liberty looked slightly greener than

usual. Someone even said that Lady Liberty threw up. While the hyperbole associated with this story is

obvious, so is the moral; the immigrant provisions of PRWORA represented a backlash against

immigrants that is at odds with the fabled inscription of the Statue of Liberty and the perception of the

United States as a place hospitable to immigrants. Federal welfare reform legislation barred future legal

immigrants (those arriving after passage of the law) from receiving cash assistance under the Temporary

Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, as well as most other federal means-tested benefits (e.g.,

food stamps), for five years, and left it up to states’ discretion whether current legal immigrants would be

eligible for such assistance. Notably, every state but Alabama maintained the TANF eligibility of current

legal immigrants and 19 states created state programs to provide TANF-like assistance to future legal

immigrants during the five-year period for which they were barred from receiving federal benefits

(Zimmerman and Tumlin 1999). The heterogeneous state responses to PRWORA, as well as subsequent

federal legislation restoring some lost benefits to immigrants, makes it clear that our nation does not share

a common vision related to the treatment of immigrants.

        Why were immigrants singled out for special treatment? One reason was that the number of

immigrants to the country had been growing rapidly prior to passage of the law, as was the foreign born

share of the population. Naturally, policy makers were concerned about the effect of this large influx of

immigrants. For example, immigrants may have contributed to the stagnating wages of less skilled

workers and worsened wage inequality, which was also growing during this period. The increase in

immigration prior to PRWORA was truly large. According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service

(INS), approximately 13.5 million legal immigrants came to the United States between 1981 and 1996

and perhaps as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants also entered the country during this period.

The only other period in which such a large number of immigrants entered the country was between 1900




                                                                                                            2
and 1920. In sum, the growth in immigration and the potentially adverse effects of that immigration may

have created some anti-immigrant sentiment that became manifest in the federal welfare reform law.

        A second reason to treat immigrants differently was that it was seen as a way to address two

problems associated with immigration that were directly related to the Aid to Families with Dependent

Children (AFDC) program. Not only was there a large number of immigrants entering the U.S. prior to

PRWORA, but the immigrants that were entering were less educated (relative to natives) than previous

immigrants reflecting the increase in the number of immigrants from Latin America and Asia (INS 1996).

Moreover, recent immigrants were more likely to use AFDC and other welfare programs than were earlier

immigrants and immigrants had higher rates of participation in welfare programs than natives (Borjas

1995, Borjas and Hilton 1996).1 This increasingly greater use of public funds erodes the fiscal benefits

associated with immigration and led to concerns that immigrants, particularly newer immigrants, were a

fiscal drag—i.e., consuming more than they were producing (Borjas and Hilton 1996, Smith and

Edmonston 1997). There was also a debate over whether immigrants were attracted to states such as

California and New York that have generous cash assistance benefits (Borjas 1999). Therefore, barring

immigrants from cash assistance and other federal safety net program was seen as a way to save money

and increase the fiscal benefits of immigration and to reduce “adverse” immigration, that is immigration

by future welfare recipients.

        The immigrant provisions of PRWORA were not universally supported and future debates over

this issue will benefit from evidence of the effect of welfare reform on immigrants. In this paper, we

provide such evidence by investigating the effect of PRWORA on the employment, hours of work and

marriage rates of three groups of low-educated women: foreign-born citizens, foreign-born non-citizens

and native-born citizens. The objectives of welfare reform were to reduce dependency on public

assistance by encouraging women to work and to change behaviors that create dependency (e.g., non-


1
  It remains true, however, that conditional on observable characteristics, immigrants were less likely to use AFDC
than non-immigrants (Butcher and Hu 2000, Borjas and Hilton 1996). However, immigrant use of all social welfare
programs was greater than that of natives even after adjusting for observable characteristics (Borjas and Hilton
1996).


                                                                                                                  3
marital births). Therefore, our analyses of employment and marriage are central to the evaluation of the

success of welfare reform. In addition, the immigrant provisions of welfare reform grew out of

perceptions about immigrant use of cash assistance and were intended to save money by barring some

immigrants from receiving benefits. Our investigation of the effect of welfare reform on foreign-born

women, both citizens and non-citizens, will contribute to and expand knowledge about differences

between foreign- and native-born women’s use of public assistance and their response to welfare reform.

Importantly, we investigate whether the behavioral response to welfare reform differed by recency of

immigration. And our analysis of the effect of welfare reform on foreign-born non-citizens, a group

which consists partly of newly barred legal immigrants, will provide evidence of the potential cost

savings associated with the immigrant provisions of welfare reform. Finally, because some states created

programs to insure that all legal immigrants remained eligible for TANF and others did not, we can

compare the response of foreign-born non-citizens between these states to investigate whether there was a

“chilling” effect of the immigrant provisions of federal welfare reform legislation.



PRWORA’s Incentives: Immigrants and Natives

        The federal welfare reform law does not distinguish among citizens by nativity and the time

limited benefits and other provisions of PRWORA apply to all citizens. However, the behavioral

response (e.g., changes in employment and marital decisions) to welfare reform may differ between

foreign- and native-born citizens. For example, Borjas and Hilton (1996) report that foreign-born women

have longer average spells of AFDC receipt than do native-born women. As a result, welfare reform may

have a larger effect on foreign-born women than it does on native-born citizens. The reason for this is

that the reduction in lifetime benefits associated with PRWORA’s time limits represents a larger change

in policy for foreign-born women who expect to receive benefits for a longer period. Other

considerations, however, suggest that foreign-born women may have a smaller behavioral response. For

example, foreign-born women may have inferior labor market opportunities compared to native-born

women, say because of language barriers, discrimination and local demand conditions. In this case,


                                                                                                           4
provisions of PRWORA such as the work requirements will not be as utility reducing for foreign-born

women relative to native-born women and foreign-born women will be less likely to exit welfare in

response to this aspect of welfare reform (Besley and Coate 1992, 1995). In general, the behavioral

response to welfare reform will differ depending on the underlying cause of welfare participation, which

may differ by women’s nativity status. We examine this issue explicitly in the empirical analysis and in

doing so investigate whether there is heterogeneity in the behavioral response of immigrants by

citizenship and recency of immigration.

        A unique aspect of PRWORA is the distinction it makes among foreign-born non-citizens.

Specifically, it creates two eligibility classes among foreign-born non-citizens who entered the country

legally. Legal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. prior to August 22, 1996 were eligible for AFDC and

remained eligible for TANF in every state but Alabama. Legal immigrants arriving in the U.S. after

August 22, 1996 are ineligible for TANF for five years unless they live in one of the 19 states that made

state funds available to maintain the eligibility of this group. Thus, all legal immigrants are affected by

welfare reform, but some newly arrived immigrants face the more draconian policy of being denied

access to government cash assistance.

        In our empirical analysis, we examine the effect of welfare reform on foreign-born non-citizens.

This group consists of documented and undocumented immigrants, although the data do not allow us to

distinguish between the two. Undocumented immigrants were never eligible for cash assistance and

welfare reform had no effect on their behavior. Thus, the behavioral response that we are attempting to

measure in this analysis is that associated with legal immigrants. The data allow us to identify new

immigrants (i.e., post 1996) and therefore we can test whether new immigrants had a larger behavioral

response consistent with the more draconian policy change that they faced. Finally, since some states

maintained eligibility of newly arrived immigrants, we can compare the behavioral response of new

immigrants in these states to that of new immigrants in states that did not maintain eligibility to test

whether there was a “chilling” effect of PRWORA. There have been many reports that the immigrant

provisions of PRWORA have discouraged participation among eligible immigrants who are confused or


                                                                                                              5
frightened by the immigrant provisions of the law (Fix and Passel 1999, Zimmerman and Fix 1998). No

difference in the behavioral responses of foreign-born non-citizens in these two groups of states would be

evidence consistent with a “chilling” effect since actual eligibility differences did not matter as much as

passage of the law.



Previous Research

        To our knowledge, there has been only one previous study of the effect of federal welfare reform

on immigrants’ use of cash assistance. Fix and Passell (1999) compare changes in welfare participation

between 1994 and 1997 among citizens and non-citizens. They found that non-citizen participation in

welfare, defined as participation in AFDC,/TANF, SSI and General Assistance, declined significantly

more than did citizen participation. These authors concluded that most of the decline (relative to citizens)

is due to a “chilling” effect since very few of the non-citizens were ineligible for benefits during the

period studied.

        The major weakness with this study is its simple before and after design. Changes in welfare

participation rates may be driven by a variety of factors, for example macroeconomic changes, and this

study did not control for these factors. Specifically, citizens and non-citizens may face different

economic conditions or may have different responses to equivalent economic changes. Indeed, the spatial

concentration of non-citizens strongly suggests that citizens and non-citizens face different labor market

conditions. Therefore, it is not clear whether welfare reform is the cause of the relative (to citizens)

decline in welfare participation. A second weakness of the study is that the data extend only through

1997 and federal welfare reform had not been widely implemented by that time.

        In contrast to this study, our analysis controls for several factors that may affect decisions about

work and welfare participation. Most importantly, we include explicit and implicit controls for

macroeconomic changes in the economy. We also use data that extend through 1999 by which time

federal welfare reform had been completed. Finally, we do not examine welfare participation, but rather

the determinants of welfare participation: employment and marital status. While the outcomes are linked,


                                                                                                               6
changes in the caseload are not the converse of changes in employment or marital status. It is interesting

from a policy point of view to investigate how much of the change in the caseload can possibly be

explained by changes in employment or marriage.



Research Strategy

           To estimate the effect of welfare reform on employment, hours of work and marriage, we use a

quasi-experimental research design commonly referred to as a difference-in-differences (DD) analysis.

The DD procedure compares the change over time in outcomes of a group affected by welfare reform, the

target group, to the change over time in outcomes of a similar group that is unaffected by welfare reform,

the comparison group. The underlying logic of the DD methodology is illustrated in Table 1, which

refers to employment, but a similar logic is applied to the analysis of other outcomes.

                                             Table 1
                          Mean Employment Before and After Welfare Reform

Differences                                                                                 (D-C)


           In Table 1, the difference B-A measures the change in employment of the target group, the group

affected by welfare reform, before and after welfare reform. This difference may be due to the effect of

welfare reform and other factors that change over time. The difference D-C measures the change in

employment before and after welfare reform of the comparison group, a group similar to the target group,

but a group unaffected by welfare reform. Changes in the employment of the comparison group are due

to other factors since this group is unaffected by welfare reform. Thus, the difference-in-differences, (B-

A)-(D-C), measures effect of welfare reform on the target group. The effect of other factors is eliminated


                                                                                                           7
by subtracting the before and after change of the comparison group from the before and after change of

the target group. Obviously, a critical assumption of the DD procedure is that changes in employment

caused by other factors are the same for the target and comparison groups.

          The DD analysis can also be cast in a regression framework. For example, the regression

specification that corresponds to Table 1 is as follows:

(1) Empikt = α 0 + α1Treat k + α 2 Reform t + α 3 (Treat k x Reform t ) + eikt

where Empikt is an indicator of whether woman ‘i’ in group ‘k’ in year ‘t’ is employed. The variable

Treatk in equation (1) denotes membership in our target group. Reformt is an indicator equal to one if it is

an observation taken after welfare reform. The key parameter in equation (1) is α3, which is the DD

estimate corresponding to (B-A)-(D-C).

          As written, the DD estimate obtained from a regression using the equation (1) specification would

equal the estimate obtained by the subtractions in Table 1. This simple specification of the regression

model generates no advantage over the differences in means in Table 1. A more complex specification of

the regression model that includes controls for personal characteristics, unmeasured state effects and

unmeasured time effects does have some advantage. Notably, DD estimates obtained from such a model

will be more precise and allow for a more refined specification of time effects vis-a-vis policy effects. In

practice, we estimate a model similar to equation (2) below.

      Empijkt = β j + ( β j x Treat k ) + δ t + X ijkt Γ + Z jt λ + α 1Treat k + α 2 Waivert +
(2)
                 α 3 TANFt + α 4 (Treat k x Waivert ) + α 5 (Treat k x TANFt ) + eikt

Equation (2) includes controls for state effects (β j), which we allow to differ by target and comparison

group, year effects (δt), personal characteristics (Xijkt) such as age, race and recency of immigration (for

foreign born), and state level variables (Zjt) such as the unemployment rate. Equation (2) also reflects a

more general specification of welfare reform by differentiating between AFDC waivers and TANF. This

is particularly important because of the special immigrant provisions of TANF. Coefficients α4 and α5




                                                                                                               8
measure the effect of AFDC waivers (α4) and TANF (α5) on the employment of the target group holding

constant unmeasured time-varying factors correlated with welfare reform.

         A strength of the difference-in-differences analysis is that it controls, in a parsimonious way, for

time variation in outcomes that is unrelated to welfare reform, for example, due to macroeconomic

changes.2 Clearly, this statement is correct only if we have chosen the “right” comparison group.

Assuming this to be the case, it implies that it is not as crucial in a DD analysis of the effect of welfare

reform to control for macroeconomic activity as it is in other approaches (see Ziliak et al. 2000, Figlio and

Ziliak 1999). To be cautious, however, our regression model includes a control for macroeconomic

activity, specifically the state unemployment rate in the month of the survey. We also interact the

unemployment rates with the dummy variable indicating membership in the target group.

         As noted, a crucial aspect of the DD analysis is the validity of the comparison group. For the

employment analysis, we define the target group to be unmarried women with 12 or fewer years of

education. These women are a reasonable target group since many of them are at risk of welfare receipt.

Education and marital status are strong correlates of welfare participation and a large portion of the

AFDC/TANF caseload consists of low-educated, unmarried women. Indeed, approximately 80 percent of

the caseload in the early 1990s consisted of women with 12 or fewer years of education and an equally

large proportion were unmarried (Kaushal and Kaestner 2000). The comparison group corresponding to

this target group is married women with 12 or fewer years of education. Eligibility for AFDC/TANF is

largely determined by family composition and there is a large difference in welfare participation rates

between low-educated married women and low-educated unmarried women. While some low-educated

married women are surely at risk of welfare participation, the majority is not.3 The inclusion of women at

risk of welfare receipt in the comparison group will bias our estimates toward zero with the size of the

bias depending on the difference in the proportion of at-risk women in the target and comparison groups.


2
  An alternative to the difference-in-differences procedure is to restrict the sample to the target group and include
state-specific trends. However, there is not enough time variation in TANF implementation to make this a feasible
strategy. A regression of the TANF policy variable on just state and year dummies yields an R-square of 0.84.
3
  CPS data from 1994 show that approximately 20 percent of the welfare caseload is married.


                                                                                                                        9
For example, if 60 percent of the women in the target group are at risk of welfare receipt and 20 percent

of the women in the comparison group are at risk of welfare receipt, the DD estimate will be 40 percent of

the true estimate.

        In order to gauge the sensitivity of estimates to our choice of comparison group, we estimate

equation (2) using an alternative comparison group. Our second comparison group is unmarried women

with 13 to 15 years of education.4 The problem with using this group is that a significant proportion of it,

for example those with children, are at risk of welfare receipt. Thus, the DD estimates using this group

are likely to be severely downward biased, particularly when the target group is unmarried women with a

high school degree. It is also the case that marital status is a more important determinant of the level of

employment than education (see Table 1 and discussion below).

        While the key assumption underlying the DD methodology is that the trend in employment (that

is unrelated to policy changes) is the same for the target and comparison group, similar levels of

employment are also important. For example, it is not always obvious whether the appropriate

“differences” in the difference-in-differences procedure should be measured in absolute or relative (i.e.,

percentage) terms. The importance of this distinction is obviated when both groups have the same level

of employment. The similarity of the mean level of employment between the target and comparison

groups also provides initial evidence that the two groups have similar labor market experiences and is

consistent with the fundamental identifying assumption underlying the DD analysis.

        In order to provide some evidence of the validity of our comparison groups, we present the mean

employment rates for the different groups in Figures 1 and 2. The data underlying Figures 1 and 2 were

drawn from the March Current Population Surveys of 1979 to 2000, and refer to employment in the week

of the survey. Figure 1 pertains to all women with less than a high school degree. It is clear that the level

and trend in employment of unmarried and married women with less than a high school degree are quite

similar over the period. Notably, there is a spike in the employment of unmarried women that occurs




                                                                                                          10
around 1997, or about the same time TANF was being implemented. It is also true that the trend in

employment of unmarried women with 13 to 15 years of education is similar to that of the other two

groups, but there is a perceptible increase in employment for this group in 1997 that suggests that this

group may have also been affected by TANF. However, the level of employment is much higher for the

more educated unmarried women. Overall, Figure 1 provides some justification for our choice of target

and comparison groups and evidence consistent with our preference for the comparison group consisting

of married women with similar education. The evidence in Figure 2 is a bit more problematic in this

regard. There appears to be significant differences in both the trend and level of employment of

unmarried and married women with a high school degree in the period prior to 1994. By 1994, however,

and in the period between 1994 and 1997, the level and trend in employment of the two groups are

similar. Again there is a spike in the employment of unmarried women around 1997. Although not as

clear, we believe that the married women comparison group is superior, primarily because it is the group

most unaffected by welfare reform and because during the pre period of our analysis, roughly between

1994 and 1997, the level and trend in employment is the same for the two groups. But as we noted above,

we present estimates using the alternative group for the reader’s benefit since the superiority of our

preferred comparison cannot be established with certainty.

         A difference-in-differences approach is also used to examine the effect of welfare reform on

marital status. For this analysis, we define the target group to be all women with 12 or fewer years of

education and the comparison group to be all women with 13 to 15 years of education. Obviously, since

the outcome is marital status, we cannot stratify on the basis of this variable. Therefore, we are relegated

to using education to classify women into those most and least likely to be affected by welfare reform.

This will undoubtedly increase the bias of the DD estimate, particularly when the target group is women

with 12 years of education, but there are few feasible alternatives.

 We do not include unmarried women with 16 (BA) or more years of education in the alternative comparison group
because it is unlikely that their labor market experiences will be similar to that of women with 12 or fewer years of
education.


                                                                                                                   11
Data

        The data used in the study is the Current Population Survey – Outgoing Rotation Group File for

the years 1994 to 1999. The Outgoing Rotation Group File is a 25 percent sample from each monthly

Current Population Survey (CPS) file and contains information on nativity status, citizen status, and

recency of immigration, as well as information on important welfare related outcomes such as

employment, hours of work and marital status. Importantly, the Outgoing Rotation Group File (ORG)

does not include information on fertility or welfare receipt and so we do not examine the effect of welfare

reform on these outcomes. This ORG does, however, have information on other individual characteristics

such as age, education level, ethnicity, race, and place of residence. We can use these in the regression

analysis to increase the precision of the DD estimates. We limit the time period to the years 1994 to 1999

because information about citizenship and recency of immigration is unavailable prior to 1994.

        One of the most important characteristics of the ORG data for the purposes of this study is the

relatively large number of observations in these data. The March CPS file contains more comprehensive

information (e.g., welfare receipt) about respondents than the ORG, but it does not have sufficient number

of observations to carry out analyses separately by nativity and citizen status. This stratification is

essential to the goals of this study.

        We focus on three samples of women: native-born citizens, foreign-born citizens and foreign-

born non-citizens. In all cases, we limit the sample to women between the ages of 18 and 44 years of age

because very few women over age 44 are at risk of welfare receipt. We exclude younger women because

we use education to stratify the sample and there is little variation in education among women below age

18. We also exclude from the analysis women with more than 15 years of education. These women are

not likely to be at risk of welfare receipt and their labor market and marital experiences are not likely to

be comparable to those of the low-educated women in our target groups. For native-born citizens, we

select a 25 percent random sample from the ORG to reduce the computational burden associated with the

large number of observations for this demographic group. The 25 percent sample provides sufficient

sample sizes.


                                                                                                           12
        Information about state level policies related to welfare reform is merged to the individual level

data. Policy variables are measured as of the date they became effective. We use a variety of data

sources to define the policy variables including the 1999 CEA report, information reported in Schoeni and

Blank (2000), data maintained by the Urban Institute and data collected by the National Governors

Association. We use two broad categories of reform: AFDC waivers and TANF.

        Table 1 provides descriptive information about the employment rates of the samples and the

sample sizes of our target and comparison groups for the U.S. as a whole. Among the foreign born

groups, the sample sizes are not large, particularly for foreign-born citizens, but are sufficient to detect

reasonable sized effects. For example, an estimate of the effect of welfare reform on employment is

simply the difference in mean employment before and after welfare reform, or

(3) π = EMPbefore − EMPafter .

The variance of the effect is simply the variance of the difference in mean employment before and after

welfare reform:

(4) Var (π ) = 2σ 2 / N .

In equation (4), σ2 is the variance of the binomial outcome of employment, which we assume is equal to

0.24 (implying a mean employment of 0.60). Equation (4) also assumes that there are an equal number of

observations before and after welfare reform and that the variance of employment is equal in each period.

To detect a significant effect, the estimate has to be 1.96 times larger than its standard error, or

    π / Var (π ) > 1.96

(5) π / 2σ 2 / N > 1.96
     N > 2(1.96) 2 σ 2 / π 2 = 2(1.96) 2 (0.24 / π 2 )

The necessary sample size depends on the size of the true effect. So, to detect a true effect of 0.03, or a

three percentage point change in the employment rate, the required sample size is 4098 (2N in equation

5). The preceding calculation is meant to be more illustrative than definitive, for example this sample




                                                                                                               13
size calculation ignores type II errors and is based on a two-tailed (1.96) test, but it demonstrates that the

sample sizes in Table 1 are sufficient.

        The second point to note about Table 1 is the relatively similar employment rates of our target

and comparison groups, particularly when marital status is used to define these groups. For example,

among the native-born group, the employment rate of unmarried women without a high school degree is

0.437; the similar figure for married women without a high school degree is 0.505. Table 1 also indicates

that education is a stronger correlate of employment than is marriage. For example, the employment rate

for unmarried women with 13 to 15 years of education is 0.753, which is 12.7 percentage points higher

than the employment rate for unmarried women with 12 or fewer years of education.



Results - Effects of Welfare Reform on Employment

        Table 2 presents the DD estimates of the effect of AFDC waivers and TANF on the employment

of unmarried women. Analyses were done separately for three groups: native-born citizens, foreign-born

citizens and foreign-born non-citizens. The top panel of Table 2 presents estimates obtained using

married women with similar education levels as the comparison group. The bottom panel presents

estimates obtained using unmarried women with more education as the comparison group. Each row

(within column) of Table 1 presents estimates from a separate regression. So row 1 presents DD

estimates of the effect of AFDC waivers and TANF on unmarried women with 12 or fewer years of

education, and row 2 presents similar estimates for unmarried women with 12 years of education (i.e.,

high school degree). Note that we do not obtain estimates of the effect of AFDC waivers on the

employment of foreign-born women. The reason for this is the lack of within-state variation in state-level

welfare policy (i.e., AFDC waivers) in the states where foreign-born women live. Over 80 percent of

foreign-born women lived in states that had no within-state variation in pre-TANF welfare policy and

none of the top six “immigrant” states (CA, FL, IL, NJ, NY, TX) implemented a waiver during the period




                                                                                                            14
of our study.5 We also do not present separate estimates by education level for foreign-born citizens

because of small sample sizes. All estimates were obtained by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression

using White’s (1980) correction for heteroscedasticity.

           Estimates in the top panel of Table 2 indicate that TANF increased the employment of low-

educated unmarried native-born women in the U.S. by approximately 2.6 percentage points, which

represents a relative effect of about four percent. The effect of TANF was significantly larger for women

without a high school degree than it was for women with a high school degree. Among those without a

high school degree, TANF is associated with a 5.8 percentage point, or 13 percent, increase in

employment. The similar effect for those with a high school degree is 1.4 percentage points or two

percent. The smaller effect of TANF on women with a high school degree is expected since fewer of

these women are truly at risk of welfare receipt. In contrast to TANF, AFDC waivers had no statistically

significant effect on the employment of native-born low-educated unmarried women. Similar estimates

using other data sources and methodologies have been reported by Kaushal and Kaestner (2000) and the

Council of Economic Advisers (1999). Finally, estimates in the bottom panel of Table 2 are qualitatively

consistent with those in the top, but smaller in magnitude. This result is exactly what one would expect

since a larger fraction of the comparison group used to obtain these estimates is affected by welfare

reform than was the case in the top panel.

           While the TANF effect may seem too small to be consistent with the large declines in

AFDC/TANF caseloads, it should be recognized that this is a downward biased estimate of the effect of

TANF on those who are actually at risk of welfare receipt. Only a portion of the target group is truly at

risk of welfare receipt and some portion of the comparison group is also at risk. Thus, the 2.6 percentage

point increase in the employment rate associated with TANF may mask a much larger increase in the

employment rate of women truly at risk. However, 2.6 percent of all low-educated unmarried native-born

women represents approximately 325,000 women and suggests that employment increases related to

TANF may have accounted for a relatively large part of the decline in the welfare caseload. According to

    We do include an AFDC waiver dummy variable in these regression models.

                                                                                                        15
the Department of Health and Human Services (www.acf.dhhs.gov/news/tables.html), between August

1996 and June 2000, the number of families on welfare declined by 2,207,000. If we assume that

approximately 60 percent of this group of families were headed by unmarried women with 12 or fewer

years of education, these figures suggest that the number of unmarried women with 12 or fewer years of

education who were receiving public assistance declined by 1,324,200. Thus, we estimate that

approximately 25 percent of the decline in the caseload during this period among this group was due to

increased employment related to TANF. Obviously this is a rough estimate of the TANF-induced

employment related decline in welfare caseloads, but it makes the point that the relatively small estimates

in Table 2 can account for a significant portion of the change in the welfare caseload.

        Estimates in the top panel of Table 2 indicate that TANF had no statistically significant effect on

the employment of foreign-born women. Among non-citizens, TANF was associated with a non-trivial

increase in employment of one to two percentage points (three to four percent), but these effects were not

significant. It is surprising that estimates in the bottom panel of Table 2 pertaining to foreign-born

women are larger than estimates in the top panel. We have argued that DD estimates obtained using

unmarried women with 13 to 15 years of education as the comparison group are likely to have a larger

bias (toward zero) than those obtained using low-educated married women because more of the former

are at risk of welfare receipt and therefore potentially affected by the law. Thus, we are somewhat

skeptical of the estimates in the bottom panel of Table 2, but we can’t rule out the possibility that TANF

may have had a significant effect on the employment of foreign-born non-citizens. We believe the

estimates in the top panel, however, are more credible and prefer to emphasize these estimates in our

discussion. Because there is no definitive way to resolve this issue, we present both sets of estimates

throughout the paper, but we discuss only those obtained using married women with similar education as

the comparison group.

        It is perhaps inappropriate to compare estimates across the three samples defined by nativity and

citizenship because the “quality” of the target and comparison groups may be sample specific. For

example, a significant portion of the foreign-born non-citizen sample is undocumented and ineligible for


                                                                                                          16
AFDC or TANF benefits. Therefore, this group is unaffected by welfare reform and thus the target group

in this sample may consist of fewer women at risk of welfare receipt. This would lead to a DD estimate

that is more biased toward zero and is consistent with most of the estimates in Table 2.

        In order to obtain some idea of the relative quality of the target and comparison groups in each

sample, we used data from the March CPS in 1994 to compare rates of AFDC receipt across the three

samples. Among native-born women, 15 percent of the target group (unmarried women with 12 or fewer

years of education) and 2 percent of the comparison group (married women with 12 or fewer years of

education) received AFDC in the past year (i.e., 1993). Among foreign-born non-citizens, 18 percent of

the target group and 5 percent of the comparison group received AFDC in the past year. Finally, among

foreign-born citizens, 13 percent of the target group and 1 percent of the comparison group received

AFDC in the past year. While not definitive, these figures suggest that the quality of the target and

comparison groups is roughly similar if we use the difference in average AFDC receipt in 1994 between

the target and comparison groups to evaluate “quality.” For all three groups of women, however, a

greater proportion of unmarried women with 13 to 15 years of education participated in AFDC in 1994

than did married women with 12 or fewer years of education. This suggests that the DD estimates

presented in the bottom panel of Table 2 would be smaller than those presented in the top panel. This is

clearly not the case for the foreign-born non-citizen sample and this fact motivates our skepticism related

to the significant estimates of the effect of TANF on foreign-born non-citizens in the bottom panel of

Table 2. Assuming that the “quality” of the experiment is roughly the same for native- and foreign-born

women, our preferred estimates in Table 2 imply that foreign-born women were less affected by TANF

than native-born women. Again, a caveat is necessary because estimates in the bottom panel of Table 2

suggest an opposite conclusion.

        An important issue in the immigration literature is assimilation, or how fast immigrants start

acting like native-born persons. To address this issue we allowed the effect of welfare reform among

foreign-born non-citizens to differ by the recency of immigration. A similar analysis could not be

performed for foreign-born citizens because of small sample sizes. Table 3 presents the estimates from


                                                                                                           17
this analysis. Estimates in Table 3 indicate that the effect of TANF was larger for more recent

immigrants as compared to immigrants who arrived earlier. According to our preferred set of estimates,

TANF increased the employment of foreign-born non-citizens who immigrated in the past five years by

4.1 percentage points. Among those who immigrated 10 or more years earlier, TANF had no statistically

significant effect on employment. Importantly, these models hold constant the effect of recency of

immigration on the employment level so our estimates are not confounded by the effect of unmeasured

characteristics associated with recency of immigration. However, the immigrant provisions of TANF

may have altered the composition of new immigrants and the estimates in Table 3 related to the newest

immigrants may be a combination of a behavioral response and a selection effect. Both effects are due to

TANF, but it is a factor to consider when comparing behavioral responses across groups in Table 3.6 As

discussed above, differences in the behavioral response to welfare reform stem from different underlying

causes of program participation. Estimates in Table 3, if we assume that they represent different

behavioral responses, suggest that recency of immigration signals something about the reasons why low-

educated immigrant women require cash assistance. Identifying those reasons is beyond the scope of this

analysis because of data limitations, but future research will want to address this issue. On the other

hand, recent immigrants faced a more draconian policy change since many were completely denied cash

assistance benefits and this may be the underlying explanation of the larger estimates for this group.

Finally, estimates in the bottom panel of Table 3 indicate that TANF was associated with an increase in

the employment for all groups of foreign-born non-citizens with relatively little difference by recency of

immigration.

         Another issue related to immigrants and welfare reform that has received much attention is the

“chilling” hypothesis. As noted, the “chilling” hypothesis suggests that the anti-immigrant provisions of

PRWORA have caused even eligible immigrants to forgo benefits because the anti-immigrant sentiment

of the law created confusion and fear among all immigrants. To test this hypothesis, we exploit the


6
  This point reinforces the earlier one that it is difficult to know whether the larger estimated effects are due to a
larger behavioral response or because of differences in the quality of the target and comparison groups.


                                                                                                                         18
variation in state policies that offset the PRWORA immigrant regulations. Specifically, 19 states

continued to offer TANF-like benefits to legal immigrants arriving after 1996 and we test whether the

effect of TANF differed in states that denied benefits as compared to states that continued benefits to

legal immigrants. If the “chilling” hypothesis is correct, the effect of TANF on new immigrants should

be approximately equal in both types of states since what is important is the fear and stigma created by

the law and not actual eligibility. Again, it is important to note that recency of immigration is being held

constant in this analysis. Thus, we are comparing the employment of recently arrived immigrants after

TANF to the employment of recently arrived immigrants before TANF. We allow that effect to differ by

whether new immigrants were eligible for TANF.

          Table 4 presents the estimates of this analysis and they are striking. In states that made TANF

benefits available to new immigrants, TANF had no effect on these new immigrants’ employment. In

contrast, TANF had a large effect on the employment of new immigrants in states that denied TANF

benefits. Similar differences in the effect of TANF between the two types of states were not observed

among immigrants who arrived prior to 1996. We tested whether the effect of TANF for earlier arriving

immigrants differed between the two types of states and we could not reject the null hypothesis of no

difference. Therefore, the difference in the effect of TANF among new immigrants is not due to some

unmeasured difference between states that extended eligibility and those that did not.

          The estimates in Table 4 are inconsistent with the “chilling” hypothesis, which would suggest

more equal sized effects. The “chilling” hypothesis suggests that the anti-immigrant sentiments

associated with the TANF would cause new immigrants in both types of states to respond more or less

equally since the important aspect of the law was the debate and controversy over the immigrant

provisions that may have frightened eligible immigrants from obtaining benefits. Differences in actual

eligibility should not matter that much, but the estimates in Table 4 strongly suggest that eligibility does

matter.




                                                                                                            19
Results - Effects of Welfare Reform on Hours of Work

        In addition to employment, we examined the effect of welfare reform on usual hours of work in

the week prior to the survey for our three groups of women.7 This analysis allows us to evaluate the

extent of the labor market commitment of women who have been induced to work by welfare reform.

The empirical analysis of hours of work is identical to that of employment. Table 5 presents the simple

descriptive statistics for hours of work by demographic characteristics and Table 6 presents the DD

estimates of the effect of AFDC waivers and TANF on hours of work per week.

        Estimates in Table 6 are consistent with those in Table 2 related to employment. TANF increased

the average hours worked per week of native-born women and foreign-born non-citizen women. The

effects of TANF were greatest among native-born women who had less than a high school degree.

Estimates indicate that TANF increased average hours worked per week by approximately one hour per

week for native born women and between one half and two hours per week for foreign-born non-citizen

women. The small, but significant increases in average hours worked per week in Table 6 mask a

relatively large change in labor force attachment among unmarried women who entered the labor market

because of welfare reform. We can calculate the average hours of work per week among those who were

induced to work by TANF as follows. First, we assume that TANF did not affect the hours worked per

week of unmarried women who worked before TANF. Thus, the change in average hours worked per

week in Table 6 is due solely to the change in hours worked among women induced to work by TANF.

Thus, we can divide the change in average hours worked per week associated with TANF by the change

in the proportion of women who worked to obtain an estimate of the change in hours worked per week

among those induced to work by TANF. For example, estimates in Table 2 indicate that TANF increased

the proportion of native born women with 12 or fewer years of education who work by 0.026 and

estimates in Table 6 indicate that TANF increased the average hours worked per week for this group by

0.811 hours. Thus, we can divide the 0.811 by 0.026 to obtain an estimate the average hours worked per

 It makes little difference whether we use usual hours worked per week or actual hours worked per week as the
dependent variable.


                                                                                                                20
week of native-born women induced to work by TANF. This calculation turns out to be 31.2 hours.

Similar calculations for foreign-born non-citizen women yield an estimate of 64.9 hours per week, which

is implausibly large. If we use estimates from the bottom panels of Tables 2 and 6 for foreign-born non-

citizens, a more reasonable estimate of 28.6 is obtained. In any case, these figures indicate that new

“welfare-reform” entrants to the labor market worked a significant number of hours and about the same

number of hours as the existing members of the labor force with similar characteristics.

        Gladden and Taber (2000) reported that women with less than a high school degree had an

average hourly wage of $7.55 in 1997. If we use a somewhat more conservative figure of $7.00 as an

estimate of the hourly wage of unmarried women who entered the labor market because of welfare

reform, estimates in Tables 2 and 6 indicate that low-educated, unmarried women who started working

due to welfare reform will earn between $200 (foreign-born non-citizen) and $218 (native-born citizen)

per week on average. If these women work 40 weeks per year they will earn between $8,008 and $8,720

(native-born citizens). These women will also be eligible for the earned income tax credit that will

provide up to 40 percent additional earnings, which raises average earnings to between $11,211 and

$12,208 per year. These families will remain eligible for food stamps and Medicaid will cover their

children’s health care expenses. Transitional benefits for the mother include childcare and Medicaid for

one-year after leaving welfare. Thus, the financial picture of women who have left welfare for work

improves significantly given that the cash assistance associated with TANF is quite low, with the national

median being approximately $5000 per year for a mother and two children. Moreover, evidence suggests

that these women can expect significant wage growth over time and therefore an improving financial

future (Cancian et al. 1999, Gladden and Taber 2000).



Results - Effects of Welfare Reform on Marital Status in U.S.

        One of the primary objectives of welfare reform was to reduce dependency on government

assistance by encouraging women to change behaviors that are the underlying cause of dependency.

Marital choices are one of the most important of these behaviors. In this section we present estimates of


                                                                                                         21
the effect of welfare reform on marital choices. One problem associated with this analysis is the “quality”

of the target and comparison groups. We have argued that the use of education alone to define target and

comparison groups is less than ideal and in the best case results in downward biased estimates, but may

even lead to wrongly signed estimates if the marital experiences of more educated women are dissimilar

to those of less educated women. Table 7 presents some evidence related to this point. The mean

marriage rates of the target and comparison groups are similar only for the native-born women. For

foreign-born women, there are significant differences, both statistically and practically, between the

marriage rates of low- and high-educated women. These considerations imply a cautious interpretation of

the estimates presented below.

        Table 8 presents estimates of the effect of welfare reform on marriage. There are few statistically

significant estimates in Table 8. TANF appears to have no statistically significant effect on the marriage

rates of native- and foreign-born citizens. One positive implication of these findings is that they support

our use of marital status to define target and comparison groups. If we had found a significant effect of

TANF on marriage, then part of the effects of welfare reform that we found for employment outcomes

may have been due to compositional changes because we stratified the sample by marital status.

Estimates of the effect of TANF on marriage rates of foreign-born non-citizens, however, are negative

and significant. These estimates are unexpected since the incentives in TANF the legislation were

intended to increase marriage rates in the post-TANF period.


Conclusions

        In this paper, we have investigated the effect of welfare reform on employment, hours of work

and marital status of three groups of low-educated unmarried women: native born citizens, foreign-born

citizens and foreign-born non-citizens. The results of this analysis suggest that welfare reform,

particularly TANF, induced native-born citizens and foreign-born non-citizens to increase their

employment and attachment to the labor market. TANF appears to have had a larger effect on the least

educated native-born women and a larger effect on more recent arrivals among foreign-born non-citizens.



                                                                                                         22
Estimates did not yield a clear answer to the question of whether TANF had a larger impact on native-

born women as compared to foreign-born women. Our preferred estimates, those obtained using low-

educated married women as a comparison group, suggest that in general native-born women had the

larger behavioral response, but estimates obtained using the alternative comparison group of more

educated unmarried women suggest the opposite. What wasn’t ambiguous was the result that recent

immigrants, those arriving in the last five years, were the most affected by TANF. This may reflect a

larger behavioral response, but also may be due to a compositional change in the “new” immigrant pool.

Understanding the reasons for different behavioral responses is beyond the scope of this paper, but

provides a stylized fact that future research should investigate.

        The “chilling” hypothesis that has received so much attention in the popular press and

professional literature is not supported by our results. We found that actual eligibility for benefits is an

important determinant of the behavioral response to welfare reform. This is inconsistent with the

“chilling” hypothesis, which suggests that the debate and controversey surrounding passage of TANF was

the primary cause of immigrant behavior. Our results strongly suggest otherwise.

        Finally, our estimates indicate that TANF and AFDC waivers had no effect on native- and

foreign-born citizens’ marriage decisions. TANF was associated with a decrease in the marriage rates of

foreign-born non-citizens. This latter result is counterintuitive and not readily explained.
