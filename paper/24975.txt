                                          ABSTRACT

We study the spillover effects of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) on crime, and
in the process inform how policies that restrict access to Rx opioids per se within the healthcare
system would impact broader non-health domains. In response to the substantial increase in
opioid use and misuse in the United States, PDMPs have been implemented in virtually all states
to collect, monitor, and analyze prescription opioid data with the goal of preventing misuse and
the diversion of controlled substances. Using information on offenses known to law enforcement
and arrests from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), combined with a difference-in-differences
empirical strategy, we find that PDMPs reduced overall crime by 5%. These reductions in crime
are associated with both violent and property crimes. This decrease in crime is also reflected by a
decrease in crime-related arrests as well as drug-related arrests. Overall, these results provide
additional evidence that PDMPs are an effective social policy tool to mitigate some of the
negative consequences of opioid misuse, and more broadly indicate that opioid policies can have
important spillover effects into other non-health related domains such as crime.

                                             1.       Introduction

        The prescribing behavior of physicians has fueled the opioid crisis (Kolodny et al. 2015).

In addition to the availability of new drugs (for instance, market entry of OxyContin in 1996)

and aggressive pharmaceutical marketing efforts over the 1990s, the concern that pain was being

undertreated led to more aggressive pain management standards, and state medical boards

liberalized rules governing the prescription of opioid analgesics for chronic non-cancer pain.

As a result, total opioid prescriptions filled increased from 107 million in 1992 to 274 million in

2012 (Pezalla et al. 2017). Though opioid prescribing has since fallen, the volume of

prescriptions remains more than two times higher than in 1992. The proper use of opioids can

mitigate the burden of acute pain, such as post-surgical pain (Manchikanti et al. 2010), and

indeed a substantial portion of outpatient opioid prescribing can be traced to a hospital procedure

(Brummett et al. 2017). However, while expanded availability and access to prescription (Rx)

opioids has benefitted many, it has also led to unintended consequences in the form of addiction

and the diversion of these drugs for non-medical purposes.

        Overdose deaths from opioid analgesics have increased seven-fold since 1999,1 with

economic costs of the opioid epidemic exceeding $500 billion annually (Council of Economic

Advisors 2017).2 Though the crisis has shifted in recent years with an upsurge in overdose deaths

related to non-prescription opioids such as heroin or illicit fentanyl, prescription opioids continue

to play a role as four out of five new heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioids

(Jones et al. 2013).

 The CEA found that previous estimates of the economic cost of opioid abuse (for instance, Florence et al. 2016)
were considerably understated due to the underestimation of the value of the lives lost due to opioid-related
overdoses.


                                                         2
        In order to restrain the diversion of Rx opioids for non-medical use and address the role

played by physician prescribing, a popular state-level intervention has been to implement

Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs). PDMPs are statewide databases that track the

prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances, and thus provide key information to

physicians and pharmacists on the patient’s prescription history. While individuals can obtain Rx

drugs for non-medical use through several sources including theft, street purchases, and from a

friend or relatives, physicians remain the leading source for those who are at highest risk of

overdose (Jones, Paulozzi, and Mack 2014). Notably, individuals may obtain excessive Rx

opioids through their own prescriptions, often times from multiple providers without the

prescribers being aware of the other prescriptions, a practice known as “doctor shopping”.

Doctor shopping can also be an important indirect source for the user by making up an essential

part of supply for street dealers (Inciardi et al. 2009).3 PDMPs can help identify patients who

may be doctor shopping, misusing Rx drugs, or are at risk of overdose. Also, PDMPs can help

identify patients that would benefit from timely treatment interventions.

        Currently all states and D.C. have an operational PDMP, though utilization of these

programs by providers largely remains voluntary and the systems vary based on their

comprehensiveness and degree of integration. In many states where providers have discretion in

whether or not to refer to the PDMP prior to prescribing an opioid (or another controlled

substance), utilization rates tend to be quite low, hovering between 14-25% (Alexander et al.

2015), and unsurprisingly PDMPs are found to have limited to no effect on opioid misuse. A

growing number of states have enhanced and modernized their programs, instituting universal

registration and mandatory-access provisions and requiring providers to register on and query the


3
 Numerous additional problems have also been identified with how opioids are prescribed, including overlapping or
early refill of prescriptions, dose escalation, and high daily dose rates (Mack et al. 2015).


                                                       3
PDMP prior to prescribing any controlled substance. Several individual state audit studies have

shown that mandatory access PDMPs have effectively increased utilization and query rates.4

There is an emerging consensus that these stricter programs have also led to robust reductions in

opioid misuse and related negative consequences. Mandatory-access PDMPs have reduced

opioid misuse among Medicare Part D participants (Buchmueller and Carey 2018), and also

reduced opioid misuse and opioid-related mortality among adults in the general population (Ali

et al. 2017; Grecu, Dave, and Saffer 2019).5 The CDC, U.S. Government Accountability Office,

and the President’s Commission on opioid abuse have all stressed the importance of states

mandating PDMP use among licensed prescribers, as an integral part of a comprehensive

strategy to combat opioid misuse (U.S. GAO 2009; Christie et al. 2017).6

        What remains unclear are the potential spillovers from these interventions, and any

resulting success in reducing Rx drug misuse, on other outcomes. Opioid misuse has been linked

with many adverse consequences including: higher health care costs (White et al. 2005), lower

worker productivity (Hansen et al. 2011), more suicides (Borgschulte et al, 2018), and a

complementary increase in cocaine and marijuana use (Grecu, Dave and Saffer 2019). Given the

links between drug misuse, mental health, and crime, policies that lead to changes in Rx opioid

abuse may also generate spillover effects on criminal behaviors, which could have substantial

economic effects.7


4
  For instance, the number of prescriber and pharmacist PDMP registrations increased by 77% and 680%
respectively, existing but inactive accounts decreased by 50%, and queries increased from an average of 11,000 per
month to 1.2 million per month, following New York’s enactment of mandated use in August 2013. Enrollment in
the PDMP database in Kentucky increased by 264% (and multiple provider episodes – “doctor shopping” –
decreased by 52%) and queries in Ohio increased by 505% (and multiple provider episodes decreased over 40%)
following the enactment of mandatory access PDMP provisions). See Grecu et al. (2018) and
http://www.namsdl.org/library/27CD066B-AF5B-BF3E-9B06857DF279C60A/.

  Note that these studies also found that merely having an operational PDMP without mandated access is largely
ineffective.

  Florence et al. (2016) estimate criminal justice costs of about $8 billion annually related to Rx opioid abuse.

        We provide some of the first evidence on the impact of PDMPs on an important societal

outcome, crime. Our study also speaks to the larger and complex question of how policies that

restrict access to Rx opioids per se within the healthcare system can have a broader impact on

societal outcomes such as crime. While restricting Rx opioids can reduce Rx opioid misuse,

leading to a potential decrease in crime, if individuals substitute to other illicit drugs or more

dangerous supply channels then such policies could actually generate unintended costs through

greater engagement in crime and violence. Given the growing literature on the impact of PDMPs

on the misuse of opioids, and the well-documented link between substance misuse and crime

(Carpenter 2007; Pedersen and Skardhamar 2010), such policies could have a considerable

external impact on crime. Moreover, given the substantial costs associated with crime in general,

and the fact that crime associated with opioid use is particularly costly (Hansen et al. 2011), if

there are spillovers on criminal engagement, then they are likely to be of an order of magnitude

that is economically significant.

        Many states have yet to enact stringent provisions to their PDMPs, and some providers

resist using the PDMP due to time constraints, learning costs, and because often times these

databases are not well-integrated into the electronic medical records of the medical practice

(Grecu et al. 2019).8 There have also been some drawbacks associated with PDMPs, which

include additional costs to the healthcare system and compliance difficulties (Islam and McRae

2014, Stucke et al. 2018). Hence, the overall value of these programs is still actively debated,

despite recommendations from policymakers and public health organizations urging states to




8
 For instance, challenges by some MA physician and dentist groups to the breadth of circumstances proposed for
PDMP queries have contributed to a 2-year delay in the final implementation of a legally-required mandate
(Haffajee et al. 2015).


                                                       5
adopt these provisions. Failure to account for potential crime costs associated with these

programs – either positive or negative – can substantially skew the cost-benefit calculus.

          While a few studies have imputed the criminal justice cost burden associated with Rx

opioid misuse (Hansen et al. 2011; Florence et al. 2016), these have been based on a descriptive

apportionment approach and not meant to be interpreted as causal estimates. We provide one of

the first studies to specifically inform the causal link between Rx opioid misuse and crime. In

particular, we exploit variation in the timing of the implementation of PDMPs and enhanced

mandatory access provisions across states, within a difference-in-differences research design. We

find consistent evidence that the mandatory provisions are associated with a significant reduction

on the order of about 5% for overall crime, driven by decreases in both violent and property

crimes.

          The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section briefly provides some

background on the previous literature and the pathways through which Rx opioid misuse, and

PDMPs, could impact crime. Section 3 describes the data sources, followed by a discussion of

the empirical methods in Section 4. We present the results and robustness checks in Section 5,

and the concluding section summarizes our findings and places them in context along with some

policy implications.

                                         2.     Background

2.1 PDMPs and Opioid misuse

          A large literature has studied the effects of PDMPs, which can be separated into earlier

studies that used data predating most of the mandatory access provisions and more recent work

that has specifically assessed the effectiveness of voluntary vs. mandatory access PDMPs. Many

of the studies based on older data, or data which do not differentiate between voluntary and




                                                   6
mandatory access programs, find very limited or nil effects of the programs on measures of

opioid use and misuse (McDonald, Carlson, and Izrael, 2012; Reifler et al., 2012; Jena et al.

2014; Haegerich et al. 2014). These inconsistent and limited effects are likely driven by the low

provider query rates in states that do not mandate PDMP use. As stressed in the GAO report

(U.S. GAO 2009), in order for PDMPs to work to their fullest potential, prescribers and

dispensers must refer to the data prior to prescribing and filling a prescription.9

         The recent wave of studies has moved this literature forward by specifically disentangling

the effects of voluntary vs. the more recent mandatory access PDMP provisions. They find

robust evidence of significant declines in opioid misuse and related adverse health consequences

from mandatory access PDMPs but generally not from programs with no utilization mandates.

For instance, Buchmueller and Carey (2018) find that mandatory access PDMPs significantly

reduced measures of misuse, including excessive quantity and doctor shopping behaviors, among

the Medicare Part D population. Their results reflect a 5-6% decline in the share of opioid takers

with overlapping claims (multiple scripts for the same drug at a point in time) and with more




9
  PDMPs are enacted and operationalized at the state-level; thus, each state follows its own mode of monitoring and
enforcing that healthcare providers are utilizing the PDMP where mandated. Different state agencies may be
responsible for administering the PDMP, including substance abuse or consumer protection or licensing agencies.
In the majority of states (36 states), however, PDMPs are administered either by the state’s board of pharmacy or the
department of health (Grecu et al. 2019). The state’s appropriate licensing board – typically the medical board
and/or the board of pharmacy – has the authority to impose (or refer to the appropriate licensing agency to impose)
disciplinary actions that can include revocation, suspension, or non-renewal of the provider’s license for
inappropriate prescribing of opioids and failure to register on and refer to the PDMP. Any licensed prescriber who
fails to register on the PDMP and query the system, or fails to submit the accurate prescribing information or
inappropriately prescribes controlled substances, is also subject to other civil or criminal penalties as defined in each
state’s legislation, which can vary across states. Referral to law enforcement agencies, however, is generally
confined to cases wherein physicians are prescribing for diversion purposes; a warning or license suspension
(following multiple warnings) is relatively more typical for non-compliance with PDMP mandates. States can also
conduct frequent and automated analyses of their PDMP – generating reports on providers who exhibit problematic
prescribing and dispensing – and use this information to investigate further and impose warnings and disciplinary
actions as necessary. Disciplinary actions can result from such regular audits as well as from complaints originating
from dispensers, law enforcement, or consumers regarding any inappropriate prescribing. States also can establish a
Medicaid Fraud Control Unit to investigate suspicious behavior based on PDMP information.

than a seven-month supply, and an 8-16% drop in doctor shopping behavior (share of individuals

obtaining opioids from five or more prescribers and pharmacies).

        Ali et al. (2017), based on self-reported information from the National Surveys of Drug

Use and Health, also find a significant drop in doctor shopping (defined in their data as obtaining

Rx drugs from two or more doctors) and a reduction in the number of days of misuse at the

intensive margin (by about 42% relative to the mean).10 Grecu, Dave, and Saffer (2019) assess

the effects of PDMPs on substance use disorder treatment admission flows stemming from

various Rx drugs and on mortality from drug poisonings. They also confirm the broader findings

and find statistically and economically significant reductions in these measures of misuse, with

the largest effects concentrated on Rx opioid misuse and among young adults ages 18-24 (32%

decline in treatment admissions and 26% decline in opioid-related mortality).11 Kaestner and

Ziedan (2019) provide evidence of a significant first-stage with respect to prescribing patterns,

and show that the adoption of a modern PDMP system accessible to all users is associated with a

4-8% decrease in retail opioid prescriptions.

2.2 Substance misuse, PDMPs and Crime

        Most of the studies that have evaluated the impact of PDMPs have assessed measures of

Rx drug misuse or associated health indicators, and at best assessed spillovers into the use of

other drugs. Given the robust and consistent findings from this literature that certain forms of

PDMPs have been highly effective, it is plausible that the reduction in Rx opioid misuse may

also impact criminal behaviors. Broadly, substance use can affect crime through three pathways,


10
   They do not report marginal effects, but find approximately a 24% decline in the odds of doctor shopping
associated with the must-access PDMP policies relative to voluntary PDMPs.
11
   The effectiveness of mandatory access PDMPs is driven by the sharp increase in utilization and query rates. For
instance, the number of registered prescribers and pharmacists increased by 77% and 680% respectively, existing
but inactive accounts decreased by 50%, and queries increased from an average of 11,000 per month to 1.2 million
per month, following New York’s enactment of mandated use in August 2013 (see:
http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/12/prescription_drug_monitoring_programs.pdf).


                                                         8
including a pharmacological effect by affecting aggression or violent tendencies, an economic

effect whereby drug users may resort to income-generating crime in order to finance their drug

use habit, and/or a “systemic” effect as participants interact in illicit markets that inherently tend

to resort to a high degree of violence and criminal activity in their sales and distribution networks

(Corman and Mocan 2000).12 These channels also point to important effects on both violent and

property (income-generating) crime.

        Various prescription drugs, including certain opioids and others that are likely to be

misused, have been linked to reports of violence towards others. Based on data on adverse drug

events reported to the FDA, Moore et al. (2010) find that many anti-depressants, sedatives, and

drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are associated with serious acts of violence;

oxycodone, an opioid, was among the top 20 Rx drugs associated with violence-related adverse

drug events.13 Opioid-dependent fathers tend to be more violent towards their intimate partners

(Moore et al. 2011), and behavioral symptoms of Rx drug misuse can include excessive mood

swings and hostility.14

        If PDMPs are effective in reducing opioid misuse, and effective in reducing the use of

other complementary substances such as cocaine and alcohol (which have also been linked to

aggression and violence; Davis 1996; Corman and Mocan 2000), then we may see a reduction in

violent crime. Decreased use and misuse of addictive substances, and better mental health, have

generally been linked to lower rates of both property and violent crime (Grogger and Willis,

2000; DeSimone, 2007; Cuellar et al., 2004; Markowitz, 2005; Marcotte and Markowitz, 2011;




12
   Violence occurs in drug markets partly because consumers and suppliers are not able to rely on contracts and the
court system to resolve disputes.
13
   Number of violence cases for oxycodone was over 4 times greater than for all other evaluated drugs, adjusting for
the volume of reports.

Fryer et al. 2013).15 Though these studies focused on illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin, the

broader causal link underscored here may also carry over to Rx opioids.

         More specific to Rx opioid misuse, doctor shopping has been found to be a significant

source of diversion (Simeone 2017), including sourcing street dealers. Underground drug

markets are particularly associated with violent crime as well as property crime. In this context,

mandatory PDMPs represent an adverse supply shock not just for those who may be accessing

opioids for non-medical use through the healthcare system but also for those who may be

obtaining Rx opioids on the street. To the extent that this may lead to further declines in Rx drug

misuse, criminal activity – both income-generating and violent crime – may decline.

         On the other hand, disruptions to access of Rx drugs may also generate perverse or even

no effects on crime through potential substitution and compensatory behaviors and generate

important dynamics in the market response. For instance, in the context of methamphetamines,

large supply-side disruptions have not been found to have any major effects on violent or

property crime, and any transient changes in prices and indicators of misuse returned to pre-

interventions levels within 4-18 months (Dobkin and Nicosia 2009). In the context of Rx opioids,

both substitution to other supply sources for the same Rx drugs as well as substitution to other

illicit drugs are possible. Given that doctor shopping and physicians are an important supply

source for patients who misuse opioids, constraining this access may lead them to seek out

underground channels outside the healthcare system.

         There is some emerging evidence that supply-side interventions that limit access to

opioids may increase the use of some other illicit substances. Notably, the reformulation of



15
  In order to bypass the endogeneity between substance abuse and crime and between mental health and crime,
these studies rely on natural experiment and exogenous shocks, for instance exploiting changes in illicit drug prices,
emergence of crack cocaine, and mental health treatment.


                                                          10
OxyContin into an abuse-deterrent formulation, and its market entry in 2010, has been found to

be associated with a sharp increase in mortality from heroin overdose (Alpert, Powell & Pacula

2018; Evans & Lieber 2019). Interactions with supply and distribution networks in illicit drug

markets have been especially prone to violence, gang activity, and crimes involving guns.16

Furthermore, the street price of Rx drugs tends to be considerably higher than the pharmacy price

(Sajan et al. 1998; Surrat et al. 2012; Dasgupta et al. 2013), raising the total cost of access for a

user substituting from the formal healthcare system to underground sources. Thus, if some users

are now substituting to these underground supply sources as a result of the PDMPs, then this

may lead to an increase in violent crime and possibly property crime.

         Very little work has evaluated broader spillovers of opioid-related interventions. In the

only other study on PDMPs and spillovers into crime-related outcomes that we are aware of,

Mallatt (2019) finds a strong increase (about 112% on average) in crime incidents related to

heroin possession, with stronger effects in counties which had higher rates of oxycodone

prescribing at baseline.17 Based on descriptive trends, some studies have linked the recent

increase in homicide rates to the re-emergence of heroin and transition from Rx opioids to other

illicit opioids (Rosenfeld 2016). Rosenfeld (2016) notes that the greater demand and entry of

more users into the illicit drug market leads to greater opportunities and incentives for the sellers,

and more disputes among sellers over territories and customer access and more disagreements

between sellers and buyers can lead to greater violence. At the same time, studies directly linking



16
   Drug use has been found to be correlated with aggressive and violent behavior (Murray et al. 2008), and in terms
of drug epidemics, the rise of heroin in the 1970’s and the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980’s were both
associated with substantial increases in violent crimes, including gun crimes and homicides (Szalavitz and Rigg
2017).
17
   Mallatt (2019) focuses solely on heroin and opioid crime, specifically related to possession, in order to gauge
spillovers from restricted access to Rx opioids on substitution into illicit opioids. Kaestner and Ziedan (2019)
consider broader socioeconomic outcomes including employment, earnings, public assistance, and marital status,
and find little evidence that state interventions targeting Rx opioids are significantly associated with these outcomes.


                                                          11
interventions targeted at Rx opioid misuse and spillovers on other illegal drugs are limited and

have not reached a consensus and find very weak adverse or even beneficial effects on other

illicit drugs (Meinhofer 2018; Grecu et al. 2019).18

         The upshot of this discussion is that, while spillover effects on crime are plausible, the

net effects of disruption to Rx opioid access on criminal behaviors are a priori indeterminate. The

overall effects depend on the extent of potential substitution into other illicit drugs vs. the overall

reduction in the pool of addicts. The various reinforcing and/or counteracting channels also

suggest that there may heterogeneous responses across crime types, and in particular point to

potentially important (negative or positive) effects on violent crime, which generate much of the

societal costs associated with crime (McCollister et al. 2010). We provide the first study on the

broader spillover effects of PDMPs on total crime and across specific crime categories. As

policies and interventions proliferate at the federal, state, and local levels targeted at curbing the

opioid epidemic, it is important to account for spillovers on other outcomes and markets. Hence,

our study contributes more broadly towards understanding how supply-side interventions which

disrupt access to Rx opioids in the healthcare system impact crime. Finally, this study contributes

to the larger literature on the effects of substance use on crime, providing evidence on the causal

link between Rx opioid misuse and crime by exploiting the adoption of the mandatory PDMP

provisions as a source of exogenous variation in access to and diversion of Rx drugs.

   Degenhardt et al. (2005) exploit a supply shock in Australia in 2001, which sharply reduced heroin supply, and
find a transient increase in cocaine use among injecting drug users, which was associated with an increase in violent
crime. Doleac and Mukherjee (2018) study the effects of Naloxone (an opioid antagonist, effective at reversing
overdose from Rx opioids) access laws and find an increase in opioid-related theft associated with greater access to
Naloxone. They attribute this to an ex ante moral hazard effect and to change in the composition of the population
towards surviving active drug users, who are more likely to commit such crimes.

         We use measures of crime using data spanning 2003-2017 from the Federal Bureau of

Investigation’s (FBI) Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) monthly files19, and use three separate

datasets within the UCR, each providing complementary strengths.20 All law enforcement

agencies that operate under a U.S. jurisdiction, state, county, city, university/college, tribal and

federal law enforcement agencies, submit crime data to the UCR, either through a state UCR

program or directly to the FBI’s UCR program. These files include the most commonly reported

violent and property crimes (Part I crimes) including murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery,

assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Between 88 to 96 percent of the U.S.

population is covered by agencies that report to the FBI’s UCR Program (Maltz 1999).

         For our primary analysis, we use the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrests

segments of the UCR. In addition to total crime, we estimate effects on Part I violent crime

(homicide-murder and manslaughter, rape, robbery, assault and simple assault) and Part I

property crime (burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft), as well as separately for each of the

disaggregated crime types.

         Known crimes are considered the most accurate crime outcome as they are not an

endogenous function of police enforcement; however, a drawback is that data on known crimes

do not include information about the offender (or the victim). Thus, we also supplement our

main analyses with information from the UCR Arrest Data, which are valuable for two reasons.

First, arrest data include information on drug-related crimes.21 Second, arrest data include

information on the demographics of the offender, which allows us to determine whether the



19
   Kaplan (2019) compiled the offenses, arrests and homicide UCR datasets in ICPSR. While the data on offenses
known is available for 2017, the arrest data is only available until 2016.
20
   This is important and provides a validation check, given the inherent difficulties in measuring crime, a limitation
not unique to our study.
21
   In particular, UCR Arrests report information for sale, manufacture or possession of: (1)
opium/cocaine/derivatives, (2) marijuana, (3) synthetic narcotics, and (4) other dangerous non-narcotics.


                                                          13
propensity to commit crime changed in response to PDMP implementation differentially by age.

Since young adults are more likely to engage in criminal activity in general and also the most

likely to adjust their opioid use patterns in response to the implementation of PDMPs (Grecu et

al. 2019), we expect the effect on crime among individuals of this age group to be

disproportionately impacted by the policy. We further supplement our analyses with data from

the UCR Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), with the added advantage that they contain

information regarding the age of both the offender and the victim, albeit only for homicides.

           Finally, it is important to note that the UCR data are reported at the agency level. Because

of the heterogeneity in the reliability of reporting across agencies and the fact that a single non-

reporting agency may account for a substantial fraction of crime for a given geographical area,

we follow the crime literature and focus on agencies that reported crimes consistently in all 12

months of the year, every year (Maltz and Targonski, 2002).

3.2 Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs

           While PDMP programs have been in existence for quite some time, in 2003 the

Department of Justice began supporting initiatives to implement PDMPs, and the NAMSDL

published the Model Prescription Monitoring Program Act and appropriated funds for its

deployment (Dekker 2007). Thus, we chose to begin our analysis period in 2003, which provides

a sample of PDMPs that are more homogeneous and potentially more effective across states.

           To model the impact of PDMP legislation on crime we follow the literature and use dates

on which a state’s PDMP became operational derived from the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy

System (PDAPS)22 and dates of implementation of mandatory-access provisions. Mandatory-

access provisions are stronger statutes that required all licensed prescribers and dispensers to



22
     http://pdaps.org/datasets/prescription-monitoring-program-laws-1408223416-1502818373


                                                       14
register on the PDMP and to query the PDMP prior to prescribing and dispensing controlled

substances. We note that there is some heterogeneity across states in terms of mandatory access.

For instance, Kentucky mandates access in the strictest sense in that it requires that both

prescribers and dispensers must access the PDMP before writing and dispensing any script for

controlled substances. In contrast, some states mandate access in limited circumstances or do not

mandate access for all providers. For instance, Georgia only requires that physicians practicing at

a pain clinic regularly check the PDMP on all new and existing patients and Florida only requires

providers to check the database prior to prescribing but does not require dispensers to check the

database prior to dispensing.23

        Thus, there is some heterogeneity in the PDMP definitions derived from the PDAPS. In

supplementary analyses, we also model the impact of PDMPs, based on an alternate dimension

and dates that have been highlighted in a recent study (Horwitz et al. 2018). Horwitz et al. (2018)

contend that a salient consideration when modeling the impact of PDMPs is to assess

effectiveness relative to when a state’s full modern, electronic PDMP system became operational

and became directly accessible to all users (providers, law enforcement). They carefully

assemble a legal database and report the dates based on these criteria, and further show these

PDMPs to be negatively associated with measures of “doctor shopping”.

3.3. Other Drug and Alcohol Policies

        In order to account for other confounding shifts, we control for several additional policies

and laws that were enacted over the sample period and which may also potentially have impacted

drug use and crime. Specifically, we control for ID Laws, which require pharmacists to request

and check identification prior to dispensing controlled substances, and physical exam


23
  According to PDAPS, eighteen states have mandated access defined as “Does the state require prescribers to
check the PDMP before prescribing controlled substances?”.


                                                       15
requirement (PER) laws, which require a physical examination or a bona fide physician-patient

relationship prior to prescribing controlled substances. Dates of implementation of ID and PER

laws are obtained from the National Conference of State Legislatures and the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention and are cross-validated with the review of individual state legislatures

and the Federation of State Medical Boards.

           We further control for Naloxone access laws, which expand access to Naloxone to people

other than the person at risk of overdose in order to facilitate friends and family of the user to

administer the opioid antagonist in case of an overdose (Rees et al. 2019). We also control for

Good Samaritan Laws, which exempt those who seek medical assistance for someone

experiencing overdose from arrest and prosecution for minor drug and alcohol law violations

(Rees et al. 2019). Information on these laws is obtained from the Policy Surveillance Program,

which is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Network for Public Health

Law.24 Finally, we control for policies pertaining to marijuana legalization, marijuana

decriminalization, medical marijuana, beer taxes, and whether the state has a 0.08 blood alcohol

content (BAC) per se limit law.

3.4. Demographic and Police Composition Data

           Police department employment data were obtained from the UCR Program Data: Police

Employee (Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted Program - LEOKA) from 2003 to

2017. Specifically, we control for the natural logarithm of the number of officers in the police

force per 100,000 residents. We also control for state-level demographic composition using data

from the bridged-race population estimates, which are produced by the U.S. Census Bureau in

collaboration with the National Center for health Statistics (NCHS).25 In particular, we construct

                                                       16
the share of the population composed by minors, individuals ages 18-25, and males ages 18-25

years, as well as the overall share of males. Additionally, we control for income per capita and

seasonally adjusted unemployment rates, which were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor

Statistics and the County Business Patterns (CBP), and account for shifts in the state’s

economy.26 Finally, we control for the poverty rate, and the share of residents with a college

degree, some college, high school, less than high school.27

                                               4.       Methods

        Our empirical analysis is motivated by the mechanisms described above through which

mandatory PDMPs, which have been shown to significantly reduce Rx opioid misuse, can have

spillover effects on crime. To assess these relationships, we exploit variation in the timing of

PDMP implementation across states, and estimate the following difference-in-differences (DD)

specification:

𝑌"#$ = 𝛼' + 𝛽' 𝑃𝐷𝑀𝑃#$ + 𝛽- 𝑃𝐷𝑀𝑃#$ ∗ 𝑀𝐴#$ + 𝛿𝑋#$ + 𝛾$ + 𝛾" + 𝜀"#$                        (1)

        Equation (1) can be interpreted as a reduced-form crime supply function. The analysis is

at the agency-year level j, and the outcome (denoted by 𝑌"#$ ) represents the natural logarithm of

the rate of offenses known to police per 100,000 residents in a given agency j, in state s and year

t. 28 Models are estimated for all Part 1 crimes, and separately for violent and property crimes.

The variable 𝑃𝐷𝑀𝑃#$ is a dummy variable that indicates if a state has an operational PDMP in

place, and 𝑀𝐴#$ is a dummy variable indicating that the state has enhanced its prescription drug

28
   We add one to the counts before computing the rate in order to avoid dropping the agency-year observations with
zero counts.

monitoring program and implemented stricter mandated-access provisions. The coefficient of

interest is β1, which represents the net reduced-form effect of mandated PDMP use, relative to

states that have an operational but voluntary PDMPs.

       All specifications control for an extended vector of socioeconomic and policy factors

(𝑋#$ ) including demographic information (share of population composed by minors, individuals

age 18-25, males 18-25 years of age, males), drug and alcohol policies (ID laws, PER laws,

Naloxone laws, Good Samaritan laws, marijuana decriminalization, marijuana legalization,

medical marijuana laws, BAC laws, beer taxes), police composition (number of officers in the

police force) and other socioeconomic variables (income per capita, unemployment rate, poverty

rate and share of residents that have a college degree, some college, high school, and less than

high school).

       All specifications further include agency fixed effects (𝛾" ), and year fixed effects (𝛾$ ).

The agency fixed effects account for time-invariant differences across agencies (and hence time-

invariant differences across states, since agencies are nested within states). Time fixed effects

account for national trends in crime rates over the sample period. We also present estimates from

models that include treatment-specific linear trends (𝑀𝐴# ∗ 𝑡), to account for the possibility that

states which ever-adopted enhanced provisions to their PDMPs may be systematically different

than the non-adopting states, and models that include state-specific linear trends (𝛾# ∗ 𝑡), to

account for unmeasured systematic time-varying confounding factors across all states (e.g.

policing behavior, funds allocated to policing, funds allocated to education, among others).

These controls account to some degree for systematic differential trends across implementation

vs. non-implementation states prior to the policy. Given that the analysis is performed at the

agency-year level, including state-specific trends is salient as most potential confounders such as



                                                 18
allocation of public funds or implementation of police training tactics would be implemented at

the state and not at the agency level.29 Standard errors are clustered at the state level, and all

models are weighted by the population covered by the agency (Angrist and Pischke 2007).

         We extend the baseline model in several ways. First, in addition to evaluating the effects

on aggregated counts of all Part 1 crimes (per 100,000 residents), which implicitly assigns equal

severity to each offense, we also evaluate effects on cost-weighted crime following Chalfin and

McCrary (2018). The latter provides an estimate of the policy on the expected cost of crime

based on a weighted aggregate of crime counts, with weights equal to the cost of each type of

crime.30 This approach explicitly places a larger weight on more costly crimes, and typically

violent crimes are more costly than property crimes, given the high victim and societal costs of

the former. Second, since aggregated crime may mask nuanced changes in relatively infrequent

crimes, we also explicitly assess effects of PDMP policy separately on each offense type.

Specifically, the following crimes are evaluated: homicide (which combines murder and

manslaughter), rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

         Third, drawing on the previous literature that has documented significant heterogeneity

across age groups with respect to the non-medical use of opioids, we estimate the impact of

PDMPs on crime conditioned on age group. While information on the offender’s and victim’s

age is not contained in the UCR Offenses Known Segment, we can observe the offender’s and


29
   Previous crime literature exploits variation at the county or city level to evaluate the effect on crime or substance
use at the agency level include a state by year fixed effect as the main specification in order to control for potential
confounders such as the allocation of public funds on policing, education, changes in policing tactics and training, or
socioeconomic conditions that usually vary at the state level (Bondurant, Lindo and Swensen, 2019; Swensen,
2015). Because PDMPs vary at the state-year level, we cannot include a state by year fixed effects, but a state-
specific linear trend would take into account these confounders that vary linearly. Also, note that the treatment-
specific linear trends are nested within the state-specific linear trends.
30
   Estimating the effect on cost-adjusted violent and property crimes, or the expected cost of crime, as presented in
Chalfin and McCrary (2018), takes into account that a policy that prevents a small amount of more socially costly
crimes such as homicide could be more cost-effective than a policy that prevents a large amount of less costly
crimes such as burglary.


                                                          19
victim’s age and gender with respect to homicide incidents using the UCR Supplement of

Homicide Report (SHR). In particular, we examine the following dependent variables: the rate of

homicides where the offender (victim) was between the ages of 18-39 and 40 and over.31

         Fourth, we further exploit the SHR to evaluate whether the rate of homicides that

involved a firearm or a knife changed in response to PDMP implementation. Illicit drug markets

are more likely to involve interactions and networks prone to violence. In particular, studies of

drug gangs show that a significant amount of gang activity involves homicide and assault (Levitt

and Venkatesh 2000; Rainbow 2010; Klein, Maxson and Cunningham, 1991) and particularly

gun-related homicide (Miron 1999; Levitt and Rubio 2005). If PDMPs impact interactions with

illicit drug markets, violent crime, and homicides in particular, it is possible that the strongest

impact among offenders may be among young adults - the group whose opioid misuse and

adverse health events are most impacted by mandatory PDMPs (Grecu et al. 2019).

         Fifth, we also use information on the offender’s age from the arrest data, which have also

been commonly used in the crime literature (Corman et al. 2014). Specifically, we re-estimate

Equation (1) for total arrests for adults 18-30 and over 40. Another advantage of these data is that

they allow separate analyses for drug-related arrests, which we capitalize on to assess effects on

arrests related to specific categories of drugs.

         A critical assumption necessary for the DD research design to credibly identify the causal

effect is that trends in non-implementation states are a valid counterfactual for trends in

implementation states in the absence of mandatory access provisions (Angrist and Pischke 2007;




31
  The age of the victim is missing only in 1.3 % of the incidents while the age of the offender is missing for 35% of
the incidents and therefore the results pertaining the effects on demographics of the offender must be interpreted
with caution.


                                                         20
Colman and Dave 2018). We conduct a fully-specified conditional event study based on the

following specification.
                            8
       𝑌"#$ = 𝛼 + ∑" 𝛽 8 𝐼[𝐷#$ = 1] + 𝛿𝑋#$ + 𝛾$ + 𝛾" + 𝜀"#$        (2)

                              8
       In this specification 𝐷#$ is an indicator that has the value of one when state s has enacted

a PDMP k years away from the contemporaneous period and we estimate this event study using

both the voluntary PDMP implementation dates as well as the mandatory access dates from

PDAPS. Note that when k<0 it indicates lead pre-policy effects, that the PDMP will be enacted k

years in the future, and when k>0 it indicates post-policy effects, that the PDMP program was

enacted k years in the past. We normalize 𝛽 =- to zero and therefore all parameters 𝛽 8 for k

between -4 and 4 should be interpreted as the policy effect on crime relative to the year prior to

implementation. We also impose endpoint restrictions for periods at least five years away from

the year of implementation, which prevents us from assigning unequal weight to states that

enacted PDMP particularly early or particularly late given the unbalanced sample.

       The event study framework serves two functions. First, it allows us to directly test for

differential pre-policy trends by evaluating the magnitude and significance of the lead

coefficients (k<0). Second, the event study allows us to decompose the dynamics of the main DD

effect from Equation (1). That is, the main DD effect represents the average effect on crime over

the post-policy window. For instance, Grecu et al. (2019) show that, while mandatory PDMPs

are highly effective, the effects become stronger over time. This compounding is partly due to

the diffusion of physician knowledge and training as they become more versed with using the

PDMPs, partly because there may be lags in the disruption to supply due to stockpiling, or

because it may take time for the total pool of addicts to decrease. Furthermore, even if access to

Rx opioids is disrupted, alternate sources may substitute over time or there may be substitution



                                                21
into heroin and other illicit drugs (synthetic opioids) in the shorter or longer term. The event

study allows us to capture any such dynamic effects that may either accumulate or dissipate over

time.

         Finally, to evaluate the validity of our empirical estimates we perform a placebo check

similar to the randomization inference outlined in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003). In this

falsification exercise, agency-year indicators for whether mandated access is active are re-

shuffled and randomly assigned. Equation (1) is then re-estimated with this placebo or “shuffled”

pseudo-PDMP indicator, and this process is repeated 300 times, each time using a different set of

placebo indicators. Once the estimation is complete, all 300 placebo coefficients are plotted and

compared with the results of our primary DD analysis.

5.1. Summary Statistics

         Due to the fact that some agencies do not report offenses every year, decreases in crime

could be driven by actual decreases in crime or could be driven by agencies not reporting crimes

on that year. In order to avoid that problem, our main analysis is restricted to the 9,136 agencies

that report crimes in all years between 2003 and 2017 and that report offenses all 12 months each

year between 2003 and 2017.32

         Panel A of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of offenses known to police for all

agencies in the sample (columns 1-2), and agencies that reported all 12 months and reported data

each year between columns 2003-2017 (columns 3-4). In terms of crime rates for the entire




32
   We also estimate the model restricting to agency-year cells that report offenses all 12 months regardless of
whether they do so for all years between 2003 and 2017. We further analyze offenses known to police restricting the
agencies to those that report crimes all years between 2003 and 2016 and that belong to cities with at least 10,000
residents and the results are similar. The last restriction excludes cities with population smaller than 10,000, MSAs
and non-MSAs. These results will be provided upon request.


                                                         22
sample, overall there were approximately 2,240 crimes per 100,000 residents with 212 (9%) of

these constituting violent crimes and the other 2,027 (90%) being property crimes. The violent

crime with the highest crime rate is aggravated assault with 152 incidents per 100,000 residents

while the least frequent violent crime is homicide with 2.4 incidents per 100,000 residents.

Among property crimes, the most prevalent property crime is larceny with 1,487 incidents per

100,000 residents while the least prevalent property crime is motor vehicle theft with 129

incidents per 100,000 residents. While the means for the subsample we use in the main analysis

are expectedly higher due to more complete information on all reporting agencies, the relative

shares of violent and property crime in total crime, and the shares of the specific offenses in

violent and property crime, remain largely unaffected.

         Panel B presents summary statistics for the Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR),

where the first two columns correspond to the entire sample and the last two columns correspond

to the subsample used in this study. Because the original SHR dataset reports homicides at the

incident level, agencies only appear in the dataset as long as they reported a homicide and

therefore the SHR is potentially restricted to agencies where homicide is more prevalent. A

missing agency-year can occur either because the data are missing or because there were zero

homicides during that period. In order to avoid this issue, we restrict the analysis to agencies that

appear in the data every year, and hence report at least one homicide every year throughout the

period studied. This is reflected in the fact that the number of homicides that occurred with a

firearm are much larger in the subsample used.33




33
   We restrict the SHR analysis to agencies that correspond to cities with a population of at least 10,000 that reports
data every year instead of restricting the analysis to agencies that report all 12 months because the latter would
imply restricting the analysis to agencies that reported at least one homicide each month. The discrepancies between
the murder rate and the murder rate conditional on any given age group occurs because not every incident reports
demographics of the victim. As we mentioned earlier, demographics of the offender are largely missing.


                                                          23
       Finally, Panel C presents summary statistics of the arrest dataset. Patterns of arrest rates

(e.g. property crime arrests are more prevalent than violent crime arrests, murder is the least

prevalent violent crime, among others) remain unchanged when we restrict the sample to

agencies that report all 12 months and report crimes every year in the observed period. In

addition, the patterns of arrest rates follow closely the patterns we observed among offenses

known to police.

5.2 Effect of PDMPs on Part I Crimes

       Table 2 presents the coefficients 𝛽' and 𝛽- from Equation (1) using agency-year level

data, where the dependent variable is the natural log of the number of offenses per 100,000

residents. We also report estimates for the impact of mandatory access PDMPs, relative to no

PDMP, using a model with mutually exclusive categories for voluntary and mandated PDMP.

We present estimates for total Part I offenses, and then separately for violent and property

offenses. Panel A presents the effects for aggregated crime counts, and Panel B presents effects

on cost-weight crime counts, explicitly weighting each crime type by its total societal cost

following Chalfin and McCrary (2018).

       For each crime outcome, we estimate the baseline model, and then progressively add the

treatment-specific trends and the state-specific trends in order to control for potential

confounders and policies that likely vary at the state level and the less-than-perfect nature of the

natural experiment. Our preferred estimates are the ones that include these trends, though it is

reassuring that estimates are not largely sensitive to these controls or how we control for these

trends (state-specific or treatment-specific). We present estimates from an event study

framework later to more explicitly assess the parallel trends assumption and effect dynamics.




                                                 24
       The estimates in Table 2 suggest three main findings. First, there is little indication that

voluntary PDMPs have had any economically or statistically significant effect on crime. This is

consistent with much of the prior work that concludes that merely having an operational PDMP

without any mandate on providers to query the databases has not been effective in reducing Rx

drug or opioid misuse (Haegerich et al. 2014; Buchmueller and Carey 2018; Grecu, Dave and

Saffer 2019). Second, we do find evidence that mandatory-access PDMPs significantly decrease

crime. Specifically, mandatory PDMPs are found to significantly reduce overall crime by about

5-6%, relative to voluntary PDMPs. Since virtually all states have an operational PDMP

currently, these “add-on” effects are policy-relevant given that they inform what may happen if

these states enhanced and mandated use of these systems. The total effect of moving from no

PDMP of any kind to a fully mandated PDMP is significant and implies about a 7-8% reduction

in total crime (based on models that control for trends).

       Third, results largely hold when offenses are disaggregated into property and violent

crime – voluntary PDMPs do not significantly reduce crime and mandatory access PDMPs do.

However, some of these effects are imprecisely estimated. In general, these estimates imply

about a 4-5% reduction in property and violent crime as a result of stricter PDMPs. Results in

Panel B are largely similar and indicate a comparable reduction in total expected crime costs,

driven by both a reduction in violent and property crimes. In Table 3 crimes are disaggregated

into specific types of offenses (homicide, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and motor

vehicle (MV) theft). Similar to Table 2 – voluntary PDMPs are generally found to have no

significant effect on any of the offense types. In contrast, mandatory-access PDMPs have a

robust and significant negative effect on both assault and burglary. Also, while results are

sensitive to model specification and disaggregated crime data are more subject to noise, we also




                                                 25
find a negative effect of mandatory-access PDMPs on homicide, robbery, and motor vehicle

theft. Generally, mandatory-access PDMPs are found to reduce offenses on the order of about

5-10%.

         A limitation of offenses known segment of the UCR is that it does not contain

information about the age of either the offender or the victim. There are several reasons to use

the other UCR segments that contain demographics about the offender and victim. First,

reflecting an age-crime gradient (Ulmer and Steffensmeier 2014), engagement in criminal

activity tends to peak into late adolescence and early adulthood. Second, young adults ages 18-

24, followed by adults ages 25-44, tend to have the highest prevalence of non-medical use of Rx

drugs and dependence on pain relievers, though misuse has also been increasing among older

adults.34 Third, prior work has shown that young adults, and in particular young-adult males,

have experienced the largest decrease in opioid misuse and related mortality as a result of

mandatory access PDMPs (Grecu et al. 2019).35

         To incorporate information about the offender and victim Appendix Tables A1 and A2

present estimates from FBI UCR arrest rates, which are commonly used in the crime literature

(see for instance, Corman et al. 2014, 2017). It is validating that these estimates are largely

consistent with those from the Offenses Known Segment. They consistently show that

mandatory PDMPs are associated with a reduction in total arrests and are driven by both a

reduction in violent and property crime arrests. The effect magnitudes are also similar to those

reported in Table 2, implying a decline on the order of about 5-6%. Decomposing these effects



34
   Data from 2014 National Survey of Drug Use and Health indicate that the prevalence of Rx drug abuse and
dependence (pain reliever abuse and dependence) is 3 times (2.8 times) higher and 2.6 times (2.5 times) higher
among adults ages 18-25 and ages 26-44 relative to adults 45+, respectively.
35
   We also estimate the effect of PDMP with an alternative subsample of agencies that report crimes during all 12
months every year of the study and explore with defining the dependent variable as the log or as the log plus one in
order to avoid agencies with zero counts and the results remain unchanged. See Table A2 and A3.


                                                         26
into specific crime types, we find a significant reduction in assault, burglary, and motor vehicle

theft, particularly among young adults (ages 18-39). There is also a suggestive decline in

robbery, assaults, burglary, and motor vehicle theft (5-13%).36

5.3 Homicide

         Given that we find significant effects of PDMPs on homicide, we further evaluate

whether this effect is also reflected in data from the UCR Homicide Supplements. Based on the

Homicide Supplements we are further able to evaluate the extent to which the effect of PDMPs

on homicides is driven by a particular demographic group among offenders (gender and age), to

what extent it happens to a particular demographic group of victims, and whether the effects are

driven by homicides involving a particular weapon or firearms. For consistency, we aggregate

the data at the agency-year level.

         Table 4 presents the results of the DD model estimated with the UCR Homicide

Supplements where the dependent variable is the natural log of the number of homicides per

100,000 residents, conditioned on demographics. Results are broadly in line with the results in

Table 3 in that voluntary PDMPs are not found to have a statistically significant impact on

homicides, and mandatory-access PDMPs are found to have a significant impact.

Columns 2-3 of Table 4 report the effects of PDMPs on weapon used. The results indicate that

mandated PDMPs decreased the rate of homicides that occurred with a firearm by approximately

7-14%. If stricter PDMP regulations affects the circumstances under which individuals access

the illicit drug market, wherein interactions are particularly more likely to involve guns, one



36
   In addition, we computed a pairs cluster percentile-t bootstrap (Cameron and Miller, 2015; Hansen, 2018;
Cameron, Gelbach and Miller, 2008), where we resample states and for every resample compute a bootstrapped t-
statistic for the true null hypothesis that the bootstrap coefficient is equal to the full sample coefficient. The
percentiles of the bootstrapped t-statistics can be used to adjust up or down the full sample standard error. This more
refined approach to inference leaves our main results unchanged in terms of their qualitative conclusions. See
Cameron and Miller (2015) for a description of paired-clustered percentile t-bootstrap.


                                                          27
would expect more pronounced effects on gun-related homicides. Previous literature has found

that the drug market contributes to violent disputes, murders, and non-fatal shootings with

handguns (Maher and Dixon 2001; Blumstein 1995; Maher and Dixon 1999; Ramussen et al.

1993; Miron 1999; Levitt and Rubio 2005; Sullivan and Elkus 2008).37 The reduction in

homicides, and in particular homicides involving handguns, suggest that overall, PDMPs may

not have increased interactions with the illicit drug market. This is prima facie consistent with

the prior literature that found that these interventions resulted in a net decrease in opioid misuse

and related health consequences.

         Columns 4-5 evaluate the impact of PDMPs on homicides of victims conditioned on age.

Results indicate that mandatory access PDMPs reduced the number of homicides where the

victim was between ages 18-39 by 7-13% and the number of homicides where the victim was

over 40 by 8%.38 Both of these effects are statistically significant at conventional levels. The last

two columns present evidence that the number of homicides committed by individuals between

the ages of 18-39 decreased by about 9%, with a similar magnitude of effect among older

offenders.39 As noted previously, the effects on the offender’s demographics must be interpreted

with caution because the demographics of the offender are largely missing.

         Table 5 presents the effects of PDMP on the demographics of the victim (Panel A) and

offender by gender (Panel B) and can be summarized as follows: There is a decrease in the rate

of male homicide victims of 6-11% and this is driven mostly by a decrease in homicide rate of

18-39 year old men of approximately 6-12%. There is a decrease in the rate of female homicide




37
   On the other hand, prohibiting drugs or disrupting drug markets also lead to the inevitable consequences of gun
violence and homicides (Werb et al, 2011).
38
   The effect on victimization of older adults is not statistically different from that for younger victims.
39
   Results a close to zero for models estimated with no time trends and the results for offenders over 40 are less
precisely estimated.


                                                         28
victims of 14%, driven by larger effects among older females (40+). As indicated by the means

reported in the table, homicide is a crime where the offender and victim are typically male.

Hence, even if relative effects for female victims are similar, these estimates from the

demographic composition of homicides suggest that the decline that we find in homicides is

primarily driven by a decline among young adult male victims (ages 18-39).

         Alternately we can also turn to arrests to identify whether the effects are different among

younger or older adult offenders. Appendix Table A1 presents evidence that the decrease in

overall and property crimes are somewhat higher among 18-39 year olds than among individuals

over age 40. On the other hand, the effect of PDMP on violent crimes are generally similar in

magnitude among younger or older adults. It should be noted that, though these relative effects

are more or less similar, the effect sizes imply substantially larger reductions in the total number

of crimes committed by young adult offenders (given that young adults commit more crimes than

older adults).

5.4 Event Study and Timing of the Effects

         We visually present the event study in Figures 1-4. Specifically, Figure 1 presents the

coefficients 𝛽 " from Equation (2) corresponding to dates of mandated access implementation, for

total Part 1 crimes, and Figures 2 and 3 present the corresponding estimates for violent and

property crime rates respectively. Figure 4 separately presents the event study coefficients using

the dates of voluntary PDMP implementation.40

         Our event-study results underscore four points, all of which instill a degree of confidence

to our estimates. First, there is consistent, dynamic evidence that voluntary PDMPs did not


40
  Given the inherent noisiness of the crime data, a limitation not unique to our study, disentangling the timing of the
effects is an imprecise exercise. Furthermore, dynamics in the effect magnitudes (shorter vs. longer term effects, for
instance) may also capture differential effects across early vs. later adopters (Rees et al. 2019), and estimates should
be interpreted with care.


                                                          29
impact crime rates in any significant manner (Figure 4). Given that most of the literature has

found little to no first-order effects of these discretionary programs on opioid misuse, this result

adds confidence to the validity of our model. Second, we find that the lead pre-policy effects are

close to zero (e.g. the coefficients 𝛽 " are statistically indistinguishable from zero for t<0), which

indicate that the reduction in crime only materializes after the implementation of mandatory

PDMP. This suggests that PDMPs were not endogenously implemented in response to changes

in crime trends.

        Third, figures 1-3 suggest that a reduction in crime materializes after the implementation

of the mandatory access PDMPs. These results are also reflected in the expected cost of crime.41

Fourth, there are important dynamics in the treatment effects. For violent crime, the post-policy

effects persist up to our window of observation (4 years); there also appear to be lagged effects

of the policy such that the effects on violent crime get stronger over time. Lagged effects are

indicated in prior work, and plausible, given the time it takes for physicians to learn and become

well-versed in accessing the databases. Also, this makes sense given the potential lags between

restricted access to Rx opioids and substitution into alternate sources or diversion into treatment

(Grecu et al. 2019).42

        For property crime, the post-policy effects are negative for a while but then tend to

rebound back to pre-policy levels by the last year of our observation window. This is consistent


41
   Figure A1 presents the coefficient corresponding to the event study using the dates of modern fully accessible
PDMP systems from Horwitz et al (2018) and the results remained similar. Since the dates presented in Horwitz et
al (2018) are not as recent as those of the PDAPS mandated access, we show a longer event study when using those
dates, where we estimate dynamic effects within a five-year period and impose endpoint restrictions where 𝛽8 = 𝛽̅
if 𝑡 ≥ 6 and 𝛽8 = 𝛽 if 𝑡 ≤ 6. The endpoint restrictions prevent us from assigning unequal weight to cities that
enacted their PDMP particularly earlier or later given that the sample is unbalanced in event time (Kline, 2014;
McCrary, 2007).
42
   Prior work in the context of heroin (Moore and Schnepel 2018) also finds that a supply shock that increased the
price of heroin by 400% resulted in a short term smaller increase in property crimes accompanied by a longer term
decline; indicating that an average post-policy effect may mask important dynamics in the presence of drug
transitions.


                                                        30
with Dobkin and Nicosia (2009) who also found that changes in prices and misuse indicators

related to supply-side interventions, albeit for methamphetamines, were transient and returned to

pre-intervention levels within two years. In terms of non-cost adjusted crime rates, the transient

effects for property crime dominate those for violent crime and hence Figure 1 also suggests that

total crime may revert back within four years. However, when one accounts for the relative

severity of violent crime, cost-adjusted crime rates (Figure 1) – where violent crime carries a

larger weight - continue to show a sustained decline. The discrepancies between crime rates and

cost-adjusted crime rates arise because the more socially costly crimes are the least prevalent.

While a very small change in crime would be unlikely to noticeably change crime rates, the cost-

adjusted measure would capture it if these crimes are costly.

5.5 Robustness Checks and Falsification Diagnostics

Drug Arrests

       One advantage of the arrest data is that they allow separate analyses for drug-related

arrests, which we capitalize on to assess effects on arrests related to specific categories of drugs.

Previous work has reported strong net decreases in opioid misuse among younger adults as a

result of PDMPs (Grecu et al. 2019). Hence, if there is a decrease in Rx opioid misuse, and some

of these individuals are diverted into treatment and do not substitute into other illicit drugs, then

we would not expect strong effects on drug arrests. Drug-related arrest data are subject to

measurement error and the effects of PDMP on drug-related arrest rates are largely imprecise.

       Nevertheless, Appendix Table A3 presents some evidence of a decrease in arrests related

to drugs offenses in general. This decrease is primarily driven by synthetic drugs (manufactured

addicting narcotics such as Demerol and methadone) and by other non-narcotic drugs (e.g.

barbiturates and Benzedrine). Previous literature has found a diversion effect from opioids to




                                                  31
heroin, but our specification does not have sufficient power even though the effects are positive

and suggestive of an increase of about 5% among younger adults. In addition, some recent work

has found that opioids and marijuana may be substitutes, and that medical marijuana may be

associated with a decrease in opioid use and misuse (Liang et al. 2018; Bachhuber et al. 2014).

Consistent with this literature, we find a positive effect on marijuana-related arrests (on the order

of 6%); however, this effect is statistically insignificant at the conventional level and not

consistent across the trend controls.43

Falsification Diagnostics

        As discussed in the previous section, we perform a placebo check similar to the

randomization inference outlined in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) in order to evaluate where

our results fare relative to a placebo analysis where agency-year indicators for whether mandated

access is active are re-shuffled and randomly assigned. For this falsification exercise, we

estimate equation (1) with an iteration-specific “shuffled” or placebo pseudo-PDMP indicator

and repeat this process 300 times. Figures 5 presents the coefficients of these iterations for the

300 placebo parameters alongside the actual main policy effect and visual inspection suggest that

the estimated effect of PDMPs is considerably different from the placebo estimates for the total

crime rates as well as for the cost-adjusted crime rates. Figure A2 presents the coefficients of a

similar exercise using the dates presented in Horwitz et al (2018) and the results remain similar.

Other Specification Checks

        We implemented the following additional checks to verify that our main results are

robust to alternate specifications and adjustments for sampling issues, and to assess and these



43
  We further examine the relationship between drug-related arrests and PDMP implementation using the dates from
Horwitz et al (2018) and those results present evidence of a decrease in arrests related to “other drug” (e.g.
Barbiturates and Benzedrine) that is statistically significant at the conventional level.


                                                      32
results are available upon request. First, we alternately specify the outcome as the crime rate or

the natural log of the count of offenses (or arrests). Second, we estimate models using inverse

hyperbolic sine transformation (that can account for zero cell counts without having to add one

in the log models), fixed effects Poisson and negative binomial specifications. Third, we evaluate

the sensitivity of our results to weighting. In our main analyses, we weight all models by the

agency population, which produces a policy effect that represents an average over individuals (as

opposed to an average over agencies, if the models are unweighted) and can also improve

precision of the estimates since crime rates in a small agency may be more variable over time.

Our coefficient estimates, patterns of results, and general conclusions are not materially affected

by unweighting.

       Fourth, we aggregated up all crime data to the state-year level, and re-estimated all

specifications. Aggregation did not materially impact our results. Finally, in our main analyses

we restricted the analyses to those agencies that consistently reported their crime statistics for

every month of our sample period (that is, reported over all 180 months over our 2003-2017

sample period). As a robustness check we instead use agency-year cells that consistently reported

over all 12 months in a given year, yielding an unbalanced panel of agencies (that still

nevertheless reported consistently over all 12 months in the given calendar year for which we

included their data). All of our estimates, in terms of signs, magnitudes, and statistical

significance, remain robust in this expanded sample.

5.6 Alternate PDMP Measures

       The bulk of the recent literature that has evaluated the effectiveness of PDMPs (for

instance, Grecu et al. 2019; Buchmueller et al. 2018; Ali et al. 2017) stress the importance of

differentiating mandatory access provisions to PDMPs. These studies find strong evidence that




                                                 33
mandatory provisions have effectively reduced measures of opioid misuse. In recent work,

Horwitz et al. (2018) stress another important dimension of such programs, notably when a

state’s full modern, electronic PDMP system became operational and became directly accessible

to users (all key providers, law enforcement). They show that this aspect of PDMP deployment is

significantly and negatively associated with doctor shopping and negatively associated with the

dispensing of Rx opioids.

       Given this evidence of a “first-stage”, that such PDMPs appear to have reduced Rx

opioid misuse, we also assess whether this dimension produces declines in crime consistent with

mandatory access provisions. Appendix Table A4 and A5 utilize these alternate dates of modern,

electronic, and fully accessible PDMP deployment from Horwitz et al. (2018) to assess effects on

crime (based on both offenses known and the arrests). It is validating that these estimates largely

confirm our previously discussed findings; they indicate a significant reduction in total crime as

well as in violent and property crime, on the order of about 4%. Also, figure A1 graphically

presents estimates from the event study analysis of PDMP deployment using the dates presented

in Horwitz et al (2018). Reassuringly, the lead effects are insignificant and close to 0 in

magnitude, suggestive of parallel pre-policy trends between the treated and control states.

Furthermore, where there are reductions in crime, they materialize only after the deployment of

the modern and fully accessible PDMP, with dynamics consistent with those discussed above

with respect to mandatory PDMPs.

5.7 Effects in Context

       Our estimates thus far suggest that mandatory access PDMPs have led to a significant

reduction in overall crime, in both violent and property crime. The effect magnitudes indicate

about a 5% reduction in the total number of offenses overall, and specifically a 7% reduction in




                                                 34
the number arrests among young adults. These are reduced-form estimates that directly link the

policy lever to a key societal outcome. We can combine the reduced-form effect on crime with

the reduced-form effect on Rx drug misuse from the literature to impute an “implied instrumental

variables” (IV) estimate of the structural effect of shifts in Rx drug misuse on crime.44

Specifically, Grecu, Dave and Saffer (2018), based on similar DD and event-study specifications,

find robust evidence that mandatory PDMPs reduced Rx opioid misuse among young adults ages

18-24 by between 26-32% (26% for opioid-related mortality, and 32% for treatment admissions).

Combining these sets of estimates, the implied IV-based elasticity of total crime with respect to

Rx opioid misuse is about 0.2 for young adults.45 This effect in line with the literature relating

other substances (heavy alcohol use, crack cocaine) to crime (Grogger and Willis 2000;

Carpenter 2007; Fryer et al. 2013).

        We can further use these sets of estimates to project the numbers of arrests that could be

prevented at the margin from reducing Rx drug misuse. In 2017, about 2.5 million adults (ages

18-25) misused opioid pain relievers (based on the NSDUH), and law enforcement made about

2.21 million arrests among this age group (based on the UCR Arrest files). The reduced-form

estimates indicate that mandatory PDMP provisions may have decreased the number of young

adult Rx opioid misusers by about 750,000 and decreased total arrests among young adults by

about 154,700. This indicates that for every 5 or so fewer Rx drug misusers, about one arrest

appears to have been averted. Thus, the marginal effect of Rx opioid misuse on arrests is also

about 0.2 (154,700 / 750,000). This compares to an average probability of an arrest relative to




44
   Note that the causal effect of Rx drug abuse on crime (∂Crime / ∂Rx Abuse) can be decomposed as the ratio of
two reduced-form effects: (∂Crime / ∂Rx Abuse) = (∂Crime / ∂PDMP) / (∂Rx Abuse / ∂PDMP)
45
   The reduced-form effect of the policy on crime is about 7% and the reduced-form of the policy on Rx opioid
abuse is about 30% (26-32%), among young adults. Thus, the implied IV elasticity, akin to a Wald estimate, is: (-
0.07 / -0.30) or 0.2.


                                                        35
having ever misused opioids, of about 0.31.46 Hence, the marginal probability implied by our

estimates is reasonable and “in the ball park”; that it is somewhat smaller than the average

probability may imply a concave crime production function with respect to Rx opioid misuse.

        While these imputed estimates help to frame the potential importance of PDMPs in

affecting crime, help derive a structural causal effect of Rx drug misuse on crime, and also help

assess the plausibility of the effect magnitudes, they are meant to be suggestive and should be

interpreted with caution. The implied structural causal effect of Rx misuse on crime assumes that

shifts in Rx opioid misuse are the only proximate channel through which mandatory access

PDMPs affect crime, which appears plausible. Furthermore, small changes in the underlying

reduced-form effects (numerator and denominator of the Wald estimate) can lead to large

changes in the implied structural effect. Finally, the structural effect represents a local average

treatment effect, capturing how Rx drug abuse impacts crime for the marginal misuser who is

deterred from misusing Rx drugs due to the access restrictions (though they may substitute into

other drugs, or transition into treatment and complete abstinence). Nevertheless, this exercise

provides some validation that the effect sizes are of a plausible order of magnitude, being

consistent with prior “first-order” effects of the policy on Rx opioid misuse and also consistent

with descriptive data on the percent of opioid misusers who are arrested.

                                           6.       Conclusion

        The misuse of opioids in the United States has quadrupled in the last 15 years and has

reached epidemic proportions. In an attempt to mitigate opioid misuse almost every state has

implemented a PDMP, and while the early literature on the effects of PDMPs did not find these

programs to be effective, numerous recent studies have found a significant effect of mandatory-


46
   Data from the 2014 NSDUH indicate that among young adults ages 18-24, who had ever misused opioid pain
relievers, 31.1% had reported being arrested.


                                                     36
access PDMPs on both the misuse of opioids and opioid related deaths (Grecu, Dave, and Saffer

2018; Buchmueller and Carey 2018; Alpert, Powell, and Pacula 2017). However, there are costs

associated with PDMPs, particularly mandatory-access PDMPs, and there is still some debate

regarding the appropriateness of PDMP legislation.

         Furthermore, while the recent opioid epidemic has its roots within the formal healthcare

system and originated with the rapid growth in the prescribing of opioid analgesics, it is unclear

how restricting Rx opioids per se within the healthcare system would impact societal outcomes

and population well-being. On the one hand, such restrictions may reduce overall misuse and

adverse health consequences, though there may also be unintended costs due to the possibility

that individuals may substitute to other illicit drugs or more dangerous supply channels to

continue their habit. This study contributes to this debate and presents some of the first empirical

analyses on the broader spillover impact of PDMP mandates on non-health related domains. Our

study also more generally informs the question of how policies that specifically restrict the

prescribing of opioids (and other controlled drugs) impact an important societal outcome, overall

crime.

         We find consistent evidence that stricter and well-deployed PDMPs, but not voluntary

PDMPs, have led to a reduction in criminal activity. Our main estimates suggest that the stricter

PDMP regulations reduced overall crime by about 5%, which is driven by reductions in violent

crimes (4%), specifically homicides, as well as property crime (5%), specifically burglary and

motor vehicle theft.47 Though PDMPs were not implemented as a tool to fight crime, its

implementation has affected crime to an extent comparable to more controversial and costly



47
  The decline in property crime is consistent with a large literature that links substance use to crime and finds
evidence of an economic effect whereby addicts may resort to property crime as a way to fund drug habits
(Carpenter 2007; Silverman and Spruill 1977; Manzoni et al 2006).


                                                          37
policies, such as increasing the size of the police force by approximately 10% (Evans and Owens

2007; Chalfin and McCrary 2007)48.

         The reduction in violent crime, and in particular homicides, may reflect the

pharmacologic and systemic effects linking substance misuse to crime. Prior work has found that

mandatory PDMPs have led to robust reductions in opioid misuse and overdose-related

mortality. Even if some of these individuals are substituting into heroin or alternate underground

supply sources for Rx drugs, the reduction in crime we find implies that on the net the marginal

Rx drug misuser, who is impacted by the PDMP restrictions, has less exposure to the illicit drug

market (which is strongly associated with violence, homicides, and gun-related deaths; Werb et

al. 2011), has less exposure to the pharmacologic effects of the drugs (which may further help to

reduce violence and aggression), and has less of an incentive to resort to crime to fund their drug

addiction.49

         The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Government Accountability

Office (GAO), and the President’s Opioid Commission (U.S. GAO 2009; Christie et al. 2017)

have all stressed that in order for PDMPs to be effective, providers must access the data. They

underscore the importance of moving towards universal registration and utilization, and

recommend that all states institute mandatory access provisions. PDMP mandates are

proliferating, though these mandates continue to face some opposition by physician and dentist

groups on the grounds that they are intrusive, burdensome and difficult to implement in practice,


48
   To put this in cotext, given the cost-weighted crime elasticity of -0.21 to -0.47 of police and crime (Chalfin and
McCrary, 2017), the 4%-6% decrease in the expected cost of total crime driven by the implementation of mandated
access PDMP has an effect comparable to a 10% increase in the police force. Given the high cost of expanding
policing services as the annual salary of a police officer in 2018 is $65,400 as estimated by the Bureau of Labor
statistics (last accessed October 1st, 2019), expanding PDMP to mandated access PDMP may be a cost-effective tool
to fight crime.
49
   While individuals who are already addicted to Rx opioids may enter the underground market to substitute towards
illicit drugs, there will be newer cohorts that will not become addicted to Rx opioids as a result of the restrictions
and hence that substitution would be less likely to occur over time.


                                                         38
take up time that could be otherwise spent treating patients, and can result in substantial punitive

consequences for prescribers (Haffajee et al. 2015). At the end of our sample period, in 2017, 18

states, representing 33% of the population had required that providers must use the PDMP prior

to prescribing a controlled drug; the rest continued to leave PDMP registration and use to the

discretion of the providers or mandated use in limited circumstances. Our estimates for violent

Part I offenses suggest that expanding strict PDMP mandates from the 33% coverage rate to

universal coverage across the U.S. could reduce violent crime by about 3.4% or by about 42,408

offenses.50 This would result in economic cost savings of up to $9.8 billion annually.51 Overall,

these findings specifically provide additional evidence that prescription drug monitoring

programs are an effective social policy tool to mitigate the negative consequences of opioid

misuse, and more broadly indicate that opioid policies can have important spillover effects into

other non-health related domains such as crime that should be considered in any cost-benefit

calculus.




50
   Table 2 and Appendix Table A1 reported that mandatory PDMP provisions reduce violent crime by between 4%
and 6%, or on average 5%. Expanding coverage by 67% (from 33% to universal coverage) would therefore result in
approximately (0.67*5) 3.4% reduction in violent crime. In 2017, the FBI reported 1,247,321 violent Part I crimes
(see https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/table-1). Thus, a 3.4%
reduction translates into 42,408 fewer offenses. Since property crime might be rebounding by the end of our

   McCollister et al. (2010) present crime-specific estimates, combining the tangible and intangible costs, for Part I
and some Part 2 crimes. Aggregating their violent crime estimates, based on the specific shares of each offense in
total violent crimes for 2008, and converting to 2017 dollars yields the total cost of a violent offense as $230,205.

Notes: This event study uses the PDAPS dates of mandatory access implementation. The outcome is violent crime rates (crimes per
100,000 residents) and cost-adjusted violent crime rates. The coefficient corresponding to the year prior to the implementation (t=-1)
of mandated access PDMP is normalized to zero.

Notes: The first two columns present summary statistics for the entire sample. The last two
columns present summary statistics for the subsample used in this analysis. The analysis using
offenses known to police and arrest file are restricted to agencies that reported crimes all 12
months while the Supplementary Homicide Report analysis uses agencies that correspond to a
city of at least 10,000 residents and that report at least one homicide in each year of study.
Offenses known data is available until 2017 and arrest data is available until 2016.

Notes: This event study uses the dates of implementation from Horwitz et al (2018). The outcomes are total, violent and property
crime rates (crimes per 100,000 residents) and cost-adjusted total, violent, and property crime rates. The coefficient corresponding to
the year prior to the implementation (t=-1) of PDMP as defined in Horwitz et al (2018) is normalized to zero.

Notes: This randomization inference exercise estimates the DD specification 300 times after “re-
shuffling” the indicator for whether a state has a PDMP and estimates the total effect of PDMP
implementation as defined in Horwitz et al (2018)
