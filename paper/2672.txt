     This     paper presents a survey of the small, but growing, empiricai liter-

ature by economists on the consequences of comparable worth. It discusses in

turn studies of comparable worth's effects (or potential effects) on the

male/female earnings gap, on feriale employment, on female labor supply and

occupational mobility, and on women     and their families as a group. The

survey   is   critical in nature and areas in which further research is needed

are indicated.

I.   Introduction

     Some two and a half decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act of

1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, it is still cownon to observe

that on average females earn less than males, that females are distributed

across occupations in a manner quite different from that of males, and

that earnings in female dominated occupations tend to be lower than

earnings in male dominated occupations, even after one controls for

traditional proxies for productivity. The frustrations generated by these

outcomes have led to pressure for the adoption of the principle of

comparable worth, or pay equity, a principle that at least one participant

in the debate has called "the women's issue of the l980s."

     In simplest terms, proponents of comparable worth assert that jobs

within a firm can be valued in terms of the skill, effort, and

responsibility they require as well as the working conditions they offer.

Two jobs would be said to be of comparable worth to the firm if they were

comparable in terms of these characteristics. The principle of comparable

worth asserts that within a firm jobs of comparable worth should receive

equal compensation.

     While some efforts to implement comparable worth have taken place in

the private sector, the major push has occurred in the state and local

government sector; a sector of the economy in which both union membership

is growing and a large proportion of the employees are women. Starting

with a 1974 state of Washington study a large number of states have

undertaken formal job evaluation studies to see how their compensation

systems mesh with the principle of comparable worth and a number of state

and local governments have begun to implement comparable worth either
                                             2

throug the legislative or collective bargaining process (see Ehrenberg

and Smith (1987a), Tables 10.1 and 10.2).

        Although proponents and opponents of comparable worth continue to

debate the legitimacy of the concept, to some extent events have passed

them by. Economists protestations to the contrary, the concept of

comparable worth has become widely accepted in the public sector of some

states and the real policy issue is whether the concept should be extended

to other public employees in the state and local sector and to the federal

and private sectors. While debate on this issue viii undoubtedly continue

to be both emotional and political, rational decision making must include

an evaluation of what the empirical consequences of comparable worth are

likely to be. Decision makers either in the legislative             or collective
bargaining processes need to      know   things   such as whether implementation of

comparable worth can be expected to improve female/male earnings ratios

significantly,   whether it   would lead to &      decline   in female employment,

whether it   would induce more women to enter the labor force, whether it
would help or hinder female occupational mobility and reduce occupational

segaentation,and who would "win" and who          would   "lose" from the

implementation of comparable worth.

     To help focus subsequent d.bate, this paper presents a nontechnical

survey of the small, but growing, empirical literature by economists on

the consequences of comparable worth. I discuss in turn studies of the

consequences of comparable worth for male/female earnings gaps, of its

pot.ntial to affect   female   employment adversely, of its effects on female

labor   supply and occupational   .obility, and of its •ffscts on women        anà
                                           3


their    families as a group. The survey is critical in nature and I point
out   areas in which research is needed.

        Before embarking on this survey, however, I should stress that there

are a nuiber of important empirical issues relevant to future policy

debate that I do not discuss. These include the existence of sex bias in

describing or evaluatir -   jobs,   the difficulty (some would argue

impossibility) of devising a single evaluation scheme that can

meaningfully compare the "worth' of all employees in a single firm and

the problem of rater reliability; these are all issues that have been, and

will be, addressed by noneconomists. I also do not discuss a key

theoretical issue of concern to economists, namely whether it makes any

sense to speak of the worth of a job independent of labor market

conditions. Rather, my focus is solely with empirical studies of the

consequences of implementing comparable worth.



II. Cotoar;1,le Worth and the Male/Female Eanins Can

      Estimates of whether implementing comparable worth has a significant

effect on the gap between the average earnings of females and the average

earnings of males have been both ex ante and ex post in nature- Ex ante

studies, which include Ehrenberg and Smith (198Th). Sorensen (1986)

(l987a) (1987b), Johnson and Solon (1986), Aldrich and Buchele (1986), and

Smith (1988), use cross-section data to estimate how much female wages

would increase if comparable worth were implemented in a way the authors

specify. Ex post studies, which include Kahn (1987), Killingsworth

(1987a) (198Th) and Orazem and Matilla (1987) try to infer what has

happened to male and female earnings after the Actual implementation of
                                       4

comparable worth type pay adjustments in the public sector.   I discuss

each type of study in turn.

     A.   Ex Ante Studies

     Most, but not all, states have conducted job evaluations for their

employees based upon the factor point method (Treiman (1979)). The

characteristics of jobs are described and then raters assign point scores

to each job on a number of dimensions. For example, in the widely used

May Point System developed by Hay Associates. these dimensions are "know-

how, 'problem solving", "accountability" and "working conditions' •   while
in the also widely used system developed by Norman D. !Jillis and

Associates. the dimensions are "knowledge and skill", "mental demand",

"accountability" and "working conditions". The points a job receives for

each category are then summed to get a total score, or measure of worth

for the job.

     Assuming that the principle of comparable worth requires that jobs of

equal worth be paid equal wages, one can compute a comparable worth wage

gap (CWtJC), or estimate of how much on average wage levels in female-

dominated jobs (typically taken to be those whose employment is at least

70 percent female) would have to be increased to equal wage levels in

equally rated mate jobs (taken to be those whose employment is at least 70

percent male) as follows; First, estimate a wage equation in which a

measure of the occupational wage (e.g., the starting wage scale, the mid-

range wage scale, or the maximum wage scale in the occupation) in male-

dominated jobs is specified to be a function only of the occupations

total factor point score. Next, compute, in percentage tens, how much

the actual wage in each female-dominated job lie below this estimated male
                                         5

wage   equation; this is an estimate of the magnitude of the comparable
worth   wage adjustment required in each occupation. Finally, weight each

of these individual occupational wage adjustments by the share of

employees in each occupation and then    aggregate across the female
dominated   occupations o come up with the CWWC.

       This was the approach followed by Ehrenberg and Smith (1987a) and

Sorensen (l987a) who together studied pay systems for state government

employees in five states and local government employees in one

municipality prior to any implementation of comparable worth in the

jurisdictions. Of course, in implementing the methodology described

above, the researchers had to decide which wage measures to use (Sorensen

used a single measure Ehrenberg and Smith experimented with starting,

mid-range and maximum salaries), which functional form to use to describe

male wages (Sorensen used a linear equation, Ehrenberg and Smith

experimented with linear and loglinear functional forms), and whether to

enter the four individual factor point scores rather than the total score

as predictors in the male equation (Ehrenberg and Smith experintented with

the four factor point scores because this allows the existing male-

dominated occupational structure to determine the marginal value the state

places on an additional point in each of the four categories, rather than

assuming that only total factor points should affect wages).

       Their results are summarized in Table 1.   CWWC   in   the range of 15.4

to 33.5 percent were found for the six jurisdictions. The range of

estimates for each stats from the Ehrenberg and Smith study occurred

because of all the experimentation they did. However, in each case their

estimates were fairly robust to the methods used.
                                             6

     Given these estimates, one can compute the effect of making such

comparable worth wage adjustments on the relative earnings of men and

women by computing hypothetical wages for alt female and male employees

after such adjustments (assuming these adjustments are made only in

female-dominated occupations and are given to employees of bg,ch sexes

employed in these occupations) and then contrasting the ratio of average

female to average male wages after the adjustments to the ones that

existed before. This was the procedure followed by Sorensen: the

unweighted average (across the six jurisdictions) earnings ratio she

observed before the hypothetical adjustments was 76 percent, while after

the adjustment the average earnings ratio was 87 percent. So, she

concluded chat on average, such comparable worth wage adjustmencs would

reduce the female/mate earnings gap for ovenent emolovees in these

jurisdictions by about 45 percent (11/24).

     For a number of reasons, however, one must be cautious in drawing

conclusions from these numbers about the likely effects of implementing

comparable worth for state employees. First, in some of the states (e.g.

Washington).   the job   evaluations covered only a sample of state employee

occupations; the results may not generalize to other state employee

groups. Second, such wage adjustments raise total, labor costs (on average

Sorensen computes this increase to be 8 percent of payroll) and this

increase in labor costs along with the changing relative costs across

occupations may cause the level and composition of employment across

occupations of males and    females   to   change. Sorensen implicitly assumes
no employm.nt changes in these calculations. Finally, given the political

nature of both the collective bargaining and legislative processes and the
                                       7


constant pressure by groups to improve their job evaluation scores (see

Ehrenberg and Smith (1987a), footnote 17). there is reason to believe that

actual comparable worth wage adjustments that are implemented would not

approach the magnitudes described above. Indeed, as we shall see below.

several studies sugges that in practice they have been much smaller in

several states.

     Private sector ex ante studies, such as Johnson and Solon (1986).

Sorensen (1987b), Aldrich and Buchele (1986) and Smith (1988) have adopted

somewhat different approaches. Johnson and SolDn use a Large national

sample of both private and public sector workers taken from the May 1978

current pooulption Survey and estimate wage equations for males and

females as functions of the individuals personal characteristics (e.g.,

age) industry dummy variables, occupational characteristics variables

(developed by the National Research Council), and a variable measuring the

fraction of an occupation nationwide that is female. In such wage

equations, a larger share of female employment in an occupation is

associated with lower wages.

     Johnson and Solon then interoret the concept of comparable worth to

mean that it would be illegal to have this share influence wages and

simulate how much the average female/male wage gap would be reduced if the

coefficients of the female share were set equal to zero. Depending upon

the specification they use, an overall female/male wage differential of

roughly 41. percent is estimated to decline by 3 to 8 percent when this

restriction is imposed. So comparable worth is estimated to reduce the

overall wage gap by at most one-tenth to one-fifth by them.
                                      B

     A similar calculation was undertaken by Aldrich and Buchele who use a

different sample of data, the National LonEitudinal Surveys, and find that

"comparable worth would reduce the aggregate female/male wage gap by one-

fifth. So their estimate and those of Johnson and Solon are fairly

consistent.

     Finally. Sorensen (l987b) extends and replicates Johnson and Solon's

analysis, using more recent data from the May and June 1983 Current

Population Surveys that permit her to include additional variables (e.g.,

firm size) in her estimated wage equations. Like them, she concludes that

a comparable worth policy would reduce the overall wage-gap by at most

one-fifth. Quite strikingly, however, the potential effect of such a

policy is seen to vary widely across sectors of the economy. While she

estimates the policy might reduce the female/male earnings gap by about

one-third in the public sector, and one-quarter in the nonmanufacturing

private sector (defined by her to include all industries except for

manufacturing and the public sector), at best it would reduce the gap in

manufacturing by only six percent.

     Of course, none of these authors' concept of comparable worth really

corresponds to the definition of comparable worth that proponents expound,

namely equal wages within a firm for jobs of equal value. The authors

control for interindustry and (in Sorensen's case) firm size wage

differentials, but these are incomplete controls for fin-specific wage

differentials.   Other studies also suggest that the magnitud, of the
coefficient of the female occupational employment share variabl, is
sensitive to the variables that are included in   the   wag. equation, with
more controls reducing the magnitude (see for example, Filer (1987)).
                                            9

Moreover, as Johnson and Solon and Sorensen note, their estiaated
comparable worth effects would be diminished if         coverage   of comparable
worth was    incomplete. Formal job evaluations tend to be conducted only by

large firms and Johnson and Solon conjecture that only 40 percent of

workers, namely those mp1oyed by the government sector and large private

firms, would be affected     Assuming that the magnitude       of the female/male

wage gap does not depend upou wtaether an individual employer would be

covered by comparable worth, they further estimate         that the overall effect
of    comparable worth would be to reduce the wage gap by only 1.4 to 3.2

percent, far less than one-tenth of the overall         gap.
       Sorensen's   (1987b) results   are relevant to this point. While

coverage   of workers under comparable worth might be large in manufacturing

where many employees are employed in large establishments (U.S. &areau of

the Census, l985a) her evidence (cited above) suggests that comparable

worth's likely effects would be small in this sector. In contrast, in the

nonmanufacturing private sector, where she estimated comparable worth to

have the potential to reduce the wage gap by a quarter, only a small

fraction of employees would likely be covered. For example, if coverage

was   restricted to employees employed in firms with at least 100 employees,.
only about 49   percent of   the employees in   the service industry and 48

percent in retail trade would be covered (U.S. Bureau of the Census

(1985b) Table 5 and U.S. Bureau of the Census (1985c) Table 5). If

instead the minimum finn size for coverage was set at 500,          these numbers
would    fall to about 29 percent and 38 percent respectively.

       Of course, these crude calculations assume that females and wales are

distributed across different sizes of firms       in   the same manner and that
                                            10

all employees, not just      those in occupations that are predominantly

female, would be      eligible for   comparable worth wage        adjustments.   More

refined calculations are made by Smith (1988) who uses the May 1979

Current Ponulation     Survey data, which have information on individuals'
industry       occupation, and size of employer to estimate the maximum

fraction   of woioen who might have their wages adjusted by a comparable

worth policy. He assumes that only females           employed in jobs      that are   (a)
at   least 60 percent female and (b) are either nonteaching jabs in the

public sector (since it is hard to envision other jobs "comparable" to

teachers in education) or private sector jobs in firms whose employment

was at least 500. would be eligible for such wage adjustments. Using

these criteria he concludes that only 23 percent of females would likely

be covered by comparable worth and that these would tend to be higher paid

women. So overall, comparable worth effects on women's wages might be

even less than Johnson and Solon estimate.

       3. Ex Post Studies

       After a well-publicized strike over the issue, the city of San Jose,

California was the first city in the United States to implement comparable

worth for its employees via the collective bargaining process. Five wage

adjustments to achieve comparable worth took place in San Jose during the

July 1981-July 1984 period. Two studies, Kahn (1987) and Killingsworth

(1987a), provide estimates of what the effects of these adjustments were.

Both   these   studies try to make inferences based upon before-after

comparisons, which require them to infer what would have happened in San

Jose in the post 1981 period in the absence of the adjustments. As the

discussion will indicate, this is not a          simple   task.
                                         11

     Kahn focuses on the wage increases for San Jose city jobs that were

targeted to receive comparable worth increases and contrasts them to the

wage increases in nontargeted city jobs. She finds that during the July

1980-July 1986 period the increases in targeted job wages averaged 74

percent. In contrast, wage increases for other jobs in the city ( just

those that had been part of an original pay equity survey) averaged

roughly 50 percent during the period. Since a similar pattern of relative

wage changes was not observed for the jobs in other nearby local

governments, she concludes that the observed difference in San Jose may

have been due to the comparable worth efforts. I say 'may here because,

while the other job wage scales in San Jose were roughly equal to those in

the surrounding areas in 1980, the wage scales in the jobs targeted to

receive comparable worth increases were somewhat lower in San Jose.

Hence, some of the observed difference in wage increases for the two sets

of jobs in San Jose may simply have been responses to market forces,

although Kahn does note that public sector wages in San Jose in the

targeted (clerical) occupations were higher than private sector wages in

these occupations in San Jose in 1980.

     Killingsworth (l9Sla) focuses his analysis on the 170 full-time job

classifications that were part of the original pay-equity survey. He

finds that between October of 1981 (after the implementation of the first

comparable worth wage adjustment) and July of 1986. mean pay grew by 30.5

percent and 38.1 percent in the male-dominated and female-dominated jobs

respectively, which like Kahns analysis suggests comparable worth may

have had an effect (smaller in his case) on wages in female occupations.
                                       12

     To model more formally whether comparable worth adjustments affected

wages in both the female and male occupations in the city, Killingsvorth

conducts both cross-section and longitudinal econometric analyses. As he

notes, the longitudinal analyses, in particular his fixed and random

effects models, are preferable and I discuss them here.

     In both cases. Killingsworth uses salary data by occupation for

points in time (July 1980. October 1980, October 1981, January 1983.

August 1983, March 1984. April 1985. and July 1986); the first two dates

preceded the implementation of comparable worth, while the latter six

occur during and after the implementation. The logarithm of the salary in

occ_ation i at time C      is   specified to be a linear function of a time

trend term (the number of days between July 1980 and the date), a dummy

variable that takes on the value of one once comparable worth had begun to

be implemented (the last six dates) and zero otherwise, and an occupation

specific effect that is assumed to be either fixed or random. The models

are estimated separately for the male and female occupations and in each

case he interprets the coefficient of comparable worth as indicating by

how much, on average, comparable worth increased wages in these

occupations.

     ltillingsworth finds that on average comparable worth caused male

wages to increase by about 9 percent more than otherwise would have been

the case and female wages to rise by about 12 percent more. As such, he

concludes that comparable worth in San Jose increased female wages by

about 3 percent relative to male wages during the period; this difference

was statistically significant from zero in the fixed effects model but not
                                               13

in the random       effects   model. He thus    finds much smaller   effects for

comparable worth than Kahn         did.
        Killingsworth's findings, however, raise two  questions. First, why
should comparable      worth wage adjustments in female jobs cause wages to
rise faster than would otherwise be the case in gj               jobs?   Indeed, one
fear of critics of comparable worth is that comparable worth wage
increases would be financed by restricting wage increases in other public
sector jobs; one might thus expect comparable worth adjustments to reduce
wage increases in male jobs.
        This   leads to the second question, why        should one assume (as his
model implicitly does) that in the absence of comparable worth
adjustments, wage increases would have increased at a constant rate in San

Jose during the July 1980-July 1986 period. In fact, for the economy as a

whole, average hourly earnings growth varied considerably during the

period,    falling from   over 9 percent in 1980 and 1981 to under 4 percent in

1984,    1985 and 1986. The      effects he attributes to comparable worth may
reflect only nonlinear underlying         trend rates of growth of earnings in San

Jose.

        Killingsworth (1987b) uses essentially the same         methodological

approach       to estimate the effects of three     sets of comparable worth wage

adjustments that were         legislatively   enacted   for Minnesota state employees
between    1983 and 1986 (these became effective in July 1983, July 1984, and

July 1985). He analyzes data for a random sample of 1,000 white male and

1,000 white female employees who were present and active in state

employment during the entire October 1981-April 1986 period and asks

whether, after holding constant changes in personal characteristics and
                                         16

and Smith (1987a; 1987W and Ehrenberg,        Smith and Stratka (1986), who
simulate the effect on female employment in the state and local sector of
imposing comparable worth in the sector and Aldrich and Buchele (1986),
who perform   similar simulations using economy wide private Sector data.
Included in the latter category are Gregory and Duncan's (1981) analyses
of how comparable worth type wage adjustments influenced female employment
in Australia. and Kahn (1987) and Killingsworth (1987a) (1987b) analyses
of how comparable worth wage adjustments in San Jose and Minnesota,
respectively, affected municipal employment and state employment levels in
these jurisdictions.
       Comparable worth wage increases would tend to increase the wages of
female employees relative to male employees within any major occupational
group (e.g., clerical) as females are more likely to be employed in
female-dominated decailed occupational    groups (e.g., secretaries) chat

would receive CWWA increases. Similarly, CWA increases would tend to

increase the average wage costs in those major occupational groups that

contain many female-dominated occupations (ag., clerical) relative to

chose major occupational groups (e.g., blue-collar workers) that contain

fewer female-dominated occupations. As such, one might expect to observe

decreases in female employment, both because of within major occupational

group male/female employment substitution away from female-dominated

detailed occupational groups and because of substitution away from female-

dominated major occupational groups. To the extent that CWVA increases

for   female-dominated groups are not paid for by smaller wage increases
for
      male-dominated groups, average wages    would rise,   which should further
depress both female and male employment.
                                            14

allowing for long-ten pay trends, salary changes were           larger   for women

than for men after the comparable worth wage adjustments. He concludes

that women's wages grew cumulatively by about 7 percent mn and men's

wages by about   1.4 percent   un than     they would have grown during the

period, in the absence of comparable worth. However, again, one must

question his assumptions of constant trend growth rates of earnings for

men and women in the absence of the comparable worth adjustments.

     Orazem and Matilla (1987) use a different approach to estimate the

impact that a comparable worth policy had on the wage gap for Iowa state

employees. Based on a job-evaluation study conducted by Arthur Young and

Associates, a pay equity program was proposed in 1984 for Iowa employees.

However, the proposal, which called for wage decreases for about 40

percent of the covered employees, was subject to considerable political

debate and eventually a "compromise" program was adopted in 1985 that

moderated the wage increases "winners" received and eliminated at]. the

proposed reductions.

     Orazem and Katilla use data on a random sample of state employees and

estimate wage equations for them using individual characteristics, job

evaluation point scores, and     several   other variables, including whether

the employs. was a woman, as explanatory variables. Three different Wage

outcomes are analyzed; the employees actual wage scale as of December

1983 (prior to the comparable worth plan), the employee's wage scale as

proposed under   the   Arthur Young plan, and    the   employee's wage scale after

the implementation of the political        compromise. Focusing on how the
co.ffici.nt of the "female" variabi. changes with the wage outcome used
allow, the authors to escirsate what the effects of the original comparable
                                        15

worth   proposal and the compromise that was adopted were on the male/female
wage differential.
    The precise estimates the author, obtain are     somewhat   sensitive to
the explanatory variable, they include in their estimating equations.
Some of their specifications include private sector market wage rates for

occupations as measured by an annual wage survey conducted by the state - -
presuaably proponents of comparable worth would prefer to see this
variable excluded. Some specifications include the job evaluation point

scores, while others do not. Nonetheless, all tend to suggest that the

pay-equity policy that was actually implemented reduced the unexplained

(by the wage equations) wage gap by about a quarter, while the proposed

policy would have almost completely eliminated the gap.

        In an absolute sense, their estimates suggest that the policy that

was implemented increased the average female state ewployees wage scale

in Iowa by about 1 to 4 percentage points relative to the average males

wage scale. These numbers should be contrasted to an average 8 percentage
point gain that they estimate the original Arthur Young pay equity

proposal would have produced. Comparable worth policies implemented

through the political process do not necessarily lead to 'comparable

worth". Indeed, using analyses very similar to Orazem and Mattila (1987).

Killingsworth (1987b) reaches this same conclusion.



III. Ce.tarable Worth     and Taolanent Levels
        As with studies of the effect of comparable worth on earnings.
studies of the effect of comparable worth on employment have been both ex

ante    and ex post in nature, Included in the former category are Ehrenberg
                                              17

         A.    Ex Ante Studies

         Ehrenberg and Smith (1987a; 1987b) use data from the 1980 Census of

Pornilatio,, grouped by state (for state employees) and SMSA (for local

government employees) to simulate what the likely effect of a 20 percent

wage increase for all female employees in the sectors would be on female

employment there. Their simulations are based on estimates of within-

occupation male/female substitution elasticities obtained from a constant

elasticity of substitution production function specification, and

estimates of across-occupation substitution elasticities obtained from a

translog cost share specification. Because the estimated elasticities

they obtain are quite small, they conclude that a 20 percent increase for

at]. female        employees in the sector would reduce female employment by         only

2   to   3 percent.

         Aldrich and Buchele (1986) apply Ehrenberg and         Smiths approach to

private sector data using three-digit industries, rather than geographic

areas as units of analyses. They obtain very similar employment effects.

predicting that private sector comparable worth wage increases in the

range of 10 to 15 percent would reduce           female employment   by roughly 3

percent       in   that sector.

         While female employment     losses in   each   of these studies   seems   small
and should allay         critics' fears that comparable worth wage increases in

the   U.S. would lead to large female employment losses, it           should be

emphasized         that these estizates are based on cross-section demand
elasticities         that use broad occupational groups (4 in total) and that do

not control for area specific (in th. case of Ehrenberg/Smith) or industr

specific (in the         case of Aldrich/Buchele) factors that might       influence
                                         18

either   male/female employment ratios within occupations or the
occupational distribution of employment. Ehrenb.rg, Smith and Stratka
(1986) use longitudinal data on local government employment and wages from
the Equal Employment Opportunity Coission's EEO-4 dat; to try to control
for such   omitted area specific variables and also use a larger number of

occupational ,categories (8). However, these modifications did not

fundamentally alter any of the conclusion that only small employment

effects would result.

     B. Lx Post Studies

     There are serious data problems (acknowledged by all the authors)

that limit the usefulness of the above studies for public policy

simulations and the simulations are often based on statistically imprecise

parameter estimates. As such, it is useful to turn to the ex post

studies. Cregory and Duncan's (1981) time series study of the Australian

employment experience after the institution of comparable worth type wage

adjustments found that relative (by sex) employment demand elasticities

with respect to relative (by sex) wages were sufficiently small, that the

substantial relative wage increases for women that occurred between 1g75

and 1978 in Australia reduced female employment growth by only

approximately   1.5   percentage points a year. The estimated slowdown in

employment   growth was smallest in the public (close to zero) and service
sectors, and largest in manufacturing. Of course, whether 1.5 percentage
points per year is a small effect should be judged in the context of an

overall female employment growth rate of 3 percentage points per year more
than the male growth rate during the period. Viewed in the context of
this number, the Australian policy reduced the employment growth rate
                                            19


advantage of females vis-a-vis males by one-third (1.51(3.0+1.5)). As

noted above, male employment is also likely to be affected by comparable

worth policies; this was not analyzed by them.

     In later work, Gregory, Anstie, Daly and Mo (1987) present analyses

of the Australian data that cover the 1966-1984 period. While no formal

econometric analyses are conducted in this paper, they note that women

increased their share of hours worked in Australia during the period and

that the growth rate of this share was dominated by a trend with no sharp

slowdown occurring after the large (in the range of 20 percent) comparabli

worth type wage adjustments occurred. From this they conclude that any

relative employment effects of the policy must have been very small,

although they note that they again did not analyze the effects of the

policy on total employment. In fact, Ehrenberg and Smith (1987a) (198Th)

found in their simulations that the potential adverse effect of a

comparable worth policy on female employment in the United States would bi

primarily through its effect on total employment.

     The two studies of the San Jose experience reach conflicting

conclusions. Kahn (1987) finds that municipal employment grew more

rapidly during the 1981-86 period in the San Jose public sector than in

other neighboring cities, that employment in the municipal jobs targeted

for CWWA in   San Jose grew   more rapidly than municipal employment in

nontargeted jobs, and that the share of female employment in these

targeted   jobs actually increased. From this evidence she concludes that

comparable   worth had no adverse employment effects, that higher    wages in

the targeted jobs induced more     female   applicants, and that it was
                                         20

affirmative action, or increased female labor supply in general, that led

to the increases in female employment.

     It is hard to evaluate the validity of Kahn's findings because they

are all based on simple comparisons of trend increases in employment

across occupations in San Jose and/or across local governments in the San

Jose area. Put another way, implicitly she is assuming that in the

absence of comparable worth municipal employment would have grown at the

same rate for all occupations in San Jose and that this rate would have

equalled the growth rate of municipal employment in neighboring cities.

As such, she does not allow for factors other than comparable worth to

influence employment growth and labor supply across occupations and areas.

     Killingsworth (1987a) estimates a fixed effects model using data for

six points in time and the 170 full-time job classifications that were

part of the original San Jose jab evaluation study. The logarithm of

employment in an occupation at each time is specified to be a function

only of the logarithm of the occupational wage at that time, a time trend

term to control for general growth in employment, and occupation specific

dummy variables. Separate equations are estimated for male and female-

dominated jobs and he concludes that negative wage elasticities of demand,

in the range of minus one, exist for both the male and female-dominated

occupations. He attributes the actual employment increases that Kahn

observes to his time trend ten. (which is roughly 9 percent per year for

both mate and female dominated jobs). Given his estimate (sea the

previous section) that the CWWA increased male wages by about 9 percent

and female wages by about 12 percent. he concludes that these wage

adjustments actually "cost" San Jose male municipal employees one year's.
                                        21

and female municipal employees more than one year's employment growth

during the period.

     Killingsworth (1987b) performs similar analyses for Minnesota using

data for 876 male-dominated state jobs and 203 female-dominated state jobs

over 19 quarters during the October 1981-April 1986 period. He again

finds (when starting wage scale data are used) wage elasticities in the

range of minus one for bath wales and females. These, when coupled with

his estimated wage effects reported earlier, suggest that the comparable

worth wage adjustments in Minnesota decreased female employment by about 7

percent and increased male employment by about 1.4 percent during the

1981-1986 period. The estimated female effect is equivalent to a loss of

about one year's employment growth for women.

     Of course, his results for both San Jose and Minnesota are contingent

first on his estimated CWWA effects on male and female wages in these

jurisdictions: as noted in section II, I believe there are problems with

these estimates. Second, his employment equations do not permit

interoccupational substitution (an occupation's wage influences its

employment level only), and assuwe that omitted time specific factors

influence all occupations (in a sex group) identically and at a constant

rate over time. Indeed, no thought is given to the possibility that

comparable worth per se may have influenced the trend rate of growth of

employment (one of Kahn's points) independent of its effects via wage

rate.. While my own   preference   is to prefer rigorous econometric

aod.].ling, such as Killingsvorth's, the jury   is still out on   what

comparable worth's effects have been on municipal employment in San Jose
and state employment in Minnesota.

IV. General Eauiiibrim consider&tions Who Viii Win and Who Will Lose
     The   studies discussed in the previous section ignore   the   partial
coverage   aspect (see section II) of any comparable worth policy that is

likely to be implemented in the United States. If comparable worth has

adverse employment effects in the covered sector, displaced workers may

seek jobs in the noncovered sector and downward pressure on wages there

would result. Even if female employment losses in the covered sector are

low relative to the wage gains induced by comparable worth there, it is

not obvious that women as a group would gain, for women in the low-paid

noncovered sector (see Smith (1987)) might find their wages lowered even

more by the crowding" of displaced workers into that sector.

     Alternatively, increased wages in the covered sector might induce

some of the displaced females to remain "attached" to the covered sector

in the hope of obtaining a now higher-paying job in the future. Thus, the

policy might lead to "wait-unemployment" among females. As is well-known.

in this case the increase in female unemployment may exceed the number of

females displaced by the increase in covered sector wages caused by the

CWA policy,    and the direction that the female wages in the noncovered
sector   would move would depend upon demand elasticities in both sectors

(see Ehrenberg and Smith (1988). Chapter 12, for a more extended

discussion of wait unemployment).

     Of course, in addition to influencing the allocation of female labor

between the covered   and noncovered sectors, CWWA   may also influence female

labor    force participation rates and occupational choice. Higber wages in
some female-dominated occupations might induce more    women to enter the
                                            23

labor force and increase the supply of women to occupations in which the

adjustments took place (Kahn (1987)). Higber wages in these occupations

m*gbt increase       their attractiveness to incumbents and new entrants and
thus    reduce the mobility of women into traditionally male-dominated

occupations.        Finally, higher wages in   traditionally female-dominated

occupations might increase the supply of males to these occupations,

thereby reducing occupational segregation.

        Empirical research relating to these topics has been surprisingly

slim. As noted above, Kahn (1987) found          that   CWWA were associated with

increased female representation in targeted occupations in San Jose.

Beider, Berriheim, Fuchs and Shoven (1987, henceforth BUS) simulate some

of the effects of a policy that raised female wages (like comparable

worth) in a computable general equilibrium model. While their simulations

likely overstate the effects of comparable worth, because the policies

they simulate eliminate all within major occupational group gender

differences in earnings, their results are of interest because they are

the only authors who analyze comparable worth formally in a general

equilibrium    framework empirically.
        BBFS find   that comparable worth would induce more married women to
enter the labor force and that increased employment          for these women would

be   at the expense of employment for males and single women. Despite the
latter's loss of employment, in a distributional sense as a group they
would gain because of      their increased wages. In contrast, married couples

would    los. (increased   employment   of married women would be offset by
decreased employment for some of their husbands) •         and   single men as   a

group   would be the big losers. BZFS also present estimates of efficiency
                                             24

and employment losses under a variety of assumptions about, for example,
coverage of comparable worth (partial or total) • the nature of married
couples'   utility   functions, elasticities of supply and substitution, and

employer hiring rules (applicant fraction or historical fraction) and are
careful to stress the sensitivity of their results to changes in
assumptions. Nonetheless, to keep their model           "computable   they are
forced    to limit it to   only two   occupational   groups (skilled and
unskilled).    This restriction prevents them from addressing a number of

the issues described above.



V.   Cancludint Remarks
     As    this survey   has shown, we   know very little about what the true
"general equilibrium"      effects    of comparable worth are likely to be. The

research described above has cDncentrated heavily on estimating what the

direct effects of comparable worth might be on the female/male wage gap

and what the likely direct effects of comparable worth wage changes might

be on female employment in the covered sector. Although the authors of

the various studies might disagree my evaluation of the evidence is that

it is fairly consistent. The studies surveyed in sections II and III

suggest to me that comparable worths direct effects will be to reduce the

overall female/male wage gap modestly and that this reduction will be

achieved at the cost of only small female employment losses.

     What is missing, how'ver, is much discussion of the true general

equilibrium, or second round effects, that comparable worth is likely to

induce. Will the altered wage structure affect the occupational choices

of males and females in the covered sector and/or employers' hiring
                                     25

decisions? Will the changing wage structure in one sector of the economy

lead to alterations in the wage structure in the rest of the economy?

Will higher mandated wages in female-dominated jobs lead to higher

implicit hiring standards, or employers compensating by providing less on-

the-job training? Will these higher wages reduce female occupational

mobility over the life-cycle and female earnings growth rates (see

Hashimoto (1982) for evidence that minimum wages affect earnings growth

rates)? Analyses of issues like these should be on the agenda of

comparable worth researchers.
