Staggered Price Indexation

                                          ABSTRACT

Empirical studies using micro data find that about two thirds of all product prices do not change
in a given quarter. This evidence has been interpreted as indicating the absence of price
indexation. Further, models of staggered price setting without indexation interpret all price
changes as optimal. However, the empirical evidence is mute with regard to whether price
changes are optimal or not. To reconcile the possibility of price indexation with the micro
evidence on the frequency of price changes, I modify the Calvo sticky price model by allowing
each period a fraction of randomly picked prices to change optimally, another fraction of
randomly picked prices to change due to indexation, and the remaining prices to be constant. The
paper presents five main findings: (1) with staggered price indexation the Phillips curve
includes a state variable that carries information about all past inflation rates; (2) as the degree
of staggered price indexation increases, the Phillips curve becomes flatter; (3) staggered
indexation dampens the short-run effect of monetary policy on inflation and amplifies its effect
on output; (4) fixing the probability of a price change to 33% per quarter (in accordance with the
empirical evidence), a small-scale new-Keynesian model estimated on U.S. data yields a
probability of indexation of 19% per quarter (and therefore a probability of an optimal price
change of 14% per quarter); and (5) according to the estimated model, staggered indexation
explains more than half of the observed persistence of inflation in the United States.

1     Introduction
Empirical studies using micro data find that product prices change with a probability of
about 33% per quarter (e.g., Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008). The fact that prices don't
change every quarter is often interpreted as indicating the absence of price indexation. Fur-
ther, models of staggered price setting without indexation assume that all price changes are
optimal. However, the empirical evidence is mute with regard to whether price changes are
optimal or not. In this paper, I modify the Calvo sticky price model by allowing a fraction
of randomly picked prices to change optimally, another fraction of randomly picked prices
to change due to indexation, and the remaining prices to be constant.
    Staggered price indexation introduces a new dimension of payoff-relevant states in the
pricing problem of the firm. The reason is that in any given period, say t, given the path of
all aggregate variables, a firm that gets to choose its price optimally takes into account that
it can arrive at any given future date, say t + j , with a multitude of different possible prices,
depending upon whether and when it got the chance to index its price between periods t and
t + j . Thus, its expected profit in period t + j depends not just on the accumulated inflation
between periods t and t + j , as is the case under the standard indexation scheme, but on the
expected inflation rate at every individual date within that period. In other words, the firm's
expected present discounted value of profits features a double summation: the standard one
over time horizons, capturing the presence of price stickiness, and an additional nested one
over the length of each time horizon, capturing the presence of staggered price indexation.
    The paper has two main theoretical findings: First, with staggered price indexation the
Phillips curve includes a state variable that carries information about all past inflation rates.
This state variable is the inflation rate of the basket of goods whose prices get to be indexed
in the current period. In turn, this state variable takes the form of a geometric distributed
lag of all past inflation rates, with a weight coefficient equal to the degree of price stickiness
(0.66 if one uses the evidence reported at the top of this introduction). The second theoretical
finding is that the slope of the Phillips curve as well as its expected-inflation coefficient are
decreasing in the degree of staggered price indexation. Intuitively, given the total number of
goods whose prices can change each period, the larger is the number of goods whose prices
are indexed to past inflation, the fewer will be the number of goods whose prices can be
adjusted in response to current or future expected disturbances in marginal costs.
   The staggered price indexation model nests as special cases the standard Calvo model
without price indexation and the Calvo model with the standard form of price indexation
(i.e., one in which each period all prices that are not adjusted optimally are indexed to past
inflation). For simplicity the formulation considered in this paper assumes full indexation to


                                                1
past inflation. Allowing for partial staggered indexation is relatively straightforward.
   The empirical contribution of the present investigation is an econometric estimation of
the degree of staggered price indexation and an assessment of its contribution to explaining
inflation persistence in the United States. Fixing the probability of a price change to 33%,
(in accordance with the available micro-data evidence), a small-scale new-Keynesian model
estimated on U.S. data yields a probability of indexation of 19% per quarter (and therefore
a probability of an optimal price change of 14% per quarter). Thus, according to this
estimate, more than half of all price changes observed each period are indexatory in nature.
The estimated model does a good job at explaining the dynamics of output, inflation, and
the nominal interest rate. Shutting off staggered price indexation causes a drop in the serial
correlation of inflation from 0.71 (which coincides with its observed value) to 0.30, suggesting
that staggered indexation explains more than half of the observed persistence of inflation in
the United States. The intuition behind this result is straightforward; the larger the fraction
of goods that are updated on the basis of past changes of the general price level is, the larger
the correlation of current inflation with past inflation will be. Finally, an analysis of impulse
responses shows that staggered indexation dampens the short-run effects of monetary policy
shocks on inflation and amplifies their effects on output.
   This paper is related to a large body of empirical and quantitative work on price stickiness,
indexation, inflation persistence, and the Phillips curve, too large to allow for an exhaustive
account. On the empirical front, the evidence on the frequency of price changes used in this
paper comes from Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) who, using micro data underpinning the
U.S. consumer and producer price indices, find that after accounting for sales, the frequency
of price changes is about 11 percent per month. Earlier, Bils and Klenow (2004), without
controlling for sales, had found a frequency of price changes almost twice as large, 21 percent
per month. The present paper contributes to this literature by showing that knowing what
fraction of prices change each period might not suffice to ascertain how much price stickiness
there is in the data, for holding this fraction constant, the partition between optimal and
indexatory price adjustments can be key for understanding the dynamics of inflation. An
early study on the difficulties of models with nominal rigidity in replicating observed inflation
persistence is Fuhrer and Moore (1995). Pioneer work on estimating medium-scale DSGE
models with nominal rigidity and indexation are Christiano et al. (2005) and Smets and
Wouters (2007). These papers estimate a standard form of price indexation under which
all prices change every period. The present paper extends the standard model of price
indexation by assuming that this type of price updates are staggered over time as opposed
to taking place every period. In this way, the aggregate model is in line with the fact that
individual prices do not change every period.


                                               2
   More closely related is the hybrid sticky-price model of Gal´
                                                               i and Gertler (1999). As in
the present model, in the hybrid model each period there is a fraction of firms that cannot
change their prices. The difference between the two formulations arises when firms get to
update prices. Specifically, the hybrid model assumes the existence of two types of firms.
One type always adjusts prices in an ad-hoc, backward-looking fashion and the other type
always adjusts prices in an optimal, forward-looking fashion. By contrast, in the staggered
indexation model developed in this paper all firms are optimizing and forward looking. As
a result, differently to what happens in the hybrid model, under staggered indexation when
firms get the chance to change their price optimally they internalize that there will be random
spells of time in which they will have to keep the price fixed and spells in which they will
have to index to past inflation. This feature endogenously introduces a state variable in
the Phillips curve that depends not just on last-period's inflation but on the entire history
of inflation rates. Importantly, the law of motion of this state variable is endogenous, so
that the loading of any past inflation is determined within the model. This means that the
staggered indexation model differs in relevant ways even from formulations of the hybrid
model in which the backward-looking firms are assumed to index to an average of any
number of past inflation rates, as it provides a theory of what the weights on this average
should be. Quantitatively, the staggered indexation model places a relatively high weight
on the forward looking component of the Phillips curve. The coefficient on future expected
inflation is estimated to be more than ten times as large as that on the backward-looking
state variable. Although the estimation strategies and samples are different, in the baseline
estimation of the hybrid model reported in Gal´i and Gertler (1999) this ratio is below three.
This ratio, however, does not represent a sufficient statistic for the ability of either model
to explain inflation persistence, for the introduction of backward-looking firms or staggered
indexation also affects the marginal cost coefficient of the Phillips curve and, in the case of
staggered indexation, introduces long memory in the backward-looking term. As mentioned
above, the general equilibrium effect of staggered indexation is estimated to be significant,
accounting for more than half of the predicted serial correlation of inflation.
   A number of papers have attempted to disentangle the roles played by indexation and
the monetary regime in inducing inflation persistence, see Woodford (2007) for a conceptual
argument and Benati (2008) and Cogley and Sbordone (2008) for empirical investigations.
Ascari and Branzoli (2010) show that partial indexation to past inflation `
                                                                          a la Christiano
et al. (2005) can be optimal in models with staggered price setting and trend inflation.
Kurozumi and Van Zandweghe (2019) show that introducing trend inflation and a Kimball-
type non-CES aggregator in the Calvo model gives rise to lags of inflation in the Phillips
curve, despite having only forward-looking, optimizing price setters. The recent subdued


                                              3
response of inflation to relatively large swings in aggregate activity, especially since the onset
of the great contraction of 2007-2009, has revitalized a literature that aims to document and
explain changes in the slope of the Phillips curve (Del Negro et al., 2020; Stock and Watson,
2019; Gal´
         i and Gambetti, 2018; and McLeay and Tenreyro, 2019, among others). This paper
contributes to this literature by identifying a new channel through which the slope of the
Phillips curve can be affected.
    The paper proceeds in six sections. Section 2 presents the model with staggered price
indexation. Section 3 derives the Phillips curve under staggered price indexation. Section 4
presents a numerical illustration to shed light on the role of staggered price indexation in
producing inflation persistence and amplification. Section 5 estimates the degree of staggered
price indexation in the context of a small-scale new-Keynesian model on U.S. data. Section 6
uses the estimated model to ascertain how much of the observed inflation persistence in the
United States is accounted for by staggered price indexation. Section 7 concludes.


2     The Model
Consider an economy populated by a large number of identical households with preferences
given by
                                            
                                       E0          t U (ct , ht),
                                            t=0

where ct denotes consumption in period t, ht denotes hours worked, U (·, ·) is the period
utility function, assumed to be increasing in its first argument, decreasing in its second
argument, and concave,   (0, 1) denotes the subjective discount factor, and Et denotes
the expectations operator conditional on information available in period t.
    Every period t  0 households face the budget constraint

                         Pt ct + Bt + Tt = (1 + it-1 )Bt-1 + Wt ht + t ,

where Pt denotes the nominal price of consumption, Wt denotes the nominal wage rate, Bt
denotes holdings of a nominally riskless, one-period bond issued by the government in period
t, t denotes nominal profit income, and Tt denotes lump-sum taxes paid in period t. Bonds
issued in period t pay the nominal interest rate it in period t + 1.
   The household chooses processes {ct , ht, Bt }t=0 to maximize its lifetime utility function
subject to the above sequential budget constraint and to some borrowing limit that prevents
it from engaging in Ponzi-type games. Letting  tt /Pt be the Lagrange multiplier on the
period budget constraint, the first-order conditions of the household's optimization problem

where t  Pt /Pt-1 - 1 denotes the inflation rate, and wt  Wt /Pt denotes the real wage
rate.

and represents the minimum cost of one unit of the composite consumption good.
   The firm producing variety i operates in a monopolistically competitive market. The
production technology is linear and uses labor and is buffeted by exogenous productivity
shocks. Specifically, output of variety i is given by

                                              yit = eat hit,                                  (6)

where yit denotes output of variety i in period t, hit denotes labor input used in the production
of variety i, and at denotes the productivity shock.
      The main innovation of the model is in the formulation of nominal rigidity. The model


                                                           5
builds on Calvo (1983) and Yun (1996). Each period, firm i  [0, 1] gets to change its price
with constant probability 1 - . Thus, the probability of being stuck with the previous
period's price is . The point of departure from the Calvo-Yun model is that in the present
formulation having the right to change the price is not equal to having the right to choose the
price optimally. Specifically, I assume that with probability  the firm indexes its price to
past inflation. Thus, each period the firm chooses its price optimally with probability 1- -.
I refer to this price-setting mechanism as staggered price indexation. The parameter  resides
in the interval [0, 1 - ]. The special case  = 0 corresponds to the standard Calvo-Yun
model. The special case   (0, 1) and  = 0 corresponds to the Calvo-Yun model with
standard indexation--i.e., a model in which all prices that are not set optimally are indexed
to past inflation.
   Let Pit be the price charged in period t by a firm i  [0, 1] that gets to set its price
optimally in period t. In period t + j , j  0, a firm that has not gotten the permission to
set its price optimally since period t and has not gotten the permission to index since period
t + k , k  j , charges the price Pit Pt+k-1 /Pt-1 .1 The probability of this event conditional on
information available in period t is [( + )k-1]I (k>0) j -k , where I (k > 0) is the indicator
function taking the value 1 if k > 0 and 0 otherwise.
    At the posted price, firms commit to meet demand. Then, a firm i that gets to optimize
its price in period t chooses Pit and employment to maximize the present discounted value
of profits,

features a double summation. The summation over k reflects the fact that the firm can
arrive at period t + j with k + 1 different possible prices, depending on the period in which it

where  j   t
               [( + )k-1]I (k>0) j -k µit+j,k   is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the firm's
participation constraint. The interpretation of these optimality conditions is the same as
in the standard sticky-price model: The second condition says that at the optimum, the
Lagrange multiplier on the participation constraint equals the firm's marginal cost. The first
condition states that the firm picks the price Pit in period t so that the demand-weighted
present discounted value of discrepancies between marginal cost and marginal revenue is nil.
The difference with the standard model is that here the firm faces a larger set of payoff-
relevant future states, due to the presence of staggered price indexation.


2.1      The Government
Monetary policy takes the form of a Taylor-type interest-rate feedback rule of the form
                                                                      y
                                  1 + it        1 + t            yt
                                         =                                et ,                         (9)
                                  1+i           1+               y

where yt is aggregate output, to be defined later,  is the central bank's inflation target, i
and y are the steady-state values of it and yt, respectively, and t is an exogenous monetary
shock.
   The fiscal authority consumes no goods and maintains a passive fiscal stance, in the sense
that it sets lump-sum taxes, Tt , to guarantees fiscal solvency independently of the paths of
the price level or the nominal interest rate.


2.2      Equilibrium
The key step in characterizing the equilibrium conditions of the present model is to express
the firm's optimality condition (7) in recursive form. To this end, we proceed as follows:
The firm's optimality condition (8) shows that the Lagrange multiplier µit,k is independent
of i and k , so we will write it without these two subscripts. Then we have

                                                        wt
                                                µt =         ,                                        (10)
                                                        e at

                                                    7
for all t  0. Similarly, since the firm problem features no idiosyncratic state variables other
than its own price, all firms choosing the price optimally in a given period pick the same price,
which allows one to drop the subscript i from Pit . Now let's split optimality condition (7) in
                                                                                      1

                                                             2
and the present discounted value of marginal costs, denoted zt . Formally, let

                                          j                                                                  1-

           zt = Et      j                         [( + )k-1 ]I (k>0)j -k ct+j
                   j =0
                          t                                                                    Pt+j Pt-1
                                         k=0


and                                                                                                    -
                                              j
              2             t+j                                                            Pt Pt+k-1
             zt = Et      j                       [( + )k-1 ]I (k>0) j -k ct+j                             µt+j
                     j =0
                            t                                                              Pt+j Pt-1
                                          k=0

So that, by equation (7), we have that

                                                              1    2

To write the first of the above three expressions recursively, begin by rewriting it as

zt = Et           j        ct+j                                    +           ( + )k-1 j -k ct+j

Now define

in period t in terms of the composite consumption good, one can write zt  and zt  recursively

Appendix A presents a detailed derivation of equation (14). The derivation of equation (13)

is analogous. Similarly, one can write zt recursively as

This completes the recursive representation of optimality condition (7).
   In equilibrium, a fraction  of all firms is stuck with the previous period's price, a fraction
1 -  -  sets their optimal price Pt , and the remaining  firms index their price to past
inflation. So the price level given in equation (5) can be written as

                         Pt1- = Pt1 -
                                  -1 + (1 -  - )Pt

where Ix denotes the set of goods whose prices are indexed in period t. By definition, Ix has
measure . A firm that has not optimized since period t - j and gets to index in period
t charges the price Pt-j Pt-1 /Pt-j -1 . The size of this cohort in period t - j is 1 -  - .
Of these firms, a fraction ( + )j -1 arrives in period t - 1 not having gotten the right to
optimize again, and of these a fraction  receives the permission to index in period t. So we
have that
                                                                        1-

Define the price level of the basket of goods whose prices are indexed in period t as
                                                                1

Then, we can write equations (18) and (19), respectively, as

Equation (21) can be written recursively as (see section B of the appendix for a proof)

                                                                      1-

          x
Let 1 + t    Ptx /Pt-1 . The variable t x
                                          is the rate of inflation of the basket of goods whose
prices are indexed in period t. To see this, note that since the right to index is random across
goods, the price level of this basket of goods in period t - 1 is Pt-1 . Then, after shifting the
time subscript one period forward, we can write (22) as

                   x      1-             1-
              (1 + t +1 )    = (1 -  - )pt  (1 + t )1- + ( + )(1 + t

                                                                     ) .                                 (23)

                                     x
The inflation rate of indexed goods, t , is a predetermined state variable, because both Ptx
and Pt-1 are determined prior to period t. Similarly, we can write equation (20) as

                                                                                           x    1-

   Let us now derive an expression for aggregate output, which, as mentioned earlier, we
denote by yt . Clearing of the labor market requires that
                                                              1

In the goods market output of each variety must equal demand,
                                                                          -

                                         e hit = ct                             .
                                                                  Pt

Integrating over varieties and using the above labor resource constraint yields

                                                          1                 -
                                    at                             Pit
                                   e ht = ct                                    di.                      (25)

The integral on the right-hand side of (25) is a measure of price dispersion that arises
naturally in models of staggered price stickiness. As shown next, the presence of staggered

By the same argument used to derive equations (20) and (22), in equilibrium this equation

is a measure of price dispersion among goods whose prices are allowed to be indexed in
period t. This variable is backward looking, adding persistence to the general measure
of price dispersion St , relative to the standard Calvo-Yun model. Defining st  St/Pt
and sx      x
      t  St /Pt-1 , we can write equations (26) and (27) as the following two expressions
describing the equilibrium dynamics of price dispersion:

                                                     -            x-
                      s-
                       t  = (1 + t) s-
                                     t-1 + (1 -  - )pt + (1 + t ) st                                      (28)

and
                           sx -                    - -         x-
                            t+1 = (1 -  - )(1 + t ) pt + ( + )st  .                                       (29)

The variables st-1 and sx
                        t are predetermined states. Finally, using this definition, we can
write equation (25) as
                                                     y t = ct ,                                           (30)

3      The Phillips Curve with Staggered Price Indexation
To understand the role of staggered price indexation in equilibrium, this section derives the
Phillips curve that arises from a linearized version of the equilibrium conditions around a
zero-inflation steady state. The main result of this section is that the Phillips curve under
                                                                            x
staggered price indexation includes a new term featuring the state variable t , the inflation
rate of the basket of goods that get to be indexed in period t. Formally, the Phillips curve
takes the form

                                                        x
                                 t =  Et t+1 + µ µt + x t ,                                 (32)

                                                                                      x
where hatted variables correspond to the log deviations of µt , 1 + t , and 1 + t       from
                                                                                    x
their deterministic steady-state values. Equation (33) says that the state variable t carries
information about all past inflation rates. The higher the degree of price stickiness, the larger
                                 x                  x
the effect of past inflations on t . The loading of t on t the Phillips curve, given by the
parameter x depends on , the fraction of prices that are indexed each period. In particular,
x is increasing in  and vanishes at  = 0. The next two sections show that this property
of the Phillips curve under staggered indexation has a significant role in determining the
persistence of the rate of inflation in equilibrium.
   As shown later in this section, equation (32) nests the Phillips curves of two special
economies, one with no indexation ( = 0), and one with full indexation ( = 0). Setting
 = 0, equation (32) becomes

                                             (1 - )(1 - )
                            t = Ett+1 +                   µt
                                                   

which is the familiar expression implied by the standard Calvo-Yun model. Setting  = 0,
                    x
the state variable t  collapses to t-1, and the Phillips curve becomes

                                       (1 - )(1 - )       1
                     t =      Et t+1 +              µt +    t-1                             (34)
                           1+              (1 +  )       1+
                                      x
    One might find it surprising that t does not depend on the probability of indexation,.
           x
After all, t is the inflation rate of the basket of goods whose prices got the permission to
                                                                x
be indexed in period t. To build intuition for this property of t , let us deconstruct its law
of motion, given in equation (33) (a formal derivation appears later in this section). Of the
set of goods that are indexed in period t + 1, the fraction of prices that are increased by

                                               12
exactly t is given by the fraction of goods whose prices are allowed to change in period t,
namely, 1 -  -  prices that are optimized in period t plus  prices that are indexed in
t, for a total of 1 -  prices. The fraction of indexed prices that will increase by exactly
t + t-1 in t + 1 is given by the fraction of prices that were allowed to change in t - 1
but not in t, that is, (1 - ). Similarly, the fraction of indexed prices that will increase by
exactly t + t-1 + t-2 in t + 1 is 2 (1 - ). In general, the fraction of indexed prices that
will increase by exactly t + t-1 + · · · + t-j in period t + 1 is (1 - )j . So we have that
 x                               2                                x
t +1 = (1 -  )[t +  (t + t-1 ) +  (t + t-1 + t-2 ) + · · · = t +  t , which is precisely
equation (33).
                                                         x
   To derive the Phillips curve and the law of motion of t (equations (32) and (33)), begin
by linearizing equilibrium conditions (11), (12), and (15). This operation yields

                               1     1 -  ( + ) 11     12
                              zt =             zt +     z ,
                                        1 -         1 -  t

                               2     1 -  ( + ) 21     22
                              zt =             zt +     z
                                        1 -         1 -  t
and
                                             1    2
                                            zt = zt .

In deriving these linearizations and those of the other equilibrium conditions of the model, it
is of use to first calculate the steady state of the model under zero inflation. This information
appears in appendix C. Combining the above three linear expressions gives

                             12    22      1 -  ( + ) 11      21
                            zt  - zt  =-             (z t - z t  )                          (35)
                                               

Linearizing equations (13) and (16) we have

Subtracting the second of these two expressions from the first, one can write

Using equation (35) to eliminate zt  - zt  and zt +1 - zt+1 and rearranging gives

                     1 -  ( +  )

Comparing (36) and (37) yields the restriction

(1-)pt - (+)(1-)Etpt+1 +t-(1- (+))Ett+1 -(1- (+))(1-)µt-Ett+1 = 0

To eliminate pt and pt+1 log-linearize equation (24). This yields
                                                          x
                                             ( +  ) t -   t
                                      pt =                                                    (38)
                                               1--

Combining the last two equations yields

 [(1 - ) + [1 +  (1 - (1 +  + ))]]t = [ (1 - ) + (1 - )]Ett+1
                                                        +(1 - )(1 - 2 - )t
                                                                         x


                                                        +[1 -  ( + )](1 - )(1 -  - )µt ,

Dividing both sides by the coefficient on t yields the Phillips curve (32) as desired. It is
straightforward to see that setting  = 0 the Phillips curve collapses to its standard form
given by equation (34) and that setting  = 0 it becomes the Phillips curve implied by a
model with the standard form of indexation, given in equation (34).
                                                            x
   Let's now derive the law of motion of the state variable t given in equation (33). Log-
linearizing equation (23) evaluated in period t + 1 yields

                           x                                x
                           t +1 = (1 -  - )(pt + t ) + ( + )t .                               (39)




                                                14
Now using equation (38) to eliminate pt one obtains

                                       x           x
                                       t +1 = t +  t


which is equation (33).


4     The Effects of Staggered Price Indexation
How does staggered indexation affect aggregate dynamics? It is natural to think that if, as
in the standard Calvo-Yun model, all of the 1 -  prices that change every period adjust op-
timally, inflation will be more responsive and aggregate activity less responsive to aggregate
disturbances than if a nonzero fraction  of these 1 -  prices adjust autonomously to past
inflation.
   Figure 1 confirms this intuition. It plots the response of inflation and output to a
contractionary interest-rate shock, 0 = 1 , with persistence equal to 0.5 (this shock ap-
pears in the interest-rate feedback rule (9)), and to a positive permanent technology shock,
z0  a0 - a-1 = 1, with persistence equal to 0.3 (at appears for the first time in the pro-
duction function, equation (6)). The impulse responses are computed for three values of ,
0, 0.1, and 0.2. The fraction of prices that remain unchanged each period is kept constant
and equal to 66% ( = 0.66), in accordance with the available micro evidence. The param-
eterization of the model is described in detail in the notes to the figure. The key message
of this exercise is that, in line with the intuition given at the beginning of this section, an
increase in the degree of staggered price indexation, , causes a smaller and flatter short-run
response of inflation and a more pronounced response of output.
   The result that the short-run response of inflation to aggregate shocks becomes more
muted as the degree of staggered price indexation increases suggests that inflation persis-
tence could be increasing in , the parameter measuring the fraction of prices that are
indexed to past inflation each period. Figure 2 shows that this is indeed the case under the
illustrative parameterization we are considering in this section. It displays the serial corre-
lation of inflation as a function of . The economy continues to be driven by the monetary
shock, t, and the permanent technology shock. zt = at - at-1 , which, as before, follow
AR(1) processes with serial correlations of 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. The innovations to both
processes are assumed to have standard deviations equal to 0.01. All other parameter values
are as described in the notes to Figure 1. Figure 2 shows that staggered price indexation
can have a significant effect on the persistence of inflation. In this illustration, the serial
correlation of t almost doubles as  increases from 0 to 0.33.

    The degree of staggered price indexation, , affects inflation persistence not only by
                                             x
increasing the loading of the state variable t on inflation in the Phillips curve, but also
by affecting the slope of the Phillips curve (the loading of marginal cost, µt , on inflation),
and the loading of expected inflation on inflation itself. To see this, Table (1) displays the
                                                               x
coefficients of the Phillips curve, t =  Et t+1 + µ µt + x t     , for  = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.
As the degree of staggered price indexation increases, the Phillips curve becomes flatter (µ
falls) and less responsive to expected inflation ( falls). Intuitively, as  increases, holding
constant the total number of firms that can change prices each period, 1 - , fewer firms
will update their prices in response to current or future expected disturbances and more will
simply limit themselves to charging past inflation.
    The last three columns of table 1 show that this effect is reflected in the policy func-
                                                                       x
tion of inflation. The present model features one endogenous state, t    , and two exogenous
states, namely, the permanent technology shock, zt , and the monetary shock, t.2 Thus, the
equilibrium dynamics of inflation are a function of these three variables and up to first order
                          x
can be written as t = x t   + z zt +  t,. The table displays the parameters of this policy
function for the three values of  considered. In line with the intuition given above, as the
degree of staggered price indexation increases, inflation becomes more sensitive to changes in
x
t , the inflation rate of the basket of goods whose prices are indexed in t, and less sensitive

    The model also includes the state variables st and sx t , measuring price dispersion. However, It can be
shown that with zero steady-state inflation, these state variables are irrelevant up to first order.

to exogenous shocks to technology or monetary policy.
   The effects of staggered price indexation on the slope of the Phillips curve (µ ) and on
the persistence coefficient (x ) characterized in this section are relevant in light of the fact
that existing empirical studies of price dynamics based on micro data do not provide much
information on which fraction of observed price changes are optimal and which indexatory.
In other words, based on the information provided by existing empirical studies, the four
economies shown in table 1 have the same degree of price stickiness. This observation
motivates the need to gauge the value of . The next section uses aggregate data to infer
the value of this parameter.


5     Estimating the Degree of Staggered Price Indexation
This section estimates a version of the new-Keynesian model of section 2 on U.S. data, with
the aim to extract information about , the new parameter introduced in the proposed model
of staggered indexation. To make the model amenable to estimation, it is augmented with
three additional sources of uncertainty, a real friction taking the form of habit formation,
and a more realistic monetary policy rule, which incorporates interest-rate smoothing,
   Specifically, the model is now driven by five shocks: a preference shock, denoted t , a
labor-supply shock, denoted t , a government purchases shock, denoted gt , a technology
shock, denoted at, and a monetary shock, denoted t . The technology and monetary shocks
were introduced already in section 2. The technology shock is assumed to have a nonsta-
tionary component. Specifically, the law of motion of at is assumed to be

                                        at = at-1 + zt ,

where zt, the growth rate of technology is assumed to be a stationary random variable with

    With habit formation, the period utility function takes the form

which individual households take as exogenous,  is a parameter measuring the degree of
(external) habit formation, 1/ is the Frisch labor supply elasticity, and  is a scaling
parameter. Upper case letters are used to indicate variables that have a stochastic trend
inherited from at. In equilibrium, all households consume identical quantities of goods, so

   Government spending is assumed to be exogenous and given by

                                               Gt = g

where gt is a stationary random variable with mean 0, and g   ¯ is a parameter. Scaling Gt by
the nonstationary productivity factor, eat , is necessary to prevent public consumption from
vanishing over time.
    The interest-rate feedback rule is augmented to allow for interest-rate smoothing. This
feature has become a standard component of monetary policy in estimated new-Keynesian
models. Specifically, the Taylor rule (9) now takes the form

                                               I                              y 1-I

where I  [0, 1) is the interest-rate smoothing parameter. As explained next, the estimated
model allows for persistence in all shocks, including the monetary shock, t. Since this shock
is indistinguishable from trend inflation (i.e., from replacing the constant  that divides
t in the Taylor rule by a random variable), the econometric estimation makes staggered
indexation and trend inflation, among other shocks and frictions, compete for the data.
This race is motivated by the work of Cogley and Sbordone (2008).
   All five shocks are assumed to follow exogenous AR(1) processes. Formally, for v =
, , , z, g it is assumed that
                                                                 v
                                     vt+1 = v vt + v             t+1 ,

where v and v are parameters and           t   is an i.i.d. disturbance with standard normal distri-
bution.
   The equilibrium conditions of the model are identical to those listed in Definition 1 in
section 2, except for the household's optimality condition (1), which in stationary form be-
comes (ct - e-zt ct-1 )-1 = t , and the resource constraint (equations (30) and (31)) which
becomes yt = est ht = ct + g
                           ¯egt . To render the equilibrium conditions stationary, all endoge-
nous variables other than ht , t , and it are detrended by the nonstationary productivity
shock, eat . So, for example, ct  Ct e-at .
   As in much of the DSGE literature, the estimation strategy consists of estimating a subset
of the parameters of the model and calibrating the remaining ones using standard values in
business-cycle analysis. The set of estimated parameters includes the degree of staggered
price indexation, , which is the focus of the present section, along with other parameters
that play a central role in determining the model's implied short-run dynamics, such as those

governing habit formation, monetary policy, and the stochastic properties of the underlying
sources of uncertainty.
   Table 2 displays the values assigned to the calibrated parameters. The probability of
not being able to change prices, , is set to 0.67, following the evidence from micro data
(Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008). The subjective discount factor,  , is set equal to 0.9926,
or 3% per year. The intratemporal elasticity of substitution across varieties of intermediate
goods,  , is set to 6 (Gal´
                          i, 2008). The unconditional mean of per capita output growth, z ,
takes the value 0.0041 (or 1.65 percent per year), which matches the average growth rate of
real GDP per capita in the United States since the beginning of the great moderation. The
parameter  is fixed at unity, to ensure a unit Frisch elasticity of labor supply (Gal´
                                                                                     i, 2008),
and the scaling parameter  at 1.11 to normalize hours work to 1. Unlike in the numerical
example of section 3, the inflation target,  , is now set at the more realistic value of 0.005,
or 2% per year.
   The remaining parameters of the model are estimated on three observables: the logarithm
of real output, proxied by the logarithm of real GDP per capita; inflation, proxied by the
growth rate of the GDP deflator; and the nominal interest rate, proxied by the federal funds
rate. The sample is quarterly U.S. data from 1984:1 to 2008:1. Thus, the data ranges
from the beginning of the great moderation to the onset of the global financial crisis. This
is a period during which arguably monetary policy was relatively homogeneous, providing
some degree of control for the possibility that inflation persistence be affected by changes
in the policy regime (Woodford, 2007; Benati, 2008, Cogley and Sbordone, 2008). The data
is detrended by first differencing. Appendix D provides data sources and a more detailed
description of the construction of each series.
   The econometric estimation employs Bayesian techniques. Table 3 displays means and
standard deviations of the prior distributions of the estimated parameters. All estimated

parameters have relatively loose priors. In particular, the novel parameter , measuring
the degree of staggered price indexation is given a uniform distribution with the maximum
possible support, namely, [0, 1 - ], to allow the data to freely pick the feature that constitutes
the focal point of the present analysis. As is standard in the related literature, the estimation
allows for i.i.d. measurement error in the observables. The prior distribution of the variances
of measurement errors are assumed to be uniform with an upper bound of 10% of the variance
of the data.
   The last four columns of Table 3 displays means, standard deviations, and 5-95 percent
intervals of the estimated posterior distributions, based on a Random Walk Metropolis Hast-
ings MCMC chain of length one million after discarding (burning in) another one million
draws. A number of parameters are estimated with significant uncertainty, a feature that
is common in estimates of small-scale New Keynesian models. Nonetheless, the data speaks
with a clear voice on the parameters ,  , and I , governing nominal and real frictions in
the model.
   Of particular interest is the estimate of the staggered indexation parameter . It's pos-
terior mean is 0.187, which means that each period about 19% of all prices change due to
indexation and 14% change optimally. The degree of staggered price indexation is estimated
with relative precision, with a posterior standard deviation of  is 0.02. Figure 3 provides
additional posterior information on . The left panel displays its prior and posterior dis-
tributions. The latter is significantly more concentrated than the former, suggesting that
the data contains relevant information about this parameter. The right panel displays the
MCMC chain of . Its relatively flat aspect indicates convergence.
    In sum, the estimation of the model suggests that there is substantial staggered indexation
in the United States, with more than half of all price changes being indexatory in nature.
   To gauge the fit of the model, Table 4 displays selected actual and predicted second
moments. The model does well in matching the standard deviations and serial correlations

of output growth, inflation, and the nominal interest rate. It also replicates well the correla-
tion of inflation with the interest rate, and the low correlation between output growth and
inflation, but it misses its sign.


6     Staggered Price Indexation and Inflation Persistence
The illustrative numerical exercise of section 4 (see in particular Figure 2), suggests that
staggered price indexation has the potential to induce substantial inflation persistence. We
can now address this question in the context of the estimated model.
   To this end, Table 5 presents a counterfactual exercise consisting in computing serial
correlations when  is restricted to be 0 and all other estimated parameters are set at their
posterior means shown in Table 3. For convenience, the table reproduces from Table 4 the
actual and predicted serial correlations.


                                                    23
    When  is set to zero, the predicted serial correlation of inflation falls by more than half,
from 0.71 to 0.30. The intuition behind this result is clear. When  = 0, all price changes (33
percent of all prices, the fraction 1 - ) are optimal. Because firms are forward looking, in this
case all price changes are linked to current and future expected changes in marginal costs,
aggregate demand, and the price level. By contrast, when  takes its posterior mean value
of 0.187, only 14 percent of prices are changed in an optimal, forward-looking fashion, and
almost 19 percent in a backward-looking fashion, by incorporating the cumulative inflation
rate since the last price change. Thus, in the latter case current inflation has a tighter link
to past inflation, which makes it more serially correlated.


7     Conclusion
This paper introduces staggered price indexation in a model of staggered price setting. This
theoretical contribution is motivated by the observation, based on micro evidence, that only
about one third of all prices change each quarter, and by the fact that the same evidence is
not informative as to whether the price changes that do occur are optimal or not. Staggered
price indexation is an environment in which each period a random fraction of prices is allowed
to incorporate the cumulative inflation since the last price change.
    The main theoretical result derived from the present analysis is that under staggered
price indexation the Phillips curve features an additional term, given by the inflation rate of
the basket of goods that are indexed to past inflation. This is a state variable that carries
information about all past rates of inflation. Its persistence is dictated by the degree of price
stickiness, that is, by the fraction of goods whose prices do not change each period. The
loading of this variable on the Phillips curve depends on a new parameter, , measuring the
random fraction of goods that are indexed each period. Staggered price indexation is also
shown to flatten the slope of the Phillips curve and to lower the loading of expected inflation
on current inflation.
   Given the degree of price stickiness (that is, the fraction of prices that are not allowed
to change each period), staggered price indexation has the potential to affect inflation per-
sistence in a significant way. Fixing the fraction of prices that are sticky each quarter at
two thirds, in accordance with the available micro data, a small-scale new-Keynesian model
estimated on U.S. data yields an estimate of the staggered indexation parameter  of about
0.19, which, interpreted through the lens of the model means that each quarter more than
half of all price changes are indexations to past inflation and less than half are optimal up-
dates. The estimated model predicts that staggered price indexation is responsible for more
than half of the inflation persistence observed in the United States.

The variable zt  is defined as

Noting that the j counter ranges from 0 to  whereas the k counter ranges from 1 to j , we
have that the term corresponding to j = 0 is nil. So we can write

C     Zero-Inflation Steady State
For any variable, say, xt , let x denote its deterministic steady-state value. Consider a steady
state in which inflation is zero,  = 0. Then, by equations (23) and (24) we have that

                                              p = 1 +  x = 1.

Then, from equation (13) we get

                                                    ( - 1)/

and from equation (14)
                                                   ( + ) 11
                                       z 12 =               z
                                                1 -  ( +  )




                                                      26
Similarly, from equations (16) and (17), respectively, we obtain

                                                     µ
                                        z 21 =         c
                                                  1 - 

                                                ( + ) 21
                                    z 22 =               z
                                             1 -  ( +  )
The above steady-state conditions and equations (11), (12), and (15) then yield

                                       1 -               ( - 1)/
                        z1 = z2 =               z 11 =             c,
                                    1 -  ( +  )        1 -  ( +  )

                                                  -1
                                             µ=      ,
                                                  
                                             z 21 = z 11,

and
                                              z 22 = z 12

From (28) and (29) we have
                                             s = sx = 1.

From (30) we have
                                               c = h.

This expression together with (1), (2), and (10) implies that h is given by

                                             Uh (h, h)
                                       -               = µ.
                                             Uc(h, h)

Finally, the Euler equation (3) implies that

                                                  1
                                             i=     - 1.
                                                  

D     The Data
The proxy for output is the logarithm of real GDP seasonally adjusted in chained dollars of
2012 minus the logarithm of the civilian noninstitutional population 16 years old or older.
The proxy for the inflation rate is the growth rate of the implicit GDP deflator expressed
in percent per year. In turn, the implicit GDP deflator is constructed as the ratio of GDP
in current dollars and real GDP both seasonally adjusted. The proxy for it is the monthly
Federal Funds Effective rate converted to quarterly frequency by averaging and expressed in

                                                  27
percent per year. The source for nominal and real GDP is the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(bea.gov), the source for population is the Bureau of Labor Statistics (bls.gov), and the
source for the Federal Funds rate is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(federalreserve.gov).
