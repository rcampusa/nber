                            Union Wage Practices and
                      Wage Dispersion Within Establishments



                                    ABSTRACT



     This study uses establishment level data to examine the effect of

unionism on the wage structure within establishments. The major finding

is that unionism substantively reduces within—establishment dispersion

of wages, in part through explicit wage practices, such as single rate or

automatic progression modes of wage payment as opposed to merit reviews

and individual determination. Dispersion of wages between organized plants

is reduced compared to dispersion of wages between unorganized plants,

but by more modest amounts. Overall, the evidence suggests a major role

for explicit union wage policies on dispersion of wages within firms and

in the economy as a whole.

          One of the principal goals of trade union wage policies has been

to reduce dispersion of wages through standard rate policies. These poi—

icies seek to obtain "equal pay for equal work" across establishments and

to reduce "inequities" and differentials based on perceived personal char-

acteristics   rather than on specific job tasks. Recent work on dispersior

of wages among union workers and among nonunion workers has suggested that
                                                                               1/
these policies have produced markedly lower dispersion in the union sector.

Because of a paucity of data on establishments, as opposed to individuals,

and on establishment wage practices, however, this work has not documented

the effect of unions on wage dispersion within establishments, nor has it
                                                                       2/
shown the link between wage practices favored by unions and dispersion.

As a result, we currently lack any estimates of the impact of union wage poi—

ides on    the   wage structure within establishments themselves.

          The present paper seeks to remedy this gap in our knowledge by us—
                                                                    3/
ing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Industry Wage Survey       on wages

for workers within establishments and on the explicit wage practices of or-

ganized and unorganized establishments. The data on within establishment

wages is used to calculate measures of dispersion of wages by establishment.

These measures of establishment—level dispersion are then related to the

union status of the establishment and to the explicit wage practices of the

establishment.

          There are five principal findings:

          (1) Organized establishments have much lower dispersion of wages

than otherwise comparable unorganized establishments in the same four—digit

industry. Using the standard deviation of the in of wages as a measure of

dispersion, unionized establishments have levels of dispersion that range

from 5% to 50% below those of nonunionized establishments in the industries

                                                     4/
studied, with an unweighted wage differential of 22%.   Diverse variables

controlling for size of establishment, region and detailed occupation of

workers do not greatly affect the magnitude of these results.

          (2) Organized establishments have adopted explicit wage practices

which tend to reduce wage inequality. They favor single rate or automatJ'

progression modes of wage payment as opposed to merit reviews and indivi-

dual determination. A sizeable part of the union—induced reduction in within

establishment dispersion is attributable to the explicit wage practices in such

plants. By favoring wage practices that narrow ranges of rates among workers

and limit managerial disrection, unions reduce inequality within firms. Even

taking account of wage practices, however, unionized firms tend to have lower

inequality among workers, indicative of an influence on the operation of spe-

cific wage setting mechanisms as well as on the choice of the practices them-

selves.

          (3). Dispersion of wages between organized plants in the same four digit

industry also tends to be lower than dispersion of wages between nonorganized

establishments, taking account of differences in regional and occupational dis-

tribution of the two sets o plants. This result is found in six of nine indus-

tries.

          (4) The total effect of unions on the dispersion of wages among blue—

collar workers depends upon three components: the effect of unionism on dis-

persion within organized firms, the effect of unionism on dispersion across or-

ganized firms, and the union wage effect. In six of nine industries studied

the net effect of unions on dispersion, taking account of all three effects,

is negative, indicating that in the majority of cases studied, unionism lowers

wage inequality for blue—collar workers.

          (5) Because the union wage gains bring blue—collar wages closer to

hitc—cOl.1ar wages in the unionized sector, unionism tends to have a greater

negative impact on the dispersion of wages among      workers in an industry
than on the dispersion of blue—collar workers alone. Assuming that unionism

does not influence the wage dispersion among white—collar workers, we El d

that in all nine industries, unionism reduces dispersion of wages among all

workers by sizeable amounts.

         Put broadly, these results indicate a major role for explicit union

wage policies on dispersion of wages within firms and in the economy as a

whole.

         The paper begins with a brief analysis of union policies toward

standardization of rates within establishments. Then it describes in de-

tail the Industry Wage Survey data under analysis and documents the differ-

ence in dispersion between union and nonunion establishments in the same

detailed four—digit SIC industries. The next section estimates the effect

of unions on the wage practices of firms while the succeeding section shows

how these policies act as an intervening variable that explains part of the

observed reduction of within—establishment dispersion under trade unions.

The paper concludes with an evaluation of the significance of the results

for the study of the economics of trade unionism.



Union Wage Policies Within Establishments

         With rare exception unions have sought to reduce differentials a—

mong workers with nominally similar skills and job tasks within establish—

ments. They seek such reduction through two types of wage policies: a sin-

gle rate of pay for each occupational group, and a seniority based progres-

sion of rates to a maximum. Single rate policies, with one level of pay
                                          —4—



 for all workers iii a specified job category, reduces dispersion more than do

 the other policies, but even plans with progression to a maximum level

 tend to have a sizeable impact on dispersion by requiring similar treatment

 of workers who have the same seniority. Because of union desires for re-

 duction of differentials, many progression plans have tended, moreover, to
                                                5!
 become effectively a single rate maximum. UnlOfl pressures to reduce the range

of rates within job categories and to expand the diverse oh activities included

within categories further narrows the dispersion, Overall, Slichter, Healy and

Livernash conclude that these two avenues of influence, single rates and auto-

matic progression plans, have "clearly been one of minimizing and eliminating

discriminatory judgement—based differences in pay for individuals employed
                       6/
in the same job."

         At the other end of the spectrum, unions generally have been opposed

to merit review and individual determination payment plans, with the result

that in the 1970s whereas 43% of major companies used merit review for blue—

collar workers, just 12.5% of major union contracts contained a merit pro—
                 7/
gression plan.          Moreover, since unionized workers not given merit increases

can raise and win grievances, many union merit plans also resemble automa-

tic progression or single rate plans.

         All told, unions have been very successful in removing performance

judgements as a factor in determining individual pay.

         Three basic factors appear to explain union preference for reduced

differentials within firms. First, there is the often held believe of work-

ers that existing rate differentials reflect favoritism and discrimination
                                                                  8/
rather than           relative job duties and responsibilities.        "Inequity prob—

lems"have historically plagued numerous industries, leading workers and

their organizations to prefer objective standards to evaluation of indivi—
                                      —5—



duals based on the subjective decisions of foremen.9" As long as super-

visors are imperfect and make decisions based on criterion other than 'true"

contributions to the firm (which is exceedingly difficult to measure) it is

reasonable to expect employee preference for narrow job—related rates. In

a world of Rawisian "veil of ignorance" where workers will not know whether

they will benefit or lose from apparently arbitrary supervisory decisions,

simple maxi—min behavior will dictate preference for narrow ranges of rates.

Finally, workers vith risk averse preference functions or with preferences

for a narrow distribution of relative wages will favor standard rate policies

rather than a wide range of wage rates.

        Second, there are organizational reasons for expecting unions to favor

narrow ranges of rates. If, as suggested by Freeman (1976) among others, the

union is viewed as a political organization dependent on average (median)

worker preference, then when the median wage is less than the mean wage, a

majority of workers will favor redistribution to the lower paid and thus to
                                     10/
wage policies reducing inequality.         In the median voter model of union

behavior, if the median worker receives less than the mean wage, then he and

the other 50+% also receiving less than the mean wage will favor redistri-

bution. Worker solidarity and organizational strength is also likely to be

greater when workers receive roughly the same pay than when they receive

very different levels of pay.

       Whatever the reasons for union pressures for reducing wage inequal-

ity within establishments, such policies are a fact of economic life. Do

they have a significant effect on the typical organized establishment? Is

dispersion lower within organized rather than unorganized plants, and if so,

by how much? To what extent can any observed differences in wage disper-

sion within establishments be attributed to specific wage practices associ—
                                            —6—



ated with collective bargaining? In short, how important are union policies

for reducing dispersion within establishments in the labor market?

Data

         To answer these questions, it is necessary to have data on wages

of workers within establishments and on establishment wage practices, as

well as on the union status of the establishments. In contrast to widely
                                    11 /
used data files on individuals,            establishment data sets with information

on individuals within establishments are exceedingly rare. One of the few

such data files is provided by the Industry Wage Surveys of the Bureau of

Labor Statistics. These surveys, conducted since the 1940s by the Industry

Wage Division of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, are designed to obtain in-

formation on wage levels and practices within firms for the purpose of aid-

ing establishments in understanding their labor market environment. The

surveys cover a random sample of establishments in major four—digit SIC in-

dustries and provide data on distribution of wage payments unavailable else-

where.

         For purposes of this study, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Industry

Wage Surveys have several major advantages. They obtain data on the wages

of individual workers within establishments, which allows for calculation of

within establishment dispersion of wages. They obtain data on how many pro-

duction workers in each establishment are paid under the following types of
                             12 /
payment plans for time rates:       (1) individual determination, (2) range of

rates merit review, (3) range of rates automatic progression, (4) combina-

tion of range of rates merit review and automatic progression, (5) single

rate, and (6) incentive rates of pay. They categorize each production work—

er by an industry—specific detailed occupational code such as card grinder

in the wool textile industry, which permits more precise controls on occu—

pation and skill than in most data sets widely used by economists.

        At the same time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Industry Wage

Surveys have some disadvantages. They lack information on the "human capi-

tal" (education, age) and related personal characteristics (race, marital

status, training) of workers except for sex, and lack information on pro-

duction workers whose occupation is not classified in the survey. Because

of the narrow occupational categories, however, it is unlikely that absence

of data on education, race, and experience is a tremendous drawback.

        This study will consider nine four—digit industries where time rates

are the usual means of payment. It focuses on time rates because the stan-

dardization of piece rates has no clear effect upon wage dispersion, as the

dispersion of the effective hourly rate for piece rate workers depends also

on the dispersion of productivity among workers within establishments.

        Table 1 reports the characteristics of the nine industry sample under

study. The sample was chosen so that there are a significant number of

union and nonunion establishments, thereby permitting comparisons.. In total

we have information on nearly 3,000 establishments, 49% of which are organ-

ized, and on 500,000 individual workers, 45% of whom are organized —— an

exceedingly large number of observations even by modern labor economic stan-

dards. Selecting a set of industries in this manner means that we do not

have a random sample of four—digit industries. Had we picked industries

with stronger or weaker union organization, our results might be somewhat

different.

        Even within the four—digit sections chosen, a surprisingly large

number of unions are represented among the organized workers. For example,

in the Industrial Chemicals industry, organized firms in the survey are cov-

ered by the International Chemical Workers Union, the Oil, Chemical and

 company and local unions not associated with national or international unions.

         The main dependent variable in the study is the dispersion of wages

within establishments. Dispersion is measured by the variance and standard

deviation of the in of wages, metrics that are appropriate if wages follow the

lognormal distribution and/or the ln earnings function widely used in empiri—

cal work. All of the analyses were also performed using the variance of wages

in dollar units. Use of natural rather than ln units strengthens all of the

findings reported in this paper.

         To obtain the variance of the in of wages, we took the in of wages

of workers in each establishment and then calculated the mean in wage and

its properly weighted variance. This statistic was calculated for all

production workers in an establishment, for male and female workers separ-

ately, and for workers in the major industry—specific occupations.

        Since the dispersion of wages within an establishment is a variable

not widely examined in labor market analysis, it is of some importance to

examine its distribution in the sample. Figure 1 shows how the variable

differs across the samples. On average the within establishment variance

has a mean of .017, which compares with a variance of wages across establish-

ments of .028.

       Table 2 decomposes the total mean sum of squares of wages into the

between—establishment and within—establishment components and then further

decomposes the within—establishment sum of squares into between—occupation

and within—occupation components. While there are notable differences across

industries, the table shows substantial dispersion both within and between

establishemtns and within and between occupations within establishments. On

average, 40% of the variance in in wages of production workers in a detailed

to within—establishment differences in occupational means.

         Now that we have some notion of the magnitude and nature of within—

establishment dispersion of wages, we turn to the question of concern in

this paper: differences in dispersion between organized and unorganized

establishments.



Unionism and Ln Variance of Wages Within Establishments

         Table 3 presents the results of the first stage of our analysis.

It contrasts the variance in in wages in union and nonunion establishments

in several ways, each of which strongly supports the conclusion that within

establishment dispersion of wages are much less in union than in nonunion

   tin. Columns 1 through 3 contrast the mean variance of in wages for

organized and unorganized establishments; the difference in means show

unionized plants with a lower variance and the t—tests show these differences

to be significant in six of the nine cases. To make sure that these results

are not due to different characteristics of union and nonunion establishments,

we regressed the variance of the in wage in each establishment on a 0—1

dummy variable for unionism and the control variables listed in the table

notes: variables for size of establishment, region of location, the percentage

of workers in each detailed occupational category (to eliminate the possibility

that differences are due to association of workers in occupations with low

variances of wages in the union sector). The resultant coefficients and

standard errors, recorded in column 4, show that the differences in means

are not attributable to differences in characteristics. In seven of the

nine industries, the union coefficient is significantly negative at a 95¾

Source:       The union and nonunion means for the standard deviations of wages are calculated from the means of
              the standard deviations of the in wages for each firm. The t—test     the standard test of the dif—is
              ference between two means assuming unequal variances of the union and nonunion distribution. Also
              included on the regressions are size and region, and for the overall firm equation occupation con-
              trols. In the detailed occupations firms with only one worker listed under one occupation are de-
              leted. The levels of significance are computed from a one—tailed t—distribution. Standard errors
              are in parentheses.

confidence level, and in six of nine the   coefficient   is significant at a

99.5% confidence level.

         Columns 5 through 9 present the results of comparing the ln variance

of wages for the industry—specific occupations within establishments in

terms of the number of cases in which organized establishments had lower or

higher dispersion. The evidence confirms that unions reduce wage dispersion

within occupations within establishments. Unions decrease the varinace of

in wages in 124 nf the 176 detailed occupations, significantly so at 90% in

68 occupations and at 95% in 51 detailed occupational groups. Correspondingly,

the union coefficient increased the variance in only 52 occupations; in 14

significantly at the 90% level and at 95% significance in only eight of the

172 occupations.

         Table A in the appendix provides corresponding estimates for the

standard deviation of in wages rather than for the variance of ifl wagcs. As

many analyses of income distributions focus on standard deviations, it is

useful to examine those results as well, in large measure to evaluate the

magnitude of the estimated uniOn effects. What stands out in the calculations

is the fact that the union effect is not only highly significant in most

cases, but also large in absolute magnitude. These calculations show stan-

dard deviations of wages in the union sector averaging .0268 units below the

standard deviation in the nonunion sector ——   or   22% lower than the standard de-

viation in the nonunion sectors. We conclude that in the sample under study,

unionism is associated with markedly lower dispersion of wages within—establishments.



Unionism and Dispersion—Reducing Wage Practices

         We consider next the routes by which unionism reduces within—

estabiisiiment wage dispersion. The greater our ability to reiate the union

effect to specific wage practices favored by unions the greater is our

understanding of the nature of the results and the greater our willingness

to attribute them to unions as economic institutions. According to the

"standard rate hypothesis" set out earlier, we expect unionism to increase

the proportion of workers covered by the most egalitarian wage systems,

single rate and/or automatic progression, and to reduce the proportion of

workers covered by those systems allowing greater dispersion and managerial

discretion, merit review and individual determination.

         Table 4 presents the results of analyzing the effect of unionism

on the different methods of wage payment used within establishments. It

records the mean percentage of workers in union and nonunion establishments

enrolled in five time—rate payment plans presented more or less in order of

their likely impact on dispersion, from the plan with potentially the least

dispersion to the plan with potentially the most dispersion. It also re-

cords the union coefficient and its standard error from a regression of

the percentage of workers in each firm in the payment plan on unionism and

the average worker's wage, the ratio of male to female production workers,

the ratio of office to production workers, region size and occupation inde-

pendent variables.

         In all nine industries, unions increase the percentage of workers

paid by single rate plans and decrease the percentage paid by individual

determination. In all but cotton, man—made fiber textiles, the effects are

large and statistically significant. In miscellaneous plastics, for example,

an average 67% of workers in union plants are covered by single rates com-

pared to 12% of workers in nonunion plants, whereas at the other end of the

spectrum, just 4% of union compared to 49% nonunion workers are paid by in—

dividual determination of rates. Moreover, only when the efforts of unions

are totally directed toward single rates of pay, such as in the industrial

chemicals industry, do unions appear to be adversely affecting automatic

progression plans.

        The conclusion that unionism is associated with establishment

wage practices likely to reduce dispersion is inescapable.




Method of Payment as an Intervening Variable

        To determine the extent to which method of wage payment, particu-

larly the adoption of single rate wage practices, accounts for the lower

dispersion in organized establishments shown in Table 2, we have added to

the regressions of the variance of in wages on unionism and other

controls of Table 3 the fraction of workers under all wage systems, with

the single rate factor deleted to prevent singularity. If the union coef-

ficient is substantially reduced by the addition of the wage practices var-

iables, then we can conclude that explicit wage practices are a major inter-

vening variable in the union—within—establishment dispersion relation.

        The results of the calculations, given in Table 5, confirm that in

all but the cotton textile industry (where unionism is only weakly related

to wage practices), the inclusion of the vector of wage payment plans at

least partially explains the union differential in the variance

of the in wage regressions. The union coefficients are reduced in eight of

the nine sectors and by significant amounts in three of the nine sectors.

        Examining the table more closely, we see that in four cases over

50 % of the difference in variances between union and nonunion firms

 is explained by wage practices, and in another two cases, 40% of the decrease

 in difference in union firms is explained by the methods. In two industries

essentially the entire differential attributed to the union indicator variable

is explained by the methods of wage payment. Thus, for a majority of the in-

dustries studied, a significant portion of the union effect is explained j

the method of wage payment.
        As for the effect of the methods of wage payments themselves, the co-

efficients for all methods are positive, indicating that all of the payment

methods raise the variance of the firm wage relative to the omitted single

rate method formed by unions. (The one exception to the time rate methods

explanation of increased variance of wages within firms is the automatic

progression payment plan in the wool textile industry which has a negative

coefficient). Moreover, as could be expected, the individual determination

coefficients tend to be important (six of nine cases) while most merit review

coefficients (seven of nine cases) are larger than the combination merit re-

view and automatic progression coefficients and all are larger than just the

automatic progression coefficients. Finally, eight of the nine combination

merit review and automatic progression coefficients are larger than just

their automatic progression plans. In sum, the contribution of payment

plans to variance of wages within firms is as expected, and the differences

in use of plans is a major comDonent of the observed differences in inequality.



Interpreting Results

        The finding that unionism is associated with markedly lower dis-

persion of within establishment wages and with explicit wage practices

which have a significant effect on the dispersion of earnings is consistent

with the hypothesis that "standard rate" policies have a sizeable impact on
                                        —21—



establishment wages and, more generally, with one of the major contentions

of institutional labor economics: that explicit policies of market organi-

zation, such as unions and firms, can affect market outcomes. Surely the

most immediate interpretation of our results is that union (and firm)

policies greatly affect the pattern of wages.

          One may, however, object to reading causality into the statistical

analysis because of the possible endogeneity of the union organization

and/or the wage practices. With respect to the union effects, perhaps the

inverse relation between unionism and dispersion simply reflects the greater

likelihood that unions organize low dispersion firms. For instance, some

may argue that workers in such firms are likely to be more homogeneous and

thus more easily organizable.

          This objection to the line of causality stressed here finds no

support in fact. Extant institutional and statistical evidence suggests,

if anything, that workers in plants with greater dispersion of wages, not

those with a narrow dispersion, are more favorably attuned to unionism.
                14 /
In   Foulkes'          interviews with nonunion firms, several reported eschewing

rewarding workers by merit pay for fear that such practices would lead

to unionization. In Farber and Saks' analysis of NLRB elections the

standard deviation of wages in the firm was estimated to have a positive

but insignificant effect on the vote for unionism, but inclusion of a second

term in which the standard deviation appears suggests this underestimates
                                                          15/
the positive effect of inequality on the vote for unions.     In addition,

Farber and Saks found that individuals with earnings below their firm

mean were significantly more likely to vote for unions than those with earnings

above the firm mean. This suggests, as they note, that 'workers at the lower

end of the inter—firm earnings distribution.. . expect a larger increase in

earnings from unionization' (Farber and Saks, p. 36), consistent with
                                —22—




 the causal link in which unionism reduces dispersion. Evidence from the

1977 Quality of Employment survey shows no discernible difference between

the dispersion of earnings of nonunion blue—collar workers who would vote

for having a union to represent them and the dispersion of those who would

vote against a union. Those for the union had a mean log wage of 1.26

with a standard deviation of .45; those against had a mean log wage of 1.42
                                  16/
with a standard deviation of .46.     Finally, while I believe that systems

equations attempts to discern lies of causality from cross—section data
                     17/
are of little value,     the one effort to use such procedures shows that
                                                                      18 /
the systems calculation yields results confirming OLS calculations.

        In sum whereas there is strong institutional evidence supporting

the argument that unions choose wage policies which reduce dispersion,

whereas there is no evidence of a reverse causality.

Unionism and Between Establishment Dispersion

        In addition to reducing the dispersion of wages within—establish-

ments, unionism can be expected to affect the dispersion of wages between—

establishments. Under the banner of "equal pay for equal work", unions

have long pressed for standardization of rates across establishments in the

same sector. However, this goal conflicts with another primary union

goal, the desire to achieve monopoly wage gains, which could be expected

to increase dispersion to the extent that different establishments have

different elasticities of labor demand. In our data set, controlling for

the regional location of establishments and their distribution of employees

by occupation, we find that dispersion of wages between—establishments is

smaller in six of nine industries.

        Table 6 presents the empirical results. Columns 1 and 2 examine

the cross—establishment dispersion of wages in the sample as a whole.

Column 1 records the mean square error in the sample, while column 2

           The analysis thus far has studied the effect of unionism on wage

dispersion by analyzing differences in the dispersion of wages between organ-

ized and unorganized production workers. The impact of unionism on the dis-

persion of wages as a whole depends not only on the impact on organized labor,

however, but also on the union wage effect. By raising the wages of organized

production workers compared to those. of otherwise comparable unorganized pro-

duction workers, unionism increases dispersion. By raising the wages of pro-

duction workers relative to higher paid nonproduction workers unionism re-

duces dispersion of wages within an industry.

        What is the net effect of these rates of impact and of the union

impact on within—establishment and among—establishment dispersion analyzed

earlier?

        To answer this question we decompose the variance of the ln of wages

of all workers in a sector as follows:

(1) 2 = cu(2Bu) + cN(cBN) + c;(a2w) + cj c1(ln u/n)2 + cU c(ln u/w)2 +
                                         3N(1 w/n)2
where 2            = variance     of in wages in the industry

           cu     =   share of all workers classified as union and blue—collar

             N
                  =   share of all workers classified as nonunion and blue—
                      collar

                  =   share of all workers classified as white—collar
                  =   variance   of in wages of blue—collar union workers
                  =   variance   of in wages of blue—collar nonunion workers

           G2w
                  = variance of in wages of white—collar workers
                                        —25—



        u/n       =   ratio   of union to nonunion wages

        u/w       =   ratio   of union to white—collar wages

        win       =   ratio   of white—collar to nonunion wages

        To determine the effect of unionism on the variance of wages in the

industry, we difference (1) with respect to unionism. This yields:
            = a            +
(2)                   A2]          B BN A[ln u/n]2 + BU U L[1n uiw]2
where the effect of unions on the dispersion of white—collar workers,

       and on ti:. differential between nonunion blue—collar and white—

collar workers (ln n/w), are assumed zero.

        The first term in (2) is just the sum of the union effect on dis-

persion of wages within organized establishments and between organized es-

tablishments. The     second   term depends on the differential between union

blue—collar and nonunion blue—collar workers, while the third term depends

on the differential between union blue—collar workers and nonunion white—

collar workers.

        The information needed to calculate (2) is presented in Table 7.

Column 1 records the proportions needed for the analysis: the fraction of workers

who are unionized blue—collar, nonunionized blue—collar and white—collar in

each i:idustry. Column 2 gives the estimated effect of unionism on the vari-

ance of ln wages in an establishment, obtained by regressing the within—

establishment variance on unionism and the relevant control variables, as

in Table 3, but weighting the regressions by number of workers: the exact

calculations are given in appendix Table A. Column 3 gives estimates of

the effect of unions on the variance of wages across establishments by taking

differences in mean squared errors, as in Table 6. Because we are adding

together variances to get a total for the work force as a whole, both of

these figures are based on calculations in which firms are weighted by their

  occupation controls in a regression with dependent variables of the average
   firm. The blue—collar/white—collar wage differential is computed from   the  corresponding three—digit industry observations
   from the EEC Survey, and is the ratio of the total blue—collar wages  divided  by total blue—collar employment and total
  white—collar wages divided by total white—collar employment. The union    effect  is equal to the difference of the in of the

number of employees. Hence, the figures differ slightly from those in

Tables 3 and 6.

        The contribution of the within and between effects to the overall

industry variance in wages is given in column 4.   It is simply the sum of

columns 2 and 3 multipled by the unionized blue—collar shre of labor (cLB    ')




reported in column 1. In seven of the nine industries, the contribution
is negative, indicating that through the within and among firm effects

unionism lowers dispersion, as noted earlier.

        Column 5 presents an estimate of the union wage effect in each sector.

This estimate is obtained from regressions of the mean ln wage in each

establishment on its union status and the full set of controls used in

Table 3. These results are shown in appendix Table C. The dependent vari-

able is weighted by the number of workers in each firm.    Consistent with

previous work, union wage effects are positive in the majority of cases.

The unweighted average of effects, however, is just .06, which is somewhat

smaller than the result obtained in most studies. In one industry, union—

ism is estimated to have a modest negative effect on wages.

        Assuming no differential between union and nonunion establishments

in the absence of unionism, the effect of the union wage differential on

the variance according to (2) is just ctaBN multiplied by the differential

squared. This is recorded in column 6. Note that, with the exception of

three industries, the effect is negligible to the third decimal place, and

thus dwarfed by the effects in column 4.

        Because the Industry Wage Survey tapes lack information on the

pay of white—collar workers, we have been forced to rely on another data

set to obtain estimates of the effect of unionism on the blue—collar!

white—collar pay differential.   We have estimated the blue—collar/white—
                                      —28—



collar differential in the absence of unionism using the relevant three—

digit industry nonunion observations from the Expenditures for Employee

Compensation Survey and then used our estimates of union wage effects to

calculate the potential impact of unionism on the differential. If, con-

sistent with the results reported by Freeman and Medoff (1980), there is

relatively little spillover of wages from union to nonunion blue—collar work-

ers, and if Ufliofl wages do not affect white—collar wages in a firm, this

is the appropriate impact. If the presence of unionism raises wages of non-

union blue—collar labor, it is an underestimate; if the presence of union-'

ism raised the wages of nonunion white—collar labor in organized firms, it

is an overestimate. Following equation (2), the union effect is calculated

as the difference between the squared ln blue—collar/white—collar differential

from the EEC tape and that differential adjusted for the union wage effect on

blue—collar workers.

         As can be seen in the final column, consistent with the somewhat

 different calculations for the entire economy by Freeman (1980), the dis-

 persion—reducing effects of unionism dominate the dispersion—increasing

 effects in all of the industries covered.

Conclusion

        This study has used establishment level data to examine the effect

of unionism on the wage structure within establishments. It answers the

question, "How does unionism impact wages in an establishment?" rather than

the usual question, "How does unionism impact wages of an individual?"

The major finding is that unionism and union wage standardization policies

have a sizeable impact on the structure of wages in the economy. If, as

has often been a1eged, the dispersion of wages within firms and sectors

reflects disequilibrium or "inequities" due to the influence of nonmarket

forces, and the failure of the market to bring about equal pay for equal

work, the union—induced reduction in dispersion may increase efficiency.

If, on the other hand, dispersion within job categories perfectly reflects

differences in productivity, the union induced choice of single rate and

automatic progression plans may reduce efficiency while lowering inequality.

3/      The Industry Wage Survey provides information on all categorized

workers in establishments for specific four—digit industries. The only

workers who are lost and not in the sample are those who the Bureau of

Labor Statistics' surveys cannot categorize into any detailed occupation.

The survey includes firm data as well.


4/      The unweighted differential of the standard deviation of in wages

is a simple mean over all nine industries of the percentage reduction from

the numerous variances in the union sector. The unweighted differential of

the variances of in wages over all industries computed as the percentage

reduction in variance in the union sector from the nonunion sector is .33%.

The weighted differential of the variance of ln wages is the mean differ-

ential for each industry weightel by the number of firms in the industry and

is computed to be .27%.


5/      According to Slichter, Healy and Livernash, 87% of the workers in

the automatic progression plan had reached the top of their rate ranges

and thus were effectively paid a single rate. See Slichter, Healy and

12/       These methods of wage payment are defined by the BLS survey as follows:

                Formal rate structure for time—rated workers provide single
                rates or a range of rates for individual job categories.
                In the absence of a formal rate structure, pay rates are de-
                termined primarily by the qualifications of the individual
                worker. A single rate structure is one in which the same
                rate is paid to all experienced workers in the same job clas-
                sification. (Learners, apprentices, or probationary workers
                may be paid according to rate schedules which start belov
                the single rate and permit the workers to achieve full job
                rate over a period of time.) An experienced worker occasion-
                ally may be paid above or below the single rate for special
                reasons, but such payments are exceptions. Range.-of-rate
                plans are those in which the minimum, maximum, or both of
                these rates paid experienced workers for the same job are
            •   specified. Specific rates of individual workers within the
                range may be determined by merit, length of service, or a
                combination of these. Incentive workers are classified
                under piecework or bonus plans.

fractions of variance for each industry from Table 2.

15/       Specifically, Farber and Saks report calculations with the inverse

of the standard deviation of wages in a firm   and with the wage of an mdi-
vidual minus the wage of the establishment divided by the same standard

deviation. The first terms obtains a coefficient —207 with an asymp-

totic standard error of .273, the second a coefficient —.161 (.049).

The derivative of votes with respect to the inverse of the standard de-

viation of wages is the sum of the two, —.268, which is much larger, of

course, than the coefficient on the inverse itself. Note that in the

text I report results with respect to the standard deviation, not its inverse,

and thus reversed sign. See Henry S. Farber and Daniel H. Saks, "Why

             Source: The union and nonunion means for the standard deviations of wages
                      are calculated from the means of the standard deviations of the in
                      wages for each firm. The t—test is the standard test of the differ-
                      ence between two means assuming unequal variances of the union and
                      nonunion distribution. Also included on the regressions are size
                      and region, and for the overall firm equation occupation controls.
                      In the detailed occupations, firms with only one worker listed under
                      one occupation are deleted. The levels of significance are computed
                      from a one—tailed t—distribution. Standard errors are in parentheses.

             Note:      *    significant at better than 1% level.
                        **    significant at better than 57. level.
