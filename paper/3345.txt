                  PROVISION OF CHILD CARE: COST FUNCTIONS FOR
               PROFIT-MAKING AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT DAY CARE CENTERS


                                   ABSTRACT

     This paper eatimates cost functions for day care centers in Masaachuaetta.
The production technology aaauiued is the generalized homothetic Cobb-Douglas
production function. The cost function dual to this production function is
estimated separately for profit-making (P1Os) and not-for-profit (NPOa)
organizations. The results are discusse n the context of current NPO
literature. NPOs are found to be operating at higher average coats than PMOa
for most output levels as predicted by the literature. However, the proviaion
of more staff per child hour, our measure of quality, increases coats by
similar amounts in PMOs and NPOs. Further, present forms of subsidies do not
help either PMO5 or NPO5, and in fact, promote 'shirking' in NPO5. PMOs are
not optimizing with reference to the amount of education and experience in
their personnel. The results suggest that experienced labor may be working for
less than its marginal product in the day care industry.

I. Introduction

     The   need   for affordable child care arrangements has escalated in recent

years as a result of two demographic trends: the rapid, continuing increase

in maternal employment in the last decade and a half and an even higher

increase in the number of single parent households.1 Crucial to the

affordability issue is the need to study the factors underlying the cost of

providing high quality daycare. This paper focuses on these cost determinants

in the case of day care centers in Massachusetts. The latter comprise a

significant subset of all day care options2 caring for 16% of infants, 31% of

toddlers, 66% of pre—schoolers and 7% of schoolgoing children in non—parental

care.3 Since not all the daycare centers are profit oriented, this was an

excellent opportunity to study both profit (PMO) and not—for—profit (NPO)

organizations co—existing in the same industry. Most previous work has

focused on modeling the demand for child care (e.g. , Robins and Spiegelman,

1978 and Henriques and Vaillancourt, 1988). Two exploratory studies analyzing

the costs of providing day care are now over a decade old. See Robins and

Weiner (1978) and Ruopp,             (1979). Robins and Weiner sought to determine

the factors affecting the price (rather than cost) of day care. Their sample

targeted low income families in Denver and Seattle. Their model is, however,

really a revenue function and not a cost function as their dependent variable

measures weekly revenues of the center. A revenue function includes the net

profit or net loss of the center which a cost function does not. The second

study, by Ruopp,            is   the 1977 National Day Care Study by Abt Associates,

which uses a random sample of licensed centers. Both studies adjusted for

heterogeneity in output by including a staff/child ratio as an indicator of

quality. They also included the average experience and educational levels of

the staff. In the present study, cost functions for both profit and nonprofit
                                       2

 day care centers have been estimated separately, refining the measurements of

quality, and comparing and interpreting the results in the context of current

 literature, in particular, the shirking and property rights models for NPOs.

     When property rights are reduced, negative consequences may occur

 (Clarkson 1980). See mes and Susan Rose—Ackerman (1986) for a concise

survey of existing empirical studies testing various implications of the

property right model as applied to NPOs.4 As regards the relative costs of

the PMO5 and NPOs, they may be expected to behave in exactly the same   way if

entry is restricted and when maximum expected profits are zero. But in the

long run, if donations are present, or if the nonprofit Status is taken by the

consumers as signalling higher quality, one may expect higher costs in NPOs.

These costs may be higher for various reasons: shirking, quality becoming an

important NPO objective, or technological preference for particular factor

mixes (e.g., generous expense accounts, sophisticated decor, etc.). The

present study extends the scope of current empirical studies of the relative

performance of PMOs and NPOs to the daycare industry.

     The paper is structured as follows. Section II discusses the theoretical

issues and the major factors determining the costs of day care centers.

Section III describes the data and the empirical formulation of the model.

The results are in Section IV and Section V concludes the paper and suggests

extensions.



II. The Theoretical Underpinnings

    At its simplest, a firm's total cost function may be denoted as:



    TC —
           f(Q,P1)
                                            3

i.e. ,    total   expenditures (TC) are related to he level of output Q,   the Cost
of its inputs P1, and the type of production technology represented in the

functional form, f.        Specification of a cost function does not imply any

restriction on the market structure. However, the derivation of a supply

curve from a cost function involves the assumption of competitive conditions

which, prima facie, does not seem appropriate in this subsector of the day

care industry. Thus we make no attempt to estimate a supply curve. The

latter would require a careful formulation of the appropriate model for the

day care industry and a simultaneous estimation of both supply and demand.5

         The simple formulation of the total cost function involves certain

restrictive assumptions. Output must be homogenous, all differences in factor

inputs fully reflected in their price and factor—embodied technology absent.

The daycare industry does not fit this mold. Output is not homogeneous,

either within or between firms, and it is possible that total Costs are

affected by the education and experience of the staff even after controlling

for wage level. The technology of day care production is the manner in which

day care is provided. Though some of the technology may be disembodied (i.e.

independent of the level of education and experience of the staff) some may

not be so separated from the factors of production.

         In selecting an appropriate functional form, we considered the different

restrictions that various functional forms impose. The simplest, the

generalized Cobb—Douglas production function, allows returns to scale to be

increasing or decreasing for all output levels, but does not let them depend

on the output level. Further, the elasticity of substitution is constrained

at unity. Functional forms that allow returns to scale and/or the elasticity

of substitution to vary with output are available. One may choose from the
                                        4

 class of homothetic functions allowing returns to scale to vary with output.

 Even more attractive theoretically are the flexle forms which place few

 restrictions on technology. See for example, the translog (Christensen,

 Jorgensen, and Lau, 1973), the generalized quadratic (Denny, 1974) and the

 generalized Leontief (Diewert, 1971). However, the large number of parameters

 to be estimated in a flexible form call into question the precision of

 estimates in a reasonably sized data set. The other problem that arises is in

 the presence of a wide range of observations in the data set, in which case

 the flexible forms may fail to fulfill certain restrictions (e.g.,
                                                                      diminishing
marginal physical product). These considerations led us to consider the class

of homothetic functions as good candidates for selection. We chose the

generalized homothetic Cobb—Douglas functional form, first proposed by Zellner
and Revankar (1970).

     The cost function dual to this production function has the following

specification:



     IC — Bo +
                 BiYi + B2lnY + (lnP)'B3 + (1nX)'34 +   E

where TC is the dependent variable denoting total costs; Yj is output; P is

the vector of explanatory price variables; X is the vector of non—price

explanatory variables; 0' i        are parameters to be estimated; B3, B4 are

vectors of parameters to be estimated and E is the random disturbance term.



III. The Data and Empirical Formulation of the Model

     The data are for a random sample of day care centers in Massachusetts.6

The dependent variable, total costs, is the weekly expenditure of each center
                                         5

summing up all labor, capital, supplies, food, transportation, utilities,

phone, liability insurance and other costs. The independent variables are

discussed below.

     The output of a center is the total number of child hours provided by the

.enter during the year. This is the sum of the hours spent by all children

resident at a center in that year.

     The price of labor is the personnel costs, fringe benefits and payroll

taxes divided by total paid staff hours. To arrive at the total capital cost

for a center, we add up rent/mortgage payments, utilities, and maintenance and

repair costs.      This aggregate is divided by the total number of rooms to

yield the price of capital. Adding up costs of supplies, equipment, food,

phone services and transportation, and then dividing by the number of children

gives us the price of materials.

     Day care centers receive a range of subsidies: state food program

allocations, donations, funds from endowments, supplies brought in by parents,

volunteer hours and DSS7 funding. Since these subsidies fall naturally into

two groups, two subsidy variables were created. Subsidy 1 is a binary

variable equal to one if the center used volunteer hours and zero if the

center did not. Subsidy 2 is a binary variable equal to one if the center

received State funding items (state food and DSS), financial subsidies such as

endowments and loans, or funding from private organizations or the United Way.

These subsidies may be expected to lower costs for P!4Os, but orima—facie, it

is not possible to say how they may affect NPOs. In the latter case the use

of subsidies may actually increase costs (for example, they may be used for

staff perquisites). Costs may also rise due to unmeasured improvements in

quality. For instance, better and more varied play equipment may be bought.
                                       6


      Since output of day care centers is not homogenous, one has to control

 for quality. Quality is a multi—dimensional concept, and in the day care

situation, good quality care may be envisioned as one where the child receives

individual attention and interaction, emotional support and care, the teaching

of universally accepted values, and the fostering of individuality,

creativity, etc. Measuring these is beyond the scope of this study, but one

may try to isolate objective factors or attributes that create or encourage

such a nurturing environment. An important one is the degree of interaction

of the provider with the child. Previous studies have used the staff to child

ratio as a quality measure. This does not take into account the reality that

the staff also spend time away from the children in administrative duties and

that all children do not require the same degree of care and supervision. To

capture these features, the ratio of weekly paid staff hours in the classroom

to the number of children (weighted) is computed.8 We realize that this ratio

may not capture all the aspects of quality.

     The next two variables relate to education and experience. To reflect

the diverse educational levels of the staff in any daycare center, we

construct a variable that indicates the average education of the staff. The

experience variable is created by taking the weighted average of the total

years of experience -possessed by the staff. This reduces the range of staff

experience in any one center to a scalar. It is unclear how parameter

estimates on these two variables should be interpreted. They may be

reflecting technology embodied in labor. In that case, there is the

possibility that as more technology is incorporated into labor, certain

aspects of quality (for example, the fostering of creativity in children) may

be enhanced. Alternatively, this labor embodied technology may lower costs.
                                         7

The coefficients on these variables may also measure marginal productivity not

included in labor price. To the extent these two variables measure quality,

we would expect a positive relationship to costs. However, to the degree they

reflect cost—reducing technological change- or differences in marginal

productivity not reflected in labor price, we would expect negative

coefficients.



IV. The Results

A. For—Profit Centers (PMOs)

     The model was estimated by OLS. The regression results are reported in

Table 2. The residual plots did not indicate significant heteroskedasticiry

and therefore no data transformations were made. The adjusted R2 is 0.83 and

the F statistic is significant at any reasonable level of statistical

significance. The collinearity diagnostics using eigen values (following

Belsley,        , 1980)   do not show any significant multi—collinearity.

     Turning to the coefficients on output and input prices, the results are

generally as expected. Total cost goes up with an increase in any factor

coat. The elasticities of total cost with regard to capital and material

prices are 0.24 and 0.17 respectively, whereas the elasticity of total cost

with respect to labor price is the highest, at 0.81. This is not unexpected

considering labor costs constitute the largest share of total costs. Further,

increases in output reduce average costs significantly, indicating the

presence of economies of scale. See Figure 1.

     As the ratio of the paid staff class hours to weighted children

(henceforth called QUALR) increases, costs go up. A 10% increase in QTJALR

would lead to a 3.7% increase in total costs. Assuming equilibrium in the day
                                        8

care market, these results imply an insignificantly different market valuation

(or the marginal willingness to pay by consumers of day care) for increasing

staff—child ratio

      The coefficients of both education and experience variables are

significant and negative. Recall from our earlier discussion that a negative

coefficient could reflect cost—reducing technical change and/or differences in

marginal productivity not captured in labor price. It is not possible,

however, in the present model, to separate Out the two effects.



B.   Not for Profit Centers (NPOs)

     The regression results for the NPOs are reported in Table 2. The

adjusted R2 is 0.82 and the F statistic is significant at any reasonable level

of statistical significance. As in the previous case, the results with regard

to material and labor costs are consistent with economic theory. However, the

elasticities of total cost in relation to all input prices are much lower for

NPOs than PMOs. Total costs go up by 2.6% when labor costs increase by 10%.

This is less than a quarter of the rate of increase experienced by PMOs. As

for PMOs, total costs are affected to a smaller degree (2.0%) when material

costs increase by the same magnitude. An increase in the price of capital,

though, has no significant effect on costs. NPOs like PMOs experience

increasing returns to scale. However, note in Figure 1 that the average cost

of NPOs is greater than that for PMO5 for most output levels.

     NPOs share three results with PMO5: there are economies of scale; as

the staff—child ratio increases, costs are affected positively; as average

experience increases, costs go down.9 However, they differ from PMOs in that

an improvement in education has no significant effect on costs)° This
                                       9

appears to indicate that quality improvements acted as an offsetting force.

The fac: that the coefficient on education is insignificant also suggests that

NPOs may have increased the education level to its optimum, in contrast to

PHOs who have not done so. Another difference between the two forms of

organizations is that contributions of volunteer hours actually increased

costs.




C. Comparison of PMO5 and NPO5

     Since the day care industry gave us an excellent opportunity to study a

case where both PMO5 and NP0s Coexist, we can examine the results further in

the light of current literature on NPO5. The first question we sought to

answer was whether the cost functions of the two types of centers were the

same or whether the two samples had been drawn from different populations. To

test for the equivalence of the two regression equations, we used the Chow

test11 and found the relevant F statistic significant at the .01 level. This

lent justification to the separate treatment of PMOs and NPOs, and implies

that if PMOs are minimizing costs, then the other centers are not doing so.

Indeed, 4POs do, for most ouput levels have higher average costs than PHOs

(See Figure 1).

     Will giving donations worsen matters? In this context, James and Susan

Rose—Ackerman12 succinctly summarize current theoretical thinking on NPOs.



          Shirking is possible in the long run only if there are
          barriers to entry, if donations are positive for some
          organizations, or if some customers prefer nonprofits as
          more 'trustworthy.' Ironically, donations and trust make
          things worse rather than better in this respect. In
          effect, 'shirking' is one possible use of donation and
          other revenues induced by trust.
                                       10




Further,



           Put another way,— in situations where a profit oriented
           market will not produce efficient amounts (as where
           externalities exist) mechanisms (such as voluntary
           donations) that allow increased production also allc
           productive inefficiency (excess capacity, shirking) anc
           society faces a trade—off between the two kinds of
           inefficiency.



     Donations in our sample are given in different ways: as direct funding

and/or as aid in the form of volunteer hours. Our results show that donations

have no effect on PMO5. In NPOs, however, volunteer hours have the effect of

actually increasing costs thus providing support to the 'shirking' hypothesis.

On the other hand, in both PMOs and NPOs, a reduction in the price of labor

would decrease costs. Therefore, any form of subsidy that reduces the cost of

labor should reflect in a cost reduction in both forms of organization. A

reduction in the price of capital, however, does not reduce appreciably costs

in an NPO. These results impel us to conclude that in the main, present forms

of subsidy are not helping to lower day care costs at all, and in fact are

promoting 'shirking' in NPOs. Designing subsidies that        help decrease

costs must lower effective prices of labor, materials and capital in a PMO,

and that of labor and materials in an NPO.

     Where quality is observable, NPO models usually agree that PO managers

may tend to overemphasize quality which leads to higher costs for NPOs

relative to PMO5. On the other hand, where quality is      easily obseried and

measured as in the Hansmann model,13 consumers are unable to make enforceable

contracts in regard to these characteristics. This could be the case in areas
                                         U.

such as health and education, and PMOs in these industries would then have a

tendency to downgrade quality, whereas NPOs would have an attenuated pecuniary

incentive to do the same.

     The d.aycare industry can be categorized as one where quality may be

observed (with cost), but may not be enforceable contractually. Our results

indicate that, improving quality increases costs for both organizations.

However, a 10% increase in the staff—child ratio increases total costs by 3.3%

in an NPO, as against 3.7% in a PMO. Since the test of the null hypothesis

that the two parameters are equal cannot be rejected, increases in the staff—

child ratio at PMOs and NPOs imply similar increases in costs. This suggests

similar market valuations of quality under competitive market conditions.

     Accumulation of experience decreases costs significantly for both

organizations. This indicates that both should value experience for its cost

reducing potential. Recall (see Table 1) that the average experience was

significantly higher in PMO5. This is consistent with attempts to maximize

profits by PMO5. However, our results suggest that both PMOs and NPOs could

lower costs further by increasing the experience of their staff. We do not

have the data to furnish an explanation for center's failure to hire more

experienced staff. We speculate there may be supply constraints in the labor

market. We have already discussed the fact that PMOs are not optimizing with

regard to education either, and it now appears that NPOs place a greater

emphasis on education over experience.

     We are left with an intriguing picture. The average wage is

significantly higher in NPOs than PMOs (see Table 1).   PMOs are not optimizing

with regards to either education or experience, and NPOs are not optimizing

with regards to experience. An explanation could be that all centers are
                                      12

constrained from hiring staff with the desired level of experience because of

market constraints. Interestingly, bOOs appear to have been able to hire

staff with cost minimizing levels of education while PMOs have not been able

to do so.




V. Conclusion

     The present study estimated cost functions for PMOs and MOOs in the day

care industry in Massachusetts from cross—section data collected in 1987 and

1988. The results ste discussed in the context of the MOO literature. The

two forms of organization are seen to be drawn from different populations:

the parameters of the estimated coat functions are significantly different.

One may surmise that if the PMOs are cost—minimizing, their non—profit

counterparts are not doing so since they are operating at higher average cost

for most output levels. See Figure 1. Giving financial subsidies like

donations, loans etc. do not help reduce costs. Present forms of subsidy are,

at best, quite ineffective. To lower costs, subsidies must lower the effective

prices of material, labor and capital for PMOs. For MOOs, however, the

options are narrower. Only subsidies that affect labor and material prices

would serve to lower costs. In fact, donation of volunteer hours actually

elevates costs in MPOs. This lends credence to the 'shirking' models.

Clearly the most effective method of lowering child care costs is to lower the

unit labor cost faced by both NPO end PMO producers. A recent study in

Massachusetts (Wellesley College Center for Research on Women end Center for

Survey Research, University of Massachusetts at Boston, 1988) suggests that

this may best be accomplished by providing MOOs with wage grants and PMOs with

tax credit related to their labor costs.
                                       13

     Raising the staff—child ratios increases costs of both PMOs and NPOs. As

predicted by the NPO literature, PliOs have lower ratios of paid staff class

hours to the number of children.14 If PMOs are providing the "correct" staff—

child ratios then NPOs are overproducing quality. This is consistent with the

contention in the not—for—profit literature that NPOs will overproduce

quality. Having staff with more education and experience reduces costs in

PROs, whereas NPOs seem to benefit only from staff with greater experience.

Consistent with cost minimization, we would then expect PROs to have more

experienced and educated staff in an attempt to lower costs. In practice, the

staff of PROs does have more experience on rhe average. However, the staff of

PROs and NPOs do not differ significantly in average education.

     There are a number of possible explanations for the negative coefficients

on education and experience. One possible explanation is that more

experienced and better educated staff are receiving wages that are less than

their marginal product, particularly, in for—profit centers. It is

interesting in this regard that average wages are significantly higher in NPOa

than in PMOa.

     Several issues require further research. The fact that the output in the

daycare industry requires both client and provider inputs makes this a special

case of joint production, compounding the usual difficulties of measuring

output in service industries. Further, an analysis of coat functions is only

a first step towards building a complete model of price determination to be

used for a full examination of the affordability issue.
