        This paper examines how personal bankruptcy and bankruptcy exemptions affect the supply

and demand for credit. While generous state-level bankruptcy exemptions are probably viewed by

most policymakers     as benefiting     less-well-off borrowers, our results using data from the 1983

Survey of Consumer      Finances      suggest they increase the amount of credit held by high-asset

households and reduce the availability and amount of credit to low-asset households, conditioning

on observable characteristics.   We also find evidence that interest rates on automobile loans for low-

asset households    are higher in high exemption states. Thus, bankruptcy exemptions       redistribute

credit toward borrowers with high assets.

     Over the last decade, increasing numbers of individuals and married couples have filed for

personal bankruptcy    in the United States.   In 1983 (the year of our data set), there were 313,000

personal bankruptcy    filings.   An upper bound estimate of the resulting loss to creditors that year was

about $12.5 billion (1983) dollars.l     Since 1983, the number of personal bankruptcy            filings per year

has risen steadily and it peaked in 1992 at 900,000.          In total over the decade 1983-1992, about

5,300,000    individuals or married couples filed for bankruptcy,        which implies that nearly 6 percent of

U. S. households experienced      a personal bankruptcy       filing during this period.z

     Households that file for personal bankruptcy      under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy

Code are required to give up any assets that exceed the applic~ble, state-specific           exemption   levels, but

are not required to devote any of their fiture    income to debt repayment.          In return for giving up

non-exempt    assets, they receive a discharge from most types of debt.          Thus, even households with

both high income and high assets can avoid repaying their debts in bankruptcy               as long m their assets

are below the applicable exemption level.      Debtors can ofien increase their financial benefit from

bankruptcy   by shifting assets from non-exempt     to exempt categories before filing.

     Personal bankruptcy     law became much more favorable to debtors following the passage of the

Bankruptcy    Reform Act of 1978 (BRA78).        Prior to 1978, bankruptcy        exemptions were specified by

the states and tended to be very low. The Commission             on the Bankruptcy    Laws of the United States




     ‘This figure equals the number of personal bankruptcy filings in 1983 times the mean debt level in
Sullivan, Warren and Westbrook’s [1989, p. 64] sample of personal bankruptcy filings, which was
$38,000 in 1981 dollars or $41,600 in 1983 dollars. The estimate is an upper bound because it assumes
that no debt is repaid in bankruptcy. In practice about one percent is repaid in bankruptcy [White, 1987;
Sullivan, Warren and Westbrook, 1989, Chapter 12].

   ‘The figure of 5,300,000 is overstated to the extent that debtors have made repeat bankruptcy filings.
According to Sullivan, Warren and Westbrook [1989], the repeat rate is about 8 percent. Since 1992, the
number of bankruptcy filings has fallen slightly. Data on number of personal bankruptcy filings and
number of U. S. households are taken from Statistical Abstract of the U, S. 1994, tables 865 and 65.

                                                          1
[1973] argued that a high and uniform bankruptcy        exemption would be beneficial to less-well-off

households.     The argument was that with the rise of the consumer credit industry and its aggressive

advertising   and sales techniques, households tended to accumulate substantial debt but little savings,

and therefore were vulnerable to unexpected events such as illness, layoff, or wives quitting work due

to pregnancy.    Given harsh collection practices by creditors, debtor households ofien found it difficult

to recover from these setbacks and would suffer firther      adverse consequences    such as ill health, family

strain, divorce, and job loss, unless a generous exemption in bankruptcy      Iefi them with adequate assets

for a “fresh start.”   Thus the Commission    advocated the adoption of a high and uniform Federal

bankruptcy    exemption on the grounds that it would help households whose financial situation was

marginal before bankruptcy      and who would otherwise have difficulty recovering from financial

setbacks

     While the House adopted the Commission’s         populist view, the Senate preferred to continue

allowing the states to set their own bankruptcy exemptions.3      In a compromise,    the BRA78 specified a

uniform bankruptcy     exemption    of $7,500 for equity in “homesteads” (owner-occupied     principal

residences) and $4,000 for non-homestead       property, with the exemption values doubled when married

couples filed for bankruptcy.      However, the Act permitted states to opt out of the Federal exemption

by adopting their own bankruptcy       exemptions.   By 1983, all states had done so, although   12 allowed

debtors to choose between the state and the Federal bankruptcy exemptions.          Many states raised their

bankruptcy    exemptions when they passed opt-out legislation, but they adopted widely varying

exemption     levels.4 At the two extremes, Iowa’s exemption as of 1983 was $500 for homestead equity

and $5,000 for non-homestead       property, while Texas’ exemption was unlimited for homestead equity

and $30,000 for non-homestead           property (see below).

     Because U. S. households tend to have few financial assets and are not required to use their

incomes to repay debt in bankruptcy,          more households could benefit financially       by filing for

bankruptcy     than actually file.’     In addition, Congress recently made filing for bankruptcy even more

attractive by doubling the Federal bankruptcy exemption.G This suggests that in the future, the practice

of fi Iing for personal bankruptcy       could become much more common as households become

increasingly    knowledgeable    about the bankruptcy      system.   But despite the importance     of personal

bankruptcy,     the subject has been almost completely       neglected by economists.

     In this paper we begin to address the issue of how personal bankruptcy             and the bankruptcy

exemption      affect credit markets.     Bankruptcy exemptions      are likely to affect both the supply and

demand for credit.       As the bankruptcy     exemption rises, debtors are more likely to file for bankruptcy

and repay less in bankruptcy,         holding other factors constant.   Also the bankruptcy     exemption     provides

partial wealth insurance and the higher the exemption           level, the greater the insurance coverage.        Even

when lenders raise interest rates to offset increases in the exemption          level, greater wealth insurance

makes risk averse debtors better off and causes their demand for credit to rise.            But higher bankruptcy

exemptions     also reduce the amount that creditors receive in repayment of debt and may make them

more likely to refuse to lend in the first place.        Thus, higher bankruptcy    exemptions    are predicted to

reduce credit supply.      We estimate a model of the effect of bankruptcy         exemptions    on credit supply

and demand, using data from the 1983 Survey OJ Consumer Finances and information                    on bankruptcy

exemptions      in each state.

     We find that state personal bankruptcy exemptions have a significant,             positive effect on the



    5White and Petropolous [1996] estimate that between 15 and 50 percent of U. S. households would
benefit financial] y from filing for bankruptcy as of 1992, with the range depending on what strategies
households are assumed to pursue before tiling in order to increase their financial benefit from bankruptcy.

probability     that households will be turned down for credit or discouraged               from borrowing.     We also

find that the amount of debt held by households in the top half of the asset distribution                  is positively

related to state bankruptcy          exemptions, suggesting that high-asset households have higher demand for

credit in high-exemption           states.    Households with large amounts of assets have the most to gain fi-om

generous bankruptcy         exemptions,        hence it is these households    for whom we would expect demand

effects to be greatest.         This result is reversed for households        in the lowest quartile of the asset

distribution,    where the amount of debt held is negatively related to the level of the bankruptcy

exemption.       For these households,          supply effects appear to dominate and lenders either deny credit

completely      or loan smaller amounts.           This raises the possibility that low-income     households in states

with high exemptions            receive less credit than otherwise equivalent borrowers        in states with low

exemptions.       We also present evidence that interest rates on automobile              loans are higher for low-asset

households      in states with higher bankruptcy exemptions than they are in states with low exemptions.

Thus, while generous state-level bankruptcy exemptions                are probably viewed by most policymakers             as

benefiting      less-well-off     borrowers,     our results suggest they increase the amount of credit held by high-

asset households      and reduce the availability of credit to low-asset households,            i.e., they redistribute

credit toward borrowers with high assets.

                                                   I. Background Literature

      Previous empirical papers on personal bankruptcy have focussed on the effect of the BRA78 on

the number of filings over time. Shepard [1984], Peterson and Aoki [1984], and Boyes and Faith

[1986] find evidence that the BRA78 increased the number of bankruptcy filings relative to what

would be predicted based on time series patterns prior to 1978, but Domowitz                     and Eovaldi [1993] find

that the BRA78 had no effect,                Boyes and Faith also suggest that risky borrowers      may have been

excluded from the credit market by BRA78.                  White [1987] found that the number of Chapter 7

bankruptcy      filings in 1981 was positively and significantly          correlated with the level of the state



                                                                 4
bankruptcy      exemption.’

     There is a large theoretical       literature on credit markets with asymmetric   information   that explores

when credit rationing occurs, how it is reduced by borrowers pledging collateral, and whether low-risk

or high-risk borrowers are affected when credit rationing occurs.s         Because these models assume that

borrowers      are corporations    rather than individuals, they do not consider the role of bankruptcy

exemptions      on credit markets because there is no equivalent of the bankruptcy      exemption for

corporations     in bankruptcy.g

                                      II. Legal and Institutional   Background

     When debtors file under Chapter 7 of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code, they receive a discharge from

unsecured debt in return for giving up assets in excess of the relevant state’s bankruptcy exemption.

Several provisions of the Bankruptcy         Code prevent debtors from waiving their right to benefit from

the Chapter 7 bankruptcy exemption          and hence make it impossible to use private contracts as a means

of voiding statutory bankruptcy exemptions.          Creditors may not enforce claims against debtors’ assets

if the assets are covered by the Chapter 7 bankruptcy         exemption.   This provision prevents creditors

from taking a blanket security interest in all of debtors’ possessions. 10 Creditors can only enforce




    ‘Also see Luckett [1988] for an overview of economic aspects of personal bankruptcy; Sullivan,
Warren, and Westbrook [1989] for discussion of the characteristics of a sample of bankruptcy filers from
the earl y 1980s; and White [1991] for discussion of sociological versus economic approaches to
bankruptcy. Paxson [1986], using a sample of households from 1951, 1957, 1962, and 1967, provides
evidence that state laws such as interest rate ceilings can affect credit market behavior, but she does not
examine bankruptcy provisions.

    ‘See Bester [1985, 1994], Besanko and Thakor [1987], and Boot, Thakor and Udell [1991].

     9Another strand of the literature on credit markets with asymmetric information derives from Stiglitz
and Weiss [198 1]. In their model, lenders cannot observe the riskiness of the investment project that
borrowers engage in. They show that changes in the interest rate alter the riskiness of the pool of
borrowers, which causes lenders to deny loans to some borrowers and to charge less than the market
clearing interest rate. Mankiw [1986] explores a similar model of the student loan market and emphasizes
that a small increase in lenders’ opportunity cost of funds may cause the loan market to collapse.

purchase.   (See below for further discussion of Chapter 7 bankruptcy exemptions).

     There is a second U. S. personal bankruptcy      procedure,   Chapter 13 of the U. S. Bankruptcy

Code, and debtors may not waive their right to choose between Chapters 7 and 13. ” Under Chapter

13 bankruptcy,   debtors are not obliged to give up any assets, but they must propose a plan to repay a

portion of their debts from future income over several years.       Debtors have an incentive to choose

Chapter 7 rather than Chapter 13 whenever their assets are less than the bankruptcy       exemption,    since

doing so allows them to avoid repaying debt horn either assets or future income.        Because many

states’ exemption   levels are high relative to the assets of typical households that file for bankruptcy,

around 70 percent of all personal bankruptcy filings occur under Chapter 7 [White 1987].          Even when

households file under Chapter 13, the amount that they are willing to repay is strongly affected by the

Chapter 7 bankruptcy     exemption.    For example, suppose a household with assets of $20,000 living in

a state whose exemption     level is $10,000 considers filing for bankruptcy.   Because the household

would have to give up $10,000 in assets if it filed under Chapter 7, it would be willing to pay

creditors no more than $10,000 (in present value) from future income if it filed under Chapter 13. As

a result of this close relationship   between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy     filings, we ignore the

distinction between them. 12




     ‘‘11 U.S.C. $ 706(a) provides that cases filed under Chapter 7 may not be converted to Chapter 13
unless the debtor requests such a conversion. In 1986, an amendment to the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. $
707(b)) was adopted that allows bankruptcy judges to dismiss Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy tilings if
discharge of debt would be a “substantial abuse” of Chapter 7. However this provision was not in effect
during 1983, the year of our data set, and in any case has rarely been used.

     ‘zOther reasons why debtors might choose to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 are that certain types
of debts, such as those incurred by fraud, are dischargeable only under Chapter 13. In some Bankruptcy
Courts, judges encourage debtors to file under Chapter 13 and this leads to many plans being filed that call
for only token repayment of debt. Another reason that debtors sometimes file under Chapter 13 is that
they have filed under Chapter 7 within the past few years. Debtors who file under Chapter 7 are barred
from filing again for 6 years, but there is no limit on the number of filings allowed under Chapter 13. See
Elias, Renauer, and Leonard [1993].

                                                       6
         Household   debt can be divided into secured and unsecured loans.       Secured loans include

mortgages,      home equity lines of credit and automobile    loans.   These loans allow lenders the right to

foreclose on the house or repossess the automobile if the debtor defaults, regardless of whether the

debtor files for bankruptcy.       Unsecured loans include credit card and other consumer loans.         When

debtors file for bankruptcy,       they are only obligated to repay unsecured loans if they have assets that

exceed the exemption       level and are not subject to creditors’   Iiens.

     Unsecured       loans would seem more likely to be affected by bankruptcy       exemptions   than secured

loans.     In practice, however, the distinction is blurred and households are ofien able to arbitrage assets

and debts across categories and thereby increase their financial benefit from bankruptcy.          For example,

debtors might borrow on their credit cards or obtain new consumer loans in order to reduce their

mortgage debt.       These transactions convert non-dischargeable      secured debt into unsecured debt that is

dischargeable     in bankruptcy.    Or debtors might sell personal property that is in excess of the personal

property exemption      and use the proceeds to reduce their mortgages or to buy exempt property. 13 In

addition, bankruptcy     undermines     the value of collateral to lenders, since lenders may be delayed in

repossessing     it or may be unable to repossess it at all. Lenders also incur extra legal costs because

they must obtain the permission of the bankruptcy trustee in order to repossess collateral.         For these

reasons we examine the effects of bankruptcy         exemptions on total debt, rather than distinguishing

between secured and unsecured debt.

     While debtors may arbitrage assets and debts across categories,          in the empirical work that

follows, we assume that debtors do not make interstate moves before filing for bankruptcy.               For

typical debtors contemplating       bankruptcy, the cost of such moves are prohibitive,    since moving usually

547(b),(c)(7). Debtors may also conceal assets or transfer them to relatives, but if discovered, there is a
small risk their bankruptcy filings may be dismissed on grounds of fraud.

requires paying a moving company in cash and making a cash deposit to a new landlord, in addition to

leaving friends and family and finding a new job.         For affluent debtors, these costs are less prohibitive

and there have been some well-publicized       cases of debtors moving to states that have unlimited

homestead     exemptions. 14 But the practice is uncommon       because of transactions    costs and the fact that

Bankruptcy     Courts have occasionally dismissed bankruptcy       filings by debtors who used this strategy

[Elias, Renauer, and Leonard 1993, p. 2/21].

                                         IV. Empirical Hypotheses

     Suppose in period 1 consumers borrow some amount B at interest rate r.                Consumers’ period 2

wealth, denoted    Wz, is unknown as of period 1 but is distributed according to the distribution fl~z).


The overal 1 bankruptcy    exemption in the borrower’s       state of residence is denoted E, where we assume

that assets are fungible across categories.   In period 2, the loans come due, consumers learn their

period 2 wealth, and they must decide whether to repay the debt in full or default and file for personal

bankruptcy.     If consumers file for bankruptcy,    their obligation to repay the loan depends on their

wealth.   They are obliged to repay nothing if Wz s E and to repay an amount              Wz - E if


E < Wz < E+B(l +r).    If wealth Wz exceeds E+B(l +r), then consumers must repay their debts in fill


and cannot benefit by filing for bankruptcy.        Borrowers therefore   benefit financially from filing for

bankruptcy    whenever their wealth WJ turns out to be below E +B(I +r), 15


     Borrowers’    period 2 wealth distribution     can be divided into three regions of no repayment       (a),




    ‘“For example, Martin Siegel, an investment banker, purchased a $3.25 million dollar home in Florida
when investors filed a civil lawsuit against him demanding $2.75 million in damages. See “Rich Debtors

    ‘sWealth W2 and the distribution of wealth flWz) are resumed to be measured afier debtors have
pursued any strategies that they use to conceal or reduce their wealth before filing for bankruptcy (moral
hazard).

partial repayment (b), and fill repayment (c), as shown in figure I. The level of the bankruptcy

exemption affects the sizes of the three repayment       regions.     A higher exemption causes the boundaries

between regions (a) and (b) and regions (b) and (c) to shifi to the right.           Thus, as E rises, the

probability   that debtors file for bankruptcy    and repay nothing rises and the probability     that they avoid

bankruptcy    and repay in full falls.    Also, debtors repay an amount WZ-E if their period 2 wealth falls


into region (b), so that they repay less as E rises.

     If the exemption rises, lenders will raise the interest rate.       Suppose the interest rate rises enough

that expected repayments      remain the same.    Bankruptcy    provides borrowers with partial wealth

insurance.    If borrowers   are risk averse, an increase in the exemption raises expected utility because

the amount of insurance has increased.        When borrowers’       period 2 wealth falls into region (b), the

exemption     increase raises their wealth, which makes them better off.        When borrowers fall into region

(c), the increase in the interest rate that offsets the exemption increase lowers their wealth, which

makes them worse off. But these changes make borrowers               better off ex-ante, since the wealth increase

occurs when their marginal utility of wealth is high and the wealth decrease occurs when their

marginal utility of wealth is low.       Thus a higher exemption level in bankruptcy      makes risk averse

borrowers better off, which increases their demand for loans.           The hypothesis that demand for loans

rises with the bankruptcy exemption        is examined below. ‘c

     An increase in the interest rate that fully offsets the increase in the default rate when the

exemption     level rises must leave lenders equally well off. In this case, the supply of loans would be

unaffected as long as lenders are risk neutral.      But if borrowers are heterogeneous,     it may become




     “Creditors may not be able to raise interest rates enough to offset the effect of the increase in the
bankruptcy exemption. In this case they may stop lending-completely or, if they can distinguish among
borrowers, ration loans to the least credit-worthy. Rea [1984] and Dye [1986] discuss the insurance effect
of bankruptcy exemptions.

worthwhile      for lenders to adjust the supply of credit in response to changes in the exemption             level.

      As an example, suppose some borrowers are opportunists,             while others are not.      Assume that it is

too costly for lenders to attempt to distinguish between types when borrowers apply for loans.

Opportunistic      borrowers file for bankruptcy whenever their period 2 wealth falls into regions (a) or


(b) in figure I. In contrast, non-opportunistic       borrowers file for bankruptcy only if illness or job loss


occurs and their period 2 wealth falls into regions (a) and (b).           A rise in the bankruptcy      exemption,

therefore,   increases the probability   that opportunistic    debtors will fi Ie for bankruptcy     by more than it

increases the probability    that non-opportunistic    debtors file for bankruptcy.’7     The increase in the

exemption    level may make it worthwhile       for lenders to invest in efforts to identi~        opportunistic

borrowers    in advance.    Thus, as the exemption level rises, lenders may devote more resources to

checking potential borrowers’      credit histories and, as a result, they may be more likely to turn down

loan applicants.     The hypothesis that otherwise similar borrowers are more likely to be turned down

for credit in states with higher exemption levels is also examined below.            In addition, increased losses

from opportunistic     behavior by borrowers     in high exemption states may cause lenders to reduce the

amount they lend or charge higher interest rates to otherwise similar borrowers             in these states.       We

cannot directly identi~     credit demand and supply, but we examine whether the negative effect of a

high exemption      on the supply of credit is larger or smaller than the positive effect of a high exemption

on the demand for credit.      We also examine whether lenders charge higher interest rates in high-

exemption states.

                             V. Data, Identification, and Descriptive Evidence

      We use data from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to examine the empirical




     “For simplicity we assume that the probability of illness or job loss occurring is less than perfectly
correlated with the period 2 wealth distribution.

hypotheses. 1’ For a sample of 3,706 households, the SCF gives detailed information              on the types and

amounts of credit held by households, their assets, sources of income, demographic          characteristics,

credit market experience, and state of residence. 19

        We supplement the 1983 SCF with information         on states’ bankruptcy   exemptions    in 1983. Most

states have separate exemptions for equity in homesteads,        equity in motor vehicles, personal property,

tools of the trade, the cash value of life insurance and pensions, household goods and clothing, and a

miscellaneous    (“wildcard”)   catego~.   Some states allow debtors to choose be~een       the state’s

exemption     and the (uniform)   Federal exemption, while the rest require that the state’s exemptions        be

used.    Some states also allow married couples who file for bankruptcy       to double the exemptions.

Table I lists the homestead exemption and the combined value of the personal property, tools of the

trade, automobile    and wildcard exemptions in each state in 1983.20 The table also indicates whether

each state allows its residents to use the Federal bankruptcy      exemption (listed at the end of the table)

and whether the state allows married couples to double the exemption.

        The exemption values vary widely across states and there appears to be no strong geographic

pattem.21    Seven states have unlimited homestead exemptions,       while three states and the District of

Columbia have zero homestead exemptions (although they allow their residents to use the Federal




     “See Avery and Elliehausen [1988] for details about the data and Juster and Kuester [1991]; Curtin,
Juster, and Morgan [1989]; and Avery, Elliehausen, and Kennickell [1988] for a discussion of the 1983
SCF’S good data quality.

     “Later SCFS do not identify state of residence, so we are unable to use them for this paper. The 1983
SCF includes data on a subsample of high-income households, but because state of residence is not
provided for this group, we drop these households.

    ‘“We exclude the pension and life insurance exemptions because in many cmes they involve specific
conditions, such as requiring that the insurance only benefit dependents. We also exclude the exemption
for household goods and clothing since it is generally not subject to a dollar limitation.

    2’Exemptions change infrequently, which increases our confidence in treating the cross-state variation in
exemptions as exogenous to credit market behavior.

exemptions).       The combined value of non-homestead         exemptions   range from $0 in Connecticut to

$30,000 in Texas and is unlimited in two states.

      For each household in the SCF, we compute a value for the homestead plus non-homestead

exemptions      in bankruptcy.    Because assets are fungible, for the empirical work below we combine

exemptions.z2      The overall exemption is assumed to be unlimited if either the homestead or

non-homestead       exemption in the relevant state is unIimited.     If the state allows its residents to choose

between the state or the Federal exemption, then households are resumed to choose whichever

exemption      is greater.   We also double the exemption      if the SCF household is married and the relevant

state allows doubling for married couples.

      The SCF contains a set of questions that ask whether respondents have been turned down for

credit in the three years prior to the survey or whether they were discouraged           from applying to borrow

because they thought they would be turned down,           While it is common in the literature to interpret

these questions as indicating that a borrower       is credit constrained   (see, for example, Jappelli [1990]),

people could, in principal, be turned down because they asked for inappropriately            large amounts of

credit.   Cox and Jappelli [1993] and Duca and Rosenthal [1993], however, show that the observed

level of credit for SCF households who were turned down or discouraged               from borrowing   is roughly

$10,000 lower on average than would be predicted, where the predictions come from a selection model

of credit demand estimated using the characteristics        of the sub-sample of households who were not

turned down or discouraged        from borrowing.    This result supports the idea that SCF households who

were turned down or discouraged from borrowing            are in fact constrained   by credit supply (also see

Perraudin and Sorensen [1992]).        These questions allow us to examine the empirical hypothesis that

borrowers    in high-exemption     states are more likely to be turned down for loans than observationally



     22Elias, Renauer, and Leonard [1993, p. 2/20] gives this advice on asset substitution: “If you have an
asset that is not exempt, you may want to sell it before you file for bankruptcy. You can use the proceeds
to buy exempt property.”

equivalent borrowers      in low-exemption         states.

     For households that are not supply constrained, observed levels of credit reflect some mix of

supply factors, which should decrease the amount of credit made available to borrowers                        in high-

exemption    states, and demand factors, which should increase the amount of credit held by borrowers

in high-exemption     states.    Thus, an increase in the bankruptcy           exemption will have an ambiguous              a

priori effect on the amount of debt held by unconstrained                 households.   However, if we observe that

unconstrained    households      in high-exemption       states hold more debt than households in low-exemption

states, controlling   for other characteristics,      then we can infer that higher bankruptcy           exemptions

stimulate demand for credit.         Thus, the SCF data on debt held by households can be used to make

inferences about the effects of bankruptcy            exemptions on demand for credit.            Additionally,   this

discussion implies that credit should be more expensive in states with high exemptions.

     Two figures help illustrate our hypotheses.                Figure 11 plots the probability     of being turned down

for credit or discouraged       from borrowing       afier we split the sample into bankruptcy          exemption        quartiles

and asset quartiles.23    Households with “low” exemptions are in the bottom quartile of the combined

exemption distribution.         Households with “unlimited” exemptions are located in states that have either

an unlimited homestead exemption or an unlimited non-homestead                     exemption.       In each of the asset

quartiles, households in unlimited-exemption                 states are more likely to be turned down for credit than

are households in low-exemption          states.    The increased probability of being turned down or



    23The combined bankruptcy variable is discrete, hence the “quartiles” include uneven shares of the
population. The first quartile (up to $12,700) includes 27.1 percent of the population, the second (up to
$25,400) includes 31.5 percent and the third (up to $70,400) includes 22.7 percent of the population. The
remaining households live in states with unlimited exemptions (the top quartile, equalling 18.7 percent of
the population), We refer to this breakdown as quartiles throughout the rest of the paper. The results are
not sensitive to alternative, sensible specifications of the exemption variable.
     Total assets are composed of financial and real assets. Financial assets are the sum of checking
accounts, money market accounts, saving accounts, IRAs and Keoghs, CD’s, saving bonds, bonds, stocks,
mutual funds, and trust accounts. Real assets are net equity in the home plus net equity in other assets
such as cars and art work. The quartile breakpoints for the total asset distribution are $7,855, $48,535, and
$109,637.

                                                                  13
discouraged      from borrowing       in a unlimited-exemption          state ranges from 1.2 percentage points in the

bottom quartile of the asset distribution             to 8.7 percentage points (or 54 percent) in the second quartile.

      The effect of the bankruptcy exemption on households’                   demand for credit should depend

nonlinearly      on assets.   To illustrate, suppose the bankruptcy          exemption in a state increases to $40,000

from $30,000.        This change should increase the demand for credit by a household having $35,ooo in

assets, since the increase in the exemption level lowers the household’s                expected cost of borrowing,

but it would have little or no effect on the demand for credit by a household having $10,000 in assets.

In the extreme case of households that will never have assets, the bankruptcy                  exemption   will not affect

demand for credit because there is (and will be) nothing for these households to shelter in bankruptcy.

      Figure III graphs median total debt against quartiles of the distribution              of total assets and the

bankruptcy      exemption.     The figure shows the importance of accounting for potential nonlinearities               in

the asset-exemption       relationship.     For households in the bottom half of the asset distribution,        median

holdings of debt change little across exemption               levels.   For households in the top half of the asset

distribution,    median holdings of debt generally increase with the size of the exemption                 (although the

relationship     is not monotonic).

      The figures display patterns that are consistent with the empirical hypotheses.                The probability     of

being turned down for credit or discouraged               from borrowing      is positively related to the bankruptcy

exelnption      within asset quartiles.     Households in the top half of the asset distribution       in states with

high exemptions       appear to have stronger demand for credit than their counterparts             in states with low

exemptions.        We measure the size, significance,         and robustness of these effects, conditioning     on other

characteristics,     in the following     section.

                                                     VI. Regression Analysis

      Our first hypothesis is that the higher a state’s bankruptcy exemption, the more likely that lenders

turn down credit applicants or that applicants will be discouraged from borrowing.                    We examine this



                                                                 14
hypothesis using probit regression.

Probability     of Being Denied Credit

     The central variable of interest in the empirical model is the bankruptcy        exemption.      We use

dummy variables to represent quartiles of the exemption distribution,         with the lowest quartile being the

excluded category.        A number of other factors are also likely to affect the probability    that a household

gets turned down for credit or is discouraged from borrowing.           The life-cycle hypothesis suggests that

younger households are more likely to borrow than older households.            Consequently     we include age

and age squared in the regression.        Income affects households’   access to credit and may affect their

demand for credit, so income and income squared are included.”            In a manner similar to income,

assets affect households’       access to credit and may also affect their demand, so we include the level of

total assets in our analysis.      We use several additional variables to proxy for tastes:     family size,

education of the household head, and dummy variables for whether the household head is married or

is nonwhite,

     There may be geographic variation across credit markets that could spuriously influence our

exemption      variables.25    We include the Herfmdahl   index for financial institutions in the area as a crude

proxy variable for the competitiveness        of the local lending market, and dummy variables indicating

whether branch banking was allowed state-wide and whether multi-bank             holding companies were

prohibited     in the state.   We include the county unemployment      rate in 1992, a dummy variable for rural

households,     and three dummy variables for the region of the country (the west is the excluded

category) to account for potential geographic variation in credit markets.




     24For example, income tends to be positively correlated with tax rates. Households with high marginal
tax rates may find it profitable to borrow because the after-tax interest rate on borrowing is lower than the
after-tax rate of return on investments (recall that in 1983, interest on all loans was tax-deductible).

    “One potential source of geographic variation in credit markets might be state usury laws, but they had
been abolished by 1983.

                                                          15
         We also include additional observable characteristics    that enter the credit scoring finction    used by

financial institutions.    Following Boyes, Hoffman, and Low [1989], we include the mean income of

the profession of the household head (also see Cox and Jappelli [1993]) and years working at the

household head’s current employer.2b        Descriptive   statistics for the variables used in the analyses are

given in Appendix Table 1.

         Table II shows the results of a probit regression examining the factors correlated with being

turned down for credit or discouraged        from applying to borrow.     Standard errors are computed using

Huber’s method [StataCorp        1995] to account for potential correlation    in the error terms at the state

level.     We find that the exemption variable for households      in unlimited exemption states is positively

and significantly    related to the probability   of being turned down for credit or discouraged     from

borrowing.      This result is consistent with the descriptive evidence presented in Figure II. The fourth

column of the table shows the effect of a marginal change in a given covariate on the probability             of

not receiving credit.     It shows that the economic significance    of the bankruptcy variable is substantial.

In the sample, 17.3 percent of households were denied credit or discouraged from borrowing.                 The

exemption variables suggest that the probabi Iity of being turned down for credit or discouraged            from

borrowing      is 5.5 percentage points higher in states with unlimited exemptions than in states in the

bottom quartile of the exemption distribution.        The other two exemption dummies are not significantly

different from zero, but the point estimates show a roughly 2.7 percentage point difference.27

         As expected, the magnitude of all the estimated exemption coefficients      increases if the sample is

restricted to households with low assets. If we restrict the sample to households in the bottom half of



    2’Boyes, Hoffman, and Low [1989] had access to confidential credit history information (especially
credit bureau reports) when estimating their score function of being turned down for a credit card,

     27The results are robust to a large number of alternative specifications and the inclusion of additional
geographic characteristics. Dropping the regional dummies increases the magnitude of the exemption
variables by roughly one percentage point, makes the second exemption dummy significant at the 7 percent
level, and the others significant at all usual levels of confidence.

                                                          16
the asset distribution,    the marginal effect for the unlimited exemption increases to 7.9 percentage

points.     If we restrict the sample firther,   to households in the bottom quarter of the asset distribution,

the marginal effect increases to 10.2 percentage points.         It is statistically significant   in each

specification.      Thus, it appears that the bankruptcy exemption is strongly correlated with the

probability      of being turned down for credit or discouraged from borrowing,          particularly   for low-asset

households.

        The other coefficient    estimates conform to intuition and previous empirical estimates (for

example, Jappelli [1990]).        The probability   of being denied credit or discouraged      from applying falls

at an increasing rate with age and falls at a decreasing rate with income.           The banking market

variables suggest that households       are less likely to be turned down for credit or discouraged           from

applying in more highly concentrated          financial markets and states that prohibit multi-bank          holding

companies.       All the binary covariates are interpreted as the effect of switching the variable to one from

zero.     The largest economic effects are that nonwhite households are 8,7 percentage points more likely

to be denied credit and married households are 5.7 percentage points less likely to be denied credit,

relative to baseline characteristics    evaluated at the mean.

Household Debt2’

        We write households’      desired level of debt, D as


                                                 D = X~l + alE + Cl,



where E is the bankruptcy         exemption   in the household’s state of residence and X denotes a vector of


other factors influencing       the demand for debt.   We do not observe D, however, because the household

may be turned down for credit or discouraged           from applying and therefore the observed level of debt,



    28The selection model of household debt is similar to Cox and Jappelli [1993] and Duca and Rosenthal
[1993]. Neither previous study examines the effect of bankruptcy exemptions on credit markets.

D*, may be less than D.      In addition, the distribution    of D * is truncated at zero.   Therefore,     we


define two indicator variables

where Ild distinguishes   households that are not turned down or discouraged        from applying for loans,


and Zzddistinguishes   households with positive observed amounts of debt.         We parametrize      the


indicator functions using a bivariate probit model,




                                                  Zld= xTp T +    &T

where XT represents a vector of factors influencing the decision of banks to deny credit to applicants,


Xz represents a vector of factors affecting the incidence of positive debt, and E~ and Cz are

      The empirical model of the demand for debt is

is a normally distributed error tern.

      Because the distribution      of household debt is highly skewed, we use the natural logarithm of total

household debt as the dependent variable in our primary specification.        To account for potential

nonlinearities   between the bankruptcy exemption      and assets, we treat the combined bankruptcy

exemption     as a continuous variable for states whose exemptions     are not unlimited and interact this

exemption variable with asset quartile dummies,        leading to four asset-exemption   interaction variables

(where states with unlimited exemptions are coded as zeros).        Because any specific coding of the

unlimited exemption states is arbitrary, we also add a second set of four variables that interact the

dummy variable for states with unlimited exemptions with the four asset quartile dummies.            We also

include an age spline (defined in Appendix I) for the age of the household head to capture life-cycle

patterns in the use of debt, and a series of dummy variables measuring the educational         attainment of

the household head (where the omitted category is no high school diploma).           Otherwise the covariates



     29Estimates for the bivariate probit model are given in Appendix Table II. The specification for the
denied or discouraged from borrowing portion of the model is identical to Table II, with the coding of the
dependent variable reversed. The covariates for having positive amounts of credit differ by dropping one
of the variables included as part of the bank’s credit scoring function (average income in the household
head’s profession) and by adding a dummy variable for “attitude toward credit.” The latter variable comes
from an SCF question that asks whether respondents think “it is a good idea or a bad idea for people to
buy things on the installment plan.” Three answers are possible: “good idea”, “good in some ways, bad in
others, ” and “bad idea. ” We expect households answering the question that credit is a “bad idea” are less
likely to apply for credit and therefore more likely to have zero debt without ever having been turned down
for credit, making this a useful exclusion restriction.

are the same as in the probit equation for positive debt.

      Table III gives estimates for the amounts of debt held by households that were not denied credit

or discouraged     from borrowing.       As in Figure III, debt holdings are positively and significantly

correlated with the bankruptcy exemption          for households in the top half of the asset distribution.      The

effects are larger for almost all households       in states with unlimited exemptions than similar households

in states without unlimited exemptions.         This result is consistent with the hypothesis that increases in

the personal bankruptcy       exemption    increase demand for debt by high-asset households.        The estimated

coefficient    on the exemption for households in the bottom quartile of the asset distribution         is negative

and significant,    indicating that households with no or few assets hold less debt in high-exemption

states than observationally     equivalent borrowers    in low-exemption    states. The mean effects are

considerably     larger for households    in states with unlimited exemptions.     Thus, the evidence suggests

that the demand effect exceeds the supply effect for high-asset households in high-exemption               states,

whi Ie the supply effect exceeds the demand effect for low-asset households in high-exemption               states.

     We find a life-cycle pattern of debt in which households under age 35 have higher levels of debt,

and debt declines almost monotonically         for older households.   Debt increases with education,      income

(though at a decreasing rate), assets, being married, family size, and living in the west.           Debt is

negatively related to the concentration       of the financial market and the number of years that the

household head has worked at the current employer.

     The selection term for the probability        of being credit constrained   is negative and significant.    This

result implies that unobserved factors that increase the probability       of being denied credit are negatively

correlated with the unobserved factors that affect credit demand.          This selection result is similar to

Cox and Jappelli [1993].

     Selection models of the type described above impose stringent distributional            assumptions    on the

error terms and, when violated, can generate misleading          inferences [Goldberger,    1983].   To examine



                                                          20
the robustness of our results, we also estimate the debt equation using median regression. This

alternative specification provides a usefil check for the sensitivity of our analysis to distributional

assumptions   and outliers.30 The results are given in Table IV, where the dependent variable is defined

as the log of total household debt (adding $1 to total household debt to avoid taking the log of zero).

Standard errors are bootstrapped.      The sign, size and significance of the central variables of interest –

the bankruptcy    exemption   interacted with assets – are consistent across the two specifications.31

     In Table V we examine the economic significance of the coefficient          estimates from the double

selection model of log debt.     Our baseline household is defined as having the following        characteristics:

gross assets of $100,000 (3rd quartile), 45 years old, coIlege degree, income of $75,000, married,

family size of four, white, male head of household, living in the midwest,        10 years of job tenure, and

living in an area with a county unemployment         rate of 9.64 percent and a Hefilndahl     index of financial

market concentration     of 1.377.   We estimate that this household would have $31,014 of debt in a state

with a combined bankruptcy       exemption of $6,000 (such as Maryland or West Virginia).           If the

household lived in a state with an exemption of $50,000 (roughly the size of California’s           exemption),

we estimate that the household would have debt of $49,725.          Other characteristics    also have large

effects, particularly   for households in high exemptions states.    Thus, state bankruptcy     exemptions

appear to have a substantial effect on households’ debt levels.

                                       VII.    Do Interest Rates Adjust?

      Creditors may respond in a number of ways to the phenomenon of bankruptcy relative to a

situation where borrowers never default:        raise interest rates, set higher minimum standards to quali~

for loans, increase collateral requirements,     or screen loan applicants more vigorously.      In this section




    ‘“The largest value of debt in our sample is $1,247,000.

     3’The other covariates generally retain their patterns and significance, with the exception of the age
spline, assets, and several of the indicator variables.
we examine whether households who live in states with higher bankruptcy               exemptions   pay higher

interest rates on loans than households who live in states with lower bankruptcy            exemptions.       Our

sample is households       in the 1983 SCF who purchased new or used cars during 1982 or the first

quarter of 1983 and financed their purchases with loans, which gives us a homogeneous                sample of

loans.   We further limited our sample to households who obtained their loans from commercial                   banks,

savings and loans, or credit unions.32 This process yields a sample of310            households.

      Because the sample consists only of households who purchased cars with credit, we estimate a

standard Heckit selection model.33 All other independent           variables are defined as above, but we also

include quarterly dummy variables that allow for quarterly variation in the level of interest rates.                The

exemption       variables are defined exactly as in Tables III and IV.

      Results for the interest rate model are presented in Table VI. Bankruptcy            exemptions     are

significantly     and positively related to the interest rate for households in the two lowest asset quartiles.

In order to quanti~      the magnitude of the effects, we again use the baseline household defined in Table

V, with the exception that the household owns only $30,000 in assets, which would put it in the

second quartile of the asset distribution     (effects are insignificant   in the top two asset quartiles).     In a

state with a $5,000 bankruptcy exemption, this household would pay an interest rate of 17.8 percent

on its car loan.     In a state with a $50,000 exemption,      the household would pay an interest rate of 20.1

percent, or 230 basis points higher.       This 13 percent increase is well within the range of rates observed




    32We eliminated households who obtained credit from friends, dealers and automobile financing
companies, since interest rates on these loans clearly would reflect a host of other factors. For example, a
car dealer can offer a lower interest rate by adjusting the purchase price of the car.

     331naddition to functional form, the selection model is identified using the attitudinal variable whether
the household thinks that it is a “good idea” to borrow. As before, households who think it is not a good
idea to borrow are less likely to be in the selected sample. The probit results are given in Appendix Table
111.

in the sample during this high-interest-rate       sample period.34

     This result is consistent with the results found in previous sections of the paper.              It appears that

low-asset households do not demand more debt in high exemption states, because they pay higher

interest rates than they would pay in low exemption             states.   However, high-asset households do not

pay significantly    higher interest rates in high-exemption         states than in low-exemption    states, probably

because they have assets greater than the bankruptcy            exemption    level or they offer lenders greater

collateral .35

                                                  VIII. Conclusions

     In this paper we find a number of empirical results that are consistent with simple hypotheses

about the effects of the bankruptcy exemption on credit markets.               We find that the size of the relevant

state’s bankruptcy     exemption    has a statistically and economically       significant, positive effect on the

probability that potential borrowers in the state are denied credit or are discouraged              from applying to

borrow.    We also find that households in the lower half of the asset distribution            have less debt and

face higher interest rates on car loans in states with high bankruptcy exemptions than borrowers in

low-exemption       states, afier conditioning   on observable characteristics.      In contrast, households in the

upper half of the asset distribution      have more credit in states with high bankruptcy exemptions,

suggesting that these households have higher credit demand that lenders are willing to accommodate.

Thus, while generous state-level bankruptcy exemptions would probably be viewed by most




    34Most other variables conform to expectations. Even controlling for differences in market structure,
some regional variation in interest rates remains, as households in the northeast face lower interest rates
than anywhere else in country. Interest rates varied considerably even during this short time frame of 15
months, reflecting the volatility of interest rates during the 1982-1983 sample period.

     35We also ran a similar regression for the term to maturity of loans. The thought was that loans with
shorter terms to maturities would be considered “safer” by banks. Indeed, using the exact same model w
before we find that high bankruptcy exemptions appear to reduce the term to maturity by about 12 months
for low asset households. Again we find that car loans to high-asset households are not significantly
affected by changes in exemption levels. The results are available from the authors upon request.

                                                           23
policymakers      as benefiting   less-well-off   borrowers,    our results suggest they increase the amount of

credit held by high-asset households and reduce the availability           of credit to low-asset households,     i.e.,

they redistribute    credit toward borrowers with high resets.

     Given the explosion in the number of personal bankruptcy filings (to roughly 900,000 in 1992,

from roughly 300,000 in 1983), we suspect that the empirical magnitudes documented                 in this paper are

conservative    estimates of the current economic effects of personal bankruptcy          exemption   levels on

credit markets.     Moreover,     in 1994 Congress passed the National Bankruptcy        Review Commission        Act,

which, among other provisions,        doubled the Federal personal bankruptcy exemption and, therefore,

increased the number of households who would benefit financially from filing for bankruptcy.                Thus,

personal bankruptcy      may become an even more important influence on credit markets in the future.
