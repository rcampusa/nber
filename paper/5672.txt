                         PERFORMANCE          PAY AND PRODUCTIVITY



                                            ABSTRACT



       What happens when a firm switches from paying hourly wages to paying piece rates? The

theory developed below predicts that average productivity rises, that the firm will attract a more able

work force and that the variance in output across individuals at the firm will rise as well. The theory

is tested with data from a large autoglass company that changed compensation       structures between

1994 and 1995. All theoretical predictions are borne out. In the firm examined, the productivity

effects are extremely large, amounting to anywhere from about 20% to 36% of output, depending

on what is held constant. About half of the worker-specific increase in productivity is passed on to

workers in the form of higher wages.

         Many believe that an easy way to increase productivity in an organkation                     is to pay on the

basis of measured performance.          Of course, there are some difficulties associated with performance

pay schemes that have been pointed out in the literature. 1 There have been few attempts to examine

the choice of payment scheme and its effect on output.2 In large part, the lack of literature is a direct

result of a lack of data. It is difficult to fmd situations where some workers are paid on the basis of

performance and other workers are paid according to some other scheme, coupled with the condition

that the comparisons do not *O involve a number of other factors that vary across the groups,                        The

analysis in this paper does not suffer from the traditional problem.               It is based on data from a large

autoglass company named Safelite Glass Corporation.              During 1994 and 1995, after the introduction

of new management, the company gradually changed the compensation                        method for its work force,

moving them from hourly wages to piece rate pay. The effects, which are documented below, were

dramatic and completely in line with economic theory.

         In what follows, the theory of piece rate compensation is sketched with particular emphasis

on the predictions that pertain to changes in the compensation method.                  The theory is backed up by

the empirical results, the most important of which are:

         1. A switch to piece rate pay has a sigtilcant           effect on average levels of output.          This is in

the range of a 36% gain.




          ‘See Lazear (1986) for a detailed discussion of when to pay a piece rate, which is defined to be payment on the
basis of output, Also, Fama ( 1991) discusses other reasons for paying on the basis of some measured time interval.
Baker (1992) discusses the difi]culties created by pay-for-performance structures when measurement is a problem. A
very early discussion of the incentive effects of piece rates can be found in Slichter (1928), Ch. 13.

         2A notable exception is Brown ( 1992). Some have looked at the effects of compensation in the sports world.
Most recently, Fernie and Metcalf ( 1996) find that when payment is contingent on performance, jockeys better
performance than when payment is unrelated to performance. Also, Parsch and Shearer (1996) find that tree planters in
British Columbia produce higher levels of output when paid on piece rate, but that they fatigue more rapidly.

                                                            1
            2. The gain can k split into two components.   More than half of the increase in productivity

results from the average worker producing more because of incentive effects. Some results from a

reduction in turnover among the most productive workers and an ability to hire the most productive

workers. None reflects the “Hawthorne effect. ”

            3. Productivity gains show up in a number of ways. In addition to an increase in the number

of pieces produced in a given day and altering turnover, moving to pay for performance             implies

reductions in absenteeism.

        4. The f~m shares the gains in productivity with its workforce.        For a given worker, about

half of the worker-specific     increased productivity is captured by the worker.

            5. Moving to piece rate pay increases the variance in output.   More ambitious workers have

less incentive to differentiate themselves when hourly wages are paid than when piece rate pay is

used. Also, the variance in underlying ability rises because the most able workers are attracted by the

piece rate.

        The evidence implies that the choice of compensation method is important, not that piece rates

are good.      In equilibrium, f~rns choose a compensation method, based on the costs and benefits of

the various schemes. Firms that continue to pay hourly wages must, in equilibrium, fmd that benefits

of paying an hourly wage, such as low monitoring costs and perhaps higher quality output, outweigh

the costs in the form of lower output.

            Some conclusions are unambiguous.       Workers respond to prices just as economic theory

predicts.     Claims by sociologists and others that monetizing incentives may actually reduce output

are unambiguously       refuted by the data. Not only do the effects back up economic predictions, but

the effects are extremely large and precisely in line with theory.

        The evidence allows somewhat broader interpretation.       It is often difficult to obtain actual

data on consumers and their reactions to changes in prices. Tests of even the most basic tenets of

economic theory are dfilcult to perform, at least at a micro level. These data we well-suited to that

purpose. While expertints    bear out the basic response of economic agents to prices, the data used

in this paper come from the real world, rather than a laborato~ setting. Compensation,     which reflects

the most important price that a consumer faces, truly matters to the workers in this setting, and they

respond accordingly.

Modeling Choice of Pay Scheme:        Hourly Wages versus Piece Rates

        The primary motivation behind instituting a piece rate scheme is to increase worker effort.

While it may seem obvious that moving from hourly wages to piece rates would increase effort, it is

not.   When a fwm institutes an hourly wage schedule, it usually couples the payment with some

minimum level of output that is acceptable.    It is possible, therefore, that the minimum acceptable

output chosen for hourly wage workers exceeds the level of output that workers voluntarily choose

under a piece rate. Further, it maybe that the minimum level chosen under hourly wages is so high

that ordy the most able workers       can make the cut.      When piece rates are instituted,       more

heterogeneity y might be tolerated, resulting in lower average levels of output.

        In some sense, the term “performance pay” is not very useful. Even if we restrict performance

pay to refer to pay based on output (rather than input), a broad set of compensation         schemes are

included. Hourly wages that are coupled with some minimum standard could be called performance

pay, because a performance standard must be met to retain employment.              In fact, were workers

homogeneous,    an hourly wage structure with a minimum number of units tolerated per hour can
achieve the efficient outcome.’

          Given that workers differ in their talent, ambition, or willingness to trade time for money, it

is necessary to derive the optimal minimum standard under hourly wages in a more general context.

The resulting levels of output and the distribution of worker abilities is then compared with that

which is expected to result under the piece rate scheme that was chosen by Safelite.

          Begin, then, by defining e to be the output level chosen by a worker, which is a function of

underlying abtity, A, and of effort choice. Let A - g(A) with distribution function G(A). The activity

in question in the empirically analysis, specifically, the installation of glass into automobiles,                   is easily

monitored.      Thus, suppose that the f~m can observe e,

Hourly Wages

          The firm that pays an hourly wage can specify some minimally acceptable level of output per

hour eO. The fum fies workers whose output falls consistently below eO. Commensurate                                with that


level of required output is some wage, W, that the f~m offers. The worker’s utility finction is given

by

(1)                                                                       C(e)
                                                    Utility    = Income - —
                                                                           A



where C(e) is the homogeneous part of the cost function with C‘, C“>CJ . Since A measures ability,

individuals with higher levels of ability have lower costs of producing any given level of output, e.4




          ‘To do this, simply solve for the efficient level of effort per hour which sets tie marginal cost of effort equal to
the marginal value of effort. Require that level of effort as the minimum standard for the job. Then, set the hourly wage
just high enough to attract workers to the firm.

           4 The words “ output” and “effort are used interchangeably. It is always possible to redetine C(e) such that one
unit of effort, say measured in calories burned, produces one unit of output.

                                                               4
        As mentioned above, were workers homogeneous          and output or effort observable, it would

be straightforward      to implement the efficient level of effort using hourly wages and an output

requirement.   Given the utility function in (1), the efficient level of output is e*, such that

        C’(e*)/A      =1

because the marginal value of a unit of output is normalized to be 1. The f~m could simply require

that workers produce at least e*. Then the f~m would set the wage, W, such that

        W = C(e*) /A

so that workers would be willing to work.

        Workers      are heterogeneous   and this makes the problem more dtilcult      for the f~m.   The

problem is that the standard and wage that is right for one group of workers is not right for another

group. Thus, the f~m must choose a standard and wage that is the best compromise.           The problem

is solved as follows:

        For any given pair of required output and wage, (eO,~,      there is a group of workers who will


accept the job. SpecKlcally, only those with sufficiently high ability such that

        W> C(eO) /A

accept the job. The minimum ability individual who will accept a job that requires eO of output to


be produced is&       such that

(2)     W = C(eO)/AO.

        Suppose that the firm receives a given number of job applications in any period. Then the fwm

wants to maximize expected profits, taking into account that a high wage is more likely to attract

workers, but that a low wage yields higher profit on any given worker.       It is not obvious that effort



                                                    5
is low in an hourly wage fum because it is possible that the firm may choose to specify a level of eO


that exceeds the level chosen in the piece rate problem.   Of course, requiring a higher eOimplies that

the f~m must pay a higher W to attract any given worker.

         All workers with ability levels that exceed AO earn rents because they are required only to


produce eOof output and the pain associated with producing it is lower than the pain for individuals

with ability AO, who are just indifferent between working and not.         However,   because there is


competition horn other f~ms in this industry and others, a worker must compare the rents earned at

this f~m with those earned elsewhere.

         Define R(A) as the rent that a worker of ability A can expect to receive elsewhere, with

R ‘(A) >0 because higher ability workers can always do what a lower ability worker can do elsewhere


and do it with less pain,      Thus, workers who have       R(A) > W - C(eO)/A will choose to work


ekewhere. Thus, for any wage policy Wand work requirement         eO, there is a group of workers who


wiU work at the fwm. Since all receive the same wage, all choose to produce at the minimum level

of output, eO. Those willing to work have ability greater than AO, but less than Ah, where Ah


solves

(3)      W- C(e,,)/Ah =R(Ah).


This situation is illustrated in figure 1.

          Ability is shown on the horizontal ah.        As rises,   W- C(eO)/A      rises because higher ability


individuals     produce     output eO at less cost. Both       AO and Ah are defined as in (2) and (3),


respectively.       In fig. 1, R(A) is shown to cross     W – C(eO)/A.     This is reasonable since more able


workers do not earn higher wages under the straight hourly wage scheme. Every worker earns Wand

produces      eO. The ordy reason that rents are higher on the current job for higher ability workers is


that the more able accomplish the task more easily. But other fums need not constrain all workers

to earn the same amount. It is for this reason that R(A) is steeper than W- C(eO)/A.                  (It is possible,


however, that R(A) would never cross W- C(eO)/A.             If opportunities   outside are sufficiently bad, all


workers with A >AOwould work at this f~m and Ah = m). AU workers with ability A, such that

       The problem for the fm is to choose W’and e& The f~m wants to choose a lower W for any

given level of output, but this will affect the number of individuals who are willing to work on this

job. Similarly, the firm would like to set the minimum output standard as high as possible.                But for

any given W, higher required levels of output mean that fewer workers are willing to take the job.

       The maximization problem for the f~m can be written formally as

                                                       Ah

It is the correct choice for almost no specific worker type. Output eO is to high for A. and too low

pay allows better adjustment for worker heterogeneity.                 Those who want to put forth higher levels

Given (8), eO* is the solution to




         ‘The analysis is tedious, but similar to that given in the previous text and footnote. The logic is that if even the
highest ability worker were producing above his optimal level of effort, W could be reduced by more than the lost output
to make both worker and firm better off, But if reducing   eO and W is viable for the most able worker, it is even more
beneficial to lower ability workers, for whom higher standards impose even greater costs.

                                                             10
(9)            C’(eO*)/Ao*      = b .

       Similarly, define e~* as the output level chosen by the highest ability worker,         Ah*, who


chooses to work. Given (8), e~* is the solution to

(lo)           C’(e~*) /Ah*     = b .

       In order to fit the Safelite situation analyzed in the empirical section below, it is useful to

model the effects of switching from an hourly wage with minimum standard to a piece rate with a

minimum guarantee.      As part of S afelite’s plan, it offered a guarantee at approximately   the former

wage. The guarantee was coupled, presumably, with the same minimum standard of eO as before.


Thus, the plan paid W to anyone who would have earned less than W under the piece rate, but paid

the piece rate to all of those whose compensation by the piece rate formula would have exceeded       W.

The scheme used is

(11)     Compensation     = max [W, be- fl.

The situation is shown in figure 2.




                                                    11

   Compensation




    w




    -K




         This scheme is typical of many salespersons’ plans. A draw, in this case equal to W, is paid




up to some level of output. Until that t~get level is reached, the worker receives ordy W. After q*,

he begins to receive additional compensation for increases in output.    Of course, this scheme charges

all workers   whose output exceeds W the amount K for the job.          As long as the worker produces

q>q *, his compensation is given by be - K. At most firms, workers who continually dip into their

draw by producing qeq” are likely to fmd their employment terminated after some period of time.

         It is now possible to state proposition       1.

Proposition 1: Effort is does not decrease when the f~m switches horn hourly wages to piece rates,

and for high enough values of b, effort increases.

Proof    Output cannot fall below eO because of the f~m imposed constraint at eO. But output may


exceed eO if for some A, AosAsAh,




                                                            12
(P1.1)      W- C(eo)/A<be*(A)              -K-    C(e*(A))/A.


Then the worker of type A prefers to work above the level given by the guarantee.                     Since all workers

worked      at level eO under hourly wages, output rises with piece rates for b sufficiently high to


guarantee that condition (Pl. 1) holds for some A. III

          Because the guarantee binds for some workers, but not for all, effort does not increase for all

workers. Workers whose optimal level of effort by (8) lies to the left of q * in fig. 2 gain nothing by

increasing effort. But those whose optimal level of effort is sufficiently high may choose to work

enough to be on the upward sloping portion of the compensation function.

          It is now possible to determine which type of worker is willing to work for the f~m under the

new compensation scheme, Recall that A. and Ah were the lower and upper cutoffs of workers under

the hourly wage. Defie the lower and upper cutoffs in the new regime as AO* and Ah *, respectively.

          Let us examine the relation of AO* to A. and of Ah” to Ah. Fkst note that A. * =Ao if


(12)
                                              bee* -K-     C(eo*)/Ao<W-        C(eo)iAo,



here eO* was defied           above as the optimal output for type A. under piece rates.


          When (12) holds, all A. t~es prefer to accept the guaranteed wage of W and to work at eO.


Nothing is changed for the lowest ability individual.                Since types A. do not take advantage of piece


rates, no one with A <A. wiU take advantage of piece rates so the bottom cutoff remains unchanged. 8



           ‘It must be true that if   A. accepts the guarantee of W, then anyone with A <A. accepts the guarantee as well.
But   A. is detined as the lowest type to accept the cutoff.

                                                                13
Conversely, if ( 12) does not hold, then A. strictly prefers the piece rate which means that rents are


positive for A. types. This implies that there exists A <A. for whom rents are zero. But A.* is


defined as the (new) type who cams zero rents at the job. Thus, when condition ( 12) does not hold,

AO*<AO.


Also, if

(13)                                       beh* -K-    C(eh*)/Ah> W- C(eo)/Ah,




(where e~* was defined as the optimal output for type Ah under piece rates)


then Ah* >Ah.


           When condition (13) holds, the highest ability type under the hourly wage shuns the guarantee

in favor of higher effort, higher earnings piece rates. This implies that Ah now earns rents and can


no longer be the marginal worker. Then there must exist an A >Ah who is willing to work at the fum


as well. Thus, Ah* >Ah.


           It is now possible to state the following proposition:

Proposition     2: A sufficient condition for the average ability of the work force to rise after the switch

to piece rates is that some workers accept the guaranteed wage and some workers choose to work

enough to k on the piece rate. In terms of figure 2, as long as there are workers whose output lies

on both sides of q *, average ability rises.

Proofi




                                                      14
         If any accept the wage gumantee, then surely A.               accepts the guarantee.        We know that AO


is willing to work for W at effort eO because A. worked under these terms before.                         Furthermore,


since the guarantee has not been made any more attractive, no one with A CA. is willing to work.


But this means that condition (12) must hold, so A.* =Ao.


         Conversely,      if any choose to work in the piece rate range, then surely the worker with the

highest ability chooses to work in this range. But the highest ability worker cannot be Ah. If Ah


chooses to work in the piece rate range, then condition (13) holds, which implies that Ah* >Ah.


It is possible, that Ah chooses to accept the wage guarantee and another worker chooses to work in


the piece rate range. But that worker must have A >Ah or Ah would prefer the piece rate as well,


In this case Ah>Ah *. Since A.* =Ao, and since Ah* >Ah, average ability must rise. 1II


         Average ability rises because the ability of the lowest quality worker does not change as a

result of the switch in compensation           scheme, but the average ability of the highest quality worker

rises. Because a piece rate allows the more able to work harder and receive more from the job, and

because the hourly wage does not, more able workers prefer piece rates. The least able worker is

indifferent ktween the two schemes. switching               to piece rates has the effect of improving retention

and recruitment of high quality workers.9

Proposition 3: A sufficient condition for the variance of worker ability and output to rise after the




          %e condition that some workers continue to opt for the guaranteed wage is not superfluous. Were all workers
to opt for the piece rate, then it is possible that even very low ability workers who did not work before now work for the
firm. Their addition could actually result in a lowering of average quality.

                                                            15
switch to piece rates is that some workers accept the guaranteed wage and some workers choose to

work enough to be on the piece rate.

Proofi

         From the proof to proposition 2, A.* =Ao and Ah* >Ah. This is sufficient to imply that


variance in ability rises. Also, since all workers choose to produce eO under the hourly wage, but


workers who work on piece rates chooses e according to (8) under a piece rate, positive variance in

A implies positive variance in e under piece rates. Ill

         Even if underlying ability levels did not change, variance in productivity would rise because

workers choose the same level of output under an hourly wage, but type-specific levels of output

under piece rates. When it is recognized that the maximum ability level increases under a piece rate,

the change in output variance becomes even greater,

Data:

         Safelite Glms Corporation is located in Columbus Ohio and is the country’s largest installer

of automobile glass. Recently, Safelite, under the direction of CEO, Garen Staglin, and President,

John Barlow, instituted a new compensation scheme for the autoglass installers.   Until January, 1994,

glass installers were paid an hourly wage rate, which did not vary in any direct way with the number

of windows that were installed. During 1994 and 1995, installers were shifted from an hourly wage

schedule to performance pay - specifically, to a piece rate schedule.   Rather than being paid for the

number of hours that they worked, installers were now paid for the number of glass units that they

installed. The rates vmied somewhat, on average installers were paid $20 per unit installed. At the

time that the piece rates were instituted, the workers were also given a guarantee of approximately



                                                  16
$11 per hour.      If their weekly pay came out to less than the guarantee, they would be paid the

guaranteed amount.     Many workers ended up in the guarantee range.

          Safelite has a very sophisticated computerized information system, which keeps track of how

many units of each kind that each installer in the company installed in a given week. For the purposes

here, monthly data were used. Since PPP (performance pay plan) was phased in over the 18 month

period,   most workers were employed under both regimes.           Thus, data on individual output are

available for most installers both during the hourly wage period and during the PPP period.        This

before-and-tier   comparison with person spectilc data provides a very clean body of information on

which to base an analysis of performance pay.

          Some basic characteristics of the sample are reported in table 1. The data are organized as

follows. Each month provides an independent unit of observation.      There are 38,764 person months

of data covering a 19 month period.       Thus, there are 38764/19 or 2040 workers employed during

the average month.     Over the 19 month period, there was a total of 3707 different individuals who

worked for Stielite as installers, called “associates.”   The number of “good” observationsis31,    104

when partial months are dropped from the data set.

          There are a number of possible productivity measures.    The one that most Safelite managers

look to is UAD, or units-per-associate-per-day.       This is the total number of glass units per 8 hour

day that are installed by a given associate. The UAD number for each individual observation relates

to a given associate in a given month. Thus, UAD is the average number of units per 8 hour period

instaLled by the given associate during the given month.

          The average number of glass units installed per day over the entire period is 2.96, with a

standard deviation of 1,53. Under the PPP formula, the average worker would have earned $1711


                                                     17
if ordy the PPP formula were used. In actuality, the average actual pay was $2250. The difference

reflects vacation, holiday and sick pay, as well as two other factors. First, not all workers are on PPP

during the period. When on hourly wages, some received higher compensation       than they would have

had they been on PPP, given the number of units installed. Of course, when a given worker switches

to PPP, incentives change and his output may go up enough to cover the deficit. Second, even when

workers are on PPP, a substantial fraction of person weeks calculated on the basis of the PPP formula

come in below the guaranteed weekly compensation.        The guarantee binds for those worker weeks

and actual pay then exceeds PPP pay. In all months after the introduction        of PPP, at least some

workers received the guaranteed pay and some earned more than the guarantee.        Thus, the sufficient

conditions for propositions   2 and 3 are met throughout the period.

Note: 1563 observations were dropped because the individual spent part of the month on PPP and part on hourly wages.


         The story that will be told in more detail below shows up in the simple means. The average

level of UAD is about .54 units, or 20% higher in the piece rate regime than in the hourly wage

regime. Also, the variance in output goes up when switching from hourly wages to piece rates, as

can be seen by comparing the standard deviations of 1.58 to 1.41. Thus, propositions                      1, 2 and 3,

which state that both mean and variance in output rise when switching from hourly wages to piece

rates are borne out by the simple statistics.            Further, note that there is a good indication that

profitability went up significantly with the switch. The cost per unit is considerably lower in the piece



        ‘“Only observations where workers were on one pay regime or the other for the full month are used. Partial
month observations are deleted.

rate regime than it is with hourly wages. 11

         The simple statistics do not take other factors into account.                In particular, autoglass demand

is closely related to miles driven, which varies with weather.               Major storms also cause glass damage.

Month effects and year effects matter.            Perhaps more important, the management change that took

place before PPP was instituted had other direct effects on the company as well that may have

changed output during the sample period, irrespective of the switch to PPP.                            To deal with these

factors, row 1 of table 3 reports the coefficients from a regression of the log of UAD month and year

dummies. The coefficient on PPPFLAG is .36, indicating that there is a 36% gain in productivity as

measured by UAD associated with a move to PPP.

         There are three possible interpretations of this extremely large and statistically precise effect.

First, the gain in productivity may result from incentive effects associated with the program.                       Second,

the gain may result from sorting.           A different group of workers may be present after the switch to

piece rates. Third, the pattern of implementation may cause a spurious positive effect. Suppose that

Stielite picked its best workers to put on piece rates first. The PPPFLAG coefficient would pickup

an ability effect because high ability workers would have more PPP months than low ability workers.

These three effects can all be identified by using the data in a variety of ways.




          1‘The fact that actual pay has only risen slightly after the switch to PPP than before reflects the phase in pattern
of the PPP program. Lower wage areas were brought into the program first, which means that the PPP= I data are
dominated by lower wage markets,

         Regression 1 hm a coefficient on PPPFLAG of .36. When worker dummies are included, the

coefficient drops to .20. Still, .20 is a huge number and is the pure incentive effect that results from

switching from hourly wages to piece rates. A given worker installs 20% more units after the switch

to PPP than he did before the switch to PPP. This estimate controls for month and year effects.

There is no interpretation     of the PPPF’LAG coefficient in regression 2 other than the incentive one.

Individual ability is held constant m is location by including the person dummies.                   Approximately      5/9

of the 36% difference in productivity attributed to the PPP program reflects an incentive effect.

         Nor does this gain appear to be a “Hawthorne effect.”12 This can be seen by examining

regression 3 in table 3. The variable, ‘TENUR”,              is not actual years of tenure in the firm because the

true start date is unavailable. But TENUR does measure the passage of time in the f~m. Specifically,

it is defined as the time since either the beginning of the sample period, i.e., January, 1994, or the

gains in productivity.

worker’s    start date, whichever is later. Thus, if the worker had started sometime before January,

1994, tenure in July, 1994 would be .5. If the worker had started in April, 1994, then tenure in July,

1994 would be .25. The coefficient on TENUR differs from true tenure effects only to the extent that

nonlirtearities Me important. The variable, “PPPTENUR”                is defined as the number of years since the

worker was switched horn hourly wage to piece rate, times PPPFLAG.                      For example, a worker who

started 1994 on hourly wages and was switched to PPP on July 1, 1994 would have PPPTENUR=O

for the June, 1994 observation,          .5 for the January, 1995 observation,           and 1.0 for the June, 1995

observation.

         Tenure effects Me Itige and sigtilcant.           One year of experience raises productivity by about

10%. 13More interesting, perhaps, is the effect of time on the PPP program.                     The coefficient of .26

on PPPTENUR, coupled with a PPPFLAG coefficient of .29, means that the initial effect of switching

from hourly wage to piece rate is to increase productivity by 29%. Mer one year on the program,

the increase in productivity has grown to .29 + .26 or 55Y0. The Hawthorne effect would imply a

negative coefficient on PPPTENUR.             If the Hawthorne effect held, then the longer the worker were

on the progr~       the smaller would be the effect of piece rates on productivity.               The reverse happens

here. Mer workers are switched to piece rates, they seem to learn ways to work faster or harder as

time progresses. 14

sorting. nose who are not making it get fired or quite, It is impossible to hold month, year, and tenure effects constant

piece rate system and that PPPTENUR reflecrs the differential sorting rate under the PPP program.

Sorting:

          The theory stated in propositions 2 and 3 suggests that the optimal piece rate is implemented

such that both mean and variance of worker ability should rise after the switch to piece rates. The

theory implies spectilcally that there should be no change in the number of low ability workers who

are willing to work with the f~m, but that piece rates would allow high ability workers to use their

talents more lucratively.   Thus, the top tail of the distribution should thicken.

          Underlying   ability is dfilcult to measure, but actual output can be observed.     Suppose that

workers     must try the job for awhile to discover their ability levels.     Workers who fmd the job

unsuitable leave. Thus, lootig    at the relation of ability to separation rates before and after the switch

to piece rates will provide evidence on the validity of propositions     2 and 3.

          A separation is defined as an observation such that the worker in question did not work during

the subsequent month.       Thus, SEPAR is a dummy equal to 1 in the last month during which the

worker was employed. Those workers who work through July, 1995 (the last month for which data

are available) have SEPAR=O for every month in which they worked.           A worker who was employed

say from January,       1994 through    February,    1995 would have SEPAR=O in every month of

employment, except for February, 1995, when SEPAR would equal 1.

           Table 4 reports the results of logits with SEPAR as the dependent variable.       First note that

the effect of PPPFLAG is positive.        Converted to probabilities, it implies that the move to PPP

increases turnover by about 7/10 of a percentage point per month, or about 20% of the turnover rate.

This is not surprising. A major change in the pay system may make some of the incumbents unhappy

enough to leave. Given the guarantee, it is more likely that the change in the pay structure signaled

tougher times ahead for low ability workers.        Alternatively, the f~m may have become less tolerant


                                                      24
of workers at the bottom end who constantly were paid more than the PPP calculation would imply.

Second, the coefficient on UAD is negative. More able workers are less likely to separate from the

ftrm, probably reflecting the f~m’s happiness with more productive workers.

        How does the PPP program sort workers? Does it induce the least able to stay and the most

able to go? The answer is contained in logit 2 of table 4. There, an interaction effect is included.

If the PPP plan induces the least able to leave and the most able to stay, then the coefficient on

(UAD)( PPPFLAG) should k negative. In all specflcations          tried, the coefficient on this interaction

was negative.

        This is precisely what theory predicts.    The most able were the least happy with the hourly

wage structure. A switch to piece rates keeps reduces the turnover rate of high productivity workers

relative to that of low productivity workers.   The effect of PPP on turnover varies substantially with

the worker’s     productivity   level.   At UAD=4.4,     which is about the 90th percentile of worker

productivity, an additional unit of UAD is associated with an incremental decline in the turnover      rate

from switching to PPP of about 1.4 percentage points, which is over one third of the monthly

turnover rate.

       The effect of differential changes in turnover rates, hiring policy and incentives can be

summarized in the following histograms. Figure 3 shows a histogram of productivity in January, 1994

when all workers were being paid hourly wages. Figure 4 shows [he histogram in June, 1995 when

all were on PPP. The ms   in the later histogram lies to the right of the earlier one. In January, 1994,

the modal worker produced between 2 and 3 units per day.           In June, 1995, the modal worker

produced between 3 and 4 units per day.

New Hires:

        The theory taken literally implies that the average ability of workers hired after the switch to

piece rates should be higher than the average ability of those hired before the switch. While ability

cannot be observed, output can. Average output is used as a proxy for ability. For each worker,       ~,


the worker specific average output under piece rates, is computed. The sample is split into those who

were hired into the piece rate regime and those who were hired before piece rates took effect. The

man level of post-piece rate output among those hired when hourly wages were in effect was 3.17.

The mean among those hired after the piece rate came into effect was only 3.00.

        The fact that average output is higher among those hired under the hourly wage regime is not

surprising. Earlier hires have higher levels of tenure. Given that the effect of tenure on productivityy

for piece rate workers is 36% per year (according to table 3), and given that the post-piece rate hires

have ordy 5% lower productivity than pre-piece rate hires, the tenure effect is likely to account for

more than the difference between groups,         suggesting   that the post-piece   rate hires are more

productive, tenure adjusted.

Profitability:

        Table 2 reported that the cost per unit was lower under piece rates than under hourly wages.

But it is possible to analyze the change in profits somewhat more systematically.      After all, moving

to piece rates would not be desirable from the fwms point of view if more than the increase in

productivity were eaten up by increased compensation        costs.

        In fact, the reverse was true by a sigtilcant    margin. A regression of the log of pay per day

on PPPFLAG was run, holding year and month constant.           This regression is identical to regression

1 of table 3, except that log of pay rather than log of output is the dependent variable. The coefficient

                                                    28
on PPPFLAG         is .066 with a standard error of .005.     Recall that the total effect on worker

productivity was .36 (from table 3). Thus, there is a 36% increase in productivity per worker, but

only a 6.5% increase in wage cost. This reflects two factors. First, not all of the gains were given

to the existing work force.       They were shared: As will be seen below, half went to the existing

workers and half went to the ti      Second, the group of workers who are on board when piece rates

are paid are more cost effective than the group of workers who were on board when hourly wages

were paid. In l~ge part, this reflects higher levels of productivity for the typical worker in the piece

rate regime, which reduces costs per worker. Low productivity, high hourly wage workers have been

replaced by higher productivity, primarily piece rate workers.

         This can be seen in more detail by holding person effects constant.      A regression was run,

with the log of pay per day as dependent variable, on PPPFLAG including person, year and month

durnrnies. The regression is identical to the previous one except that individual constant terms are

included.    It is also identical to regression 2 of table 3, except that log of pay rather than log of

output is the dependent variable. The coefficient on PPPFLAG is .096 with a standard error of .004.

Thus, pay went up for a given employee by 9.6% on average after PPP was instituted.          But table 3

shows that productivity for a given worker incre&ed by 20Y0, which means that incumbents captured

about half of the return to the increase in their own productivity.

         Did profits rise? This depends on the increase in productivity relative to the increase in labor

and other costs.    Given the numbers (36Y0 increase in productivity y, 6.690 increase in wages), it is

ufiely   that other variable costs of production (most importantly the glass and transportation    costs)

ate up the margin still given to the f~m. The piece rate plan seems to have been implemented in a




                                                   29
way that likely made both capital and labor better off. 15

        There is one cost that has been ignored throughout.                  Piecework requires measurement of

output. In Safelite’s case, the measurement comes about through a very sophisticated computerized

system. But the system involves people and machines that are costly. Indeed, in equilibrium, f~ms

that pay hourly wages or monthly salaries are probably those for whom measurement costs exceed

the benefits from switching to output based pay.

        In this case, the gains in productivity were very large. Further, the information systems were

initially put irt place for reasons other than monitoring              worker productivity,         having to do with

inventory control and reduced installation lags. The economies of scope in information technology,

coupled with the labor productivity gains, ue probably large enough to cover whatever additional

cost of monitoring was involved.           This is not always so. Whenever a fwm switches from one pay

system to another, it is almost certain that one system does not maximize profit. But Safelite has no

apparent desire to return to the previous pay system.

Sick Leave:

        Units-per-associate-per-day         are only one measure of productivity.                 Other measures are

available.   One that is of interest is paid sick time. To the extent that workers can earn more by

coming 12to work than by taking the default sick day compensation,                       PPP created incentives for

workers to spend more time on the job and less time taking paid sick leave. Indeed, the mean level

of paid sick hours fell by almost 60% after PPP was instituted.               Most of this effect took the form of




        ls~e firm’s earnings are up substantially since the switch to piece rates, but this could retlect other factors as
well.

sorting.     There was virtually no effect of PPP on sick hours, once person dummies were included.

Virtually all of the effect resulted from turnover.           Workers who were most likely to take sick leave

left and those who were least likely to take sick leave were hired. These effects, while sign~lcant,

are not particulwly important to the company because a small fraction of the workforce is eligible for

sick pay.

Quality:

           One defect of paying piece rates is that quality may suffer. 16In the Safelite case, most quality

problems show up rather quickly in the form of broken windshields.                  Since the guilty installer can be

easily identified, there is an efficient solution to the quality problem             The installer must reinstall the

windshield on his own time and must pay the company for the replacement glass before any paying

jobs are assigned to him. This induces the installer to take the appropriate                    amount of care when

installing the glass in the f~st place.

           Safelite uses another system that relies on peer pressure. 17 When a customer reports a defect,

the job is randomly assigned to a worker in the shop that was responsible for the problem.                            The

worker is not paid for doing the repair work. But workers know the identity of the initial installer.

If one installer causes his peers to engage in too many re-dos, his co-workers pressure him to improve

or resign.

Implications:

           The results imply that productivity effects associated with the switch from hourly wages to

piece rates Me quite large, The theory implies that a switch should bring about an increase in average



           “See bzear   (1986) and Baker (1992).

           “See Kandel and Lazear (1992) for a discussion of the effects of peer pressure and norms in an organization.

levels ofoutput andin itsvariance. These predictions are borne out. Thetheory          does notirnply that

profits must rise. Mwket equilibrium is characterized by fwms that choose a variety of compensation

methods.    Firms choose the compensation        scheme by comparing the costs and benefits of each

scheme. The benefit is a productivity gain. Costs may be associated with measurement difficulties,

undesirable risk transfers,   and quality declines.

        It is interesting that the productivity gains are so large for this particular firm. Of course, this

is only one data point and it is one where the case for piece rates seems especially strong.      Output is

easily measured    and quality problems are detected         and blame is assignable.     Managerial    and

professional jobs may not be as well suited to piecework.     The fact that the productivity gains are so

large in this case is worthy of attention. The results do not imply that all f~ms should switch to piece

rate pay.

Summary and Conclusion:

        The theory above reveals average output per worker and average worker ability should rise

when a f~m switches from hourly wages to piece rates.            The hum         level of ability does not

change, but more able workers, who shunned the hourly wage, are attracted by piece rates. As a

result of incentive effects, average output per worker rises. Thus, average ability and output, as well

as variance in ability and output, should rise when a f~m switches from hourly wages to piece rates.

        The effects of changing compensation          method were estimated using worker level monthly

output data from Safelite Autoglass Company. The theory is borne out almost to the letter. Moving

to a piece rate regime is wsociated with a 36% increase in productivity for the company as a whole.

Part of the gain reflects sorting, part reflects incentives, and some reflects the pattern in which the

scheme was implemented. For a given individual, switching to piece rates increased productivity by


                                                       32
about 2070.


        Tenure effects associated with productivity    are large. The average worker’s productivity

increased by 36% in one year after piece rate pay was adopted.

        Turnover rates rise after the change in compensation method, but the pattern of turnover is

in direct support of the theory. There is a general increase in turnover of all groups, except for the

most able. Piece rates appeal to the most able, but are less attractive to other groups of workers.

As a result, coupled with a wage guarantee, the result of the switch to piece rate pay is increased

heterogeneity,   both in output and ability.

        An analysis of paid sick leave reveals that piece rate pay reduced the amount of paid sick

leave, probably because piece rates increase the relative cost of taking sick leave.

        Workers captured some of the return Ii-em moving to piece rates. The average incumbent

worker’s wages rose by 9.6% as a result of the switch.     This accounts for about half of the gain in

productivity for the given worker. No data on the costs of implementing the program are available,

but is unlikely that in this instance the costs swamp the huge productivity     gains associated with

moving to piece rates.
