Managing Bank Liquidity Risk: How Deposit-Loan Synergies Vary with Market Conditions

                                            ABSTRACT

Liquidity risk in banking has been attributed to transactions deposits and their potential to spark runs
or panics. We show instead that transactions deposits help banks hedge liquidity risk from unused
loan commitments. Bank stock-return volatility increases with unused commitments, but the increase
is smaller for banks with high levels of transactions deposits. This deposit-lending risk management
synergy becomes more powerful during periods of tight liquidity, when nervous investors move
funds into their banks. Our results reverse the standard notion of liquidity risk at banks, where runs
from depositors had been seen as the cause of trouble.

I. Introduction

         Banks have traditionally provided liquidity on demand, both to borrowers with

open lines of credit and un-drawn loan commitments (we use these terms

interchangeably), and to depositors in the form of checking and other transactions

accounts. Both contracts allow customers to receive cash on short notice. In fact, the

combination of these two products in a single firm constitutes a reasonable working

definition of a ‘bank’. The liquidity insurance role of banks, however, exposes them to

the risk that they will have insufficient cash to meet random demands from their

depositors and borrowers. In this paper, we show that combining these two products

actually reduces risk and can thus help explain the traditional structure of banks.1

         There is a large theoretical literature that attempts to understand banks’ role in

liquidity production. This literature initially emphasized the risks associated with

demand deposits that expose banks to the possibility of a catastrophic run. Diamond and

Dybvig (1983) explain the structure of banks by arguing that by pooling their funds in an

intermediary, agents can insure against idiosyncratic liquidity shocks while still investing

most of their wealth in high-return but illiquid projects. This structure, however, leads to

the potential for a self-fulfilling bank run and sets up a policy rationale for deposit

insurance. More recent theoretical and empirical studies have focused on liquidity risk




1
  Previous research identifies several other reasons why banks combine deposits and loans. For example,
Fama (1985) suggests that information stemming from the business checking account could give banks an
advantage in lending over other financial intermediaries; for recent empirical evidence, see Mester,
Nakamura, and Renault (2002). Berlin and Mester (1999) argue that banks’ access to inelastically supplied
funds (core deposits) allows them to offer borrowers insurance against credit shocks. Other studies suggest
that because bank loans are illiquid, and thus make “bad” collateral against which to borrow, the optimal
capital structure is one characterized by very liquid (or short-term) liabilities that subject the bank to the
possibility of a run (e.g., Calomiris and Kahn (1991), Flannery (1994), and Diamond and Rajan (2001)).
For a summary of empirical evidence, see Strahan (2005).

coming from the asset side of the bank’s balance sheet.2 Banks that make commitments

to lend are exposed to the risk of unexpected liquidity demands from their borrowers.

        This paper presents a systematic empirical analysis of liquidity risk stemming

from both sides of bank balance sheets. We study how deposit taking and commitment

lending interact. We find that asset-side and liability-side liquidity risks are offsetting

rather than reinforcing, meaning that combining deposits and commitment lending

provide a liquidity-risk hedge for banks.

        Our point of departure is the model presented by Kashyap, Rajan and Stein

(2002), hereafter KRS, who explain why banks tend to combine transactions deposits

with loan commitments based on a risk-management motivation: as long as the demand

for liquidity from depositors through the checking account is not highly correlated with

liquidity demands from borrowers, an intermediary will be able to reduce its need to hold

cash by serving both customers. Thus, their model yields a diversification synergy

between demand deposits (or transactions deposits more generally) and loan

commitments. As evidence, KRS report a robust correlation across banks between

unused loan commitments and transactions deposits. The correlation is robust to

variations in the definition of loan commitments, to bank size, and is also consistent

across time. However, KRS do not test the key idea in their model – the idea that by

exposing themselves to asset-side and liability-side liquidity risks simultaneously, banks

can actually enjoy a diversification, or risk reducing, synergy.

        In this paper, we test the basic premise of the KRS model – that liquidity risks

2
  For example, Berger and Bouwman (2005) document the importance of banks in liquidity production and
show that this role has grown sharply over time. There is also a growing literature showing the liquidity-
risk management or liquidity shocks to banks affect loan supply. See Paravisini (2004), Kwaja and Mian
(2005), Loutskina (2005) and Loutskina and Strahan (2006).



                                                    2
stemming from the two fundamental businesses of banking yield a diversification benefit.

The results suggest that bank risk, measured by stock return volatility, increases with

unused loan commitments, reflecting asset-side liquidity risk exposure. This increase,

however, is mitigated by transactions deposits. In fact, risk does not increase with loan

commitments for banks with transactions deposits in the top third of the distribution.

           Table 1 illustrates our key finding in a simple and intuitive way. The table reports

our measure of risk (average stock-return volatility, equal to the annualized return

standard deviation) for large, publicly traded banks, along with several bank

characteristics, including a liquidity ratio (cash + securities to assets), total assets, Fed

Funds purchased to assets, and the ratio of equity to assets.3 We divide the data into nine

cells, based on the level of loan commitments (unused commitments divided by unused

commitments plus loans) and the level of transactions deposits (relative to total deposits).

Each cell reports the simple average for all observations in that part of the distribution.

Looking across rows, stock-return volatility (our measure of risk) clearly increases with

loan commitments for banks with low and moderate levels of transactions deposits

(columns 1 and 2). But, risk does not increase for banks with high levels of transactions

deposits (column 3). In other words, loan commitments do not seem to expose banks

with high levels of transactions deposits to much risk.

           Table 1 also shows that banks with high levels of unused commitments tend to be

larger than average. Moreover, banks that operate without the benefit of high levels of

transactions deposits hold more cash than other banks (last row of column 1). Thus, the

high balance sheet liquidity held by these banks does not fully offset the risk from

liquidity exposure associated with high levels of unused commitments. Banks with
3
    We describe our sample and data in detail below.


                                                       3
unused commitments thus can conserve on holding cash by funding themselves with

transactions deposits.4

         In the empirical analysis below, we show that this result holds up in a regression

context, even after controlling for bank size (which is correlated with unused

commitments), as well as measures of market and credit risk exposure. The result is

robust to alternative measures of stock-return volatility, to statistical modeling

approaches, as well as to variations in the set of control variables included in the model.

         We then extend the benchmark results by testing how the deposit-lending

diversification synergy varies with market conditions. The hedging benefits of

combining loan commitments and transactions deposits are strongest when market-wide

liquidity supply is low, which we proxy with the Commercial Paper–Treasury Bill spread

(wide spreads indicate low liquidity). For banks with the highest levels of transactions

deposits, risk actually decreases with the level of unused commitments when spreads are

high. The deposit-lending hedge is most powerful when the short-term credit markets

become expensive because banks face increased take-down demands from borrowers

constrained by tight market conditions at the same time that they experience funding

inflows into their transactions deposits (Gatev and Strahan, 2006). These inflows and

outflows of liquidity offset, thus strengthening the risk-management synergy. Our results

thus show that transactions deposits play a critically important role in allowing banks to

manage their liquidity risk, especially during periods of market pullbacks. The findings



4
  We do not explicitly model the tradeoffs associated with banks’ varying their levels of balance sheet
liquidity (cash and securities) to manage risks from unused commitments or deposits. Banks choose these
levels jointly, along with other capital structure policies such as leverage and debt maturity. A full analysis
of the substitutability across these financial policies would require a set of identifying instruments. Instead,
we focus on the co-variation between these endogenous financial variables and our outcome measure, the
bank’s stock-return volatility.

strengthen the KRS theoretical argument, and they help explain the robust positive

correlation across banks between transaction deposits and loan commitments, both over

time and across a wide range of economies.

         The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section provide a brief

summary of some previous research. In Section III, we explain the sample design and

our empirical strategy, and the results are presented in Section IV. Section V provides

some concluding remarks.



II. Background and previous research

         The growth of the commercial paper market and subsequently of the junk bond

market in the 1980s and 1990s suggests that the role of banks in the financing of large

businesses has been diminished (Mishkin and Strahan, 1998). However, this noted

evolution away from banks and toward the securities markets has not rendered banks

irrelevant (see Boyd and Gertler, 1994). While banks do provide less funding than

before, they remain important to large firms as providers of backup liquidity support to

the commercial paper market financing. Banks act as the “liquidity provider of last

resort” by promising to offer cash on demand through commercial paper backup lines of

credit.5 Banks also continue to provide liquidity to customers through their role as

issuers of transactions deposits.

         Why do banks provide liquidity to both sets of customers? To the extent that

liquidity demands are independent across both businesses and depositors, a bank can use

scale-related diversification to mitigate its need to hold cash to meet unexpected liquidity

5
 Banks also continue to bear significant credit risk through off-balance sheet guarantees such as standby letters
of credit.



                                                        5
demands from its depositors and borrowers.6 Kashyap, Rajan and Stein (2002) present a

model based on this notion, in which a risk-management motive explains the combination

of transactions deposits and loan commitments. They argue that as long as the demand

for liquidity from depositors through the checking account is not highly correlated with

liquidity demands from borrowers, an intermediary will be able to reduce its need to hold

cash by serving both customers. Thus, their model yields a diversification synergy

between transactions deposits and unused loan commitments.

         This synergy helps explain the basic structure of banks. As evidence, KRS show

that banks offering more transaction deposits tend also to make more loan commitments.

In Gatev and Strahan (2006), we suggest a stronger hypothesis, supported by our findings

that the correlation is not only low but is in fact negative. Transactions deposits can be

viewed as a natural hedge because flows into these accounts offset the systematic

liquidity risk exposure stemming from issuing loan commitments and lines of credit.

         Our previous work extends KRS by considering the possibility that liquidity

production could expose banks to systematic liquidity risk. A bank with many open

credit lines, for example, may face a problem if, rather than facing just idiosyncratic

demands for cash, it sometimes faces increased demand for liquidity by many borrowers

simultaneously. For example, during the first week of October 1998, following the

coordinated restructuring of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM),

spreads between safe Treasury securities and risky commercial paper rose dramatically.

Many large firms were consequently unable to roll over their commercial paper as it

came due, leading to a sharp reduction in the amount of commercial paper outstanding


6
 In a world with taxes, financial distress, or agency costs, holding cash or other liquid assets is costly for
banks and other firms (e.g. Myers and Rajan, 1998).


                                                       6
and a corresponding increase in take-downs on pre-existing lines of credit (Saidenberg

and Strahan, 1999). As a result of this market pullback, banks faced a systematic spike in

demand for cash as many of their largest customers drew funds from pre-existing backup

lines of credit. Gatev and Strahan (2006) show, however, that funding supply to banks

increases as the availability of market liquidity declines. Thus, banks were able to

weather the 1998 storm because deposit funding flowed in just as it was needed by

borrowers.

        Why do banks, as opposed to other financial intermediaries, enjoy funding

inflows when market liquidity dries up? First, the banking system has some explicit

guarantees of its liabilities (government-backed deposit insurance up to $100,000).7

Second, banks have access to emergency liquidity support from the central bank. Third,

historical precedent suggests that large banks, such as Continental Illinois in the early

1980s and Citicorp in the early 1990s, may be supported if they face financial distress

(O’Hara and Shaw, 1990). Thus, funding inflows occur during market pullback in part

because banks are rationally viewed as explicitly or implicitly insured by governments.

Consistent with this notion, Pennacchi (2006) finds that during the years before the

introduction of federal deposit insurance, bank funding supply did not increase when

spreads tightened.

        In a case study, Gatev, Schuermann and Strahan (2005) focus on the behavior of

deposit flows across banks during the 1998 crisis, which began with the Russian

government bond default in the middle of August. During the three-months leading up to


7
 Deposit insurance limits have recently been expanded for the first time sine 1980. In addition, some small
banks have begun to avoid binding limits on deposit insurance by splitting very large deposits across
multiple institutions. For a broad discussion for deposit insurance and policy ramifications, see Kroszner
and Strahan (2005).


                                                    7
the crisis, bank stock prices where buffeted by news of the Russian crisis, followed by the

demise of the hedge fund LTCM in late September, and finally by the drying up of the

commercial paper market in the first week of October.8 Chava and Purnanadam (2005)

provide evidence that the CP market ceased to function at the beginning of October by

comparing abnormal returns for firms with and without access to this market. They show

first that stock prices of CP issuers fell much less than other firms when bank financial

condition deteriorated during September of 1998 (while markets continued to function).

During the first two weeks of October, however, the stock prices of all firms, regardless

of their ability to access the CP market, fell equally. Thus, all firms became bank

dependent – even CP issuers - during these weeks because CP markets ceased to function

and even large corporations relied on banks for liquidity.

        Figure 1 shows the aggregate effects of the 1998 crisis on stock-return volatility.

We plot bank stock volatility and volatility of the S&P 500, measured as the conditional

volatility from an EGARCH (1,1) model. The figure highlights the difference between

bank risk exposures in different business conditions. During the crisis, bank stock

volatility was higher than overall general market volatility, while it was lower in the

“normal” pre-crisis period.

        To understand how banks weathered this liquidity storm, in Gatev, Schuermann

and Strahan (2005) we explore the cross-sectional patterns in deposit flows during the

1998 liquidity crisis. We found first that investors moved funds from markets into banks;

second, that banks with higher levels of transactions deposits before the crisis had the

largest flows of new money during the crisis; and third, that all of the flows of new

                                                  8
money were concentrated in bank demand deposits. So, banks structured to bear

increased demands for liquidity from borrowers (i.e. banks with transactions deposits)

could meet those demands easily (because money flowed into those accounts). Thus,

government safety nets can explain why banks generally receive funding during crises,

but the evidence from Gatev et al. as well as Kashyap et al. suggests that the structure of

banks matters too.

         Before the introduction of government safety nets, transactions deposits could

sometimes expose banks to liquidity risk when consumers together removed deposits,

either to increase consumption or because they had lost confidence in the banking system.

This bank-run problem has traditionally been viewed as the primary source of liquidity

risk and creates a public policy rationale for FDIC insurance as well as reserve

requirements for demand deposits (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983). In crisis, investors now

run to banks, not away from them (at least they do in the U.S.). And, banks funded with

transactions accounts receive the inflow. Thus, rather than open banks to liquidity risk,

transactions deposits today help banks hedge that risk, which now stems more from the

lending side. We now turn to our direct tests of this idea.



III. Empirical Methods

Sample

         We start by identifying the 100 largest publicly traded domestic banks (based on

market capitalization) at the beginning of each year from 1990 to 2002.9 We focus on

large banks for several reasons. First, large-bank stocks trade frequently, so daily stock

9
 We begin in 1990 because that is the first year when unused retail loan commitments are available which
we shall control for as a robustness check. Prior to 1990 only total commitments are reported.



                                                    9
returns are available and reliable. For smaller banks, lack of active trading every day

poses problems in estimating the conditional volatility model (see below). Second, large

banks hold the vast majority of the banking system’s assets. For example, about 60

percent of bank assets were held by the 100 largest banks during our sample. Third, large

banks are more actively engaged in commitment lending than small banks.

         After identifying the top 100, we drop all banks that engaged in a merger or

acquisition (M&A) during the year of the deal itself (but not in other years). For

example, fifteen of the large banks were involved in M&A in 1990, leaving 85 in our

sample.10 Next, we construct the weekly conditional volatility for stock returns for these

banks (details below). For our purpose, a week begins and ends on Wednesday, as this is

the weekday with the fewest public holidays which might close the markets. We repeat

this sampling procedure for every year between 1990 and 2002. Note that it is important

to drop both acquirers and targets around M&A announcements because speculation

about such deals generates a large amount of stock price volatility having nothing to do

with the basic risks banks face (market, credit, liquidity, etc.). So, for example, we drop

both JP Morgan and Chase during the year of their merger, but these two banks are

included as two separate banks in the years prior to the merger, and as a single bank in

the year after the merger. As a result, the maximum number of banks in any year is 98

(2002), and the minimum is 68 (1996). The sample-generating procedure leaves us with

170 banks, and almost 50,000 bank-week observations overall.




10
  Traded equity reflects the profits and risk of the entire bank holding company, so our use of the term
bank refers to the whole holding company. In collecting characteristics, we use data for the lead bank
within the holding company.


                                                     10
Conditional Mean Volatility

           We construct our conditional stock-return volatilities by fitting daily returns to a

GARCH (1,1) model for each bank-year, as follows. Let ri,t+1 be the return for bank i

from t to t+1. Then bank returns may be characterized by

                          ri ,t +1 = μi ,t +1 + ε i ,t +1
                                                                                                           (1)
                          σ i2,t +1 = ω + αε i2,t + βσ i2,t , ω , α , β > 0,

where μi,t+1 is a non-zero, possibly time-varying drift. For estimation, the innovation εi,t+1

is assumed to be conditionally normally distributed with time-varying GARCH(1,1)

volatility as specified in the second equation of (1).

           Based on the coefficients estimated in the GARCH model, we construct daily

conditional volatility, and then we aggregate up the daily volatilities to weekly

frequency.11 Table 1 reports the simple average level of these conditional volatilities,

normalized to represent the annualized standard deviation of the stock return. We split

the data into nine cells, based on the joint distribution of the level of the ratio of

transactions deposits to total deposits and the level of unused loan commitments to total

commitments plus total loans (our measure of asset-side liquidity exposure). This

admittedly simple table illustrates the main hedging idea of our research: banks with high

levels of transactions deposits have similar levels of risk regardless of their loan-liquidity

exposure (column 3). In contrast, risk increases with loan liquidity risk (unused loan

commitments) for banks at the low end of the transactions deposits distributions (column

1). Increasing unused loan commitments comes with an increase in risk of nearly 30



11
     To aggregate volatilities from daily to lower frequencies, say weekly, we take the average over that week
and scale by 5 , allowing for the possibility of missing days due to, for instance, holidays.



                                                            11
percent for these banks (from 0.28 to 0.36). The same patterns show up in the medians

within each cell (not reported). The deposit base therefore seems to act as a natural

hedge against liquidity exposure from loan commitments.12

Regression Specification

         To demonstrate these results more systematically, we estimate an empirical model

of the conditional volatility as a function of bank liquidity exposure, deposits, and other

market-level and bank-level characteristics, as follows:



         Log(σit) = β0 + β1LoanCommitmentsi,t-1 + β2DepositBasei,t-1 +

                      + β3(LoanCommitmentsi,t-1 *DepositBasei,t-1) +                                  (2)

                      + Bank-Level and Market-Level Control Variables + ui,t,



where σit is the conditional stock-return volatility for bank i at time t from the first-stage

GARCH (1,1) model in equation (1); LoanCommitmentsi,t-1 is the ratio of unused loan

commitments to commitments plus loans (measured in the previous quarter); and,

DepositBasei,t-1 is the ratio of transactions deposits to total deposits (again, from the prior

quarter). If deposits help banks hedge asset-side liquidity risk, as suggested by Table 1,

then β3 < 0.13




12
   Notice that the hedge seems to go both ways. That is, for banks with low levels of loan commitments
(first row), higher transactions deposits come with higher risk (from 0.28 to 0.32). On the other hand, for
banks with high levels of commitments, higher transactions deposits come with lower risk (from 0.36 to
031).
13
  We have also estimated regressions like (1) using the level of volatility as well as the square of volatility
(variance). These results are similar in terms of statistical and economic significance to those reported
here.


                                                      12
Variable Definitions and Data Sources

        As time-varying controls in the regression, we include the contemporaneous stock

return volatility for the S&P 500 as a whole, estimated with a GARCH (1,1) model in the

same fashion as the bank specific volatilities; the three-month T-bill rate; and the spread

between the high-grade three-month commercial paper rate and the three-month T-bill

rate. To be consistent with the conditional volatilities, the interest rate data are taken for

the Wednesday of a given week.

        For bank-level controls, we include the following: the log of assets (size control),

the ratio of cash plus securities to total assets (liquid asset measure), the ratio of capital to

assets (capital adequacy measure), and the ratio of Fed Funds purchased to assets (a

measure of access to the Fed Funds market, a liquidity pool). Controlling for size is

particularly important given its correlation with loan commitments (recall Table 1). We

also consider a second loan commitment variable as a robustness test that removes retail

commitments (e.g. credit card lines) from both the numerator and the denominator of

LoanCommitmentsi,t-1. Unused retail commitments may be less likely to expose banks to

risk relative to business-loan commitments, where take-down demand is both less

predictable and more likely to have a systematic component such as the one observed in

the fall of 1998.

        Data on unused commitments, transactions deposits, as well as the other bank

characteristics, come from the most recent quarter of the Reports of Income and

Condition (‘call reports’) prior to the time at which we measure the stock return

variability. So for example, all weeks in the second quarter of 1990 are matched to call

report data for first quarter of 1990. Stock return data come from the Center for




                                               13
Research in Securities Prices (CRSP), inclusive of dividend payments and adjusted to

account for stock splits. Data on interest rates are available daily from the Federal

Reserve Board of Governors. Note that since the regulatory data is available only at

quarterly intervals, the bank characteristics remain unchanged for all weeks within a

given quarter.

Summary Statistics

       Table 2 reports the summary statistics for all of the variables reported in the

regressions. Bank-stock volatility averages about 30 percent per year, well above the 16

percent for the S&P 500 index. We would expect, of course, index volatility to be lower

due to portfolio effects. In our sample, the mean loan commitment ratio is about 0.32 and

the mean level of transactions deposits to total deposits equals about 0.26. As in KRS,

banks with high levels of loan commitment also tend to focus on transactions deposits.

For instance, 46 percent of the observations in Table 1 line up on the diagonal (relative to

33 percent if the data were evenly distributed). For the control variables, we use ratios

that lie between zero and one, interest rates in percent, or, in the case of assets, we have

logged the variable. Hence, there is no concern about outliers driving the results.



IV. Results

Main Findings

       Table 3 reports the benchmark set of findings. We report the regressions from

equation (2) above using all of our data. The table reports four specifications, two based

on the total commitments ratio, and two that exclude retail commitments. For each of

these, we report a simple model with just log of assets as a bank control, and a more




                                             14
complex model that adds the liquid assets ratio (cash + securities), the ratio of Fed Funds

purchased to assets, and the capital-asset ratio. Note that we have a very large sample

(almost 50,000 bank-week observations), but we cluster the data by bank to avoid

assuming independence over time for each bank. This clustering raises the standard

errors by a factor of about 10 relative to the OLS standard errors.

       The results in Table 3 support the idea that loan commitment risk (liquidity risk)

can be hedged with transactions deposits. The coefficient on the interaction term (β3) is

negative and highly statistically significant, ranging from -1.6 to -1.7 across the four

specifications. For a bank with transactions deposits at the 10th percentile of its

distribution (0.12), the coefficients suggest that loan commitments expose banks to risk.

For such a bank, a one standard deviation increase in the loan commitment ratio would

come with an increase in stock-return volatility of about 2.5 percentage points (relative to

a sample standard deviation of about 13 percentage points). For a bank with transaction

deposits at the 90th percentile (0.38), however, the same increase in loan commitments

comes with an increase in stock-return volatility of just 0.6 percentage points.

       Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between stock-return volatility and unused

loan commitments, comparing high- and low-transactions deposit banks. The figure plots

the predicted volatility based on the regressions coefficients in Table 3 (column 2) for

banks at the 10th and 90th percentiles of the transactions deposit distribution. As the

figure shows clearly, risk increases with liquidity exposure from unused loan

commitments for banks without high levels of transactions deposits. In contrast, risk

does not vary with loan commitments for banks with high transactions deposits.




                                             15
Robustness Tests

       Tables 4-6 report three robustness tests. First, we replaced the GARCH (1,1)

estimate of conditional stock-return volatility with realized volatility (the weekly average

of squared returns). Table 5 focuses on the statistical assumptions, and Table 6 focuses

on the potential for omitted variables bias. Table 4 shows that the precise modeling

technique for estimating volatility has almost no impact on any of the coefficients on the

bank variables. The variable that accounts for market conditions (the paper-bill spread),

however, more than doubles and becomes much more statistically powerful. This makes

sense because the realized volatilities will adjust immediately to changing market

conditions, while the GARCH estimates will only do so gradually. The goodness of fit of

the model also declines sharply, presumably because, in contrast to the GARCH

estimates, again because the realized volatilities are not smoothed over time.

       In columns 1 and 2 of Table 5, we report the ‘between’ estimator – that is, the

regressions are run using bank-level time-series averages. Thus, coefficients are driven

only by cross-sectional variation. We find that the hedging coefficient remains similar to

the results in Table 3 in terms of magnitudes. Levels of statistical significance fall

slightly because the between estimator has just 170 separate banks. We report the

‘within’ estimator in columns 3 and 4. The within estimator, also sometimes called the

fixed effects estimator, allows each bank to have its own intercept in the regressions.

Because the bank-level intercept strips out all cross-sectional variation before estimating

the slope coefficients, the results are driven solely by within-bank variation over time.

Again, we continue to find strong evidence of the transaction deposit-loan commitment

diversification synergy. The results in Table 5 suggest that the hedging effects of




                                             16
combining loan commitments with transactions deposits are present with approximately

equal magnitude in both the cross-sectional and time-series dimensions.

         Next, we consider the possibility that the observed bank equity risk is driven by

risks other than liquidity (Table 6). For example, credit and market risk exposures are

two of the primary risks faced by banks (and, not coincidentally, these are the risks that

the Basel Capital Accord focuses on). We want to rule out the possibility that our results

reflect credit or market risk exposure rather than liquidity risk exposure. To test this idea,

we include the ratio of commercial and industrial loans to assets and commercial real

estate loans to assets as ex-ante proxies for bank credit risk exposure. In general,

business loans are the part of the bank loan portfolio with the most credit risk (Demsetz

and Strahan, 1997; Stiroh, 2005).14 We also include the ratio of non-performing loans to

assets as a measure of ex-post risk, and, in some specifications, we also add the ratio of

net charge offs to assets, and the ratio of loan loss provisions to assets.15 To control for

cross-bank variation in market risk exposure, we include the ratio of trading account

assets to total assets.

         The results suggest that while our measures for both credit and market risk are

correlated with stock return volatility in the expected ways, the effects of the liquidity-

risk-offsetting influence of deposits is robust to the inclusion of these other risks

(columns 1 and 2). The coefficients on C&I loans and trading account assets enter with

positive signs (significant in two of the four models). Even more striking, both non-

performing loans and loan loss provisions have substantial power to explain stock-return

14
  Loan losses tend to be high for credit card loans, but these losses are much more predictable than losses
associated with business lending.
15
  Non-performing loans are defined as loans more than 30 days past due plus loans no longer accruing
interest but not yet charged off the balance sheet.


                                                     17
volatility, but the inclusion of these variables has little impact on the coefficients of

interest. Most important, the coefficient on the interaction term remains negative and

significant, and more generally the results are similar to those reported before.

        The last two columns of Table 5 repeat these regressions, but now we replace the

time-varying control variables (S&P 500 volatility, the level of interest rates, and the

spread) with a full set of time indicator variables (i.e. a separate intercept for each week).

The market-level variables are not identified in this model because the time effects sweep

out all common shocks to bank-stock volatility. The advantage of this approach is that

time effects remove any missing common factors that may move bank-stock volatility

around, such as changes in regulations, macroeconomic shocks, changes in monetary

policy, and so on.16 The effects of interest, again, remain robust in these specifications.17

Varying Market Conditions

        Table 7 sharpens our benchmark results, and ties the findings more closely to

liquidity risk. We compare our model coefficients from ‘normal’ market conditions with

the coefficients estimated when market liquidity becomes scarce. During normal

conditions, the diversification synergy of combining transactions deposits and loan

commitments comes from reducing the effects of idiosyncratic liquidity demands (as in

KRS). Following our earlier work, we use the spread between commercial paper rates

and T-bill rates as an indicator for the supply of market liquidity. As we show in Gatev

and Strahan (2006), when market liquidity becomes scarce, borrowers draw funds from



16
  For example, passage of the Financial Modernization Act in 1999 may have increase bank stock return
volatility temporarily by increasing speculation about merger activity among financial companies.
17
  We have also estimated our model for above and below median sized banks. For both samples we find
similar results for the coefficients on the loan commitments and transactions deposit variables and their
interaction, both in terms of magnitudes and levels of significance.


                                                    18
pre-existing bank loan commitments at the same time that funding flows into bank

transaction deposit accounts (Gatev, Schuermann and Strahan, 2005). Since liquidity

demands become negatively correlated when spreads rise, we would expect the hedging

term to become much larger then.

        To test this idea, we separate the data into two regimes, one when the paper-bill

spread is above 75 basis points (the 95th percentile of its distribution) and the other when

the spread is below 75 basis points (Table 7). By comparison, recall from Table 2 that

the average CP spread over the sample period is about 40 basis points. During the 1998

crisis, the spread rose above 100 basis points.

        The results indicate that transactions deposits do in fact act as a more powerful

hedge when CP rates are unusually high (Table 7, columns 1 and 2). When the

commercial paper spread is above 75 basis points, there is a much stronger positive link

from loan commitments to risk (the linear coefficient on loan commitments rises from

0.76 to 1.0), and also a greater hedge associated with transactions deposit (the interaction

effect nearly triples, from -1.3 to -3.2).18 The increase in magnitude in the hedging term

is significant at the two percent level (column 3). We also find a significant increase in

the coefficient on bank size. During normal market conditions, we find no correlation

between size and volatility, whereas larger banks have higher stock-return volatility than

smaller banks when CP spreads are wide.

        To understand the economic impact, these coefficients suggest that increased loan

commitments come with higher risk at banks with low levels of transactions deposits, but

lower risk for banks with high levels of transactions deposits. For example, for banks

18
  We have also estimated the model during periods of high and low spreads using realized volatility as the
dependent variable. In this case, the increase in the magnitude of the hedging term is somewhat larger than
the increase reported in Table 7.


                                                    19
with transactions deposit ratio of 0.38 – at the 90th percentile of the distribution – an

increase in loan commitments lowers stock-return volatility by 1.7 percentage points.

This contrast is made plain in Figure 3, where we plot the relationship between stock-

return volatility and loan commitments during periods of high CP spreads, again

comparing banks at the 10th and 90th percentiles of the transactions deposit distribution.19

         Table 8 reports a similar test for the effects of varying market conditions. In these

models, rather than split the sample into normal and high-spread periods, we simply add

an interaction between the level of the paper-bill spread and the transactions deposit and

loan commitment variables. Here, we again find that the hedging of the two liquidity

variables is stronger during periods of tight markets (wide spreads). Together, the results

of Tables 7 and 8 are consistent with the interpretation of our findings as related to

liquidity risk by banks because the demands to provide liquidity to borrowers are greatest

when market spreads widen. The greater hedging effects are consistent with our earlier

finding that funding supply to banks increases during period of high spreads, thus

offsetting the increase in liquidity demands from borrowers during those periods.



V. Conclusion

         Transactions deposits reduce liquidity-risk exposure stemming from bank lending.

Banks with high levels of transactions deposits do not face high risk even if they are

exposed on the asset side to un-drawn loan commitments. In contrast, banks exposed to

loan-liquidity risk without high levels of transactions deposits do have high risk. The


19
  We have also separated our transaction deposit variable into demand deposits and other transactions
deposits. We find no statistically significant difference across the two – that is, both kinds of transactions
accounts seem to work to help hedge asset-side liquidity risk. Thus, we only report the results here for the
total ratio of transactions deposits to total deposits.


                                                      20
deposit-lending hedge becomes especially powerful during periods of tight markets,

when funds move out of the securities markets and into banks. The results are

particularly striking to us because they reverse the standard notion of liquidity risk at

banks, where runs from depositors had been seen as the cause of trouble (e.g. Diamond

and Dybvig, 1983). Today, because safety nets protect banks, they are viewed as safe

havens for funds. Investors seem to move money into deposits during periods of market

turmoil. These funding inflows allowing banks to supply credit when markets can’t or

won’t.
