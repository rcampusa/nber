The Cross-Section of Currency Risk Premia and US Consumption Growth Risk

                                            ABSTRACT

Aggregate consumption growth risk explains why low interest rate currencies do not appreciate as

much as the interest rate differential and why high interest rate currencies do not depreciate as much

as the interest rate differential. We sort foreign T-bills into portfolios based on the nominal interest

rate differential with the US, and we test the Euler equation of a US investor who invests in these

currency portfolios. US investors earn negative excess returns on low interest rate currency portfolios

and positive excess returns on high interest rates currency portfolios. We find that low interest rate

currencies provide US investors with a hedge against US aggregate consumption growth risk,

because these currencies appreciate on average when US consumption growth is low, while high

interest rate currencies depreciate when US consumption growth is low. As a result, the risk premia

predicted by the Consumption-CAPM match the average excess returns on these currency portfolios.

      When the foreign interest rate is higher than the US interest rate, risk-neutral and
rational US investors should expect the foreign currency to depreciate against the dollar
by the difference between the two interest rates. This way, borrowing at home and
lending abroad or vice-versa produces a zero return in excess of the US short-term
interest rate. This is known as the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition, and
it is violated in the data, except in the case of very high inflation currencies. In the
data, higher foreign interest rates almost always predict higher excess returns for a US
investor in foreign currency markets.

      We show that these excess returns compensate the US investor for taking on more
US consumption growth risk. High foreign interest rate currencies on average depreci-
ate against the dollar when US consumption growth is low, while low foreign interest
rate currencies do not. The textbook logic we use for any other asset can be applied
to exchange rates, and it works. If an asset offers low returns when the investor’s con-
sumption growth is low, it is risky, and the investor wants to be compensated through
a positive excess return.

      To uncover the link between exchange rates and consumption growth, we build eight
portfolios of foreign currencies excess returns on the basis of the foreign interest rates,
because investors know these predict excess returns. Portfolios are re-balanced every
period, so the first portfolio always contains the lowest interest rate currencies and
the last portfolio always contains the highest interest rate currencies. This is the key
innovation in our paper.

      Over the last three decades, in empirical asset pricing, the focus has shifted from
explaining individual stock returns to explaining the returns on portfolios of stocks,
sorted on variables that we know predict returns (e.g. size and book-to-market).1 This
procedure eliminates the diversifiable, stock-specific component of returns that is not
of interest, thus producing much sharper estimates of the risk-return trade-off in equity
markets. Similarly, for currencies, by sorting these into portfolios, we abstract from the
currency-specific component of exchange rate changes that is not related to changes in
the interest rate. This isolates the source of variation in excess returns that interests

us, and it creates a large average spread of up to five hundred basis points between low
and high interest rate portfolios. This spread is an order of magnitude larger than the
average spread for any two given countries. As one would expect from the empirical
literature on UIP, US investors earn on average negative excess returns on low interest
rate currencies of minus 2.3 percent and large, positive excess returns on high interest
rate currencies of up to 3 percent. The relation is almost monotonic, as shown in figure 1.
These returns are large even when measured per unit of risk. The Sharpe ratio (defined
as the ratio of the average excess return to its standard deviation) on the high interest
rate portfolio is close to 40 percent, only slightly lower than the Sharpe ratio on US
equity, while the same ratio is minus 40 percent for the lowest interest rate portfolio. In
addition, these portfolios keep the number of covariances that must be estimated low,
while allowing us to continuously expand the number of countries studied as financial
markets open up to international investors. This enables us to include data from the
largest possible set of countries.

   To show that the excess returns on these portfolios are due to currency risk, we start
from the US investor’s Euler equation and use consumption-based pricing factors. We
test the model on annual data for the periods 1953-2002 and 1971-2002.

   Consumption-based models explains up to eighty percent of the variation in currency
excess returns across these eight currency portfolios. Are the parameter estimates rea-
sonable? Our results are not consistent with what most economists view as plausible
values of risk aversion, but they are consistent with the evidence from other assets.
The estimated coefficient of risk aversion is around 100, and the estimated price of US
consumption growth risk is about 2 percent per annum for nondurables and 4.5 per-
cent for durables. Consumption-based models can explain the risk premia in currency
markets only if we are willing to entertain high levels of risk aversion, as is the case in
other asset markets. In fact, currency risk seems to be priced much like equity risk. If
we estimate the model on US domestic bond portfolios (sorted by maturity) and stock
portfolios (sorted by book-to-market and size) in addition to the currency portfolios,
the risk aversion estimate does not change. Our currency portfolios really allow for
an ‘out-of-sample’ test of consumption-based models, because the low interest rate cur-

This figure presents means, standard deviations (in percentages) and Sharpe ratios of real excess returns on 8 annually
re-balanced currency portfolios for a US investor. The data are annual and the sample is 1953-2002. These portfolios
were constructed by sorting currencies into eight groups at time t based on the nominal interest rate differential with the
home country at the end of period t − 1. Portfolio 1 contains currencies with the lowest interest rates. Portfolio 8 contains
currencies with the highest interest rates.



rency portfolios have negative average excess returns, unlike most of the test assets in
the empirical asset pricing literature, and the returns on the currency portfolios are not
strongly correlated with bond and stock returns.

    Consumption-based models can explain the cross-section of currency excess returns if
and only if high interest rate currencies typically depreciate when real US consumption
growth is low, while low interest rate currencies appreciate. This is exactly the pattern
we find in the data. We can restate this result in standard finance language using the
consumption growth beta of a currency. The consumption growth beta of a currency
measures the sensitivity of the exchange rate to changes in US consumption growth.
These betas are small for low interest rate currencies and large for high interest rate
currencies. In addition, for the low interest rate portfolios, the betas turn negative when
the interest rate gap with the US is large. All our results build on this finding.


                                                                    4
        Section I outlines our empirical framework and defines the foreign currency excess
returns and the potential pricing factors. Section II tests consumption-based models on
the unconditional moments of our foreign currency portfolio returns. Section III links
our results to properties of exchange rate betas. Section IV checks the robustness of our
estimates in various ways. Finally, section V concludes with a review of the relevant
literature. Data on currency returns and the composition of the currency portfolios are
available on the authors’ web sites.2



I        Foreign Currency Excess Returns

This section first defines the excess returns on foreign T-bill investments and details
the construction and characteristics of the currency portfolios. We then turn to the US
investor’s Euler equation and we explain how consumption risk can explain the average
excess returns on these currency portfolios.


A         Why Build Portfolios of Currencies?

We focus on a US investor who invests in foreign T-bills or equivalent instruments. These
bills are claims to a unit of foreign currency one period from today in all states of the
        i
world. Rt+1 denotes the risky dollar return from buying a foreign T-bill in country i,
                                                                                                i
                                                                                               Et+1
                                                                            i
selling it after one period and converting the proceeds back into dollars: Rt+1 = Rti,£         Eti
                                                                                                    ,
where Eti is the exchange rate in dollar per unit of foreign currency, Rti,£ is the risk-free
one-period return in units of foreign currency i.3 We use Pt to denote the dollar price of
                                         i,e
                                               ¡ i        ¢ t
the US consumption basket. Finally, Rt+1     = Rt+1  − Rt$ PPt+1 is the real excess return
from investing in foreign T-bills, and Rt$ is the nominal risk-free rate in US currency.
Below, we use lowercase symbols to denote the log of a variable.

    See http://www.econ.ucla.edu/people/faculty/Lustig.html or http://people.bu.edu/av/.
    Note that returns are dated by the time they are known. Thus, Rti,£ is the nominal risk free rate
    3

between period t and t + 1, which is known at date t.




                                                 5
UIP regressions and Currency Risk premia According to the UIP condition, the
slope in a regression of the change in the exchange rate for currency i on the interest
rate differential is equal to one:
                                              ³           ´
                           −∆eit+1 = α0i + α1i Rti,£ − Rt$ + ²it+1 ,


and the constant is equal to zero. The data consistently produce slope coefficients less
than one, mostly even negative.4 Of course, this immediately implies that the (nominal)
                                                   ³            ´
                                                      i,£     $
expected excess returns, which are roughly equal to Rt − Rt + Et ∆eit+1 , are not zero
and that they are predicted by interest rates: higher interest rates predict higher excess
returns.


Currency Portfolios To better analyze the risk-return trade-off for a US investor
investing in foreign currency markets, we construct currency portfolios that zoom in on
the predictability of excess returns by foreign interest rates.

      At the end of each period t, we allocate countries to eight portfolios on the basis of
the nominal interest rate differential, Rti,£ − Rt$ , observed at the end of period t. The
portfolios are rebalanced every year. They are ranked from low to high interests rates,
portfolio 1 being the portfolio with the lowest interest rate currencies and portfolio 8
being the one with the highest interest rate currencies. By building portfolios, we filter
out currency changes that are orthogonal to changes in interest rates. Let Nj denote
the number of currencies in portfolio j, and let us simply assume that currencies within
a portfolio have the same UIP constant and slope coefficients. Then, for portfolio j, the
change in the ‘average’ exchange rate will reflect mainly the risk premium component,
              ³           ´
 j    j 1 P      i,£    $
α0 + α1 Nj i Rt − Rt , the part we are interested in.

      We always use a total number of eight portfolios. Given the limited number of
countries, especially at the start of the sample, we did not want too many portfolios.
If we choose less than eight portfolios, then the currencies of countries with very high
inflation end up being mixed with others. It is important to keep these currencies

sive surveys and updated regression results.

separate because the returns on these very high interest rate currencies are very different,
as will become more apparent below.
                                                                   j,e
    Next, we compute excess returns of foreign T-bill investments Rt+1 for each portfolio
j by averaging across the different countries in each portfolio. We use ET to denote the
                                                                                 £ j,e ¤
sample mean for a sample of size T . The variation in average excess returns ET Rt+1
for j = 1, . . . , 8 across portfolios is much larger than the spread in average excess re-
turns across individual currencies, because foreign interest rates fluctuate over time: the
foreign excess return is positive (negative) when foreign interest rates are high (low),
and periods of high excess returns are canceled out by periods of low excess returns.
Our portfolios shift the focus from individual currencies to high vs. low interest rate
currencies, in the same way that the Fama and French (1992) portfolios of stocks sorted
on size and book-to-market ratios shift the focus from individual stocks to small/value
vs. large/growth stocks.


B    Data

With these eight portfolios, we consider two different time-horizons. First, we study
the period 1953 to 2002, which spans a number of different exchange rate arrangements.
The Euler equation restrictions are valid regardless of the exchange rate regime. Second,
we consider a shorter time period, 1971 to 2002, beginning with the demise of Bretton-
Woods.


Interest Rates and Exchange Rates For each currency, the exchange rate is the
end-of-month average daily exchange rate, from Global Financial Data. The foreign
interest rate is the interest rate on a 3-month government security (e.g. a US T-bill)
or an equivalent instrument, also from Global Financial Data. We used the 3-month
interest rate instead of the one-year rate, simply because fewer governments issue bills
or equivalent instruments at the one year maturity. As data became available, new
countries were added to these portfolios. As a result, the composition of the portfolio
as well as the number of countries in a portfolio changes from one period to the next.


                                             7
Section A.1 in the Appendix contains a detailed list of the currencies in our sample.

       Two additional issues need to be dealt with: the existence of expected and actual
default events, and the effects of financial liberalization.


Default Defaults can impact our currency returns in two ways. First, expected de-
faults should lead rational investors to ask for a default premium, thus increasing the
foreign interest rate and the foreign currency return. To check that our results are due to
currency risk, we run all experiments for a sub-sample of developed countries. None of
these countries has ever defaulted, nor were they ever considered likely candidates. Yet,
we obtain very similar results. Second, actual defaults modify the realized returns. To
compute actual returns on an investment after default, we used the data set of defaults
compiled by Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003). The (ex ante) recovery rate we
applied is seventy percent. This number reflects two sources, Singh (2003) and Moody’s
Investors Service (2003), presented in section A.2 of the Appendix. If a country is still
in default in the following year, we simply exclude it from the sample for that year.5


Capital Account Liberalization The restrictions imposed by the Euler equation
on the joint distribution of exchange rates and interest rates only make sense if foreign
investors can in fact purchase local T-bills. Quinn (1997) has built indices of openness
based on the coding of the IMF Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange
Restrictions. This report covers fifty-six nations from 1950 onwards and 8 more starting
in 1954-1960. Quinn (1997)’s capital account liberalization index ranges from zero to
one hundred. We chose a cut-off value of 20, and we eliminate countries below the
cutoff. In these countries, approval of both capital payments and receipts are rare, or
the payments and receipts are at best only infrequently granted.
   5
    In the entire sample from 1953 to 2002, there are thirteen instances of default by a country whose
currency is in one of our portfolios: Zimbabwe (1965), Jamaica (1978), Jamaica (1981), Mexico (1982),
Brazil (1983), Philippines (1983), Zambia (1983), Ghana (1987), Jamaica (1987), Trinidad and Tobago
(1988), South Africa (1989, 1993) and Pakistan (1998). Of course, many more countries actually
defaulted over this sample, but those are not in our portfolios because they imposed capital controls,
as explained in the next paragraph.

Notes: This table reports the mean of the real excess returns (in percentage points) and the Sharpe Ratio (SR) for a US
investor. The portfolios are constructed by sorting currencies into eight groups at time t based on the nominal interest
rate differential at the end of period t − 1. Portfolio 1 contains currencies with the lowest interest rates. Portfolio 8
contains currencies with the highest interest rates. The table reports annual returns for annually re-balanced portfolios.


  The first panel of table 1 lists the average excess return in units of US consumption
  £ j,e ¤
ET Rt+1 and the Sharpe ratio for each of the annually re-balanced portfolios. The
largest spread (between the first and the seventh portfolio) exceeds five percentage points
for the entire sample, and close to seven percentage points in the shorter sub-sample.
The average annual returns are almost monotonically increasing in the interest rate
differential. The only exception is the last portfolio, which consists of very high inflation
currencies: the average interest rate gap with the US for the eighth portfolio is about 16
percentage points over the entire sample and 23 percentage points post-Bretton Woods.
As Bansal and Dahlquist (2000) have documented, UIP tends to work best at high
inflation levels.

    Countries change portfolios frequently (23 percent of the time), and the time-varying
composition of the portfolios is critical. If we allocate currencies into portfolios based
on the average interest rate differential over the entire sample instead, then there is
essentially no pattern in average excess returns.


Exchange Rates and Interest Rates Table 2 decomposes the average excess returns

interest rate gap (ET (∆Rj )) in the first row of each panel in Table 2 and the average
rate of depreciation (ET (−∆ej )) in the second row.6 If there is no average risk premium,
these should be identical. Table 2 shows they are not. Investors earn large negative
excess returns on the first portfolio because the low interest rate currencies in the first
portfolio depreciate on average by 34 basis points, while the average foreign interest rate
is 2.46 percentage points lower then the US interest rate. On the other hand, the higher
interest rate currencies in the seventh portfolio depreciate on average by almost 2.18
percentage points, but the average interest rate difference is on average 4.7 percentage
points. The third row in each panel reports the inflation rates. As advertised, for the
very high interest rate currencies in the last portfolio, much of the interest rate gap
reflects inflation differences. This is not the case for low interest rate portfolios.

       Our currency portfolios create a stable set of excess returns. In order to explain the
variation in these currency excess returns, we use consumption-based pricing kernels.

    ∆Rtj is the average interest rate differential N1j i Rti,£ − Rt$ for portfolio j at time t. The
average risk premium is approximately equal to the difference between the first and the second row.
This approximation does not exactly lead to the excess return reported in Table 1, because Table 1
reports the real excess return (based on the real return on currency and the real US risk-free rate), and
because of the log approximation.

D     US Investor’s Euler Equation

We turn now to a description of the US investor preferences. We use Mt+1 to denote
the US investor’s real stochastic discount factor (SDF) or intertemporal marginal rate
of substitution, in the sense of Hansen and Jagannathan (1991). This discount factor
prices payoffs in units of US consumption. In the absence of short-sale constraints or
other frictions, the US investor’s Euler equation for foreign currency investments holds
for each currency i and thus for each portfolio j:

                                     £      j,e
                                                ¤
(1)                                Et Mt+1 Rt+1   = 0.


Preferences Our consumption-based asset pricing model is derived in a standard rep-
resentative agent setting, following Lucas (1978) and Breeden (1979), and its extension
to non-expected utility by Epstein and Zin (1989) and to durable goods by Dunn and
Singleton (1986) and Eichenbaum and Hansen (1990). We adopt Yogo (2006)’s setup
which conveniently nests all these models. The stand-in household has preferences over
non-durable consumption Ct and durable consumption services Dt . Following Yogo
(2006), the stand-in household ranks stochastic streams of non-durable and durable
consumption {Ct , Dt } according to the following utility index:

                        n                                £       ¤ κ1 o1/(1− σ1 )
                                          1− σ1            1−γ
                  Ut = (1 − δ)u(Ct , Dt )         +   δEt Ut+1                      ,


where κ = (1 − γ)/(1 − 1/σ). δ is the subjective time discount factor, γ > 0 governs the
household’s risk aversion and σ > 0 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS).
The one-period utility kernel is given by a CES-function over C and D:
                                h            1
                                                        i     1
                                                      1 1/(1− ρ )
                       u(C, D) = (1 − α)C 1− ρ + αD1− ρ           ,


α ∈ (0, 1) is the weight on durable consumption and ρ ≥ 0 is the intratemporal elasticity
of substitution between non-durables and durables. Yogo (2006)’s model, which we refer
to as the EZ − DCAP M , nests four familiar models. Table 3 lists all of these. On the

one hand, if we impose γ = 1/σ , the Durable Consumption-CAPM (DCAPM ) obtains,
while imposing ρ = σ produces the Epstein-Zin Consumption-CAPM (EZ-CCAPM ).
When γ = 1/σ and ρ = σ, the standard Breeden-Lucas CCAPM obtains.

where Rw is the return on the market portfolio and v is defined as:

E        Calibration

We start off by feeding actual consumption and return data into a calibrated version
of our model, and we assess how much of the variation in currency excess returns this
calibrated model can account for. To do so, we take Yogo (2006)’s estimates of the
substitution elasticities and the durable consumption weight in the utility function.7
Next, we feed the data for Ct , Dt and Rtw , the market return into the SDF in 2, and we
    7
    We fix σ at .023, α at .802 and ρ at .700. These parameters were estimated from a US investor’s
Euler equation on a large number of equity portfolios (Yogo (2006), p. 552, Table II, All Portfolios).

simply evaluate the pricing errors ET Mt+1 Rt+1   for each portfolio j. γ was chosen to
minimize the mean squared pricing error on the 8 currency portfolios.8 Table 4 reports
the implied maximum Sharpe ratio (first row), the market price of risk (row 2), the
standard error (row 3), the mean absolute pricing error (MAE, in row 4), as well as
the R2 . The benchmark model in the last column explains 65 % of the cross-sectional

model’s predicted excess return on currency portfolio j in the price of risk and the risk
beta:

There is a large difference in risk exposure between the first and the seventh portfolios:
 1                  7
βM is -2.54, while βM is 8.21. When multiplied by the price of risk of 28 basis points,
this translates into a 3 percentage point spread in the predicted excess return between
the first and the seventh portfolio, about 65 % of the actual spread. The low interest
rate portfolio provides the US investor with protection against high marginal utility
growth, or high M , states of the world, while the high interest rate portfolios do not.
This variation in betas is the focus of the next section.

II      Does Consumption Risk Explain Foreign Currency
        Excess Returns?

So far, we have engineered a large cross-sectional spread in currency excess returns by
sorting currencies into portfolios, and we have shown that a calibrated version of the
model explains a large fraction of this spread. In this section, starting from the Euler
equation and following Yogo (2006), we derive a linear factor model whose factors are
non-durable US consumption growth ∆ct , durable US consumption growth ∆dt and the
log of the US market return rtm . Using standard linear regression methods, we show
that US consumption risk explains most of the variation in average excess returns across
the eight currency portfolios, because on average low interest rate currencies expose
US investors to less non-durable and durable consumption risk than high interest rate
currencies. We start by deriving the factor model, then we describe the estimation
method and we present our results in terms of fit, factor prices and preference parameters.


A       Linear Factor Model

The US investor’s unconditional Euler equation (approximately) implies a linear three-
factor model for the expected excess return on portfolio j:9

                              ¡           ¢        ¡           ¢        ¡           ¢

                                                                                j,e

The vector of factor loadings b depend on the preference parameters σ, α and ρ:
                                                                 

                                                                  
                                                 1−κ
    9
   This linear factor model is derived by using a linear approximation of the SDF Mt+1 around its
unconditional mean:
                                    Mt+1
                                           ' 1 + mt+1 − E[mt+1 ],
                                  E[Mt+1 ]
where lower letters denote logs. Since we use excess returns, we normalize the constant in the SDF to
1, because we cannot identify it from the estimation.

                                                 14
      The expected excess return on portfolio j is governed by the covariance of its returns
with non-durable consumption growth, durable consumption growth and the market
return. When b1 > 0 (the case that obtains when γ > 1 and σ < 1), then an asset with
high non-durable consumption growth beta must have a high expected excess return.
This turns out to be the empirically relevant case. b2 > 0 obtains when the intratemporal
elasticity of substitution is larger than the EIS. In this case, an asset with a high durable
consumption growth beta also has a high expected excess return. In this range of the
parameter space, nondurables and durables are good substitutes, and as a result, high
durable consumption can offset the effect of low nondurable consumption on marginal
utility.

      Our benchmark asset pricing model, denoted EZ-DCAPM, is described by equation
(3). This specification however nests the CCAPM with ∆ct as the only factor, the
DCAPM with ∆ct and ∆dt as factors, the EZ-CCAPM, with ∆ct and rtw , and, finally
the CAPM as special cases, as shown in the bottom panel of Table 3.


Beta Representation This linear factor model can be restated as a beta pricing
model, where the expected excess return is equal to the factor price λ times the amount
of risk of each portfolio β j :


(5)                                    E[Rj,e ] = λ0 β j ,


where λ = Σf f b and Σf f = E(ft − µf )(ft − µf )0 is the variance-covariance matrix of the
factors.


A Simple Example A simple example will help to understand what is needed for
consumption growth risk to explain the cross-section of currency returns. Let us start
with the plain-vanilla CCAPM. The only asset pricing factor is aggregate, non-durable
consumption growth, ∆ct+1 , and the factor loading b1 equals the coefficient of risk aver-
sion γ. We can restate the expected excess return on portfolio j as the product of the

       The factor price measures the expected excess return on an asset that has a con-
sumption growth beta of one. Of course, the CCAPM can explain the variation in
returns only if the consumption betas are small/negative for low interest rate portfolios
and large/positive for high interest rate portfolios. Essentially, in testing the CCAPM,
we gauge how much of the variation in average returns across currency portfolios can be
explained by variation in the consumption betas. If the predicted excess returns - the
right hand side variable in equation (5) - line up with the realized sample means, then
we can claim success in explaining exchange rate changes, conditional on whether the
currency is a low or high interest rate currency. A key question then is whether there
is enough variation in the consumption betas of these currency portfolios to explain the
variation in excess returns with a plausible price of consumption risk. The next section
provides a positive answer to this question.


B       An Asset Pricing Experiment

To estimate the factor prices λ and the portfolio betas, we use a 2-stage procedure
following Fama and MacBeth (1973).10 In the first stage, for each portfolio j, we run
                                                  j,e
a time-series regression of the currency returns Rt+1 on a constant and the factors ft ,
in order to estimate β j . In the second stage, we run a cross-sectional regression of the
average excess returns ET [Rte ] on the betas that were estimated in the first stage, to
estimate the factor prices λ. Finally, we can back out the factor loadings b and hence
the structural parameters from the factor prices.

       We start by testing the consumption-based US investor’s Euler equation on the eight
annually re-balanced currency portfolios. Table 5 reports the estimated factor prices of
  10
    Chapter 12 of Cochrane (2001) describes this estimation procedure and compares it to the General-
ized Method of Moments (GMM) applied to linear factor models, following Hansen (1982). We present
results obtained with GMM as a robustness check in section IV.

consumption growth risk for nondurables (row 1), for durables (row 2) and the price of
market risk (row 3). Each column looks at a diferent model. We also report the implied
estimates for the preference parameters γ, σ and α (rows 4-6). The standard errors
are in parentheses.11 Finally, the last three rows report the mean absolute pricing error
(M AE), the R2 and the p-value for a χ2 test. The null for the χ2 test is that the true
pricing errors are zero and the p-value reports the probability that these pricing errors
would have been observed if the consumption-based model was the true model.


C      Results

We present results in terms of the factor prices, the fit, the preference parameters and
the consumption betas.


Factor Prices In our benchmark model (EZ-DCAPM ), reported in the last column
of Table 5, the estimated price of nondurable consumption growth risk λc is positive
and statistically significant. An asset with a consumption growth beta of one yields an
average risk premium of around 2 percent per annum. This is a large number, but it is
quite close to the market price of consumption growth risk estimated on US equity and
bond portfolios (see section IV-C.) The estimated price of durable consumption growth
risk λd is positive and statistically significant as well. It is around 4.6 percent. These
factor price estimates do not vary much across the different models. Finally, market risk
is priced at about 3.3 percent per annum, but it is not significantly different from zero.


Model Fit We find that consumption growth risk explains a large share of the cross-
sectional variation in currency returns. The EZ-DCAPM explains 87 percent of the
cross-sectional variation in annual returns on the eight currency portfolios, against 74
percent for the DCAPM and 18 percent for the simple CCAPM. For the EZ-DCAPM,
the mean absolute pricing error on these eight currency portfolios is about 32 basis
  11
    These standard errors do not correct for the fact that the betas are estimated. Jagannathan and
Wang (1996) show that the Fama-MacBeth procedure does not necessarily overstate the precision of
the standard errors if conditional heteroskedasticity is present. We show in section IV - E that these
standard errors are actually close to the heteroskedasticy-consistent ones derived from GMM estimates.

points over the entire sample, compared to 65 basis points for the DCAPM, and 200
basis points for the simple CCAPM. This last number is rather high, mainly because
of the last portfolio, with very high interest rate currencies. When we drop the last
portfolio, the mean absolute pricing error on the remaining seven portfolios drops to 109
basis points for the simple CCAPM, and the R2 increases to 50 percent.

    The simple CCAPM and the EZ-CCAPM are rejected at the 5 percent significance
levels, but the DCAPM and the EZ-DCAPM are not. Durable consumption risk plays a
key role here as the models with durable consumption growth produce very small pricing
errors (less than 15 basis points) on the first and the seventh portfolio. This is clear
from figure 2, which plots the actual excess return against the predicted excess return
(on the horizontal axis) for each of these models.

Preference Parameters and Equity Premium Puzzle ¿From the factor prices,
we can back out the preference parameters. The intratemporal elasticity of substitution
between non-durables and durables ρ cannot be separately identified from the weight
on durable consumption α. We use Yogo (2006)’s estimate of ρ = .790 to calibrate the
elasticity of intratemporal substitution when we back out the other preference parameter

estimates. The EIS σ is estimated to be .2, substantially larger than 1/γ, and the
weight on durable consumption α is estimated to be around 1.1, close to the .9 estimate
reported by Yogo (2006), obtained on quarterly equity portfolios. Since the EIS estimate
is significantly smaller than the calibrated ρ, marginal utility growth decreases in durable
consumption growth, and assets whose returns co-vary more with durable consumption
growth trade at a discount (b2 > 0).

    In the benchmark model, the implied coefficient of risk aversion is around 114 and
this estimate is quite precise. In addition, these estimates do not very much across the
four different specifications of the consumption-based pricing kernel. This coefficient of

Notes: Each column of this table reports OLS estimates of β j in the following time-series regression of excess returns

on the factor for each portfolio j: Rt+1  = β0j + β1j ft + ²jt+1 . The estimates are based on annual data. Panel A reports
results for 1953-2002 and Panel B reports results for 1971-2002. We use 8 annually re-balanced currency portfolios sorted
on interest rates as test assets. ∗ indicates significance at 5% level. We use Newey-West heteroskedasticity-consistent
standard errors with an optimal number of lags to estimate the spectral density matrix following Andrews (1991).



risk aversion is of course very high, but it is in line with stock-based estimates of the
coefficient of risk aversion found in the literature, and with our own estimates based on
bond and stock returns. For example, if we re-estimate the model only on the 25 Fama-
French equity portfolios, sorted on size and book-to market, the risk aversion estimate
is 115 (with a standard error of 4.5). In addition, the linear approximation we adopted
causes an underestimate of the market price of consumption risk for a given risk aversion
parameter γ.

    These high estimates are not surprising. The standard deviation of US consumption
growth (per annum) is only 1.50 percent in our sample. This is Mehra and Prescott
(1985)’s equity premium puzzle in disguise; there is not enough aggregate consumption
growth risk in the data to explain the level of risk compensation in currency markets at
low levels of risk aversion, as is the case in equity markets, but there is enough variation
across portfolios in consumption betas to explain the spread, if the risk aversion is large
enough to match the levels. We now focus on this cross-section of consumption betas.


Consumption Betas Consumption-based models can account for the cross-section of
currency excess returns because they imply a large cross-section of betas. On average,

                                                           20
higher interest rate portfolios expose US investors to much more US consumption growth
risk. Table 6 reports the OLS betas for each of the factors. Panel A reports the results
for the entire sample. We find that high interest rate currency returns are strongly pro-
cyclical, while low interest rate currency returns are a-cyclical. For nondurables, the first
portfolio’s consumption beta is 10 basis points, the seventh portfolio’s consumption beta
is 110 basis points. For durables, the spread is also about 100 basis points, from 24 basis
points to 129 basis points. In the second post-Bretton-Woods sub-sample, reported in
Panel B, the spread in consumption betas increases to 150 basis points between the first
and the seventh portfolio (with betas ranging from zero basis points to 154 basis points
for non-durables, and from 50 to 210 basis points for durables). Finally, the market
betas of currency returns are much smaller overall.

       Next, we estimate the conditional factor betas, conditioning on the interest rate gap
with the US, and we find that low interest rate currencies provide a consumption hedge
for US investors exactly when US interest rates are high and foreign interest rates are
low.


D        Conditional Factor Betas

We can go one step further in our understanding of exchange rates by taking into account
the time-variation in the conditional consumption growth betas.12 It turns out that low
interest rate currencies offer a consumption hedge to US investors exactly when the US
interest rates are high and foreign interest rates are low. To see this, we consider a
simple two-step procedure. We first obtain the U.I.P residuals ²jt+1 for each portfolio
j. We then regress each residual on each factor f k , controlling for the interest rates
  12
       There is a conditional analogue of the three-factor model in equation (3):
                                ³             ´          ³             ´          ³            ´
                                          i,e                      i,e                     i,e
            Et [Ri,e ] = b1 covt ∆ct+1 , Rt+1   + b2 covt ∆dt+1 , Rt+1              w
                                                                         + b3 covt rt+1 , Rt+1   .

Since the interest rate is known at t, these covariances terms involve only the changes in the exchange
rate ∆eit+1 .

where for expositional purpose we introduce the normalized interest rate difference ∆R
which is zero when the interest rate difference ∆Rti is at a minimum and hence positive in
the entire sample. We use the interest rate differential as the sole conditioning variable,
because we know from the work by Meese and Rogoff (1983) that our ability to predict
exchange rates is rather limited.

       The results are reported in Table 7. Each bar in figure 3 reports the conditional
factor betas for a different portfolio. The first panel reports the nondurable consump-
tion betas, the second panel the durable consumption betas, the third panel reports the
market betas. When the interest rate difference with the US hits the lowest point, the
currencies in the first portfolio appreciate on average by 287 basis points when US non-
durable consumption growth drops 100 basis points below its mean, while the currencies
in the seventh portfolio depreciate on average by 96 basis points. Similarly, when US
durable consumption growth drops 100 basis points below its mean, the currencies in
the first portfolio appreciate by 174 basis points, while the currencies in the seventh
portfolio depreciate by 105 basis points. Low interest rate currencies provide consump-
tion insurance to US investors, while high interest rate currencies expose US investors
to more consumption risk. As the interest rate gap closes on the currencies in the first
portfolio, the low interest rate currencies provide less consumption insurance. For every
4 percentage points reduction in the interest rate gap, the non-durable consumption
betas decrease by about 100 basis points.13


Interest rates as Instruments To test whether the representative agent’s IMRS can
indeed explain the time variation in expected returns on these portfolios, in addition to
the cross-sectional variation, we use the average interest rate difference with the US as
an instrument. As is clear from the unconditional Euler equation, this is equivalent to
  13
    This table also shows our asset pricing results are entirely driven by how exchange rates respond
to consumption growth shocks in the US, not by sovereign risk.

The estimates are based on annual data and the sample is 1953-2002. We use 8 annually re-balanced currency portfolios
sorted on interest rates as test assets. The pricing factors are consumption growth rates in non-durables (c) and durables

rate difference for portfolio i as an instrument for the i-th moment. The consumption
risk price estimates are very close to those we obtained off the unconditional moments
of currency returns, and, more importantly, the benchmark model cannot be rejected in
either case.

     Consumption-based models do a remarkable job in explaining the cross-sectional
variation as well as the time variation in returns, albeit at the cost of a very high implied
price of aggregate consumption risk. In section IV, we contrast this model’s performance
with that of the workhorse of modern finance, the Capital Asset Pricing Model. As we
show, there is not enough variation in market betas to explain currency returns, but

there is enough variation in consumption betas. We conclude that consumption growth
risk seems to play a key role in explaining currency risk premia. The next section links
our findings about risk premia back to changes in the exchange rates.



III        Mechanism

We have shown that predicted currency excess returns line up with realized ones when
pricing factors take into account consumption growth risk. This is not mere luck on our
part. The next section provides many robustness checks. This section sheds some light
on the underlying mechanism: where do these currency betas come from?. We first show


                                                         25
that the log of the conditional expected return on foreign currency can be restated in
terms of the conditional consumption growth betas of exchange rate changes. We then
interpret these betas as restrictions on the joint distribution of consumption growth in
high and low interest rate currencies.


A     Consumption Growth Betas of Exchange Rates

                            i
If we assume that Mt+1 and Rt+1 are jointly, conditionally log-normal, then the Euler
equation can be restated in terms of the real currency risk premium (see proof in Ap-
pendix B):
                                              ¡                   ¢
                             i
                     log Et Rt+1 − rtf = −Covt mt+1 , rt+1
                                                       i
                                                           − ∆pt+1 ,

where lower cases denote logs. We refer to this log currency premium as crpit+1 . It
is determined by the covariance between the log of the SDF m and the real return
on investment in the foreign T-bill. Substituting the definition of this return into this
equation produces the following expression for the log currency risk premium:

                                        ¡                     ¢
(8)                      crpit+1 = −Covt mt+1 , ∆eit+1 − ∆pt+1 .


Note that the interest rates play no role for conditional risk premia; only changes in
the deflated exchange rate matter. Using this expression, we examine what restrictions
are implied on the joint distribution of consumption growth and exchange rates by the
increasing pattern of currency risk premia in interest rates, and we test these restrictions
in the data.


Consumption Growth and Exchange Rates ¿From our linear factor model, it
immediately follows that the log currency risk premium can be restated in terms of the
conditional factor betas:

                       ¡                       ¢        ¡                       ¢
      crpit+1 ' b1 Covt ∆ct+1 , ∆eit+1 − ∆pt+1 + b2 Covt ∆dt+1 , ∆eit+1 − ∆pt+1
                       ¡ m                   ¢
              + b3 Covt rt+1 , ∆eit+1 − ∆pt+1 .


                                            26
This equation uncovers the key mechanism that explains the forward premium puzzle.
                                              ¡      ¢
We recall that, in the data, the risk premium crpit+1 is positively correlated with
foreign interest rates Rti,£ : low interest rate currencies earn negative risk premia and
high interest rate currencies earn positive risk premia. To match these facts, in the
simplest case of the CCAPM, the following necessary condition needs to be satisfied by
the conditional consumption covariances:

                   ¡              ¢
               Covt ∆ct+1 , ∆eit+1 small/negative when Rti,£ is low,
                    ¡              ¢
               Covt ∆ct+1 , ∆eit+1 large/positive when Rti,£ is high.




The same condition applies to durable consumption growth ∆dt+1 and the market return
 w
rt+1 in our benchmark, three-factor model. This is exactly what we see in the consump-
tion betas of currency, reported in figure (3). Both in the time-series (comparing the
bar in the left panels and the right panels) and in the cross-section (going from portfolio
1 to 7), low foreign interest rates mean small/negative consumption betas. On the one
hand, currencies that appreciate on average when US consumption growth is high and
depreciate when US consumption growth is low, earn positive conditional risk premia.
On the other hand, currencies that appreciate when US consumption growth is low and
depreciate when it is high, earn negative risk premia. These currencies provide a hedge
for US investors. Given the pattern of excess return variation across different currency
portfolios, the covariance of changes in the exchange rate with US consumption growth
term needs to switch signs over time for a given currency, depending on the portfolio it
has been allocated to (or, its interest rate).

   There is a substantial amount of time variation in the consumption betas of curren-
cies. This reflects the time variation in interest rates and expected returns within each
portfolio over time. Yet, most of our results can be understood in terms of the average
consumption betas: on average, high interest rate currencies expose US investors to
more consumption growth risk, while low interest rate currencies provide a hedge. The
next subsection explains where these betas come from and why they are correlated with


                                             27
interest rates.


B        Where Do Consumption Betas of Currencies Come from?

The answer is time-variation in the conditional distribution of the foreign stochastic
discount factor mi . Investing in foreign currency is like betting on the difference between
your own and your neighbor’s intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS). These
bets are very risky if your IMRS is not correlated with your neighbor’s, but they provide
a hedge when her IMRS is highly correlated and more volatile. We identify two potential
mechanisms to explain the consumption betas of currencies. Low foreign interest rates
either signal (1) an increase in the volatility of the foreign stochastic discount factors
or (2) an increase in the correlation of the foreign stochastic discount factor with the
domestic one.

       To obtain these results, we assume that markets are complete and that the SDF are
log-normal. Essentially, we re-interpret an existing derivation by Backus, Foresi and
Telmer (2001), and we explore its empirical implications.


Currency Risk premia and the SDF In the case of complete markets, investing
in foreign currency amounts to shorting a claim that pays off your SDF and going long
in a claim that pays off the foreign SDF. The net payoff of this bet depends on the
correlation and volatility of these SDFs. Assuming that the inflation betas are small
enough and that markets are complete, the size of the log currency risk premium crpit+1
is given by15 :

                                £                 ¡            ¢          ¤
(9)                    stdt mt+1 stdt mt+1 − Corrt mt+1 , mit+1 stdt mit+1 .


Its sign is determined by the standard deviation of the home SDF relative to the one
of the foreign SDF scaled by the correlation between the two SDFs. What does this
equation imply? Obviously, either a higher conditional volatility of the foreign SDF or
  15
       See Appendix B for a proof.



                                                28
a higher correlation of the SDFs in the case of lower interest rate currencies -and the
reverse for high interest rates- would generate the right pattern in risk premia.


Example In the case of the simple CCAPM, these two mechanisms can be stated in
terms of the joint distribution of consumption growth at home and abroad. Assume
that the stand-in agents in both countries share the same coefficient of relative risk
aversion. Then, abstracting again from the inflation betas, the sign of the conditional
risk premium is determined by:


                   £                         ¡               ¢              ¤
                       stdt (∆cUt+1
                                  S
                                    ) − Corrt ∆cUt+1
                                                   S
                                                     , ∆cit+1 stdt (∆cit+1 ) .

   A low correlation of foreign consumption growth with US consumption growth for
high interest rate currencies, and a high correlation for low interest rate currencies,
creates the right variation in currency risk premia. More volatile consumption growth
for low interest rate currencies also delivers this pattern. What is the economic intuition
behind this mechanism?

   In our benchmark representative agent model with complete markets, the foreign
currency appreciates when foreign consumption growth is lower than US aggregate con-
sumption growth and depreciates when it is higher. When markets are complete, the
value of a dollar delivered tomorrow in each state of the world, in terms of dollars
today, equals the value of a unit of foreign currency tomorrow delivered in the same
state, in units of currency today: Qit+1 /Qit = Mt+1
                                                 i
                                                     /Mt+1 , where the exchange rate Qi
is in units of the US good per unit of the foreign good. Thus, in the case of a CRRA
representative agent in the US, the percentage change in the real exchange rate equals
the percentage change in consumption growth times the coefficient of risk aversion:
  i
∆qt+1 = γ(∆ct+1 − ∆cit+1 ).

   If the foreign stand-in agent’s consumption growth is strongly correlated with and
more volatile than that of his US counterpart, his national currency provides a hedge for
the US representative agent. For example, consider the case in which foreign consump-
tion growth is twice as volatile as US consumption growth and perfectly correlated with


                                                29
US consumption growth. In this case, when consumption growth is -2 percent below
the mean in the US, it is -4 percent below the mean abroad, and the real exchange rate
appreciates by γ times 2 percent. When consumption growth is +2 percent in the US, it
is twice as high abroad (+4 percent), and the real exchange rate depreciates by γ times
2 percent. This currency is a perfect hedge against US aggregate consumption growth
risk. Consequently, investing in this currency should provide a low excess return. Thus,
for this heteroscedasticity mechanism to explain the pattern in currency excess returns,
low interest rate currencies must have aggregate consumption growth processes that are
conditionally more volatile than US aggregate consumption growth. This is in line with
the theory. All else equals, in the case of power utility, an increase in the conditional
volatility of aggregate consumption growth lowers the real interest rate.16 If real and
nominal interest rates move in sync, a low nominal interest rate should predict a higher
conditional volatility of aggregate consumption growth. Of course, if inflation is very
high and volatile, the nominal and the real interest rates effectively are detached, and
this mechanism would disappear, as it seems to in the data.

       Time-variation in the correlation between the domestic and the foreign SDF is the
second mechanism. In the previous example, if the consumption growth of a high inter-
est rate country is perfectly negatively correlated with US consumption growth, then a
negative consumption shock of 2 percent in the US leads to a depreciation of the foreign
currency by γ times 2 percent. This currency depreciates when US consumption growth
is low. Consequently, investing in this currency should provide a high excess return.
Thus, for this correlation mechanism to explain the pattern in currency excess returns,
the correlation between domestic and foreign consumption growth should decrease with
the interest rate differential. Empirically, we find strong evidence to support that mech-
anism: foreign consumption growth is less correlated with US consumption growth when
the foreign interest rate is high.


Evidence The heteroscedasticity mechanism is also at the heart of the habit-based
model of the exchange rate risk premium in Verdelhan (2005). In his model, the do-
  16
    This can be shown by starting from the Euler definition of the real risk-free rate and by assuming
that aggregate consumption growth is log-normal.

                                                 30
mestic investor receives a positive exchange rate risk premium in times when he is more
risk-averse than his foreign counterpart. Times of high risk-aversion correspond to low
interest rates. Thus, the domestic investor receives a positive risk premium when interest
rates are lower at home than abroad.


Test of the Correlation Mechanism In addition, we document some direct evidence
in the data for the correlation mechanism. For data reasons, we focus on non-durable
consumption growth only. Using a sample of ten developed countries, we regressed a
country’s non-durable consumption growth on US non-durable consumption growth and
US consumption growth interacted with the lagged interest rate differential:
                                             ³           ´
                 ∆cit+1 = α0 + α1 ∆cUt+1
                                       S
                                         + α2 Rti,£ − Rt$ ∆cUt+1
                                                               S
                                                                 + ²t+1 .


   The results obtained over the post-Bretton Woods period on annual data are reported
in table 9. The coefficients on the interaction terms α2 are negative for all countries,
except for Japan. The table also reports ninety percent confidence intervals for these
interaction coefficients. They show that the α2 coefficients are significantly negative for
7 countries. The last row of each panel reports the pooled time series regression results.
The ninety percent confidence interval includes only negative coefficients.

   As is clear from the α2 estimates in column 3, the conditional correlation between
foreign and US annual consumption growth decreases with the interest rate gap for
all countries except Japan. We also found the same pattern for Japanese and UK
consumption growth processes (not reported).



IV      Robustness

This section goes through a number of robustness checks: (1) we look at other factor
models, (2) we split up the sample, (3) we introduce other test assets, (4) we re-estimate
the model on developed currency portfolios, and (5) we re-estimate the model using the
Generalized Method of Moments.

the spectral density matrix (Andrews, 1991). α2 and α2 are respectively one standard error below and above the point
estimate α2 .



A      Factor Models

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM ), due to Sharpe (1964) and Treynor (1961) is
a useful benchmark. In this model, the excess return on the US total market portfolio is
the only asset pricing factor. We use the CRSP value-weighted excess return, denoted
Rw , as a proxy for the market return:

                                              Mt+1              w
(10)                                                  ' 1 − bw Rt+1 .
                                             E[Mt+1 ]

Of course, the same decomposition of the risk premium in market price of risk (here λw )
and betas (βw ) applies here. The model implies that the market price of risk λw equals
the expected excess return on the market, because the market has a beta of one.

    In addition, we consider the bond and equity factor models developed by Fama and
French (1992). Fama and French (1992) add the return on a portfolio that goes long in
                               SM B
small and short in big firms (Rt+1  ) and the return on a portfolio that goes long in high
                                                        HM L
book-to-market and short in low book-to-market stocks (Rt+1  ) as additional equity

                                                           32
                                                                             long
pricing factors.17 For bond pricing, they use the slope of the yield curve (Rt+1  ) and
                                        corp
the default spread on corporate bonds (Rt+1  ). These factors proxy for the underlying
undiversifiable macroeconomic risk (Fama and French (1993)).

      Table 10 lists the results for the CAPM and the Fama-French factor models. We
start with the CAPM in the first column. The price of market risk λw is estimated to be
around 7 percent. This number is in line with the theory, which prescribes a market price
of risk of seven percent, the average excess return on the market. However, the CAPM
explains only 4 percent of the variation in returns over the entire sample. Introducing
the Fama-French bond and equity factors does not improve the pricing much. The Fama-
French equity factors explain 8 percent, while the bond factors explain 20 percent. The
mean absolute pricing error does not drop below 200 basis points for any of these models,
compared to 32 basis points for the EZ-DCAPM. The pricing errors for the first and the
seventh portfolio are large, in excess of 100 basis points, in all three cases. The factor
models, which work in equity and bond markets, break down in currency markets.

      Clearly, the currency excess returns are not spanned by Fama-French equity or bond
factors. This makes currency portfolios particularly useful as test assets. Daniel and
Titman (2005) argue that even factors which are loosely correlated with HM L and SM B
will appear successful in explaining the cross-section of asset returns, but our currency
returns are not correlated with these. In fact, our currency portfolios are out-of-sample
test assets, as advocated by Lewellen, Nagel and Shanken (2006).


B      Post-Bretton-Woods

While the same investor Euler equation applies to fixed and floating regimes, the joint
distribution of consumption growth and foreign currency returns is affected by a change
in the exchange rate regime, and this may affect the estimation. To address this, we
split the sample.

      SM B means small-minus-big and HM L means high-minus-low.

Notes: This table reports the Fama-MacBeth estimates of the factor prices (in percentage points) using 8 annually re-
balanced currency portfolios as test assets. The sample is 1953-2002 (annual data). The standard errors are reported
between brackets. The last three rows report the mean absolute pricing error (in percentage points), the R2 and the
p-value for a χ2 test.



Consumption-CAPM The results for the 1971-2002 sub-sample are reported in Ta-
ble 11. Panel A reports the Consumption-CAPM estimates, and Panel B reports the
factor model estimates. The estimated price of consumption growth risk is 2.4 percent in
the benchmark model, and it is still significant, while the price of durable consumption
growth risk is around 3 percent. The implied coefficient of risk aversion is 98, close to our
earlier estimate of 114. Our benchmark model, the EZ-DCAPM explains 65 percent of
the variation over this sub-sample, and the mean absolute pricing error increases to 128
basis points, substantially higher than the number for the entire sample. Even though
all four models pass the χ2 -test, only the models with durable consumption growth as
factor explain a large fraction of the cross-sectional variation in returns.


Factor Models The results for the factor models are shown in the second panel of
Table 11. In this sub-sample, the CAPM explains none of the variation and the Fama-

Notes: This table reports the Fama-MacBeth estimates of the factor prices (in percentage points) using 8 annually re-
balanced currency portfolios as test assets. The sample is 1971-2002 (annual data). The standard errors are reported
between brackets. The factors are demeaned. The last three rows report the mean absolute pricing error (in percentage
points), the R2 and the p-value for a χ2 test.



French factor models explain less than 18 percent of the variation in returns. The mean
absolute pricing error does not decrease below 290 basis points. The price of market risk
is not significantly different from zero in any of the models. None of these factor models
pass the χ2 -test.

C     Other Test Assets

As an additional test of the statistical significance of our results, we examine whether
the compensation for aggregate risk in currency markets differs from that in domestic
equity markets from the perspective of a US investor. To do so, we add 5 bond portfolios
and the 6 Fama-French benchmark stock portfolios, as test assets.

    We start by adding only equity as test assets. These Fama-French portfolios sort
stocks according to size and book-to-market, because both size and book-to-market
predict returns. This leaves us with 14 sample moment conditions. We want to find out
if these returns can be priced by the same SDF that prices currency risk. By adding
these to the currency portfolios, we do an out-of-sample test, as is clear from figure 4.
The filled dots represent the currency portfolios, and the actual excess returns are on
the vertical axis. The currency portfolios have radically different returns that are not
correlated with stock returns.

    The first column in Table 12 reports the results obtained using only currency portfo-
lios as test assets. The second column (E/C) reports the results for equity and currency
portfolios. Nondurable consumption risk is priced higher in equity markets (about 200
basis points), while durable consumption risk is priced about the same. The estimated
price of nondurable consumption growth risk is 3.8 percent obtained from all 14 test
assets, compared to the 2.2 estimate for currency only and 4.2 for equity only. The price
of durable consumption growth risk is 4.3 percent for equity and currency, compared
to 4.7 percent for currency and 3.8 percent for equity only. The implied risk aversion
coefficient estimates are substantially higher.

    Then we add bond and equity returns to the test assets to obtain a total of 19
moment conditions. The bond portfolios (CRSP Fama bond portfolios) contain bonds
with maturities between 1 and 2 years, 2 and 3 years, 3 and 4 years, 4 and 5 years,
5 and 6 years. In the last column (E/B/C), we report that the price of consumption
risk is now around 2.4 percent, closer to the currency market estimate, and the durable
consumption factor price is much smaller, closer to 2 percent. But, in spite of these large
differences in factor prices, the implied risk aversion estimates when bonds are included,

are very close to the currency-only ones, around 115.


D      Developed Currencies

To guard against the possibility that our results are due to sovereign risk instead of
currency risk, we exclude developing countries from the sample. The portfolio returns
are much noisier and the Sharpe ratios are smaller, simply because we only have 20
developed countries in the sample. In addition, the cross-sectional variation in interest
rates is now dominated by the time series variation in the average interest rate difference
with the US. That is why we use the interest rate difference with the US as an instrument
when testing the US investor’s Euler equation, as we did in section II.D. The first column
in Table 13 shows the estimates obtained using the average interest rate difference with
the US as an instrument; the second column shows the results obtained using the interest

are positive and significant, but somewhat lower than those obtained on the entire
sample of currencies. As a result, the implied risk aversion estimates are lower as well.
Consumption risk explains between 63 and 88 % of the variation in managed currency
portfolio returns for the subset of developed currencies.

Notes: This table reports the Fama-MacBeth estimates of the factor prices (in percentage points) using 8 annually re-
balanced managed developed currency portfolios as test assets. The sample is 1971-2002 (annual data). In column 1, we
use the mean interest rate difference on portfolios 1-7 as an instrument. In column 2, we use the interest rate difference
on portfolio i as the instrument for the i-th moment. The standard errors are reported between brackets. The factors are
demeaned. The last two rows report the R2 and the p-value for a χ2 test.



E      GMM

We also estimated the linear factor model using the general method of moments (GMM,
Hansen (1982)). The moment conditions are the sample analog of the population pricing
errors. In the first stage of the estimation procedure, we use the identity matrix as the
weighting matrix, W = I, while in the second stage we use W = S −1 where S is the
covariance matrix of the pricing errors in the first stage. Since we focus on linear factor
models, GMM is equivalent to a 2-stage linear regression of the average excess returns
ET (Rte ) on the factor-return moments ET (Rft0 ).

    The estimation results are reported in Panel A of Table 14. The first column looks at


                                                           39
the estimates obtained using only currency portfolios as test assets. Columns 2-5 report
the results for other test assets. The model cannot be rejected for any combination of
test assets.

   In the currency only case (column 1), the GMM factor price estimates for nondurable
and durable consumption are significant at the 5 percent level. The price of nondurable
consumption risk is 2.4 percent, compared to 2.2 percent using Fama-MacBeth - and
the price of durable consumption risk is 3.5 percent, compared to 4.7 percent. The
EZ-DCAPM passes the J-test at 5 percent significance level; the p-value reports the
probability of observing these pricing errors if the model is true. The measures of fit
we obtain are worse than before, because, in the case of linear factor models, GMM is
equivalent to running a regression of average returns on the cross-moment of returns and
factor without a constant in the regression.

   The Fama-MacBeth procedure uses factor betas that were estimated in the first step
of the procedure, and the standard errors reported in Table 5 do not correct for this.
However, in the currency only case, the GMM standard errors are quite close to the
‘uncorrected’ standard errors.

   In Panel B of table 14, we report the Shanken (1992)-corrected standard errors for the
Fama-MacBeth coefficients in parentheses. These include a correction for the sampling
error due to the estimation of the betas. We also report the standard errors generated
by bootstrapping 10.000 times from the empirical distribution of returns and factors in
{}. Clearly, the Shanken standard errors tend to be much larger than the GMM stan-
dard errors as well as the bootstrapped standard errors, especially when the number
of test assets is small. The large differences with the bootstrapped errors suggest this
may be due to the small sample properties of the Shanken correction. In addition, the
derivation of these Shanken-corrected standard errors assumes the errors are i.i.d; Ja-
gannathan and Wang (1998) show that the uncorrected Fama-MacBeth standard errors
do not necessarily overstate the precision of the factor price estimates in the presence of
conditional heteroskedasticity.

V      Related Literature

Our paper draws on at least two strands of the exchange rate literature. First, there is a
large literature on the efficiency of foreign exchange markets. Interest rate differentials
are not unbiased predictors of subsequent exchange rate changes. In fact, high interest
rate differentials seem to lead to further appreciations on average. This is known as the
forward premium puzzle. Fama (1984) argues that time-varying-risk premia can explain
these findings only if (1) risk premia are more volatile than expected future exchange
rate changes, and (2) risk premia are negatively correlated with the size of the expected
depreciation. Many authors have concluded that this sets the bar too high, and they
have ruled out risk-based explanations.

    Other authors have pursued the risk premium explanation. Our paper is closest
to Hollifield and Yaron (2001), Harvey, Solnik and Zhou (2002) and Sarkissian (2003).
Hollifield and Yaron (2001) find some evidence that real factors, not nominal ones, drive
most of the predictable variation in currency risk premia. Using a latent factor technique
on a sample of international bonds, Harvey et al. (2002) find empirical evidence of a
factor premium that is related to foreign exchange risk. Sarkissian (2003) finds that the
cross-sectional variance of consumption growth across countries helps explain currency
risk premia, but he focuses on unconditional moments of currency risk premia on a
currency-by-currency basis, while we find that most of the variation depends on the
level of the foreign interest rate. Finally, Backus et al. (2001) show that, in a general
class of affine models, explaining the forward premium puzzle requires the state variables
to have asymmetric effects on the state prices in different currencies. We reinterpret their
results in our framework.

    There is another literature that relates the volatility and persistence of real exchange
rates to aggregate consumption. Standard, dynamic equilibrium models, imply a strong
link between consumption ratios and the real exchange rate, but, as Backus and Smith
(1993) point out, there is no obvious link in the data. This lack of correlation motivates
the work by Alvarez, Atkeson and Kehoe (2002). They generate volatile, persistent
real exchange rates in a Baumol-Tobin model with endogenously segmented markets,


                                             41
effectively severing the link between changes in the real exchange rate and aggregate
consumption growth. Our results suggest that this may be too radical a remedy. Con-
ditional on the interest rate, there appears to be a strong link between consumption
growth and exchange rates.

   Finally, our results provide guidance for applied theoretical work in this area. A good
theory of real exchange rates needs to explain why (nominal) interest rates line up with
a currency’s aggregate consumption growth betas. And it must explain why this relation
breaks down for very high interest rates. At least on the first count, our results provide
empirical support for work by Verdelhan (2005). He replicates the forward discount bias
in a model with external habits and he provides estimates to support this mechanism.



VI      Conclusion

Aggregate consumption growth risk explains a large fraction of the average changes
in the exchange rate, conditional on foreign interest rates. On average, high interest
rate currencies depreciate when US consumption growth is low and US investors want
to be compensated for this risk. Thus, aggregate consumption growth risk is key to
understanding exchange rates. Thus far real exchange rates appeared to be unrelated
to aggregate consumption in the data (e.g. Backus and Smith (1993) and Chari, Kehoe
and McGrattan (2002)), but our results suggest that the correlation between changes
in the real exchange rate and consumption growth varies strongly over time and across
currencies.

Appendix A2            Recovery Rates

First, Moody’s research studies twenty-four defaulted sovereign bonds issued by seven coun-
tries. They compute the average of the face value thirty days after default. They obtain a
recovery rate of thirty-four percent on an issue-based computation (and forty-one percent on
an issuer-based one). These figures are biased downward as they do not include the Peru-
vian and Venezuelan cases. Second, Singh (2003) computes the recovery rate as the ratio of
post-restructuring prices on average post-default prices. The sample considers seven debt re-
structuring events for four sovereigns (Ukraine, Ecuador, Russia and Ivory Coast). The author
finds that the average debt work-out period is two years and the weighted average recovery
rate is one hundred and fifteen percent. This figure might still be biased downwards as bond
prices continued to rise after the two-year window. We have assumed a recovery rate of seventy
percent.


Appendix A3            Financial Data and Macroeconomic Factors

Returns We obtained the Fama-French factors and the 25 book-to-market portfolios for the
US from Kenneth French’s web site at http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/index.html.
The 6 CRSP Fama bond portfolios are downloadable from http://wrds.wharton.upenn.edu.


International Consumption Data The international consumption data (see Campbell
(1999)) were downloaded from John Campbell’s web site at http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/ camp-
bell/data.html. We have updated the data set using Datastream and IFS series along John
Campbell’s guidelines. We use per capita consumption deflated by that country’s CPI.


Real Per Household Consumption Growth We define real nondurable and services
consumption (NDS), as nondurable consumption deflated by the NIPA nondurable price index
plus services deflated by the NIPA services price index minus housing services deflated by the
NIPA housing services price index minus clothes and shoes deflated by the NIPA clothes and
shoes price index. The basis of all NIPA price deflators is 1996=100. They are not the same
as the corresponding CPI components from the BLS. Per household variables are obtained by
dividing by the number of households.

Appendix B                 Proofs
Linear factor Model If we take logs of equation (2) and we approximate around ρ = 1,
we obtain the following expression for the log of the stochastic discount factor:

(11)                       −mt ≈ −κ log β + b1 ∆ct + b2 ∆dt + b3 rw,t

where the factor loadings depend on the preference parameters as in equation (4). We can
back out the structural parameters from the factor loading estimates, as follows: σ = (1 −
b3 )/(b1 + b3 ), γ = b1 + b2 + b3 and α = b2 /b1 + b2 + (b3 − 1)/ρ.

   As is standard, the non-linear SDF can be approximated as a function of the log SDF m:

                                      Mt
                                            ' 1 + mt − E[mt ]
                                     E[Mt ]

¿From equation (11) , this implies that the SDF is linear in the factors.

                                  Mt
                             −          ' k + b1 ∆ct + b2 ∆dt + b3 rtw .
                                 E[Mt ]

                                                         Mt
More generally, if the SDF is linear in the factors: E[M    t]
                                                               = k + b0 ft , then the unconditional
Euler equation can be restated as follows: E[Ri,e ] = b0 Σf i where Σf i = E(ft − µf )(Re,i ). The
expected excess return is the factor loading times risk. The linear factor model can be stated
as a beta pricing model:
                                         E[Ri,e ] = λ0 βi

where λ = Σf f b is the factor risk premium and Σf f = E(ft − µf )(ft − µf )0 .
                                                                       e,i
    Similarly, starting from the conditional Euler equation Et [Mt+1 Rt+1  ] = 0, and approxi-
                                                   Mt+1            0
mating the SDF around its conditional mean: − Et [Mt+1 ] = kt−1 + b ft , the conditional excess
return on asset i can be stated as:

                                      e,i
                                               X                  e,i
                                                             k
                                 Et [Rt+1 ]=       bk covt (ft+1 Rt+1 ).
                                               k


Log Currency Risk Premium We assume that the pricing kernel and portfolio returns
are conditionally log-normal. Returns are priced using:

                                                   i
                                          Et mt+1 Rt+1 = 1.

Hence,
                                                     i
                                        log Et mt+1 Rt+1 = 0,


                                                   50
and, with log-normality

                         i
                                 ¡            i
                                                  ¢ 1     ¡            i
                                                                           ¢
            log Et mt+1 Rt+1 = Et log mt+1 + rt+1  + V art log mt+1 + rt+1   = 0.
                                                    2

This implies that the Euler equation can be restated as:

                          i       1£                    i
                                                            ¤       ¡        i
                                                                                 ¢
            Et mt+1 + Et rt+1 +     V art mt+1 + V art rt+1   + Covt mt+1 , rt+1   = 0.
                                  2

Let Rtf be the risk free rate between period t and t + 1, known at t, then rtf = − log Et mt+1 .
Since log Et mt+1 = Et mt+1 + 12 V art mt+1 and likewise for Rt+1
                                                              i , we get:


                                                     ¡            ¢
                                    i
                            log Et Rt+1 − rtf = −Covt mt+1 , rt+1
                                                              i
                                                                    .

We know that:
                                   i
                                  rt+1 = rti,£ + ∆eit+1 − ∆pt+1 ,

where eit is the exchange rate between the currency of country i and the dollar. The log
currency risk premium is then equal to:
                                       ¡             ¢
                  log(crpit+1 ) = −Covt mt+1 , ∆eit+1 + Covt (mt+1 , ∆pt+1 ) .


Complete markets If markets are complete, then the percentage change in the real ex-
                      i
change rate is ∆ log qt+1 = log mit+1 − log mt+1 . Substituting this in the expression for the log
currency risk premium,
                      ¡       ¢       ¡                                   ¢
                   log crpit+1 = −Covt log mt+1 , ∆ log eit+1 − ∆ log pt+1 ,
                        ¡                    ¢
and assuming that Covt log mt+1 , ∆ log pit+1 = 0, produces the following expression for the
log currency risk premium:
                       ¡       ¢       ¡                               ¢
                    log crpit+1 = −Covt log mt+1 , log mit+1 − log mt+1 .

This immediately delivers equation (9).
