Despite widespread awareness of the detrimental impact of CO2 pollution on the world
climate, countries vary widely in how they design and enforce environmental laws. Using
novel microdata about multinational firms’ CO2 emissions across countries, we document that
firms headquartered in countries with strict environmental policies perform their polluting
activities abroad in countries with relatively weaker policies. These effects are largely driven
by tightened environmental policies in home countries that incentivize firms to pollute
abroad rather than lenient foreign policies that attract those firms. Although firms
headquartered in countries with strict domestic environmental policies are more likely to export
pollution to foreign countries, they nevertheless emit less overall CO2 globally.

1        Introduction
         As signs of climate change accumulate, countries around the globe are taking action, yet
there is considerable variation in the strictness of the environmental policies implemented. 1
Diversity and lack of coordination in regulations across countries can lead to “carbon leakage,”
meaning that firms decide strategically where to locate their production based on existing
environmental policies.

         Given the heterogeneity in environmental policies across countries, the behavior of
multinational firms is especially important for two main reasons. First, the cost of shifting polluting
activities abroad for multinational firms is low relative to the cost that would be incurred by purely-
domestic firms, as they can utilize existing infrastructure. Second, multinational firms are an
important segment of the global economy; for example, cross-border investment by multinational
firms contributed 50% of GDP of OECD countries in 2017 (Navaretti and Venables, 2013; Shapiro
and Hanouna, 2019). 2 Despite their economic importance, little is known about the extent to which
multinational firms allocate polluting activities around the globe in response to environmental
policies. Understanding the symbiotic relationship between countries’ environmental policies and
the production decisions of multinational firms would help policymakers and governments
effectively address the emerging challenges from climate change.

         In this article, we study the impact of environmental policies on multinational firms’
polluting activities at home or in foreign countries in the 2010s. 3 We use firm-level data about

  For example, the European Commission announced in December 2019 a 30-year plan to transit toward a climate-
neutral economy by 2050, called the European Green Deal, and proposed to enact climate law. Other countries,
however, are maintaining laxer regulations and failing to meet lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions targets set forth
in the Paris Agreement of 2015, designed to collectively combat climate change (United Nations Environment, 2019).
Still others are considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement altogether. The U.S. government announced that
the country would pull out of the Paris Agreement, and in November 2019, it submitted formal notification of its
withdrawal to the United Nations. The Australian government resisted taking action to increase the 2030 target for
CO2 emissions even after catastrophic bushfires in early 2020.

  Other studies, such as Kim, Wan, Wang, and Yang (2019), explore the causal relation between changes in
environmental policies and firm response. Due to constraints related to tight identification, these studies tend to focus
on specific episodes and therefore have limited geographical and temporal scope.

their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in each country. 4 Together with information about the
country-level environmental regulations and enforcement, we assess the impact of home versus
foreign environmental policies on firms’ pollution allocations. Our findings indicate that the
allocation of pollution activities is primarily driven by the environmental policies in the home
country rather than by the opportunities available to pollute elsewhere. Our findings highlight the
importance of collective action to combat climate change given the global scale of firms’
operations.

        We use a novel panel dataset covering 1,970 large public firms headquartered in 48
countries and their CO2 emissions in 218 countries during the 2008–2015 period. The unique
feature of our dataset is that we can separately observe the CO2 emissions of each multinational
firm in each country in which it operates, providing direct evidence on the effect of environmental
policies and firms’ actual CO2 emissions at the micro-level.

        In the main analysis, we explore the location of pollution activities with respect to
countries’ environmental policies. Using a firm-year panel, we document that firms headquartered
in countries with stricter environmental policies emit less CO2 both domestically and globally
relative to firms headquartered in countries with more lenient environmental regulation. However,
we find evidence of carbon leakage from countries with strict environmental policies: Stricter
domestic environmental policies are associated with a greater share and greater amounts of
pollution abroad. The effects are economically large: A one-standard-deviation increase in the
strictness of environmental policies in the home country is associated with a 29% reduction of CO2
emissions at home, but it is also associated with up to a 43% increase in emissions abroad. These
results lend support to the concern that strict environmental policies may lead to carbon leakage.
While strict national environmental policies are effective in reducing global CO2 emissions to a
certain extent, they also create negative externalities, incentivizing firms to export their polluting
activities to other countries. Given the relative scale of foreign operations, however, our analysis
suggests that stringent domestic environmental policies still have a partial, but positive, impact on
reducing overall pollution. A one-standard-deviation increase in the strictness of environmental

  Although several greenhouse gases contribute to climate change, we focus on CO2, a byproduct of industrial
production that has the fastest concentration growth in the atmosphere. For further information, see
https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/CO2-and-global-warming-faq.html.

                                                     2
policies leads to about 14% lower global CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to a reduction of
441,000 tons of CO2 emission annually by an average multinational firm.

         Next, we explore the destination countries to which firms export their pollution.
Specifically, we examine whether the difference in policy strictness between the home and the
foreign country can predict whether and the extent to which such exporting takes place. Using a
firm-country-year panel, we test whether the relative strictness of environmental policies in the
home country versus the foreign country is correlated with more pollution abroad. Indeed, we find
that firms pollute more in a foreign country when the difference in the strictness in environmental
policies between the home and the foreign country is greater.

         The results thus far are consistent with the pollution haven hypothesis, suggesting the firms
perform their polluting activities in countries with lenient environmental policies. Prior studies
that examined this hypothesis were based on limited data, e.g., aggregated at the industry or
country levels, or lacked actual emissions data. 5

         Our data allow us to dive deeper into the drivers of carbon leakage. Specifically, a
combination of both push and pull forces can explain our baseline results of carbon leakage. The
push is in evidence when firms export their polluting operations to foreign countries in response
to tightened environmental regulations in their home countries. The motivation for this move is
purely economic because complying with stricter environmental policies is costly, requiring
investment in resources such as waste treatment, auditing, and litigation (see, e.g., Christainsen
and Haveman, 1981; Stewart, 1993). The pulling force is in action when countries deliberately
impose relatively weak environmental policies to attract the economic activity of polluting firms.
Such countries may benefit, at least in the short run, from the economic growth that additional
industrial production would likely bring through employment and investment.

         Our analysis shows that the main force dictating multinationals’ emission of CO2 abroad
is pressure from the home country’s environmental policies (push force). First, we test the “push


5
  Earlier studies used limited data aggregated at the industry- or country-levels (e.g., Eskeland and Harrison, 2003;
Cole, 2004; He, 2006; Wagner and Timmins, 2009). Related firm-level studies also provide indirect evidence, without
observing actual pollution levels, that firms are more likely to have facilities in countries with weak environmental
policies (Becker and Henderson, 2000, 2001; Ben Kheder and Zugravu, 2012; Dam and Scholtens, 2012). A few
recent studies use actual CO2 emissions data, but the scope of these studies is limited – within specific countries or
industries (e.g., Ederington, Levinson, and Minier, 2005; Bento, Freedman, and Lang, 2015; Bartram, Hou, and Kim,
2019).

                                                          3
hypothesis.” We use a specification that holds constant the environmental policies of foreign
countries to test whether changes in the environmental policies in the home country have an effect
(as in Khwaja and Mian, 2008). Indeed, we find evidence of such a “push effect”: Tightening the
home countries’ environmental policies pushes multinational firms out and incentivizes them to
pollute in foreign countries. Second, we reverse the specification and test the “pull hypothesis.”
We hold constant the home country environmental policies and test whether changes in the foreign
country environmental policies matter for pollution abroad. We find no evidence supporting the
pull hypothesis. In sum, multinational firms pollute abroad because of the tightening of policies in
the home countries, not because of pollution opportunities abroad.

         We also find that changes in environmental policies have asymmetric effects on firms’
polluting behavior. While the tightening of policies forces firms to shift polluting activities abroad
and to substitute with CO2 emissions through their supply chains (e.g., outsourcing), the relaxation
of environmental policies in the home country does not affect the allocation of CO2 emissions.
This finding suggests that tightening domestic environmental policies may create negative
externalities in the absence of global coordination in curbing multinational firms’ polluting
activities.

         In our final analyses, we exploit the cross-section of firms to examine the factors that
amplify firms’ incentives to pollute abroad in response to strict environmental policies at home.

         First, we consider firm-level governance. For firms that have strong governance, we find
that the positive effect of strict regulations on pollution is more pronounced. In other words, when
the home country sets strict environmental policies, well-governed firms produce fewer emissions
domestically and export fewer emissions to foreign countries. Importantly, this result could imply
that strong governance mechanisms guide managers to consider long-term value, providing a
counterweight that pushes the firm toward production with lower emissions (see Krueger, 2015,
as well as the Dupont case in Shapira and Zingales, 2017). 6



6
  The pressure to implement sustainable production techniques is generally associated with long-term investors who
value corporate responsibility practices (see, e.g., the survey regarding institutional investors’ perceptions of climate
risks in Krueger, Sautner, and Starks, 2020, and Bonnefon, Landier, Sastry, and Thesmar, 2019). Consistent with
institutional investors valuing firm environmental profiles, Kim, Wan, Wang, and Yang (2019) empirically document
that firms mostly held by investors with socially responsible investing (SRI) styles tend to adopt environment-friendly
corporate policies and eventually release fewer toxic chemicals.

                                                           4
          Second, we consider the variation of pollution by industry. Polluting activities vary widely
by industry, and therefore we conduct a cross-sectional analysis by industry type. We document
that firms’ behavior with respect to environmental policies is more accentuated in pollution-
intensive industries. The emissions in the home country of firms in these industries is less sensitive
to home environmental policies; however, their emissions abroad are twice as sensitive to home
policies, relative to firms in other industries. This finding is consistent with the idea that complying
with strict environmental policies is particularly costly for pollution-intensive industry firms.

          Overall, our study informs the debate among regulators as well as economists about the
effectiveness of environmental policies in reducing pollution and their economic consequences.
For regulators, our findings on multinational firms’ CO2 emissions patterns in response to the
stringency of countries’ environmental policies highlight the need for global coordination of
regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. We find that firms increase their pollution abroad in
response to the tightening of environmental policies in their home countries, as opposed to being
attracted by lax policies abroad. Thus, our results imply that without collective action,
multinational firms with production facilities around the globe may continue to benefit from
regulatory arbitrage opportunities by exporting pollution. At the same time, this study emphasizes
that local policies restricting pollution activities do have some effect on reducing global pollution
levels.



2         Data Description and Summary Statistics

2.1       CO2 Emissions Data

          Our main data source is a large database provided by CDP (formerly known as the Carbon
Disclosure Project) that contains firms’ self-reported survey responses about their national and
global CO2 emissions. CDP is a UK-based “not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure
system for investors, firms, cities, states, and regions to manage their environmental impacts”
(CDP, 2020). As of August 2020, more than 500 institutional investors with more than US$100
trillion in assets under management (AUM) were supporting CDP and its initiatives. Since CDP’s
inception in 2000, the number of institutional investors that have become signatories of CDP has
grown tremendously as has the AUM represented by those investors. CDP began by only surveying

UK-based FTSE firms but now obtains climate change and pollution information from firms
around the world.

       Our dataset consists of annual survey data from firms between 2008 and 2015. Over this
period, CDP increased its outreach from about 3,000 to more than 6,000 firms worldwide. CDP
sends its survey to the largest firms in the world, most of which have publicly-traded equity. The
questionnaires ask firms about their CO2 emissions, their various approaches to combatting climate
change, and the practices they use to manage potential risks stemming from climate change. In this
study, we focus on the questions that ask firms about the CO2 emissions that stem both directly
and indirectly from their operations. The answers to these questions allow us to directly measure
firm-level emissions and identify the countries where these emissions take place. Overall, the firms
in our sample emit CO2 in 218 different countries. We have pollution information on firms that
operate in multiple countries as well as firms that operate in a single country (about 11% of the
sample). We create a panel dataset containing annual CO2 emissions information for firms in each
country in which they operate.

       We have two main measures and one secondary measure of CO2 emissions. Scope 1
emissions are the total CO2 emissions (in metric tons) that stem directly from the operations of the
reporting firms. Scope 2 emissions are the total CO2 emissions (in metric tons) arising from the
production of the electricity the firm purchases to run its operations and over which it does not
have direct influence. The firm estimates this quantity based on a breakdown of the electricity
sources used in the respective country. Hence, Scope 2 measures emissions that take place
upstream in production lines. Another category of CO2 emission is Scope 3, which measures other
indirect emissions such as outsourced activities, business trips, and the production from suppliers
in the supply chain. Scope 3 emissions data provided by CDP covers a subset of firms during the
2009–2013 period and are only available at the aggregate level. While we cannot use this
information in our main analyses due to these data limitations, in Section 4.3 we use the Scope 3
data to shed light on the global substitution effect along supply chains.

       Note that our data are based on firms’ self-reported information. Specifically, CDP collects
data that firms voluntarily provide in response to a survey. Despite the self-reported nature of our
data, we believe that the emissions information is accurate and close to actual emissions for several
reasons. First, firms’ incentive to report their emissions comes from pressure from both


                                                 6
institutional investors and regulators who demand greater transparency about the environmental
impacts of their business and how climate change affects the long-run viability of the business.
Investors, especially long-term institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance
companies, seek to understand the long-run implications of tightening climate change and
environmental regulations resulting from the Paris Agreement on climate change, which was
agreed upon at the end of 2015 and subsequently has begun to be implemented by most signatory
countries. In addition, institutional investors are interested in learning about firms’ exposure to
climate change and environmental issues to identify business models that are at risk or less
resilient. The consequences of misreporting can be detrimental for multinational firms that rely on
institutional investment. Second, prior research shows that firms report emissions rates that are at
least as high in their sustainability reports (like CDP) as in their annual financial reports (Depoers,
Jeanjean, and Jérôme, 2016). Finally, a self-reporting bias is likely to attenuate results against
finding supporting evidence that firms in tightly regulated countries are more likely to export
pollution. Firms might under-report their emissions activity in foreign countries. If anything, our
results are likely to show a lower bound for the effect, because pollution reporting is voluntary and
the reporting firms may be less aggressive than non-reporters.

         To address the concern that self-reporting may affect our results, we repeat some of the
tests using a subset of firms that report audited data. Specifically, investors of some firms have
begun requiring their auditors to approve the statistics in the sustainability reports. We have
information on whether firms had their auditors verify the CO2 information and which reporting
standard they applied. 7 In Section 5.4, we use this fact to provide some assurance regarding the
quality of the data and hence the results. 8




7
  The CDP data contain information on how and to what extent the firms’ auditors or other third parties have verified
the reported carbon emissions. The dataset also contains information about what reporting standard or framework was
applied to verify the carbon emissions, such as, for example, ISO14064-3. Furthermore, companies usually disclose
in their annual reports or sustainability reports whether their reported information on carbon emissions has been
verified and, if so, by whom.
8
  When we restrict the sample to those observations for which the emissions information has been verified by external
parties such as the firms’ auditors, the main results are quantitatively similar to those obtained using the full sample.
We discuss these robustness tests and results in Section 5.4.

                                                           7
2.2      Country-Level Data: Environmental Laws, Enforcement, and Macroeconomic
Conditions

         We use an additional dataset compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF) that contains
information about the strictness of environmental laws and enforcement at the country-year level.
This dataset covers the 2008–2015 period and is publicly available on a bi-annual basis for 150
countries. 9 WEF assigns two rankings for each country on a scale from 1 to 7: (1) the stringency
of its environmental regulation (SER) and (2) how strictly these laws are enforced (EER), based
on surveys of top local business leaders. 10 The profile of the survey respondents increases the
validity of our results, because the WEF measure reflects scores as perceived by corporate leaders,
who eventually respond to this perception by determining the location of polluting activities. The
two environmental policy measures—stringency of environmental regulation and stringency of
enforcement—are highly correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.97).

         For our analysis, we combine the two policy measures into a single measure. We assume
that a country needs both components, laws and enforcement, to have a robust environmental
policy in place. Stated differently, an inherent interaction exists between these two dimensions:
Strict environmental laws must be enforced to make a difference. Because of the high correlation
of these variables, introducing both into the regression simultaneously induces severe
multicollinearity. To remedy this issue, we adopt three approaches. The first is to combine the two
                                                  1
scores into a single variable: 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 7 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 × 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 . We call this measure stringency and

enforcement of environmental regulation, or SEER, and its value ranges from 0.14 to 7. The other
two approaches involve examining the effect of each variable in isolation and orthogonalizing the
variables so that we can introduce both into the regressions. We implement these approaches as a
robustness test in Section 5.3. Overall, our results largely remain robust across the three methods.

competitiveness-report-2017.
10
   We use annual rankings from the WEF’s Executive Opinion Survey administered to more than 14,000 business
leaders worldwide. Two survey questions are relevant to our study: (1) How would you assess the stringency of your
country’s environmental regulations? and (2) How would you assess the enforcement of environmental regulations in
your country? Answers range from 1 (very lax) to 7 (among the world’s most rigorous). According to the WEF, its
survey “captures the opinions of business leaders around the world on a broad range of topics for which data sources
are scarce or, frequently, nonexistent on a global scale. It helps to capture aspects of a particular domain … that are
more qualitative than hard data can provide” (Schwab and Sala-i-Martin, 2016). The WEF survey measures are highly
correlated with policy-based indices such as the EBRD’s CLIMI index or the OECD’s EPS index (Botta and Koźluk,
2014) but have the advantage of being available for a large number of countries over time.

         To consider macroeconomic conditions of the countries in which firms operate, we collect
information on GDP and GDP per capita growth from the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators. We also estimate the industry-level comparative advantage in skilled labor and capital
of each country — CA(Skill) and CA(Capital), respectively — following Romalis (2004) and
Nunn (2007). 11 CA(Skill) is defined as hsHc, and CA(Capital) is defined as ksKc. Hc and Kc denote
endowment in skilled labor and capital in country c, respectively. hs and ks denote the skill and
capital intensities of production in the firm’s industry s. 12 Skill intensity hs is the ratio of
nonproduction worker wages to total wages in industry s in the United States, averaged across the
period 2008 to 2011. Capital intensity ks is the real capital stock in industry s divided by the value
added in industry s in the United States, averaged across the period 2008 to 2011. A country’s
skilled labor endowment Hc is measured as the natural log of the ratio of the population aged 25
or above that completed secondary education to those that did not complete secondary education. 13
A country’s capital endowment Kc is the natural log of the capital stock per worker, averaged
across the period 2008 to 2015. 14 We also collect country-pair proxies such as geographical
distance, common border, colonial history, and logged annual trade between the firm’s home
country and the country in which it emits CO2. These proxies come from Andrew Rose’s website
(see Glick and Rose, 2016) and the International Monetary Fund’s Direction of Trade Statistics.



2.3      Firm-level Financial Data

         We obtain firm-specific financial information, including total assets and foreign asset
share, from Worldscope. As our measure of the corporate governance quality of firms, we use the
corporate governance score provided in the Thomson Reuters Asset4 database (CGVSCORE). This
firm-year dataset is widely used in academic research as well as by long-term institutional
investors interested in environmental, social, and governance information. The governance score
ranges from 0 to 100 and measures as a percentage the quality of a firm’s governance systems and

11
   Skilled labor and capital endowment data are not available for all countries and factor intensities are only available
for manufacturing industries. Consequently, our sample size drops substantially.
12
   Data for factor intensities are obtained from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database available at
http://data.nber.org/nberces/, which contains annual data up to 2011.
13
   Data for skilled labor endowment Hc are obtained from the Barro-Lee Educational Attainment Dataset, available at
http://barrolee.com/. Data for 2010 are used as this is the only year that falls into our sample period.
14
    Data for capital endowment Kc are obtained from the Penn World Tables, available at
https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/.

                                                           9
processes, ranging from board structure and compensation arrangements to a firm’s treatment of
shareholder rights. A higher CGVSCORE value indicates better governance. All variable
definitions and sources can be found in Appendix Table 1.

        The final dataset that we construct is a three-dimensional panel of the firm-country-year
that contains the amount of CO2 emissions by each firm in each country in each year. Naturally,
most of our emissions observations have a value of zero because firms tend to have operations in
a limited set of countries. 15



2.4     Summary Statistics

2.4.1   Trends in Pollution and Environmental Policies

        Table 1 reports summary statistics over the sample period of 2008 to 2015, including the
number of unique firms, their global and home-country emissions, and the number of countries in
which each firm has emissions. For the average firm, global Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in
tons decrease over time. Note that the majority of emissions are direct Scope 1 emissions. One
caveat of interpreting the average firm-year emissions, however, is that these trends can be a result
of the expanding coverage of firms by CDP (see Section 3.3 for a discussion of time trends of
emissions). Most CO2 is emitted domestically, but the share of home emissions in global emissions
decreases substantially over time (from 72% in 2008 to about 57% in 2015 for Scope 1 emissions).
In addition, the number of countries where the average firm’s emissions take place increases from
6.0 (6.8) countries in 2008 to 9.0 (10.6) in 2015 for Scope 1 (Scope 2).

        As described earlier, our measure of environmental regulation is SEER, which is the
product of measures of the environmental strictness score (ranging from 1 to 7) and the
environmental enforcement score (ranging from 1 to 7), scaled by 7. Panel C of Table 1 indicates
that SEER slightly increases over time, both on average and at the median, with most of the
improvement occurring among the 50 countries that had the weakest environmental policies in
2008. The statistics suggest that environmental regulation has tightened over time, but the cross-
country variation is much starker than the time-series variation within a country. Furthermore, we

15
   Not all firms fully disaggregate their global emissions to the country level. We thus impose a minimum
disaggregation requirement and restrict our sample to firms that report at least 85% of their global emissions on a
country level.

                                                        10
observe that the distribution of environmental regulation is skewed, with most countries being
weakly regulated.

       Environmental regulation varies greatly around the globe. Figure 1 uses heat maps to show
country-level environmental regulation at the beginning and end of our sample period (2008 and
2015). The map shows a general improvement in environmental regulation over time; however, it
remains weak in several large regions, especially in developing countries in Africa, South
America, and Asia.

       As environmental regulations have, on average, tightened globally in recent years, it is
important to examine how polluting activities have evolved over time. To understand the trend of
the overall amount and allocation of CO2 emissions by multinational firms in our sample, we
estimate ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with time fixed effects, using the sample of firm-
year emissions observations. The dependent variables include the CO2 emissions variables. In
addition to year indicators, we include firm fixed effects in the regressions to address any potential
sample bias from the increase in coverage of firms by CDP. Thus, the coefficients of the year
dummy variables indicate the incremental changes in emissions over time (2008 as a baseline)
after controlling for any firm-level unobservable factors that might be correlated with being
included in the CDP dataset.

       In Figure 2, we plot the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of year indicators for
global, home, and foreign emissions, and the percentage of foreign emissions. In Panel A, we
observe a rise in global emissions in 2010; thereafter, global emissions remain relatively constant.
However, the percentage of foreign emissions increases over time. Panel B, which focuses on the
allocation of pollution between home and foreign countries, clearly confirms this pattern. We find
that firms continuously increased the percentage of pollution they export to foreign countries from
2008 to 2015 while moderately reducing pollution at home. These figures imply that global carbon
emissions by firms neither increased nor decreased substantially during the study period, but
carbon leakage became more prevalent.

2.4.2   Relationship between Environmental Regulation and CO2 Emissions

        Figure 3 presents a visualization of the relation between environmental regulation in the
firm’s home country (as measured by our proxy SEER) and firm-level emissions abroad. We plot
each country as a circle, the size of which represents the average home emissions by firms in that
country (in tons). The color of the circle indicates the stringency of environmental regulation
scores (SEER) in the home country, with the scale from red (the weakest regulation) to green (the
most stringent regulation). The y-axis shows the average percentage of emissions in foreign
countries. Two observations can be made. First, the size of the circles is much smaller in green
countries than in red countries, suggesting that strict regulations in home countries are negatively
associated with the amount of home emissions. Second, the slope of the dotted predictive line
implies that firms headquartered in strictly regulated countries produce a higher proportion of their
CO2 emissions abroad than domestically.



2.4.3   Firm-level Summary Statistics

        Table 2 presents summary statistics for our sample firms. It shows that, on average, firms
emit more in their home countries than abroad (1.85 million tons vs. 1.30 million tons for Scope 1
emissions and 0.37 million tons vs. 0.30 million tons for Scope 2 emissions). On average, 38.3%
(42.8%) of firms’ Scope 1 (Scope 2) emissions are emitted abroad. These ratios are slightly
higher—41.4% for Scope 1 and 44.8% for Scope 2—when we take the value-weighted average,
using the amount of global emissions as weights. The average SEER for a firm in our sample is
4.11; the average score for the strictness of environmental regulation is 5.43; and the average score
for the enforcement of environmental regulation is only 5.23. The firms covered in our sample are
mostly large multinational firms with an average of US$60.7 million in assets and a foreign asset
share of 26.4%. Panel B of Table 2 provides additional country-level statistics that we use in our
empirical analyses as control variables.

3        Empirical Design and Main Results

3.1      Polluting Domestically or Abroad?

         To test whether firms pollute more in countries with weak environmental policies, we
estimate the following equation:

                               𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

The following dependent variables measure the amount of pollution by firm i in year t: logged
global emissions of CO2, logged emissions in the home country, logged total emissions in all
foreign countries, and total foreign emissions as a percentage of global emissions. 16 Our main
variable of interest is SEER, the combined variable of environmental policy and enforcement
strictness in the firm’s home country (h) in year t. We include as control variables logged firm
assets, the share of foreign assets, and logged GDP in the home country. In addition, to capture
any industry-specific trends in emissions that might confound the changes in country-level
regulations targeting specific industries, we include industry-year (𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) fixed effects. Standard
errors are clustered by firm. 17

         The results are presented in Table 3. Panels A and B show evidence for Scope 1 and Scope
2 emissions, respectively. In Columns (1) and (2), we regress logged global emissions in tons on
SEER and the control variables. In Panel A, the coefficient on SEER is negative, indicating that
firms exposed to strict environmental policies in their home country pollute less globally. A one-
standard-deviation increase in SEER (0.90) is associated with a 14% decrease in global emissions
after controlling for firm size, home-country characteristics, and industry-year fixed effects. 18 The
results for Scope 2 emissions in Panel B are of similar magnitude. These effects are not only
statistically significant but also economically relevant: For the average firm that emits 3.15 million
tons of global Scope 1 CO2 each year, a 14% reduction amounts to 441,000 fewer tons of CO2
emitted each year.

         The results are robust to different regression specifications. In the regressions presented in
Column (2) of Panels A and B of Table 3, we also control for a firm’s share of assets that are

16
   We add one to all emissions variables before logging them.
17
   As an alternative specification, we also include country fixed effects in the equation, which brings weakly significant
coefficients for foreign emissions (results are available upon request). Given that the time-series variation in SEER
within a country is small, our main results can be interpreted as the impact of cross-country differences in SEER.
18
   %∆y = 100 * (eβ*∆x – 1) = 100 * (e-0.17 * 0.9 – 1) = –14.19%.

                                                                13
located abroad. We include this independent variable, which is mainly driven by factors other than
environmental regulation, to control for the higher likelihood of foreign emissions when the firm
has more assets located abroad for reasons other than environmental regulation, such as labor costs
or closeness to customers. Due to the limited availability of the foreign asset share variable, the
number of observations in the regressions slightly drops. Our previously documented results
remain unchanged, and we find that a firm’s share of foreign assets does not influence its global
emission levels in either direction.

        Overall, these results do not support the commonly held view that an individual country
with strict environmental policies can have little impact on global pollution levels. Instead, we
document that firms headquartered in highly regulated countries pollute less globally, potentially
due to the environmental standards imposed by the home country.

        We next test whether the strictness of home-country regulations is related to the geographic
allocation of pollution activities. We explore the emissions in logged tons of CO2 at home versus
abroad in Columns (3)–(4) and (5)–(6), respectively, of Table 3. Because some firms have zero
emissions in their home countries, we use a Tobit model for this specification. 19 Here, the effect
is larger: A one-standard-deviation increase in SEER is associated with up to a 29% decrease in
                         20
emissions at home.            By contrast, a one-standard-deviation increase in the strictness of
environmental policies at home is associated with up to a 43% increase in emissions abroad. 21 As
for Scope 2 emissions, Panel B shows that a one-standard-deviation increase in SEER is correlated
with a 54% decrease in home emissions and a 45% increase in foreign emissions. 22 For both Scope
1 and Scope 2 emissions at home, we find that a higher foreign asset share significantly reduces a
firm’s emissions at home; however, this effect does not cancel out the influence of countrywide
environmental legislation and enforcement. Our results can be interpreted in the context of Walker
(2011), who shows that stricter environmental regulation in the U.S. in the form of the Clean Air
Act led to plant-level downsizings and ultimately lower sector-level employment. Lower




19
   Because the fraction of observations that is censored is relatively low in our sample, we re-estimate all Tobit
regressions in Tables 3 to 5 and Appendix Tables 3 and 4 as OLS. The results remain similar in the alternative
specification, and they can be provided upon request.
20
   From Column (3): 100 * (e-0.38 * 0.9 – 1) = –29.0%.
21
   From Column (5): 100 * (e0.40 * 0.9 – 1) = 43.3%.
22
   For Column (3): 100 * (e-0.48 * 0.9 – 1) = –54.0%; for Column (5): 100 * (e0.41 * 0.9 – 1) = 44.6%.

                                                       14
production at home rather than investment in green technology might thus be responsible for at
least part of the reduced home-country emissions.

           In Columns (7) to (8), we reaffirm the previous findings by documenting the relation
between environmental regulation and foreign emissions as a percentage share of total global
emissions. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation increase in the strictness of domestic
environmental policies is associated with a 4.0% greater share of foreign emissions. 23 The result
for Scope 2, in Panel B, shows a larger corresponding effect of 6.6%. 24 As foreign Scope 1 (Scope
2) emissions amount to 38.3% (42.8%) of total global emissions for the average firm in our sample,
these effects are substantial and economically meaningful.

           Overall, the findings in Table 3 show that firms headquartered in countries with stricter
environmental policies emit less CO2 globally. However, with stricter environmental regulation,
the CO2 emissions at home are significantly lower but foreign emission levels (in absolute and
relative terms) are significantly higher. These results imply that while strict environmental policies
incentivize firms to allocate polluting activities to countries with weaker environmental policies,
we find that country-level environmental regulations are related to lower global pollution levels.



3.2        Where Do Firms Emit CO2?

           We next examine where firms pollute. The analysis in this section explores whether
multinational firms pollute in foreign countries that have weaker or stronger environmental
policies than those in their home country. To investigate this issue, we construct a firm-country-
year panel and estimate the amount of CO2 emissions by a firm in a specific country each year. In
contrast to the previous specification, which focused on the environmental policies in the home
country, the disaggregated model allows us to determine how the difference between home and
foreign environmental policies is related to the location of emissions. Specifically, we test whether
a firm’s tendency to transfer polluting activity to a foreign country increases with the difference
between domestic environmental policies and those abroad.




23
     4.46% * 0.9 = 4.0%.
24
     7.35% * 0.9 = 6.6%.

                                                  15
           Figure 4 provides an intuitive visualization of our approach using a firm-target country pair
analysis. We focus on the emissions of firm i in foreign country c in year t, and only include the
observations for which the SEER scores in the home and foreign country are known. In addition,
we drop observations of firms with zero emissions in foreign country c in year t to avoid any
potential bias in calculating means from zero-emission observations. The variable of interest is the
difference between the SEER of firm i’s home country and the SEER in foreign country c. On the
x-axis, the left bars represent observations with stronger environmental regulations abroad; the
middle bars represent observations with similar environmental regulations at home and abroad;
and the right bars represent observations with stronger environmental regulations at home. The y-
axis shows tons of CO2 emissions per GDP of the foreign country, which is averaged across all
firm-country-year observations. The figure shows that pollution abroad increases monotonically
with the gap in the stringency of environmental policies. In other words, firms emit in foreign
countries where the gap in environmental regulation is most favorable to them.

           To implement the analyses with the firm-country-year panel in a regression setting, we use
the following procedure. We create a firm-country-year combination matrix that has a cell for each
firm i corresponding to each of the 149 foreign target countries c in year t as long as firm i reports
non-zero global CO2 emissions in a given year t. 25 In each cell, we record the pollution of the firm
in the country during the specific year. Importantly, we also have a cell with a value of zero for
firm-country-years in which no activity was recorded. In fact, about 95% of our dataset has zero
activity. We drop all cells related to the firm’s activity in its home country because our intention
is to study the choice of foreign countries to target for pollution.

           Using the firm-country-year panel data, we estimate the following equation:

              𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 − 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 ) + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃ℎ + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

where the dependent variable includes the level and proportion of foreign emissions by firm i in
country c in year t. Our variable of interest is the difference between SEERhome and SEERforeign,
the environmental policy scores for the home country (h) and the foreign country (c) in year t. The
higher the value of SEERhome – SEERforeign, the stronger the regulation at home is relative to the
foreign country.


25
     Our analysis is limited to the 150 countries for which environmental policy scores (SEER) are available.

                                                                      16
           Table 4 shows the results of the regressions using the firm-target country-year panel. In
each model, we regress either the logged CO2 emissions (in tons) or the percentage of global
emissions the firm emits in the foreign country on the difference in SEER scores between the home
and the foreign country. As before, we control for logged firm assets and the share of foreign assets.
In addition, we control for the foreign country’s GDP and country-pair variables that reflect the
following relations between the home and the foreign country: logged geographic distance (in
kilometers), whether the countries share a common border, whether the countries share a colonial
history, and the logged trade volume between the two countries (in US$ bn). We also include
industry-year (𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ), foreign-country (𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐 ), and home-country (𝜃𝜃ℎ ) fixed effects.

           In all regressions in Table 4, the coefficients for SEERhome – SEERforeign are positive and
significant. These results indicate that foreign emissions are higher in countries where
environmental regulation is weaker than in the firm’s home country. The effects are sizable: A
one-standard-deviation (1.52) increase in the relative strictness of the environmental policies at
home compared to abroad is associated with up to an 84% increase in emissions in the respective
                        26
foreign country.             This finding suggests that firms export pollution to countries where
environmental regulation is relatively weaker. As the home and foreign country fixed effects
capture the time-invariant unobservable factors of each country, the significance of the difference
in SEER implies that allocation of polluting activities is a function of the differentials in the
stringency of environmental policies between two countries. In other word, the results from the
granular panel data at the firm-country-year level provide direct evidence of carbon leakage by
multinational firms.

           The other control variables have the expected signs: Emissions are higher for larger, more
international firms and when countries are geographically closer, trade more with each other, or
share a colonial history. The higher percentage of production occurs in foreign countries, the higher
its foreign emissions. These results make intuitive sense considering that emissions are the direct
result of a firm’s production or operations.

4      Economic Mechanisms

       Our baseline results in Section 3 show that firms headquartered in countries with strict
environmental policies reduce overall CO2 emissions, but they shift polluting activities to foreign
countries, specifically those with relatively more lenient regulations relative to their home
countries. In this section, we investigate the economic drivers of this finding. First, we examine
whether a push (stricter policies in home countries) or a pull (more lenient policies in foreign
countries) is the main driver behind multinational firms’ pollution behavior. Second, we explore
whether tightening or relaxing environmental policies has symmetric effects. Lastly, we consider
the possibility that firms facing strict regulations pass polluting activities along supply chains.



4.1 Pushed Away by Strict Domestic Policies or Attracted by Lenient Foreign Policies?

       Our main finding that multinationals tend to export pollution when environmental policies
are strict in the home country can be explained by two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. First,
strict domestic policies can push away firms to pollute abroad. Facing tightened domestic policies,
firms have a stronger incentive to export their polluting operations, because reducing emissions
might be costly and can require investment in resources (the “push” force). Second, countries with
more lenient environmental policies may “attract” pollution from firms headquartered in countries
with relatively stricter environmental policies. In this case, even without any changes in domestic
regulations, firms can be attracted by looser foreign policies and shift their polluting operations
abroad (the “pull” force).

       Our firm–target country–year panel dataset allows us to tease out these two forces. To
assess whether multinational firms are pushed away from tighter policies in their home countries
or are attracted by more lenient policies in foreign countries, we implement the following
specifications:

                  𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛾𝛾1 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃ℎ + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖      (𝐴𝐴)

              𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛿𝛿1 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 + 𝛿𝛿2 𝐶𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 + 𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃ℎ𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (𝐵𝐵),

where the dependent variable is the level or the proportion of foreign emissions. In equation (A),
we include foreign country–year fixed effects (𝜋𝜋𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) to control for time-varying foreign country
conditions. Thus, in this specification, we compare firms located in different home countries and

                                                                  18
examine whether they are polluting more within the same foreign country, depending on the
strictness of environmental policies in their home country. If the stricter domestic policy drives
firms to export pollution (the push hypothesis), holding fixed the foreign-country conditions, we
expect that 𝛾𝛾1 > 0. In equation (B), we examine the opposite force by including home country–
year fixed effects (𝜃𝜃ℎ𝑡𝑡 ). We examine the effect of the strictness of foreign environmental policy
on attracting firms, comparing the behavior of all multinational firms within the same home
country–year. If the looser foreign regulations are the main driver of firms’ foreign emissions (the
pull hypothesis), we expect that 𝛿𝛿1 < 0.

         Table 5 reports the results. We find that in Panel A, the coefficients on SEERhome are
positive and significant, but in Panel B, those on SEERforeign are not statistically different from zero.
The economic interpretation is that domestic countries that strengthen environmental policies push
out multinational firms to emit CO2 abroad. However, we find no evidence that countries that
loosen environmental policies attract multinational firms to pollute in their countries. These
findings highlight the importance of global regulatory coordination, given that many countries
have been tightening domestic environmental policies. While our results in Table 4 generally
support the pollution haven hypothesis, the findings in Table 5 suggest that firms are pushed abroad,
as opposed to being pulled there.



4.2      Asymmetric Effects of Changes in Environmental Policies

         We next explore whether the tightening or weakening of environmental policies has a
symmetric impact. We design the following test to estimate the sensitivities of CO2 emissions to
changes in domestic environmental policies, separately for the years when regulations were
tightened and for those when they were loosened:

      𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜌𝜌1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜌𝜌2 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃ℎ + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

We estimate this equation using a firm-year panel. 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 is defined as
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(0, ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 ) and 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 as 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡, 0), where ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 is the change in
the environmental regulation index of the firm’s home country in year t (SEERt), relative to the
index of the country in the first year of the sample period (SEER0). The estimation includes
industry ( 𝜎𝜎𝑠𝑠 ) and country ( 𝜃𝜃ℎ ) fixed effects to capture the impact of yearly changes in


                                                                   19
environmental policies within a country. If the strictness of environmental regulation has a
symmetric effect regardless of the direction of the changes (i.e., either ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 > 0 (tightening)
or ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 < 0 (weakening)), we expect that 𝜌𝜌1 = 𝜌𝜌2 . In contrast, if 𝜌𝜌1 ≠ 𝜌𝜌2 , the effect is
asymmetrical.

         Table 6 reports the results. We find that the effect of SEER on firms’ foreign emissions is
indeed asymmetric. In Columns (3) and (7), the coefficients on Tightening SEER are statically
significant, but the coefficients on Weakening SEER are either statistically insignificant or take the
opposite sign. These results suggest that tightening environmental policies at home drives firms to
shift polluting activities to foreign countries, but that relaxing environmental policies does not
have the opposite impact of increasing home emissions and decreasing foreign emissions. The
economic magnitude of SEER on foreign emissions is sizable given that most countries tightened
environmental policies (68% country-year observations), rather than loosening them, during our
sample period.



4.3      Outsourcing Pollution: Substitution along the Supply Chain

         Although our results on overall emissions are consistent with firms strategically moving
polluting activities abroad and reducing home emissions, we cannot perfectly rule out other
possibilities. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions only capture the direct CO2 emissions from firms’
manufacturing and production activities and its purchased electricity. Thus, our interpretation of
the impact of regulation on overall pollution levels should come with a caveat because it is possible
that firms under tight regulations might externalize polluting activities along supply chains.

         We consider the substitution effect along supply chains in response to strict domestic
environmental policies. We collect Scope 3 emission information, which is only reported at the
firm level, for a subset of firms during the period of 2009–2013. 27 Despite the limited availability,

27
  As of 2012, CDP asks firms to disclose the following standard sources for Scope 3 emissions: business travel,
purchased goods and services, waste generated in operations, capital goods, downstream transportation and
distribution, employee commuting, fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2), downstream
leased assets, end-of-life treatment of sold products, franchises, investments, other (downstream), other (upstream),
processing of sold products, upstream leased assets, upstream transportation and distribution, use of sold products,
purchased goods & services, upstream transportation & distribution, and fuel- and energy-related activities (not
included in Scopes 1 or 2). Before 2012, firms were free to define their own Scope 3 categories. While our main
dataset covers the global, home, and foreign Scope 1 and 2 emissions of 1,970 firms from 48 countries, only 816 firms
from 30 countries report global Scope 3 emissions.

                                                         20
the Scope 3 emissions data allow us to estimate broader impacts of environmental policies on other
related firms along the supply chains. We estimate the equation introduced in Section 4.2 using
data on global Scope 3 emissions. The results are reported in Column (9) of Table 6.

         We find that overall Scope 3 emissions increase when environmental policies tighten.
However, we do not find the equivalent symmetric effect when firms face loosening regulations.
The substituting effect of delegating polluting activities through supply chains is sizable: A one-
standard-deviation increase in ∆SEER (0.22) is associated with a 22.7% increase in Scope 3 global
emissions. 28 This result implies that as environmental policies tighten, multinational firms are
more disposed to substitute pollution in their own local activities (Scope 1) with pollution of
upstream or downstream firms (Scope 3).



5        Additional Results

         In this section, we explore the heterogeneity in multinational firms’ behavior in regard to
exporting pollution. We consider two cross-sectional differences: firm governance structure and
industry characteristics. We further corroborate our findings by conducting robustness tests on the
environmental policy measures and control variables and by addressing the concern of self-
reporting bias.



5.1      Role of Corporate Governance

         Corporate governance could potentially affect how firms respond to a country’s
environmental policies. Managers of well-governed firms look after the interests of their investors.
Traditionally, such interests have been confined to their financial interests; therefore, firms with
good corporate governance are expected to minimize costs. 29 As such, if governance is related to
the maximization of profits and complying with strict home environmental regulation is costly, we
would expect firms with good corporate governance to be more likely to shift emissions to foreign
countries when home environmental policies are strict.

   From Column (9): 100 * (e0.93 * 0.22 – 1) = 22.7%
29
   In recent years, a growing number of institutional investors are also interested in returns that go over and above
financial returns, that is, firms should not only look after their financial stakeholders but also other material stakeholder
groups that are crucial for the long-term business success of the company.

                                                             21
       To explore the role of corporate governance in moderating the correlation between the
degree of CO2 emissions and environmental policies, we interact SEER with I(Strong governance),
a dummy variable indicating good corporate governance practices. I(Strong governance), based
on the CGVSCORE from the Asset4 dataset, receives a value of one for a score that is above the
annual in-sample median. The CGVSCORE takes into account more than 250 individual
governance aspects of the firm in the areas of board structure, compensation policy, board
functions, shareholder rights, and strategy. As reported in Panel A of Table 2, the average corporate
governance score in our sample is 65.1% and the median is 76.5%.

       The corporate governance analysis is presented in Table 7. The regression results show that
firms with above-median corporate governance scores are more sensitive to home environmental
policies; that is, they emit less in their home country when environmental policies are strict
(Column (2)). The results in both Panel A and B indicate that whereas poorly governed firms have
higher foreign emissions when home environmental policies are strict, well-governed firms do not
emit more Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions abroad (the interaction cancels out the main effect; see
the F-test in Column (3)). Well-governed firms thus reduce emissions at home while keeping
foreign emissions unchanged. This leads to an overall higher percentage share of foreign emissions
(the interaction adds to the main effect; F-test for Column (4)), but this effect is mechanical,
meaning that it is driven by reduced home emissions but not by increased foreign emissions.

       There could be multiple non-mutually exclusive explanations for these effects. First,
managers in well-governed firms may have a genuine interest in sacrificing short-term gains for
long-term benefits to the firm and its stakeholders (see Shapira and Zingales, 2017, for a case study
of pollution by DuPont). Second, well-governed firms may attract investors who care about
corporate social responsibility and advocate for such investments. In other words, good corporate
governance could be a proxy for a strong shareholder base that pushes an agenda of corporate
social responsibility.

       Our finding is consistent with recent papers documenting that firms’ compliance with
environmental standards is positively recognized by shareholders. For example, Dowell, Hart, and
Yeung (2000) find that firms that comply with strict environmental regulations by global standards
have higher Tobin’s Q ratios than those that only adopt local standards. Chava (2014) documents
that firms that emit substantial amounts of hazardous and toxic chemicals pay a higher cost of


                                                 22
equity and debt capital than those without such environmental concerns. 30 Our result of the prudent
polluting behaviors of well-governed firms suggests that strong firm-level governance can mitigate
negative externalities associated with strict national regulations.



5.2      Pollution-intensive Industries

         We next examine whether firms adjust their behavior with respect to home-country
environmental policy differently across industries. We are interested in the pollution-intensive
industries that account for most emissions. The underlying hypothesis in this section is that firms
in pollution-intensive industries are more likely to shift their emissions abroad rather than try to
minimize them in the home country.

         We define I(Pollution intensive) as a dummy for firms in industries with high pollution
intensity. We base our indicator on the definition used by the European Union (EU), which
measures the kilograms of CO2 emitted in generating one euro of gross value added. The industry-
year table provided by the EU is presented in Panel A of Appendix Table 2, and Figure 5 shows
the industry averages in graphical form. The chart clearly shows three groups of polluting
industries. The top two industries—electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply, and
manufacturers of coke and refined petroleum products—emit around 6 kilograms of CO2 per one
euro of gross value added. The next four industries—air transport, water transport, manufacture of
other nonmetallic mineral products, and manufacture of basic metals—emit between 3 and 4
kilograms of CO2 per one euro of gross value added. All other industries emit less than 2 kilograms
of CO2 per one euro of gross value added. Based on these figures, we define pollution-intensive
firms as those in the top six polluting industries.

         Panel B of Appendix Table 2 presents summary statistics for firms classified as in
pollution-intensive industries and the rest of firms. 31 Only 6.5% of all firm-years for which we
have matched industry information are classified as pollution-intensive, yet the total emissions of


30
   Given this evidence that environmental policies can affect firm value, several recent studies have attempted to
identify determinants of firms’ polluting behaviors. For example, financial constraints are known to exacerbate firms’
incentives to pollute (Bartram, Hou, and Kim, 2019; Levine, Lin, Wang, and Xie, 2018; Kim and Xu, 2020; Shive and
Forster, 2020). Our paper adds to this strand of the literature by providing evidence on the importance of operating
locations in understanding firms’ polluting incentives.
31
   We lost some firm-year observations in a subset of the sample that we could not map into the NACE industry codes.

                                                         23
Scope 1 CO2 emissions by this small fraction of firms is as large as the total emissions by the rest
of the sample (93.5%). 32

          With this definition of pollution-intensive industries, we test whether their sensitivity to
environmental policy strictness is different from that of firms in other industries. The industry
analysis is presented in Table 8. Panel A focuses on Scope 1 emissions. The regressions in
Columns (1) and (2) show that firms in pollution-intensive industries are not sensitive to
environmental policies in regard to their global emissions or home emissions (F-test is not
statistically significant). In contrast, Column (3) shows that in regard to emissions in foreign
countries, these firms are twice as sensitive to home environmental policies. Hence, when domestic
environmental policies are strict, firms in pollution-intensive industries emit significantly more in
foreign countries. Panel B presents the corresponding results for Scope 2 emissions. While the
results are similar, they are not identical. Columns (1) and (2) show that firms in pollution-
intensive industries are sensitive to home environmental policies to a lesser degree than firms in
non-pollution-intensive industries. Columns (3) and (4) show analogous results to those in the
corresponding columns of Panel A: Firms in pollution-intensive industries have nearly twice the
sensitivity to home environmental policies when it comes to polluting in foreign countries.

          These results have important implications for policymakers because firms in pollution-
intensive industries emit materially greater amounts of CO2. Thus, environmental policies that
target these industries may be more effective in reducing total emissions. At the same time, our
results show that firms in these industries are polluting significantly more in foreign countries
when their home country has more stringent policies. This effect potentially indicates that the cost
of reducing emissions in these industries is high, causing firms to transfer polluting activities
abroad.



5.3       The Influence of Stringency and Enforcement of Environmental Regulation

          Our measure of a country’s environmental regulation rests on both stringency and
enforcement. Thus, we also investigate each of these factors separately to determine whether our
findings are driven by either the stringency or the enforcement of environmental regulation at

32
  Firms in pollution-intensive industries are responsible for 52% of global Scope 1 CO2 pollution. We reach this
conclusion by summing the tonnage of CO2 emissions across all firm-years in both parts of the sample.

                                                      24
home, or by both. In Appendix Table 3, we address this issue and separate SEER into its two
components: SER (stringency of environmental regulation) and EER (enforcement of
environmental regulation). In Panels A and B, we investigate the individual effects of SER and
EER on firms’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions levels, respectively. Our results show that
individually, both the stringency of environmental regulation and the enforcement of this
regulation significantly affect emissions levels in the same ways. The results are in line with our
main findings reported in Table 3: Firms in countries with more stringent and more strongly
enforced environmental regulations emit less in total, less at home, but more abroad. The
individual effects of SER and EER are economically meaningful: A one-standard-deviation
increase in SER (0.56) is associated with up to a 30% decrease in emissions at home and up to a
37% increase in emissions abroad. 33 Similarly, a one-standard-deviation increase in EER (0.68) is
associated with up to a 34% decrease in emissions at home and up to a 40% increase in emissions
abroad. 34

         In Panels C and D of Appendix Table 3, we go one step further and investigate the
simultaneous effects of SER and EER on emissions levels. To do so, we orthogonalize EER in our
regression specifications. The results show that although the stringency of environmental
regulations, SER, negatively affects overall and home emissions levels, it positively affects the
absolute and relative foreign emissions levels. These results are consistent with our previously
documented findings. Similarly, the enforcement of environmental regulation, EER, significantly
affects home and foreign emissions levels above and beyond SER, with the exception of foreign
Scope 2 emissions, which just miss the 10% significance level (Column (3) in Panel D). This
finding implies that the enforcement and stringency of environmental regulations are
complementary in shaping a firm’s pollution behavior.

5.4      Addressing Potential Self-Reporting Bias

         The underlying information from CDP on emissions is self-reported by firms. This fact
raises concerns that our data could have a self-reporting bias. To address this possibility, we
conduct a subsample analysis similar to our main analysis in Table 3. This time, however, we only
include in our sample firms whose CO2 emissions are externally verified by the firms’ auditors.
This analysis enables us to rule out the potential effects of a self-reporting bias on our findings.
The drawback of this subsample is that it reduces the sample size by about 40%.

         The findings of this subsample analysis are presented in Appendix Table 4. The results are
generally consistent with our main results in Table 3: SEER has a negative effect on global and
home emissions levels and a positive relation with foreign emissions (both absolute and relative).
This observation implies that among firms whose reported emissions are externally verified,
stricter environmental regulations in the home market lead to lower emissions at home but to
higher emissions abroad. The economic effects are similar to those reported in Table 3. For firms
with externally verified emissions, a one-standard-deviation (0.90) increase in the strictness of
environmental policies is associated with up to a 31% smaller share of home emissions 35 and up
to a 32% greater share of foreign emissions. 36



5.5      Controlling for Comparative Advantage

         In Tables 3 and 4, we control for country, industry, and firm characteristics, including the
firm’s foreign asset share as a broad proxy for the firms’ foreign operations. Nevertheless, we
might be missing a major consideration in the firm’s strategic decision to operate — and thus
consequently to pollute — abroad or at home: the comparative advantage a firm has when
operating in different countries. If comparative advantage in pollution is correlated with the




35

31.5%.
36
   From Column (3) in Panel A: 100 * (e0.26 * 0.9 – 1) = 26.4%; from Column (3) in Panel B: 100 * (e0.31 * 0.9 – 1) =
32.2%.

                                                           26
classical advantages in factors of production such as skilled labor and capital, then our SEER
coefficients might incorrectly reflect this classical comparative advantage.

           To isolate the sheer comparative advantage in CO2 emissions, we additionally control for
the classical comparative advantage variables following Romalis (2004) and Nunn (2007). 37
Doing so reduces the sample size substantially because skilled labor and capital endowment data
are not available for all countries in our sample and factor intensities are only available for
manufacturing industries.

           Results are reported in Appendix Tables 5 and 6 for our firm-year level and firm-country-
year level emissions, respectively. In general, our results are robust to the inclusion of comparative
advantage control variables. However, in Appendix Table 5 not all coefficients of SEERhome are
significant. To determine whether this reduced significance is due to the inclusion of the
comparative advantage controls or the reduced sample size, we re-estimate Appendix Table 5 for
the same, smaller samples but without including the comparative advantage controls. We again
find some insignificant coefficients for SEERhome, indicating that the reduced sample size is
responsible for the loss in significance and not the addition of the comparative advantage
variables. 38




6          Conclusion

           Pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases is an undesired externality of
manufacturing activity that contributes significantly to the changing climate around the world.
This externality is costly to avoid. As a result, firms are likely to find ways to circumvent costly
CO2 pollution abatement requirements. One strategy for firms operating in multiple locations could
be to transfer manufacturing activities that produce CO2 to countries where environmental
regulations are less stringently defined and enforced than in the firm’s home market, a concept
known as carbon leakage.

           Our study sheds light on this argument using a novel dataset comprising firm-level CO2
emissions data. We find a strong pattern that firms indeed locate their CO2 emitting activities in

                                                          27
countries where environmental regulation is less developed and less stringently enforced: Scope 1
and Scope 2 CO2 emissions levels are significantly higher abroad when environmental regulation
in the home market is more stringent than abroad. These results hold in a standard firm-level
framework as well as in a disaggregated firm-country-level context. More specifically, we find
that firms emit less at home when headquartered in countries with stricter regulations. These firms,
however, pollute more abroad, typically in countries with weaker regulations.

       The combination of push and pull factors can explain our main finding that firms perform
their production activities in countries with looser environmental regulation relative to their home
country. Our results suggest that tightening environmental policies in home countries, not the laxer
policies in foreign countries, incentivize multinational firms to shift polluting activities abroad. In
addition, we document that tightening domestic environmental regulations has a strong impact on
firm behavior related to pollution transfer, while relaxing them does not have the opposite impact
to the same degree. This result underscores the possibility that, without global coordination,
strengthening domestic environmental policies could create an unintended negative externality,
pushing firms to pollute elsewhere.

       On the positive side, the higher foreign emissions levels do not completely outweigh the
reduction at home. Thus, individual countries can make a difference. However, our findings overall
highlight the need for collective action to bring down global emission levels further. The 2015
Paris Agreement on climate change was an important step toward achieving this goal. If no
coordinated effort is undertaken to address climate change, major stakeholders, such as large firms,
will find ways to at least partially circumvent strict environmental regulations in certain parts of
the world and move their production activities elsewhere. Our results further suggest that
policymakers might be most effective if they focus on curbing the ability of pollution-intensive
industries to export pollution to countries with laxer environmental regulations.

       For multinational firms with production facilities around the globe, our results imply that—
depending on how quickly and effectively countries implement the Paris Agreement and the
European Green Deal—they may continue to benefit from the regulatory arbitrage opportunities
we document or they should be prepared to invest in pollution-abatement methods and techniques.
Whether these international agreements will harmonize national environmental regulation enough




                                                  28
that firms will no longer have an option to locate operations purely based on concerns about the
strictness of environmental regulation in a particular country remains to be seen.

Table 1. Summary Statistics
The table shows descriptive statistics on the Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions and environmental regulation proxies by
year from 2008 to 2015. Statistics are based on the sample of all firms that report at least 85% of their global emissions
on a country level and that are headquartered in countries with environmental regulation data. Overall, 1,813 firms
from 48 different home countries report Scope 1 emissions, and 1,863 firms from 47 different home countries report
Scope 2 emissions. Our proxy for environmental regulation (SEER) combines the World Economic Forum’s
assessment of a country’s stringency and enforcement of environmental regulation. The proxy ranges from 0.14 to 7,
with higher values indicating stricter environmental regulation.

Table 3. Analysis of Firm-Level Emissions: Effect of Domestic Environmental Policies
The table presents evidence about the relation between global, home, and foreign emissions and home-country environmental policies. Panels A and B show results
for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, respectively. The regressions are conducted on a firm-year panel. Columns (1) and (2) are estimated with ordinary least squares in
which the dependent variable is ln(1+Global emissions). Columns (3)–(8) are estimated using a Tobit model. The dependent variable is ln(1+Home emissions) in
Columns (3) and (4), ln(1+Foreign emissions) in Columns (5) and (6), and Foreign emissions in % of global emissions in Columns (7) and (8). SEER is our proxy
for stringency and enforcement of environmental regulation in the firm’s home country, with higher values indicating stricter regulation. All regressions include
industry-year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by firm. The definitions of all variables are provided in Appendix Table 1. For each independent variable,
the top row shows the estimated coefficient and the bottom row shows the t-statistic. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 4. Analysis of Firm-Country-Level Emissions: Effect of Environmental Policy Gaps
The table shows the effect of environmental regulation gaps between home and foreign countries on the firms’
emissions in a specific country. We estimate Tobit regressions in which the dependent variable is ln(1+Foreign
emissions) in Columns (1) and (3) and Foreign emissions in % of global emissions in Columns (2) and (4). Columns
(1) and (2) show the results for Scope 1 emissions, and Columns (3) and (4) show the results for Scope 2 emissions.
SEERhome – SEERforeign is our proxy for stringency and enforcement of environmental regulation in the home minus
the foreign country, with higher values indicating stricter regulation at home. All regressions include industry-year,
home country, and foreign country fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by country-pair. The definitions of all
variables are provided in Appendix Table 1. For each independent variable, the top row shows the estimated coefficient
and the bottom row shows the t-statistic. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level,
respectively.

Table 5. Home versus Foreign Environmental Policies
The table shows the effect of environmental regulations in home and foreign countries separately on the firms’
emissions in a specific country, using a firm-country-year panel. We estimate Tobit regressions in which the dependent
variable is ln(1+Foreign emissions) in Columns (1) and (3) and Foreign emissions in % of global emissions in
Columns (2) and (4). Columns (1)–(2) and (3)–(4) show the results for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, respectively. Controls
include ln(Assets), Foreign asset share, ln(Geographic distance), Common border, Common colonial history, and
ln(Trade). In Panel A, the main independent variable is SEERhome, the environmental policy of home country, and the
regressions include industry-year, foreign country-year, and home country fixed effects. In Panel B, the main
independent variable is SEERforeign, the environmental policy of foreign country, and the regressions include industry-
year, foreign country, and home country-year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by country-pair. Robust t-
statistics are shown in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 6. Asymmetric Effects of Environmental Policies
The table shows the effect of the changes in home-country environmental regulations on the firms’ foreign emissions using a firm-year panel. Columns (1) to (4)
show results for Scope 1 emissions, Columns (5) to (8) for Scope 2 emissions, and Column (9) for Scope 3 emissions. Columns (1), (5), and (9) are estimated with
ordinary least squares, and Columns (2)–(4) and (6)–(8) are estimated using a Tobit model. Standard errors are clustered by firm. Tightening SEER is defined as
Max(0, ∆SEERt) and Weakening SEER as Min(∆SEERt, 0), where ∆SEERt is the change in the environmental regulation index in the firm’s home country in year
t (SEERt), relative to the index of each country in the first year covered during the sample period (SEER0). All regressions include industry and home country fixed
effects. Standard errors are clustered by firm. For each independent variable, the top row shows the estimated coefficient and the bottom row shows the t-statistic.
***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 7. Environmental Regulation and Firms’ Corporate Governance
The table shows the role of firms’ corporate governance modulating the relationship between the domestic
environmental policy and firms’ emissions. Panels A and B show results for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, respectively.
Results are estimated using ordinary least squares (Column (1)) and Tobit (Columns (2)–(4)) regressions with standard
errors clustered by firm. Controls include ln(Assets), Foreign asset share, ln(GDP), GDP per capita growth, and
I(Strong Governance). All regressions include industry-year fixed effects. For each independent variable, the top row
shows the estimated coefficient and the bottom row shows the t-statistic. The F-test assesses the joint significance of
the coefficients of SEER and SEER×I(Strong governance). ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and

Table 8. Environmental Regulation and Pollution-Intensive Industries
The table shows the relationship between the domestic environmental policy and firms’ emissions by industry. Panels
A and B show results for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, respectively. Results are estimated from ordinary least squares
(Column (1)) and Tobit (Columns (2)–(4)) regressions with standard errors clustered by firm. Controls include
ln(Assets), Foreign asset share, ln(GDP), and GDP per capita growth. All regressions include industry-year fixed
effects. For each independent variable, the top row shows the estimated coefficient and the bottom row shows the t-
statistic. The F-test assesses the joint significance of the coefficients of SEER and SEER×I(Pollution intensive). ***,
**, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table 2. Pollution-Intensive Industries
The table presents summary statistics about the pollution intensity of industries and firms in pollution-intensive versus
non-pollution-intensive industries. Panel A shows the CO2 intensity of various industries in the European Union (2018
member states). CO2 intensity is measured as the kilograms of CO2 per euro of gross value added. For comparability
over time, gross value added is measured in real terms (chain linked volumes at 2010 prices) to eliminate the effects
of inflation. Pollution-intensive industries are marked with an asterisk and bold face. Source: Eurostat, Air emission
accounts, Air emissions intensities by NACE Rev. 2 activity (env_ac_aeint_r2):

Appendix Table 3. SER versus EER
The table presents evidence about the relation between emissions in foreign countries and home-country stringency
and enforcement (SER and EER) of environmental policies. Panels A and C show Scope 1 emissions, and Panels B
and D show Scope 2 emissions. Columns (1) and (2) are estimated with ordinary least squares, and Columns (3) to (8)
are estimated as Tobit models. All regressions include ln(Assets), Foreign asset share, ln(GDP), GDP per capita
growth, and industry-year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by firm. For each independent variable, the top
row shows the estimated coefficient and the bottom row shows the t-statistic. ***, **, and * indicate significance at
the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table 4. Subsample Analysis: Only Externally Audited Emission Data
The table presents evidence about the relation between emissions in foreign countries and home-country
environmental policies for firms whose emissions information is externally verified. Panels A and B show results for
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, respectively. Column (1) is estimated with ordinary least squares, and Columns (2) to (4)
are estimated as Tobit models. SEER is our proxy for stringency and enforcement of environmental regulation in the
firm’s home country, with higher values indicating stricter regulation. All regressions include ln(Assets), Foreign asset
share, ln(GDP), GDP per capita growth, and industry-year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by firm. For
each independent variable, the top row shows the estimated coefficient and the bottom row shows the t-statistic. ***,
**, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table 5. Firm-Level Emissions: Controlling for Comparative Advantage
The table replicates Table 3 and adds control variables for the comparative advantage of the home country. Panels A and B show results for Scope 1 and 2 emissions,
respectively. Columns (1) and (2) are estimated with ordinary least squares, and Columns (3) to (8) are estimated as Tobit models. SEER is our proxy for stringency
and enforcement of environmental regulation in the firm’s home country, with higher values indicating stricter regulation. CA(Skill) and CA(Capital) are our
additional controls for comparative advantage in skilled labor and capital of the firm’s industry in the home country, respectively. All regressions include industry-
year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by firm. For each independent variable, the top row shows the estimated coefficient and the bottom row shows the
t-statistic. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Appendix Table 6. Firm-Country-Level Emissions: Controlling for Comparative Advantage
The table replicates Table 4 and adds control variables for the comparative advantage of the home and foreign
countries. Panels A and B show results for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, respectively. Regressions are estimated as Tobit
regressions. SEERhome – SEERforeign is our proxy for stringency and enforcement of environmental regulation in the
home minus the foreign country, with higher values indicating stricter regulation at home. CA(Skill) and CA(Capital)
are our additional controls for comparative advantage in skilled labor and capital, respectively of the firm’s industry
in the home or foreign country. All regressions include home country and foreign country fixed effects. Standard
errors clustered by country-pair. For each independent variable, the top row shows the estimated coefficient and the
bottom row shows the t-statistic. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Figure 1. Global Development of Environmental Regulation
The heat maps show our proxy for environmental regulation (SEER) for the 150 countries included in our sample as
of 2008 in Panel A and 2015 in Panel B. SEER combines the World Economic Forum’s assessment of a country’s
stringency and enforcement of environmental regulation. SEER ranges from 0.14 to 7, with lower values, colored red,
indicating laxer environmental regulation and higher values, colored green, indicating stricter environmental
regulation.

Figure 2. Evolution of Pollution Over Time 2008–2015
This figure shows the annual changes in CO2 emissions by firms in our sample over the period of 2008–2015. The
sample includes the firm-country-year observations for which SEER in the home and foreign country is known. We
plot the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the year dummy variables from the ordinary least squares
regressions, where the dependent variable is ln(1+Global emissions) and foreign emissions as a percentage of global
emissions in Panel A and ln(1+Home emissions) and ln(1+Foreign emissions) in Panel B. All regressions include
firm fixed effects. The dependent variables are based on Scope 1 emissions. The coefficients of the year dummy
variables indicate the incremental changes in pollution activities over time (2008 as a baseline).

Figure 3. Visualization of the Home and Foreign Emissions with Respect to Cross-Country
Environmental Regulation
The figure visualizes the relation between country-level environmental regulation and CO2 emissions by
multinational firms. We plot each country as a circle, with the size indicating the average home emissions amount
(in tons) by multinational firms headquartered in that country. The color of the circle represents the score of
environmental regulation of each country, measured as SEER, a country’s stringency and enforcement of
environmental regulation. SEER ranges from 0.14 to 7, with red being lower values indicating laxer environmental
regulation and green being higher values indicating stricter environmental regulation. The average percentage of
CO2 emissions in foreign countries out of global emissions by the multinational firms headquartered in each
country are shown on the y-axis. All numbers are averaged by firms over the 2008–2015 period.

Figure 4. Differences in Environmental Regulation and Emissions in Foreign Countries
The figure presents the differences in environmental regulation and emissions in foreign countries. The sample
includes the firm-country-year observations for which SEER in the home and foreign country is known. We exclude
the observations with zero emissions. We split the firm-country pairs into three categories based on the difference in
environmental regulation in the home versus foreign country. The left, middle, right bar panels on the x-axis represent
country pairs with stronger (SEERhome – SEERforeign< –1), similar (-1≤SEERhome – SEERforeign< 1), and weaker
(SEERhome – SEERforeign≥ 1) regulation abroad relative to the home country. The y-axis shows average tons of CO2
emissions to a target foreign country by the multinational firms headquartered in the home country per million USD
of the foreign country’s GDP.

Figure 5. Pollution Intensity by Industry
This chart shows the CO2 intensity of various industries in the European Union (2018 member states). CO2 intensity
is measured as the kilograms of CO2 per euro of gross value added. For comparability over time, gross value added is
measured in real terms (chain linked volumes at 2010 prices) to eliminate the effects of inflation. Pollution-intensive
industries are marked with striped red bars. Source: Eurostat, Air emission accounts, Air emissions intensities by
