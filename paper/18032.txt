                                             ABSTRACT

It has long been recognized that business cycle comovement is greater between countries that trade
intensively with one another. Surprisingly, no one has previously examined the relationship between
trade intensity and comovement of shocks to the trend level of output. Contrary to the result for cyclical
fluctuations, we find that comovement of shocks to trend levels of real GDP is significantly weaker
among countries that trade intensively with one another. We also ˝find that the influence of trade on
comovement between shocks to trends has remained stable, or become stronger in recent decades,
while the role of trade in generating cyclical comovement has diminished steadily over time. In short,
we find that international trade relationships have a substantial impact on comovement of shocks to
output trends across countries, and these effects stand in stark contrast to the conventional wisdom
regarding cyclical comovement.

1        Introduction

      It has long been recognized that business cycle comovement is greater between countries
that trade more with one another. Frankel and Rose (1998) first demonstrated stronger
correlations between business cycle fluctuations in real GDP for trading partners. A large
ensuing literature has demonstrated that this result is robust to the inclusion of a battery of
additional explanatory variables, country-pair effects, and is also present for intra-industry
and infra-national trade.1
      Unlike the empirical relationship, the theoretical relationship between output comove-
ment and trade is ambiguous. A positive shock in one country can generate increased
demand for foreign goods, so that the foreign country also experiences an increase in output
(i.e., the demand channel). On the other hand, the positive shock in one country may cause
production to be reallocated away from foreign suppliers, so that foreign production declines.
Also, if countries supply goods and services to international markets by specializing in their
own comparative advantaged industries, then shocks to specific sectors may be less correlated
among strong trading partners (i.e., supply channels). For business cycle fluctuations, the
evidence to date suggests that the demand channel dominates such that trade strengthens
comovement patterns.
      Surprisingly, no one has previously examined the relationship between trade intensity
and comovement of shocks to countries’ trend levels of output. This omission is important,
as changes in GDP trends are potentially driven by different types of shocks than are busi-
ness cycle fluctuations. The propagation of these shocks across national borders, and the
relationship of this propagation to trade linkages, may also differ. In particular, the effect
of trade on the long-run distribution of suppliers across countries and sectors (the supply
channels) may be more important when explaining cross-country correlations in shocks to
GDP trends. Thus, the sole focus of the existing literature on business cycle fluctuations may

give an incomplete picture of the relationship between trade intensity and the comovement
of output across countries.
    Contrary to the result for cyclical fluctuations, we find that the correlation between shocks
to GDP trends is significantly weaker among G7 countries that trade intensively with one
another.2 The negative association between trade and trend comovement is quantitatively
important. A one-standard deviation increase in trade intensity between countries reduces
the correlation in shocks to their output trend by approximately one-third of a standard
deviation. We also find that the influence of international trade on comovement in shocks
to the trend has remained stable, or become stronger in recent decades, while the role of
trade in generating cyclical comovement has diminished steadily over time. Finally, we find
that the effect of trade on trend comovement is significant only for G7 country pairs. This is
consistent with the results for cyclical comovement in Kose et al. (2003) and Calderon et al.
(2007) who provide evidence that the effect of trade on cyclical comovement is much weaker
among lower income trade partners. In short, we find that international trade relationships
have a substantial impact on comovement between countries’ shocks to output trends, and
the direction of these effects stand in stark contrast to the conventional wisdom regarding
the effect of trade on cyclical comovement.
    Beyond the implications for the relevance of demand or supply mechanisms for the trans-
mission of shocks across countries, our results are also important as they speak to a quantita-
tively significant source of output fluctuations. In particular, the evidence shows that shocks
to output trends contribute substantially to the variance of quarterly real GDP growth. For
the majority of countries in our sample, shocks to the trend account for over half the overall
variation in quarterly real GDP growth over time, and the observed comovement patterns
for trends are persistent over each decade in our sample.3 Thus, the capacity of trade to
2
  As with cyclical comovement, the average correlation in trend fluctuations across all country-pairs is positive,
  with very few country-pairs experiencing negative correlations across the entire sample. Thus the negative
  impact of trade on the correlation between GDP trend fluctuations indicates a movement in correlations
  toward zero. Trade is associated with weaker comovement, rather than stronger negative correlations.
3
  On the other hand, Doyle and Faust (2005) demonstrate that cyclical comovement patterns among G7
  nations have become weaker in recent decades.

decouple trend fluctuations across countries is of important policy relevance.
    The specifics of our data and estimation methodology are as follows. We gather quar-
terly real GDP and bilateral trade flow data for 21 developed countries for the years 1980
to 2010 from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics and Direction of Trade Statistics.
The set of countries in our data set is similar to that used in previous comovement stud-
ies, so that differences in results for trends and cycles cannot be attributed to selection.4
To obtain a measure of the trend and business cycle component of real GDP we use an
unobserved-components model, which has been used extensively in the literature as a tool
for trend and business cycle measurement.5 The unobserved-components model identifies
trend vs. business cycle fluctuations by assuming the trend represents the accumulation of
the permanent effects of shocks to the level of real GDP, which is equivalent to the stochastic
trend in real GDP. The business cycle component is the deviation of real GDP from this
stochastic trend, and represents transitory fluctuations in the series. A key advantage of the
unobserved-components approach for our purposes is its explicit characterization of both
trend and cyclical components, each of which is needed for our empirical analysis. Other
popular approaches for measuring business cycle variation, such as the band-pass filter of
Baxter and King (1999) or first differencing, do not provide an explicit definition or measure
of the trend component.
    Our key dependent variable is the correlation between changes in the trend component of
quarterly real GDP for each country pair. Bilateral trade intensity is measured as the total
real valued trade flows between countries, divided by the sum of their real GDP levels. We
take several steps to ensure that the comovement patterns we describe are due to interna-
tional trade relationships, and not other underlying factors. To avoid issues associated with
4
  Our sample produces the same stylized fact that trade exhibits a positive effect on cyclical comovement as
  found in previous studies.

  Examples of macroeconomic detrending using the unobserved-components framework include Harvey
  (1985), Watson (1986), Clark (1987), Harvey and Jaeger (1993), Kuttner (1994), Kim and Nelson (1999),
  Kim and Piger (2002) and Sinclair (2009). Also, as shown in Morley et al. (2003), the unobserved-
  components decomposition is consistent with the identification of trend and cyclical components explicit in
  the Beveridge and Nelson (1981) decomposition. For a recent example of measurement of macroeconomic
  trends using the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition, see Cogley and Sargent (2005).

potential trends in trade volumes between country-pairs over time, we calculate decade spe-
cific correlations for each country-pair, and control for decade fixed effects when estimating
the effects of trade intensity. Country pairs may differ in their exposure to common shocks,
as well as their incentives to trade with one another. Thus, we further include country-
pair fixed effects when estimating the relationship between trade intensity and comovement.
The substantial literature on cyclical comovement suggests other factors, such as patterns of
industry specialization or membership in a currency union, that may contribute to comove-
ment in output levels. Our empirical strategy incorporates these alternative channels which
could potentially mitigate the consequences of international trade.6 The key result regarding
weaker trend comovement among trading partners is robust to the inclusion of these other
potential determinants of comovement patterns.
       The next section describes our methodology for estimating trend and cyclical fluctuations
for the GDP series of each country, the calculation of comovement across country-pairs, and
the details of our empirical specification linking comovement to trade intensity. Section 3
describes our data sources and variable construction. Section 4 presents the results for the
effects of trade on comovement patterns. The final section concludes.



2        Empirical Strategy

       Our analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we separate changes in the real GDP series for
each country into trend and business cycle components, and calculate cross-country correla-
tions for the fluctuations in both of these components. Second, we relate these correlations
to trade intensity between country-pairs. This section provides details about each step of

6
    Imbs (2004) and Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) argue that specialization patterns in output across countries
    independently affect comovement patterns. Baxter and Kouparitsas (2005) evaluate the robustness of
    other country-pair specific features in generating cyclical comovement and find strong support for the
    inclusion gravity variables (e.g., geography), which partially determine trade flows. Our use of country-
    pair fixed effects subsumes these gravity variables. There is also evidence that investment linkages impact
    comovement; see Prasad et al. (2007). Blonigen and Piger (2011) demonstrate that the best predictors
    of foreign direct investment patterns between countries are those suggested by gravity models. Thus our
    fixed-effects strategies also captures the motives for nations to invest in one another.

our empirical strategy.


2.1     Estimating Trends and Cycles in Real GDP

    The trend and business cycle components of real GDP are not directly observed. A
large existing literature provides several alternative definitions of trend vs. business cycle
fluctuations, and corresponding methods to identify these defined components. Here, we
define and identify trend vs. business cycle components in real GDP using an unobserved-
components (UC) model. The UC model has a long history in macroeconometrics as a tool
for business cycle measurement.7 In the UC framework, log real GDP for country i in period
t, denoted yi,t , is additively divided into trend (τi,t ) and cyclical (ci,t ) components:


                                             yi,t = τi,t + ci,t .                                       (1)


The UC framework then specifies explicit equations for the trend and cyclical components.
The trend component is specified as a random walk process, while the cyclical component
follows a covariance stationary autoregressive (AR) process:




                                        τi,t = µi + τi,t−1 + vi,t ,                                     (2)

                                             φi (L) ci,t = i,t ,                                       (3)



where φi (L) is a pth order lag polynomial with all roots outside the complex unit circle,
                                                    
vi,t ∼ i.i.d. N 0, σv2i , and i,t ∼ i.i.d. N 0, σ2i . Following the bulk of the existing literature
on business cycle measurement with UC models, we make the assumption of independence
between trend and cyclical shocks, such that σvi ,i = 0.8 The model in (1) – (3) is estimated

  Early examples of macroeconomic detrending using the UC framework include Harvey (1985), Watson

via maximum likelihood, and estimates of the unobserved trend and cycle components con-
structed using the Kalman Filter.
       The UC model identifies trend vs. business cycle fluctuations by assuming the trend
represents the accumulation of the permanent effects of shocks to the level of real GDP.
In other words, the trend in real GDP is equivalent to its stochastic trend. The business
cycle component is then the deviation of real GDP from this stochastic trend, and represents
transitory fluctuations in the series. This identification strategy is consistent with a wide
range of macroeconomic models in which business cycle variation represents temporary fluc-
tuations in real GDP away from trend. As shown in Morley et al. (2003), the UC approach
to detrending is also equivalent to the well-known Beveridge and Nelson (1981) decomposi-
tion, which measures the business cycle from the forecastable variation in real GDP growth.9
Rotemberg and Woodford (1996) argue that this forecastable variation makes up the essence
of what it means for a macroeconomic variable to be “cyclical.”
       The existing literature investigating the relationship between trade intensity and business
cycle comovement has taken multiple approaches to measure the business cycle component
of real GDP, including deterministic detrending (linear or quadratic), the band-pass filters
of Hodrick and Prescott (1997) and Baxter and King (1999), and first differencing. For our
purposes, deterministic detrending is unsatisfactory, as we are interested in studying correla-
tions between stochastic shocks to trend real GDP. Under the assumption of a deterministic
trend, such stochastic shocks do not exist.
       When real GDP contains a unit root, band-pass filters and first differencing will both
produce a measure of the cyclical component that is partially influenced by shocks to the
stochastic trend. For example, suppose that real GDP is generated by a stochastic process
similar to equations (1) – (3). Then the first difference of real GDP and the business cycle
component produced by a band-pass filter will be influenced by both the permanent and

9
    Specifically, Morley et al. (2003) show that given the same reduced form time-series model used to represent
    real GDP, the UC-based decomposition gives the same estimates of trend and cycle as the Beveridge-Nelson
    decomposition.


                                                        7
transitory shocks, vt and t . To the extent one believes that permanent shifts to real GDP
appropriately belong in the trend of real GDP, this is problematic. As an example of this,
Cogley and Nason (1995) and Murray (2003) demonstrate that if real GDP is itself a random
walk, bandpass filters will generate a cyclical component.10 As will be seen in Section 4 below,
this seemingly extreme example is relevant for the real GDP series of a number of countries
in our sample, for which the trend dominates the variance of real GDP growth.
     Another advantage of the UC approach for our purposes is its explicit representation
of trend vs. cyclical components, estimates for both of which are required in our analysis.
This makes interpretation of the components straightforward, and aids in the construction
of variance decompositions designed to separate the sources of fluctuations in international
real GDP growth. Such explicit characterizations of both trend and cycle are not always
available from other popular filters. For example, the Baxter-King filter, while providing a
clear definition and measure of the cyclical component, does not provide an explicit definition
of the trend component.
     The model for the trend component in (2) implies a constant average growth rate of µ for
the trend component of real GDP. To relax this restriction, for each country we also estimate
a version of the model in which equation 2 is replaced with:


                                   τi,t = µi,0 + µi,1 Di,t + τi,t−1 + vi,t ,                               (4)

where Di,t is a dummy variable that is zero prior to the break date ki , and one thereafter.
This break date is estimated along with the other parameters of the model via maximum
likelihood.11 We then report results based on the UC model with either equation (2) or (4)
by choosing that model that minimizes the Schwarz Information Criterion.




10
   In the literature, this phenomenon is often, and not without controversy, referred to as a “spurious cycle.”
   See, e.g., Pedersen (2001) and Cogley (2001).
11
   We assume that the break date does not occur in the initial or terminal 20% of the sample period.


                                                      8
2.2    Variable Construction

   For each country-pair in our sample, we require the correlation between trend fluctuations
and the correlation between cyclical fluctuations for those countries. Measured across all the
country-pairs, these correlations then make up the cross section for two different dependent
variables used in our analysis. To create a time-series dimension to our sample, we measure
correlations separately by decade. The correlation between cyclical fluctuations in countries
i and j in decade d is given by:


                                    ρcijd = corrd (b
                                                   ci,t , b
                                                          cj,t ) ,                         (5)


where corrd (·) indicates the sample correlation coefficient measured using data in decade
d, and b
       ci,t and b
                cj,t represent the Kalman filtered estimates of the business cycle component
for countries i and j respectively. For trend fluctuations, the level of the trend component
contains a unit root by assumption, and second moments of this level are thus infinite.
To study the correlation between trend fluctuations, we consider the correlation between
first differences of the trend component. Given the random walk assumption for the trend
component in (2), this is equivalent to considering the correlation between the permanent
shocks to real GDP in the two countries:


                                    ρτijd = corrd (b
                                                   vi,t , vbj,t ) ,                        (6)


where vbi,t and vbj,t represent the Kalman filtered estimates of the shocks to the trend compo-
nent for countries i and j.
   Our goal is to relate comovement patterns to the strength of trade relationships across
countries. As with previous studies of cyclical comovement we weight trade flows between
countries by their respective GDP levels. The variable, T radeijd , measures trade between
countries i and j during decade d, and is calculated by



                                                  9
                                                                     
                                                   1 X Xijt + Mijt
                                     T radeijd   =                      ,                                    (7)
                                                   Td t∈d   Yit + Yjt

where Td is the total number of quarterly time periods observed in each decade d, Xijt + Mijt
is real valued exports plus imports between countries i and j expressed in $US, and Yit and Yjt
are real GDP for countries i and j expressed in $US. Thus this measure has the interpretation
of the amount of trade between countries i and j, relative to the total economic size of these
two countries.12
       Our choice of decades as the time-series unit of observation is driven by several factors.
First, a longer time span provides a more precise estimate of the comovement relationship
between any given country-pair. In addition, as shown by Leibovici and Waugh (2012) among
others, international trade flows are strongly procyclical. Differences in bilateral trade flows
over shorter time spans than a decade are more likely to reflect these cyclical fluctuations,
rather that capturing the role of trade relationships in determining comovement patterns.
Finally, the choice of decade matches the earlier literature; see for example Frankel and Rose
(1998), Calderon et al. (2007) and Kose et al. (2003).
       Section 3 below will describe the sources of the data necessary to compute our correlation
and trade intensity variables. Here we present figures displaying averages of these variables
across trading partners computed over time. In Figure 1 we plot the decade-average corre-
lation between trend fluctuations in real GDP where the ten year period rolls forward on
an annual basis. Trend comovement patterns are stable within the 1980s and the 1990s.
However when the measured correlations begin to include years after 2000 (i.e., correlations
calculated beginning in 1991) we see a slight increase in average comovement. Furthermore,
when the time span begins to include periods after 2008, during the latest global recession,
we see a sharp spike in average comovement patterns. Figure 2 plots 10-year averages in
12
     Several previous studies have employed measures of trade intensity identical to equation (7) except that
     nominal values of trade and GDP are used instead of real values. Such a measure only has an interpretation
     as a real measure of trade intensity when the proper deflator for the trade terms and each of the GDP
     terms are identical. If this is not true, and there is no reason to believe that it would be, then the trade
     intensity measure constructed using nominal data will be affected by various relative price level changes.

trade intensity on a rolling basis, and shows that trade intensity has also been rising on aver-
age. Finally, Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that both average trend correlations and average
trade intensity are higher for G7 country-pairs than for country-pairs involving a non-G7
country.


2.3        Estimating Comovement across Trading Partners

      To estimate the differences in comovement patterns across country-pairs with varying
trade relationships we estimate the following regression equation:


                            ρkijd = α + βT radeijd + ΓXijd + ηij + δd + ξijd                         (8)


where k = c, τ . As described in more detail in Section 3 below, our sample consists of 21
countries measured over the time period 1980-2010, which produces a panel dataset of 210
unique trading partners across 3 decades (1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2010.) Although our
primary interest is in the correlations between permanent shocks, we also estimate (8) for
comovement in transitory (cyclical) shocks to verify that our sample is consistent with the
patterns highlighted previously in the literature.13
      The variable δd is a decade specific fixed effect. Doyle and Faust (2005) estimated struc-
tural breaks in comovement statistics among G7 nations and found that cyclical comovement
became weaker over the period 1960-2002, while the results presented in Figure 1 demon-
strate that average trend correlations have become stronger since the late 1990s. Similarly,
improvements in communication and transportation technologies have allowed trade to grow
steadily over the sample period, as is shown in Figure 2. Decade specific fixed effects thus
protect us from estimating a spurious regression in the trade-comovement relationship. We

mate how the role of trade in generating comovement has changed over time.
       Trade patterns are clearly related to the innate characteristics of each country-pair. For
example the gravity model predicts that exogenous differences in geography and distance will
cause bilateral trade patterns to vary.14 The importance of gravity variables in generating
comovement in countries GDP series is emphasized by Baxter and Kouparitsas (2005). There
is also evidence that financial linkages may promote output comovement between countries;
see Prasad et al. (2007), among others. Blonigen and Piger (2011) demonstrate that gravity
variables are among the most robust predictors of foreign investment activities between
countries. The term ηij is a country-pair fixed effect included when we estimate (8) to
account for the varying incentives for countries to trade and invest with one another, and
any other fixed exposure to shocks in output between countries.
       Previous studies have demonstrated that the impact of trade linkages on business cycle
comovement varies across levels of industrial development. Kose et al. (2008) provide evi-
dence that cyclical comovement relationships among G7 members differ systematically from
non-G7 nations. Table 1 also makes it clear that average comovement varies across countries
with different income levels (see also Figure 1), as does average trade intensity (see also
Figure 2.) Furthermore, our results in Table 2 demonstrate that there is substantial hetero-
geneity across G7 vs. non-G7 countries in the proportion of the total variance of real GDP
that is attributable to trend fluctuations. Concerning the estimation of the impact of trade
on comovement, Calderon et al. (2007) provide evidence that the effect of trade on cyclical
fluctuations is much different among developing countries than for high income nations, and
Kose et al. (2003) demonstrate specifically the importance of estimating the effect of trade
separately for G7 and non-G7 nations. To account for differences in comovement patterns
across national income levels, and differences in the effect of trade, we estimate equation (8)
separately for members and non-members of the G7.
       The vector Xijd incorporates several control variables suggested previously in the comove-

     patterns.

ment literature. Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) show that comovement patterns are systemati-
cally related to patterns of industry specialization. To account for similarity in specialization
patterns, Imbs (2004) suggests controlling for the combined income levels, as well as differ-
ences in income, between country-pairs.15 Baxter and Kouparitsas (2005) perform a general
robustness analysis of the determinants of comovment across countries. They argue that
in addition to gravity variables, membership in a currency union is a strong predictor of
correlations in output fluctuations across countries. We include an indicator variable, CUijd ,
that equals one if country-pair ij belongs to a currency union during period d.



3      Data

     GDP data come from the International Financial Statistics, made available by the IMF.
For 21 countries, we observe quarterly output from 1980:Q1 to 2010:Q4.16 A high frequency
of observation is important for accurately measuring both variation in the business cycle and
the trend, as some business cycle episodes last only a few quarters. Also, there is substantial
evidence in the existing literature that trend fluctuations account for a significant portion
of relatively high frequency fluctuations in real GDP growth.17 We will present evidence
consistent with this result for our sample of countries below. Previous studies have estimated
comovement patterns for a longer time series, but generally have relied on annual data that
subsume transitory fluctuations lasting only a few quarters. With quarterly data we have
observations from 124 time periods for each country, and by restricting ourselves to the post-
1980 period are able to include a relatively large number of countries from different regions



15
   We note that our inclusion of relative income levels between countries does not conform exactly to the spec-
   ification in Imbs (2004). He estimated a static model in a simultaneous equations framework, whereas here
   we exploit time series variation in the sample. Thus the role of national incomes across our specifications
   differs somewhat.
16
   The countries in our sample are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
   Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
   United Kingdom and United States.

of the world and at different stages of development.18 The set of countries in our sample also
corresponds to those studied in previous analyses of comovement, limiting the potential for
sample selection to generate any differences in our results for trend vs. cyclical comovement.
     Information about bilateral trade flows come from the Direction of Trade Statistics. We
observe total imports and exports between country-pairs. Trade flows are expressed in nomi-
nal US dollars, which we deflate directly as described in section 2 above. In several instances
export values do not correspond precisely to import values reported by the destination coun-
try. Our results are insensitive to which country’s reported value of trade is used for any
given country-pair. Table 1 presents the summary statistics for the trade measures across
time periods and across the samples of countries with and without G7 membership.19



4      Results

4.1     Trend & Cycle Components of Real GDP

     Table 2 reports results regarding the estimated trend and cyclical components of real GDP
across countries. The second column gives the estimate of µi , which has the interpretation of
the average quarterly growth rate of the trend component for country i. For those countries
where the model with a one-time structural break in µ is the preferred model, Table 2 reports
the estimates of both µi,0 and µi,1 , along with the estimated date of the structural break (in
parenthesis). For most countries, average annualized trend growth rates range from between
1.6% to 3.2%. Korea displays faster growth than all other countries over the entire sample
period, although this growth rate slows in the last decade of the sample period. During
the first decade in the sample period, Japan also displays faster than typical trend growth,
before slowing significantly at the start of 1990s. Two other countries, Spain and Italy, also

   New Zealand is a slight exception in that we do not observe the real GDP series until mid 1982. Still,
   there are 118 quarters over three decades of observed GDP data for New Zealand.

   Note that the trade measures have been scaled (x 100) to improve exposition of tables that report point

display evidence of a changing trend growth rate, which in both cases are growth slowdowns
in the early to mid 2000s.
   Our primary interest in this paper is on the stochastic shocks hitting the trend and
business cycle components. The third and fourth columns of Table 2 give the estimated
standard deviation of these shocks, σvi and σi . Comparing across countries, there are large
differences in the estimated standard deviations for shocks to the trend component. Eight
of the countries in the sample experience quarterly shocks to the trend component with
a standard deviation of 4% of real GDP or higher on an annualized basis, while for seven
others this standard deviation is below 2% of real GDP. For nearly all countries, shocks to the
trend component are substantial, with Canada being the only case where trend shocks have
a standard deviation less than 1% of real GDP. For shocks to the business cycle component
there is more uniformity, although three countries, Mexico, New Zealand, and Norway, stand
out for having larger than typical business cycle shocks.
   A novel feature of our paper is the focus on the relationship between trade intensity and
comovement in trend fluctuations. Thus, it is of particular interest to gauge the relative
importance of the trend vs. the cycle for generating variability in real GDP growth. If the
trend component was relatively unimportant in this respect, the effect of trade on trend
comovement would be of less interest. To measure the relative importance of trend vs.
the cycle we calculate variance decompositions. Note that from (1) – (3), quarterly output
growth can be expressed as:


                                        ∆yi,t = ∆τi,t + ∆ci,t .


Given the independence of shocks to the trend vs. the cyclical component, the variance of
quarterly output growth is then given by:


                             V ar (∆yi,t ) = V ar (∆τi,t ) + V ar (∆ci,t ) .



                                                   15
Each of the components on the right hand side of this equation can be computed analyti-
cally using the estimates of the parameters of the unobserved-components model. In par-
                          2
ticular, V ar (∆τi,t ) = σvi , while V ar (∆ci,t ) can be recovered from the autoregressive spec-
ification of the cyclical component. Given these components, we then compute a variance
decomposition for the proportion of quarterly output growth due to the trend component as
∆τi,t / (∆τi,t + ∆ci,t ).
    The final column of Table 1 reports these variance decompositions, which reveal that
the trend component contributes substantially to the overall variance of quarterly real GDP
growth in most countries. The average value of this variance decomposition across countries
is 0.58, indicating that more than half of the variance of quarterly real GDP growth comes
from the trend component. Also, the variance decomposition is above 0.25 for all but two
countries, Switzerland and Canada, and is above 0.75 for ten countries. There is also some
evidence that the trend component is more important in non-G7 countries, for which the
average variance decomposition is 0.65, vs. 0.45 for the G7 countries. These results suggest
that fluctuations in the trend component are a quantitatively significant source of total
quarterly output fluctuations for a large number of countries, which further motivates our
study of the relationship between trade intensity and trend fluctuation comovement. They
also highlight the potential danger of using first differences or a band-pass filter to measure a
business cycle component defined as the transitory fluctuations in economic activity. As was
discussed in Section 2 above, such approaches to detrending will produce measures of the
business cycle that mix permanent and transitory fluctuations. Given that the permanent
component produces a substantial amount of quarterly real GDP fluctuations in our sample,
this contamination could be significant.


4.2     Comovement and Trade Intensity

    In this section we present results for the estimated relationship between trade and co-
movement patterns across countries. We first examine cyclical comovement patterns to


                                               16
confirm that our data sample and empirical strategies are consistent with previous studies.
We then turn to our question of primary interest: how does trade influence the correlation
between shocks to the trends in real GDP series across countries?
   Table 3 reports estimates from the regression in (8), where the dependent variable is the
correlation between cyclical fluctuations in real GDP, ρcijd . Robust standard errors are in
parenthesis. For each specification we find that bilateral trade intensity leads to stronger
correlations between cyclical fluctuations in output. Note that the average correlation be-
tween transitory shocks in output is positive across countries, so that the positive coefficient
on trade indicates stronger positive correlations. These specifications and results are con-
sistent with previous literature. In column (1) we include only measures of trade intensity
to confirm the result first obtained by Frankel and Rose (1998). Doyle and Faust (2005)
demonstrate that comovement patterns have become weaker in years prior to 2002, consis-
tent with the negative estimate we obtain for the 90s decade effect in column (2). However,
the recent global recession has lead to a sharp increase in cyclical comovement during the
2000s. In column (3) we also allow the effect of trade to vary over time. The impact of
trade on cyclical comovement has become significantly weaker over time, as is apparent from
the negative coefficient on each interaction between trade and the decade effects. While the
impact of trade on cyclical comovement is declining over time, we still estimate a positive
and significant effect across the whole sample. An F-test supports the overall positive effect
of trade on cyclical comovement at high levels of confidence.
   Column (4) introduces country-pair fixed effects to control for differences in the propen-
sity of countries to trade and to share common shocks to GDP. Again, consistent with
previous literature, we find that trade intensity is associated with stronger cyclical comove-
ment patterns. Attributes specific to each country-pair appear to play a substantial role in
comovement patterns. For example, the estimated effect of trade in the 1980s nearly dou-
bles from 0.304 to 0.604 in column (4) once pair fixed effects are included, with comparable
changes in the effect of trade in later decades. This suggests that relationship specific effects


                                               17
may also be important cofactors when we examine comovement in GDP trends. Finally,
in column (5) we introduce controls for country attributes that previous literature has sug-
gested affect comovement relationships independently. The positive impact of trade is also
robust to these additional controls.
   Table 1 reports that the standard deviation in trade flows is approximately 0.53 for the
full sample of countries. Then using the preferred estimates of the relationship between trade
and cyclical comovement in column (5) of Table 3, a one standard deviation increase in trade
between the average country-pair will increase the correlation in their cyclical fluctuations in
output by approximately 0.25, which is equivalent to 0.6 of a standard deviation in cyclical
correlations. The magnitude of this effect for correlations between transitory shocks serves
as a useful benchmark to compare our main results concerning trend comovement.
   In Table 4 we turn to the primary focus of the paper: trend comovement. We present
results for both the full sample of countries (columns 1-3), and for a sample that includes
only country-pairs where both countries are a member of the G7 (columns 4-6). The results
in Table 4 report drastically different effects of trade on the correlation between trend fluc-
tuations than estimated for cyclical comovement. Each specification includes country-pair
fixed effects to account for the potential to share common shocks, and the differences in
the propensity of countries to trade or invest with one another. Robust standard errors are
in parentheses. For the full sample, there is seemingly no statistically significant impact of
trade on the correlation between shocks to trend levels of real GDP across countries. In
fact, the point estimates for the overall effect of trade obtained in columns (1) through (3)
are negative in certain decades, in contrast to the positive effect found for correlations in
cyclical output.
   Column (3) includes the full set of controls for other potential determinants of comove-
ment. The indicator variables for the latter decades in our sample suggest there are increasing
levels of comovement between trend fluctuations of output over time. The average correlation
in trend fluctuations grew during the 90s, and again during the 00s when global recessions


                                              18
have impacted all nations in our sample simultaneously. On the other hand the evidence
for average changes in cyclical comovement in Table 3, and documented by Doyle and Faust
(2005), find declining cyclical comovement over the 1980s and 1990s.
   In columns (4) through (6) we find a statistically significant effect of trade on trend
comovement for the G7 countries that is of the opposite direction from the effect on cycli-
cal comovement. That is, greater trade intensity between countries reduces the correlation
between permanent shocks to their GDP series. The negative estimates are maintained
even when we introduce measures of relative GDP levels and currency union memebership
that previous literature has suggested influence comovement in output across countries in-
dependently (column 6). Looking across all decades, the average effect of trade on trend
correlations is -0.087, and an F-test rejects the hypothesis that trade has no effect on trend
correlations (p-value < 0.05). In contrast to the declining effect of trade on cyclical co-
movement, the negative impact of trade on trend comovement is robust over time. Each
interaction between trade and the decade effects are indistinguishable from zero, indicating
no significant changes in the role of trade relationships over time.
   Looking across columns (4) through (6) we find that trade has the effect of decoupling
trend comovement relationships among G7 nations. The magnitude of the negative impact
of trade on correlations between shocks to trend levels of output is substantial. Using the
preferred estimates from column (6) that includes the full set of controls for the determinants
of comovement patterns, the estimated effect of trade is approximately -0.087. Then taking
from Table 1 the standard deviation in trade intensity for G7 nations, 1.19, our estimates
imply that an increase in trade by a standard deviation reduces the correlation in trend
fluctuations by 0.10. The size of this effect is equivalent to about 0.33 of a standard deviation
in observed trend correlations. Furthermore, the evidence in Table 2 demonstrates that
changes in the trend levels of real GDP series across countries are a substantial portion
of the variation in their overall levels of output. Thus a reduction in correlations between
shocks to the trend by one-third of a standard deviations corresponds to a significant amount


                                               19
of economic activity.
       In Figure 3 we plot the estimated relationship between trade and comovement across
decades for both cyclical and trend correlations.20 The effects on the vertical axis are mea-
sured in units equal to the corresponding standard deviation for trend and cyclical co-
movement. The dashed line illustrates the positive, and significantly declining, relationship
between trade and business cycle comovement. The solid line represents the stable neg-
ative relationship between trade intensity and the correlation between shock to countries’
trend levels of output. As mentioned above, the average effect of trade across all decades is
significantly different from zero for both trend and cyclical comovement.



5        Discussion

       Unlike the relationship between business cycle comovement and trade, there has been
little thought given to why or how trade may affect the comovement of shocks to countries’
GDP trends. Further exploration should seek to identify the potential reasons for this
negative relationship. While such analysis goes beyond our study, we surmise that a possible
explanation is tied to how (long-run) factors of production may adjust across sectors, or
across borders, when countries are open to trade; i.e., the supply channel for the transmission
of shocks to ouptut trends.
       Larger international trading opportunities can lead to specialization of the industrial
structure within countries, as they each allocate more factors of production toward sectors
corresponding to their respective comparative advantage. Hence, with more trade countries
may exhibit larger differences in composition of output across sectors. Such differences in
industrial structure due to specialization may then mean that shocks to GDP trends are
less correlated across countries. For example, suppose that changes in output growth rates
worldwide are concentrated in only a few sectors. If countries experience episodes of trade

20
     The estimated effects in Figure 3 correspond to the preferred specifications in column (5) of Table 3 and
     column (6) in Table 4, which each include the full set of control variables.


                                                       20
liberalization, they will further specialize in sectors with different growth patterns over time.
Thus, we would observe stronger trade relationships between countries that have less cor-
related shocks to their trend levels of aggregate output. Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) shows
that business cycle comovement depends, in part, on the patterns of industrial specialization
across countries, suggesting that trend comovment may also be related systematically the
concentration of output across sectors. Costinot et al. (2011) also provide evidence that
industry-specific shocks in productivity generate substantial changes in bilateral trade vol-
umes, which is consistent with the potential to observe weaker output comovement across
trading partners that specialize in industries that experience different shocks to their specific
output trends.
     In addition to the allocation of factors across industries, countries that trade with each
other are also more likely to be open to reallocations of productive capital across borders.
A positive shock to the trend level of GDP in one country may draw away investment
and associated economic activity from the other country, so that the other country is less
likely to experience the same positive shock to its own output trend. This would suggest
a major role for intra-firm trade by multinationals in the transmission of shocks across
borders. This mechanism would be consistent with our finding that the effect of trade
openness on the correlation in shocks to GDP trends is mainly a G7 phenomenon, since the
majority of worldwide FDI is into G7 nations.21 Moreover, in developed countries intra-firm
trade constitutes a substantial portion of overall bilateral trade volumes, suggesting that
the role of multinational activity is a plausible mechanism by which trade mitigates trend
comovement.22 It is also likely that both supply channels, the reallocation of production
across borders and across sectors, simultaneously induce trade to mitigate trend comovement.
As Neary (2007) argues, in the long-run closer trade relationships can trigger reallocations of

   flows among OECD nations in 2007.
22
   For example, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that in 2009 nearly 50% of all imports of consumption goods
   were from related parties of firms located in the United States. Interestingly, Kleinert et al. (2012) find
   evidence that the impact of trade on business cycle comovement is generated primarily via few multinational
   firms, who trade intensively with their parent firm host country.

production across countries via cross-border M&A in a manner that enhances the respective
comparative advantages of each trading partner across sectors.



6      Conclusion

     In the current volatile economic climate, heads of state are increasingly focused on the
policies established in countries with which they have close economic relationships. Interna-
tional trade linkages can potentially transmit episodes of output contraction across borders.
The results presented here suggest that such concerns are less warranted when considering
long-run, permanent, changes in real GDP. While trade has been shown to increase cyclical
comovement between countries, here we have found that closer trade relationships reduce
the correlation between shocks to G7 countries’ trend levels of output. For countries outside
the G7, we find no statistically significant effect of trade intensity on trend comovement.
     Our evidence suggests that the effect of trade on trend comovement in the G7 is of
substantial economic importance. For most countries in our sample, shocks to trend levels of
output account for over half of the variation in their real GDP series. Thus the quantitative
impact of closer trade relationships on trend comovement is large in terms of total economic
activity. We also find that observed comovement in output trends has remained strong, and
potentially increased over time, while cyclical comovement relationships have become weaker
over the last 30 years.
