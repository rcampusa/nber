                    WHY   ARE REAL. INTEREST RATES SO HIGH?




                                    Abstract




   This paper applies the Capital Asset Pricing Model to help explain the

anomalous behavior of real interest rates during the last several years.

Specifically,we are able to show that the increased volatility of bond prices

since the change in Federal Reserve operating procedure in October 1979 has

substantially increased the required real risk premium on long term bonds. We

also consider and reject the possibility that increased risk alone accounts

for the recent increase in the short—term real rate. Finally, we use the

model to simulate the financial effects of a Federal debt maturity management

operation.

                    WHY ARE REAL INTEREST RATES SO HIGH?




   The recent behavior of the real interest rate and the term structure of

nominal interest rates has been a major puzzle to most macroeconomists.

Throughout the 1970's, analysts explained the historically high nominal

interest rates as being the result of a high expected rate of inflation,

assuming that real interest rates remained at their relatively low historical

levels.1 In the early 1980's, however, the expected real short—term

irterest rate apparently rose, as the nominal short—term rate remained high

while the inflation rate declined.2 The behavior of the real long-term

interest rate has been less clear, since there is no accepted measure of

long—term expected inflation. Many analysts argued that the long-term nominal

interest rate was high In the early 1980's because the long-term expected

inflation rate was high.3 However, we argue in this paper that a

significant portion of the rise in long-term nominal interest rates (see

Figure 1) was due to an increase in the real risk premium on long-term bonds,

apparently resulting from the Increased volatility of interest rates since the

change in Federa' Reserve operating procedure in October, 1979.

    The theoretical model we employ is a modified version of the capital asset

pricing model (CAPM), which has become the standard financial model of capital

market equilibrium over the past decade, but which to our knowledge has not

been employed to explain macroeconomic phenomena of the sort investigated

here. Standard macroeconomic models have been employed to explain the rise in

the short-term real interest rate since October, 1979. These models, for

example the IS—LM model, typically do not account for the possibility that
                                     2
changes in the return variability on bonds can affect the short-term real

rate, and do not explain shifts in the term structure of interest rates. Our

empirical results, using the CAPM, indicate that our model by itself cannot

account for the recent high real rates of return on short-term nominal bonds,

though It does explain higher long term rates quite well. Thus, our model

explains the seeming anomaly of the flat nominal term structure observed in

the early 1980's despite a reduction in the expected future inflation rate.

    The use in this paper of the CAPM to forecast the term structure of real

risk premia on bonds stands in sharp contrast to more usual methods of

explaining the term structure. For example, the expectations hypothesis

implies that high long—term yields could be explained only by high expected

future short-term yields. The inconsistency between the expectations

hypothesis and modern financial theory has been noted (e.g., see Cox,

Ingersoll, and Ross, 1981). What appears not to be widely appreciated,

however, is that whatever the structural explanation of the term structure,

expected rates of return on bonds should obey an equilibrium asset pricing

relationship such as the CAPM.

    Our model aso permits us to explore another issue in macroeconomics,

namely how the maturity composition of the outstanding government debt affects

relative yields on short and long—term debt and, more importantly, the

required return on equity. Since Tobin's (1963) paper on debt management,

this has been a central concern of monetary theorists and policy makers.

Using our model, we are able to quantify the effects on yield spreads of

shifts in the relative supplies of short-term vs. long—term government debt.

Friedman (1982) and Roley (1982) have examined this issue using a different

methodology: empirically estimated structural demand and supply equations for
                                       —3—

different assets. Our methodology, using an equilibrium pricing relationship,

is quite different from theirs.4

     The structure of the paper is as follows: in the first section, we

briefly   explain the theoretical model and its two main implications for
equilibrium risk premia. In Section 2, we explain how we estimated the inputs
necessary to derive numerical values for the equilibrium risk premia from our
model. Section 3 presents the estimated risk premia and shows how their

behavior has evolved over time. We also consider the sensitivity of our

estimates to several of our key assumptions about aggregate risk aversion and

the stochastic process generating real returns. Finally, in Section 4 we

explore the model's implications for the conduct of debt-management policy.

In particular, we show how changes in the relative supplies of short and

long—term government debt can affect the equilibrium risk premium on equity,

thus influencing the rate of capital formation in the economy. An appendix

discusses the construction of the data.



.,   Theoretical   Model

     A. Determining the Risk Premia on Assets

          Our basic model of portfolio selection is that of Markowitz (1952) as

developed by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1964), and Mossin (1966), and extended to

a full intertemporal context by Merton (1969, 1971). Merton has shown that

when asset prices follow a Geometric Brownian Motion in continuous time and

portfolios can be continuously revised, then as in the original Markowitz

model, only variances and covariances of the joint distribution of returns are

needed to compute equilibrium risk premia. Investors are assumed to have

homogeneous expectations about the values of these parameters.    Furthermore,

we assume that all n assets are continuously and costlessly traded and that

there are no taxes.5 In this context It is straightforward to show that the

real risk premium on asset i relative to asset j, R -                  must   in


equilibrium be given by6

         R1 —
                    R
                        =
                            'iM        aM)
                                                                        (1)


where        =      Covariance between the real rate of return on asset i and the
                    real rate of return on the market portfolio

                =   Harmonic mean of investors' degree of relative risk

                    aversion, weighted by investors' share of aggregate wealth.

    Equation (1) holds for real rates of return whether or not there is a

risk—free asset, and whether or not there is inflation; in this paper, we will

be assuming there is no real risk—free asset. By choosing R appropriately,

it Is   possible        to derive the various versions of the CAPM-type asset pricing

relationships, such as the standard CAPM when there is a risk-free asset, and

the Black (1972) "zero-beta" version when there is not. Because the focus in

this paper is on explaining risk premla on bonds, we will use the rate of

return on Treasury bills as our benchmark asset.

    In the standard version of the CAPM, the measure of aggregate relative

risk aversion, ,            is   eliminated in order to write the equilibrium pricing

relationship solely in terms of (presumably) observable variables, such as

beta and the risk premium on the market portfolio. In this paper, we are

interested In       explaining        risk premia, so we leave the equation in the form

(1). Our strategy Is to estimate the necessary covariances and to compute

risk premia for various levels of risk aversion. To our knowledge, no one has

seriously   suggested that the average level of relative risk aversion is below
one or above six, so             we   restrict our calculations to that range.7
                                          —5—

      In standard discussions of the 'APM, the "market portfolio" is usually

taken to mean a portfolio of equities. In this paper, we take as the market

portfolio the total quantity of stocks and bonds which must be held. In

theory, the market portfolio should represent the total quantity of claims

which must be held by the household sector, so that our measure is preferable

to using equities alone.

      It should be emphasized that equation (1) does not give yields to

maturity; rather, equation (1) gives the expected instantaneous holding period

yield for any asset. This distinction is especially crucial for bonds, since

a long term bond with an expected holding period yield appropriate for

long—term bonds, will someday become a short-term bond with a different

expected holding period yield. The expected yield to maturity will be an

average of future expected holding period yields. For the purposes of this

paper, the important point is that, ceteris paribus, an increase in the

expected      holding period yield on a long—term asset will also raise its yield
to   maturity.



      B. The Shadow Risk-Free Rate

         Given the equilibrium pricing relationship (1), it is possible to ask

the following question: if a risk-free asset were introduced in zero

aggregate      supply, what rate of return would it   have to have if equilibrium

risk    premia were to remain undisturbed? We call      this rate the shadow

risk-free      rate.8 From (1), it is easy to see that    the shadow risk-free rate

would   satisfy
               -        =                                         (2)
         R0        Rf       OM
where R0 is the expected rate of return on zero—duration assets (Treasury
                                     —6—

bills), and OM is the covariance between Treasury bills and the Market. As

long as this covariance is unchanged, the risk premium on Treasury bills over

the shadow risk—free rate will not change.

    One reason for focusing on the shadow risk—free rate is the possibility

that it remains relatively constant over time, and thus serves to tie down the

absolute level of interest rates over time and not just the risk premia. In a

consumption—based asset pricing model (see, for example, Cox, Ingersoll, and

Ross, 1978), the shadow risk—free rate would depend on the rate of time

preference and the expected rate of change in the marginal utility of

consumption. Policy changes which changed neither of these would leave the

shadow risk—free rate constant. One should think of the shadow risk—free rate

as the rate that would prevail if the risk—free asset was in zero net supply.

The more risk-averse investors would lend to the more risk-tolerant investors,

and those with average risk aversion would hold none of the risk-free asset.



It. The Data

    In this section we describe in some detail how we estimated covariances

and market weights. It should be emphasized that the goal is not to test the

CAPM, but instead to derive Its implications for the change in risk premia due

to the change in asset return variability over the last several years.



    A. Assets Included

       Obviously It is necessary to limit the number of assets studied. We

assumed that there were ten classes of assets: stocks; Treasury-bills; and

nominally risk—free bonds, of durations one through eight years. In measuring

how long—term a particular debt issue Is, we are careful throughout the paper
                                       —7—

to use duration instead of the more common measure of maturity date.9

Duration is a measure of the time until the average payment to the bondholder

occurs, and may be used to consistently compare bonds with very different

payment streams, for which maturity date may provide a misleading comparison.

The distinction between maturity and duration Is important since the duration

of bonds of a given maturity shortened considerably In the late 1970's.

    Stocks are an obvious choice for inclusion, and we include a variety of

bonds because it is bond yields we are interested In explaining. Some of the

exclusions, however, are noteworthy: land, residential housing, and consumer

durables together account for about 40 percent of household net worth as

measured In the Flow—of-Funds Sector Balance Sheets. Unfortunately, there are

no reliable rate of return series for these assets, so we were forced to

exclude them from our market portfolIo. Human capital Is excluded for the

same reason.

   There are also a variety of assets which are not literally common stock or

governments bonds, but which we assume are good substitutes for those assets.

Time and Demand deposits, for example, are taken to have the same rate of

return as Treasury bills10; corporate bonds and municipal bonds are assumed

to be "like" government bonds; and non—corporate equity Is assumed to have the

same characteristics as equity. We decided that these assumptions (and others

to be outlined below) were preferable to ignoring these assets. We could not

separately   include these other assets because acceptable rate of return data
could not be obtained.
                                                -8-
      B.    Real Rates of Return

           We estimated covariances using monthly real rates of return for stocks

and the nine categories of government bonds described above. We used monthly

data because, as Merton (1980) has shown, the accuracy of variance and

covariance estimates is improved by using frequent observation periods, and

because one month is the shortest interval for which inflation data is

available and hence for which real rates of return could be computed.

Estimates of the mean, on the other hand, are not improved by Increasing the

observation frequency within a given time span. The price index used was the

Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index, excluding the cost of

shelter.

      Real returns on Treasury Bills are from Ibbotson and Sinquefield (198),

while bond data are from the U.S. Government bond-file of the Center for

Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Stock returns are from the NYSE monthly

CRSP file. We divided the bonds into nine categories based on duration.

      In all cases the rate of return was measured as the natural logarithm of

the monthly real wealth relatives. On the assumption that these returns are

lognormally distributed, the log of the wealth relative over a discrete time

interval Is      normally       distributed with mean   and variance a, where

                                a. 2
                     = r.   -    1
                1i

All   reported means were converted to annual rates by multiplying them by 1

and the standard deviations by multiplying them by /12. This makes them

comparable to the means and standard deviations of the continuously compounded

rates      of return one would obtain using a one year holding period.
                                     -9-

    C. Market Weights

        As mentioned, the market portfolio consists of a number   of   different

assets. In order to compute the covariance of the return on the market with

that on other assets, it is necessary to know the composition of the market

portfolio (the market weights), which we denote wM. Theoretically, WM

should measure the percentage of household net worth invested in assets which

comprise the market portfolio. We used the Flow-of-Funds Sector Balance

Sheets to obtain this breakdown for broad categories of assets for 1976 and

1980. The Treasury Department's Monthly Statement of the Public Debt was used

to determine the relative quantities of government bonds of different

maturities outstanding In those two years. We assume in the calculations that

government bonds are net worth to the household sector. The details of the

procedure for determining the weights is relegated to an appendix.

    Weights were computed by calculating the percentage of household net worth

(taken from the Flow of Funds Balance Sheet) held in each kind of asset, under

two alternative assumptions about financial intermediaries: first, that the

liabilities of intermediaries are treated as assets by the household sector;

and second, that financial intermediaries are a veil, so that households

perceive themselves as directly holding the assets of intermediaries.

Intermediaries are completely netted out in the second procedure. The chief

difference in the two cases is that households hold more short—term assets In

the first case. This Is to be expected, since intermediaries typically borrow

short and lend long. Weights computed under the two assumptions are presented

in the Appendix.

   There is one important class of assets held by households for which

duration data is not available: pension fund and life insurance reserves.
                                      -10-
Together, these constitute almost one-fifth of the financial net worth of
households in both 1976 and 1980. Consequently our results are potentially
sensitive to the allocation of these assets across durations. We elected to
compute asset weights under each of two assumptions about these assets:

first, that they were spread evenly across durations one through eight (we

also used this assumption to allocate mortgages across durations); and second,

that these reserves are predominantly long term. In the second case, we used

the sum—of-the-years digits method to allocate these assets "triangularly"

across durations. The second case is probably    more reasonable, since for
households pension reserves represent a long-term, nominally fixed claim.
Nevertheless,   we computed results under both sets of assumptions.



    0. Computing Rate of Return Covariances

          The most important input to the model is the covariance matrix of

asset returns. In order to estimate a covariance matrix, it is necessary to

create a time—series of residuals-—deviations of actual rates of return from

some mean or expected rate of return. We estimated covariances by computing

the mean in two different ways:

    1. Unconditional Covariance. Here we simply computed the covariance

matrix of asset returns by taking deviations of actual rates of return from

the historical mean rate of return over the same period. This is

objectionable only If the conditional expected mean real rate of return

changed   (or was perceived to have changed) over the period in question.
    2.   Conditional Covariance. In this procedure, we allowed for a

time—varying expected rate of return for each asset and computed deviations

from this mean in estimating the covariance matrix. To do this, we performed
                                       —11—

the following procedure: an expected real rate of return on one-month

Treasury bills was computed in one of several ways (see below), and this

process was used to generate a one-month ahead expected real rate of return on

Treasury bills. Given this forecast of R0, and the covariance matrix

estimated over the previous twenty—four months, it was possible to estimate

the expected rate of return on every asset using (1). With both the expected

rate of return on every asset and the actual return, we were able to compute

forecast   errors. The latest forecast error (conditional on the forecast of
the Treasury bill rate) was then entered into the data matrix and used the
next period in computing the covarlance matrix.
    Thus, the entries in the conditional covariance matrix were computed as


                4           1,T-t - R.1 ,T-t )(.3 ,T—t -R.j ,T—t )   (3)


where R represents the realized real rate of return and R is the estimated
expected real rate of return, computed using equation (1.) and the previous
months covariance estimate.

    An important advantage of this procedure is that the computed expected

rates of return for each period are consistent with the model. The only part

of this procedure which is ad hoc is the specification of the process

generating expected rates of return on Treasury bills. The measure of

covariance upon which   the CAPM is based is the covariance of holding period
rate   of return deviations from expected rates of return. This Is    precisely
what our procedure measures.

    An obvious alternative way to compute the conditional covariance would be

to calculate an expected rate of return based on a rolling ARIMA regression,

or using some other kind of forecasting procedure. However, under the null
                                            —12—


hypothesis that the CAPM correctly describes asset market equilibrium, the
ARIMA regression would likely fall to generate true expected rates of return,

since It ignores the relationship between the covariance structure and

expected rates of return.

     We computed expected real rates of return on Treasury bills using four

different methods:

     a) R0 =    I   -
                        w1.   The expected real yield over the coming month is

the current nominal yield on a 30—day Treasury bill, i, less last monthts

inflation rate, ri.

     b) R0 =    a +               The expected real yield on Treasury bills
                        bR0   .
follows an AR1 process. We experimented with computing a and b in three

different ways: a and b were reestimated every period using only the last 24

months of data, and using all available data; and they were constrained to be

the numbers reported in Ibbotson and Slnquefield (1982), i.e., a =        0,   b =   .63.


3. Results

     A.    Unconditional Covariances
           We estimated the covariance matrix of asset returns over two periods:

January,    1973 through September 1979, and January, 1980 through December,
1981.     Summary statistics for     these periods are presented in Table l.a. Table
la   has a number of striking features. First, except for stocks and bills, the

ex post real rate of return on all assets Is negative over both periods. We

take this to demonstrate the point made above, that the mean cannot reliably

be estimated over a relatively short span of time, and that the use of the ex

post mean to estimate the ex ante mean would be futile over this time period.

 Instead, we use the covariance data to infer the pattern of expected risk

premia across assets.

    Comparing the two sample periods, it is apparent that the standard

deviation on stocks and bills changed little between 1973—1979 and 1980—1981.

The change in rate of return standard deviations on long-term bonds is

dramatic, however, with the standard deviations on the longest-term bonds

increasing four-fold, and exceeding the standard deviation on the rate of

return on equity.

    The pattern of correlation coefficients is especially important for our

purposes, since we wish to examine the effect of Government debt management

policies on relative asset yields. The sign and strength of correlations

determines the relative substitutability of assets. For example, if the

covariance between the rate of return on equity and duration 8 bonds is large,

then an increase In the supply of duration 8 bonds would be expected to

increase the yields on both duration 8 bonds and equity, while if the

covariance is low, the effect on equity would be less pronounced.

    The pattern of correlation coefficients in Table la does not seem to

suggest that long-term bonds are more like bills than like equity, which was

argued by Tobin (1963). Between the earlier and later periods, bills and

stocks became essentially uncorrelated, while the correlation of stocks with

the longer duration bonds rose, and that for shorter duration bonds fell. It

is worth noting that covariances between the longer duration bonds and stocks

did in general increase from the earlier to the later sample period, since

both standard deviations and correlations increased. Thus the importance of

debt management policy should be greater in the later than in the earlier

period.

       The covariance matrix was then used to compute risk premia, using equation

(1).      The level of risk aversion, , was set at 1, 3.5, and 6, to represent

extreme plausible values of the level of aggregate risk aversion.            Because the

risk premium is proportional to the level of risk aversion, it is easy to

compute the result of a change in this parameter.           In Table 2 we present the

results using 1980 market weights, computed under the assumption that pension

fund and life insurance reserves are predominantly long-term assets.

       The results are striking: the increase in the variability of rates of

return on long-term assets from the seventies to the eighties raised the risk

premium on long—term nominal bonds by a minimum of 110 basis points, and

possibly by over 700 basis points, depending on aggregate risk aversion.

Thus, the puzzle of the flat term structure In 1980 and 1981 may not be a

puzzle at all. It is entirely possible that the Fed's restrictive action

lowered expected future long—term inflation rates, and that the short-term

interest rate rose for standard IS—LM reasons. The seeming anomaly that

long-term interest rates also rose, may be explained by a rise in the real

risk premium, which more than offset the decline in the long-term inflation

premi urn.

       Table   2 also shows that changes in covariances alone cannot explain the
rise in the real short-term interest rate in the early 1980's. The risk
premium for duration zero bonds relative to the shadow risk—free rate             (the


bottom     row in   Table   2)   actually fell from 1973—79 to   1980-81, and was less

 than 25 basis points in both subperiods. This suggests that changes
 riskiness of the real return on Treasury bills cannot account for the rise in

 the short—term real rate. To explain the rise in the short-term real rate, it

 Is necessary to explain a rise in the shadow risk-free rate, which this model

is not equipped to do.



       B. Conditional Covariances

             A possible objection to the use of unconditional covariance estimates

to infer risk premia is that the levels of expected rates of return are

changing       over time. In this case, estimating unconditional covariances can
give misleading results. To account for this possibility, we estimated
conditional covariances as described above, using four different methods for
calculating       the expected real rate of return on Treasury bills.

       All    of the different methods for computing conditional covariances gave
virtually identical results, so we report only those in which the expected
real    return on bills was taken to be the nominal bill rate less last month's

inflation       rate.
       Table lb reproduces Table la, except that all computations are for
deviations of actual returns from expected returns. The covarlances are
computed using (3).                                                            It
is clear that the conditional covariance estimates are virtually identical         to

the    unconditional covariance estimates; the patterns    of correlation

coefficients       and standard deviations are similar.
       Because the conditional and unconditional covariances are similar, the

forecasted real risk premla are similar in the two cases. Figures 2a and 2b

perform the same kind of simulation as in Table 2. They present a time series

of the risk premia (relative to Treasury bills) on duration 4 and duration 8

bonds. For both bonds, the risk premium shows a dramatic increase in 1980,

demonstrating that at least some of the increase in nominal long-term yields

was due to an increase in the required real rate of return. This risk premium
                                      -16..

is   computed monthly, using the covariance matrix estimated from the previous

24 months of data. Aggregate risk aversion is   set   at 3.5.

      This method of generating real risk premia can be criticized on the
grounds that the measured covariance lags behind the true expected covariance;
the   expected covariance matrix in November, 1979, was probably not equal to

the measured covariance matrix for the previous 24 months. Nevertheless, it

is notable how quickly the risk premia in Figure 2 rise following October,

1979.

      The gaps in the graphs (dotted lines) are the result of missing data.

Very long-term government bonds did not exist for some time periods in the

early and mid 1970's, so we simply omitted those periods, instead of

arbitrarily assigning the market weights from missing bonds to other

bonds.t1 When there were gaps, the covariance matrix was computed using the

last 24 months for which a full data set was available. The expected real

rate on Treasury bills, on the other hand, was always computed using the most

recent data.



      C. Sensitivity Analysis

         The market weights used in the computations are at best rough

approximations; consequently, it is important to know the sensitivity to

changes in the market weights of the estimated risk premia. Table 3 contains

risk premia estimated under two alternative assumptions about weights. All

risk premia are computed under the assumption that the coefficient of relative

risk aversion is 3.5.

      Column 2 of Table 3 contains risk premia estimated using weights

constructed under the assumption that financial intermediaries are a veil.

This results in a large redistribution of the weights from short to long—term

assets, while keeping the weight on equity at the same level. While the risk

premium   on long—term bonds rises appreciably, the overall pattern and levels
of risk premia remain much the same. This is also true for the risk premia
presented in the third column, which uses the set of weights which most
differed from the weights in Column 1, and which assumed intermediaries not to

be a veil.

    It is clear that the risk premium on equity is not particularly sensitive

to the pattern of weights across bonds. An increase in the market weights

assigned to long—term bonds, however, can appreciably raise the required rate

of return on long—term bonds. For our purpose, which Is examining the effect

of covariance changes on risk premia, the pattern of risk premia appears

sufficiently unaffected by small changes in the weights that it is unnecessary

to worry about the exact assumptions used in constructing the weights or about

variations In the weights over time.



4. Debt Management and Relative Risk Premia

    An important strand in macroeconomic thought for the last 20 years has

been the importance of government financing and monetary policy as

determinants of relative rates of return on assets, and hence of real

activity. This idea, due to Tobin (1964), stresses the myriad possible

outcomes from various combinations of debt management policy and monetary

management. The model In this paper actually provides a way to quantify the

possible effect of alternative government debt policies on relative rates of

return. There may be offsetting effects, however, so that the estimates

obtained   in this way should he thought of as maximum possible effects.
                                     -18-

    Before examining Table 4, which contains the results of a simple

experiment in which the Treasury shifts the composition of debt towards

long-term debt, we should examine the extent to which the government can

actually affect the market weights. At the most (when financial

intermediaries are considered a veil), government debt (excluding agency

securities) constitutes about nine percent of household financial net worth.

About a quarter of this is short—term government debt. Thus, if the Federal

government were to replace all short—term debt with long-term debt, a shift of

two percent would occur from short- to long—term bond weights. As we have

already seen, a change of this magnitude will not change risk premia

significantly. The government has other tools at its disposal, however, since

it regulates financial institutions. Thus, by exerting regulatory pressure,

it might be possible to reduce the percentage of short—term debt still further.

    Table 4 shows the results of a maturity change in which the government

increases the percentage of duration zero debt by 5 percentage points, and

reduces the percentage in durations 3 through 8.12 Even for this rather

large change in the weights, the risk premium on equity is reduced by only

fifteen basis points. The risk premium on the very longest-term debt is

reduced somewhat more, by almost fifty basis points.

    Some care is required in interpreting the results in Table 4. As Tobin

(1963) emphasized, it is the risk premium on equity which matters for capital

formation. The correct risk premium, however, is that on unlevered equity,

while the risk premium we have actually measured is that on levered equity.

To measure the effect of a government maturity change on the risk premium of

unlevered equity, one must unlever the number in Table 4. This can be done by

computing a weighted average of the risk premia in Table 4, where the weights

are the percentage of investment financed by equity and by each kind of debt.

This weighted average approximates the unlevered cost of equity capital.

Because    all of the risk premia in Table 4   fell, it is clear that the required

risk   premium on unlevered equity would also have fallen.
       Friedman (1981) and Roley (1982) have also studied the effects of a

federal debt management operation on relative security yields. They both

conclude that much smaller Federal debt management operations than those

considered   here would affect relative yields by roughly the same order of
magnitude as in our simulation.     An important difference between their models

and   ours, however, is that we assume that investors immediately adjust their
portfolio    composition in response to the change in relative yields, while
Friedman and Roley both use a model In which adjustment takes time. To some
extent,   therefore, their results measure transient impact effects (which are

greater than the long-run relative price changes) and thus are not directly

comparable to our results.

      This analysis is valid even though it ignores the difference between

interest-bearing and non—interest bearing debt, which is of course at the

heart of any theory of monetary policy. Our framework is partial equilibrium,

taking the level of the Treasury bill rate as given. Monetary policy should

be thought of as shifting the   general level of interest rates up or down. The
relative   pattern of risk premia should not be affected, however, except to the

extent that a change in monetary policy changes the pattern of covariances, as

it appears to have in 1979. The model in       this paper can really say nothing
about the effects of monetary policy per Se, though it can be used to analyze

the   effects of debt management.

   Having discussed what the government can in principle do, It is worth

noting that the government may not be able to have much effect. One

argument-—due to Barro (1974)-—is simply that if households capitalize future

tax liabilties, then a change in the risk composition of assets that

households must hold (due to a change in the maturity structure of outstanding

government debt) would simply be offset by a change in the risk composition of

future tax liabilities. There are a number of reasons for finding this

argument unconvincing, which are detailed in Tobin (1980).



5. Summary and Conclusions

   This paper has applied financial theory to help explain the anomalous

interest rate behavior of the last several years. A number of commentators

have been surprised that nominal long-term interest rates remained high even

when expected future inflation rates were thought to have declined. Our

explanation is that even if expected future inflation rates did decline, the

high long—term nominal yields can be explained as the result of increased real

risk premia. We are able to show that for long—term bonds, the increased

variance of the rate of return on long-term bonds and the increased

correlation with other assets, should have induced a rise in the real risk

premium on long—term bonds between 1973—1979 and 1980—1981.

    While our model is able to account for an upward—sloping term structure of

real expected rates of return, it is unable to account for the rise in the

real rate of return on short—term bonds. We are able to show that the risk

premium on bills relative to the shadow risk—free rate should not have

increased in the 1980's, since the covariance between bills and the market

changed little.

     Our model also provides a novel way to analyze the effects of a

debt-management operation, such as "Operation Twist." Instead of estimating a

supply and demand equations for different assets, we simply use the CAPM,

which is an equilibrium pricing relationship, to explore the effects of

changes in the relative supplies of different assets.

     We   used only the one-factor CAPM in this paper; an obvious next step would
be the use of a consumption based asset—pricing model, as in Breeden    (1979),
to   compute risk premia. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons the

consumption—based approach is more difficult to implement, so we did not

attempt it in this paper.

   First we calculated the quantities of government bonds outstanding for

each duration. This was done using the Monthly Statement of the Public Debt

and then converting maturity into durations. Results of these calculations

are in Table A—i.

   The following sums were computed to calculate w1 for each asset category:

   The market weights were then computed under two alternative assumptions

about financial intermediaries: that the liabilities of financial

intermediaries are treated as assets by the household sector, and that

financial intermediaries are a "veil,0 so that households behaved as if they

directly held the assets of intermediaries. The first is more coherent under

the finance paradigm; nevertheless we computed both sets of weights as a

sensitivity check. Notice that the biggest difference between the two

computations is in the percentage of duration zero bonds held by households.

Under the intermediaries—a—veil assumption, there are no financial

institutions to perform the function of transforming long—term assets into

short-term liabilities. Households hold no demand or time deposits, with the

result that they Instead directly hold assets such as mortgages. The

aggregate debt-equity ratio is insensitive to the assumption that

intermedtaries are a veil, because financial institutions hold debt and are

predominantly debt—financed. Tables A—2 and A—3 contain the results of both

computations.

1.   Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982) show that the average annual real rate of

     return on Treasury bills was close to zero, and that on long—term

     government bonds was about one percent,over the period 1926 to 1976.

2.   See Martin Feldstein, "Why Short-Term Interest Rates Are High," Wall

     Street Journal, June 8, 1982.

3.   See for exampleRobert E. Lucas, Jr., "Deficit Finance and Inflation,"

4.   Roley (1979) and Walsh (1983)/study the theoretical effects of debt

     management operations in a mean variance model. Walsh also shows how

     changes in the stock of assets outstanding can affect the covariance of

     security price changes.

5.   The assumption that there are no taxes does not appear to be important

     for our qualitative results but can affect the magnitude of the risk

     premium, depending on the assets being compared. There are two problems,

     one relating to means, the other to covariances. To convert the risk

     premia to the difference in nominal before—tax expected yields, it is

     necessary only to divide the risk premium by one minus the tax rate if

     both assets are taxed at the same rate. In this case, the reported risk

     premia understate the before—tax nominal risk premia. If the two assets

     are taxed at different rates (as with stocks and bonds) it is necessary

     to know rate of return levels and not just risk premia in order to infer

     the difference in before-tax nominal yields.

          The covariance correction is more involved. For 30-day bills, the

     conditional   real rate of return variance is unaffected by taxes since the
                                        -28-

     nominal after-tax rate of return is certain, and the real rate of return

     is obtained by subtracting the stochastic inflation rate. For stocks and

     long-term bonds, there is uncertainty about the nominal yield, and hence

     about the part of the return which will be taxed. It is then necessary

     to adjust the covariance for the reduction in the real return variance

     due to taxes. (The deviation of actual from expected nominal returns

     will typically be taxed at the capital gains rate, at least to a first

     approximation.) The net effect of making all the adjustments is

     ambiguous.

6.   It is shown in Bodie, Kane, and Mcflonald (1983) that the equilibrium

     expected rate of return on any asset may be written
                               2
           R1 = Rmin   6'iM — amln
     where    is a measure of aggregate risk aversion, aIM is the covariance

     of the real rate of return on asset i with that of the market, and rmjn

     and       are the expected rate of return and the variance of the

     rate of return on the minimum variance portfolio. This relationship

     implies (1).

7.   Friend and Blume (1975) estimate tS   to   be 2, while Friend and Hasbrouck

     obtain an estimate of 6. Grossman and Shiller (1981), using a different

     method, obtain an estimate of 4.

8.   What we call the "shadow risk-free rate" Is also the rate of return on

     the zero—beta portfolio in the Black (1972) version of the CAPM. Using

     arguments along the lines of Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1978), ft is

     straightforward to show that in a model with one state variable and no

     risk-free asset, the zero beta portfolio has a rate of return equal to

     the rate of time preference, less the expected percentage change in the

     marginal utility of consumption.
                                        —29—

             It is also shown in Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1978), and in Lintner

     (1969) that the shadow risk—free rate equals the Lagrange multiplier

     associated with the wealth constraint in the portfolio maximization

     problem.

             A possible reason for the non-existence of indexed bonds is

     discussed in Bodie, Kane and McDonald (1983), where it is shown that the

     welfare gain from introducing such an asset would be small.

9.   Duration, as defined by Macaulay (1938) is a weighted average of the

     years to maturity of each of the cash flows from a security. The weights

     are the present value of each year's cash flow as a proportion of the

     total    present value of the security. Duration equals final maturity only
     in   the case of pure discount bonds. For coupon bonds and mortgages,

     duration is always less than maturity. The difference between maturity

     and duration for ordinary coupon bonds and mortgages is greater the

     longer   the final maturity and the higher the level of interest rates. In
     our sample of bonds this difference rose steadily over the 1953-1981
     period   due to the rising trend In interest rates. The most pronounced

     differences were in the 8 year duration category. In 1953 the average

     maturity of the bonds in our 8 year duration portfolio was just under 9

     years whereas in 1981 the average maturity of the 8 year duration

     portfolio was 23 years. This variation over the last 30 years calls into

     question the appropriateness of a bond return series with a constant

     maturity of 20 years, such as the one tabulated by Ibbotson and

     Slnquefiel d (1982).

10. Currency and bank deposits are taken to have a non—measurable "service

     yield" over and above their explicit, nominally—fixed rate of return.
                                    -30-

11. Other long-term nominally fixed securities such as corporate bonds and

    mortgages did exist over these periods, so simply setting the long—term

    market weights to zero would have been inappropriate.

         Ibbotson and Sinquefield use flower bonds in constructing their rate

    of return series for long—term government bonds. We exclude them,

    however, on the grounds that their true maturity is likely to be much

    shorter than the stated maturity.

12. The weights on duration 3 and 4 bonds are set to zero, and those for

    durations 5 through 8 are reduced by one percentage point.
