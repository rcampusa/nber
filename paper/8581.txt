                                               ABSTRACT


          This study examines the relationship between Japan’s manufactured exports to individual markets
and the economic activities of foreign manufacturing affiliates of Japanese multinational corporations
(MNCs) and U.S. MNCs in those markets. First, the relationships between Japanese export levels and
employment in foreign affiliates of Japanese MNCs are analyzed in the context of a typical gravity model
explaining the cross-country variation of Japan’s manufacturing exports. Second, the paper examines the
effects of the presence of affiliates of U.S. MNCs on Japanese export levels. And third, it analyzes the
relation of changes in Japanese exports to levels of and changes in employment in Japanese and U.S.
MNC affiliates.
          The level of Japan’s manufactured exports to a country is almost always positively related to
employment in foreign manufacturing affiliates of Japanese MNCs there. There is no evidence that
Japanese-owned host country production replaces Japanese exports. However, production by U.S. MNC
affiliates in a country often tends to reduce Japanese exports to that market.
          In some industries and periods, the initial level of Japanese affiliate employment, or changes in
Japanese affiliate employment, are positively and significantly correlated with changes in Japan’s exports,
and there are no cases of significant negative relationships. The predominant effect of U.S. affiliates’
presence on changes in Japanese exports to a country is negative, but the evidence for that effect is not
strong.

1. Introduction

          This purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between Japanese manufactured exports to

individual markets and economic activity in foreign manufacturing affiliates of Japanese and U.S. multinational

corporations (MNCs) in those markets. The relationship between home country exports and economic

activities of foreign affiliates of home-based MNCs has long been a topic of interest to policy makers and

academic economists alike. The most detailed studies of this relationship use firm-level data and have focused

primarily on the United States and Sweden, because those are the countries that have published the most data on

their firms’ foreign operations and permitted the analysis of individual firm data. Recently, access to the

firm-level data underlying surveys of Japan’s MNCs by MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry,

various years and 1998), has facilitated similarly detailed studies of the relationship between exports by

Japanese MNC parents and economic activities in affiliates of those MNCs (e.g., Amano, Fukao, and Toyonaga

1998; Fukao and Chong 1997; Lipsey, Ramstetter, and Blomström 1999, 2000b).1 However, it is also of great

interest from a public policy point of view to ask how production abroad is related to a home country’s

aggregate exports, rather than only the exports of parents. Such production might have an impact on the

country’s non-multinational firms different from that on the parent firms. For example, foreign production

might favor exporting by parents at the expense of exporting by non-multinational Japanese firms. As pointed

out in Lipsey, Ramstetter, and Blomström (1999, 2000b), there are as yet no studies for Japan that relate all

samples from other sources.


                                                                                                                    1
home country exports, including exports of non-MNCs, to the economic activities of foreign affiliates, as in

studies of Sweden and the United States (e.g., Blomström, Lipsey, and Kulchycky 1988). This study tries to fill

this gap in the literature by presenting evidence on this relationship for Japanese manufacturing industries in

1986, 1989, 1992, and 1995 and the periods bounded by these years.

           To do this, section 2 first examines the relationship between the level of Japanese exports to a country

and the level of Japanese affiliate employment there, in relatively large samples of 96-98 trading partners.

Section 3, for smaller samples of 41-48 trading partners, introduces the possibility that Japanese exports to a

country are adversely affected by the activity of competing MNCs from the United States. That would seem

likely if the activity of U.S. affiliates in a host country encouraged imports from the United States, as has been

found in many studies. Section 4 then examines the effects of initial year employment or changes in

employment of Japanese affiliates on changes in Japanese exports and Section 5 adds initial employment or

changes in employment of U.S. manufacturing affiliates to this analysis. Finally, section 6 offers some

concluding remarks.




2. Japan’s Manufactured Exports and Employment in Japanese Manufacturing Affiliates

           As in previous studies of this nature, a typical gravity model is taken as the basis for explaining the

variation of Japan’s manufacturing exports across countries.2 Explanatory country variables include its size,


2
 Manufactured exports and manufacturing affiliates are defined here to exclude oil and coal products, except for Japanese
affiliates. In the case of Japanese affiliates, revised estimates of affiliate employment from the panel data underlying Fukao,


                                                                                                                             2
measured by real gross domestic product (GDP), per capita GDP, and its distance from Japan. The sign of the

coefficient on the GDP variable is expected to be positive, reflecting the positive influence of larger size on the

demand for imports in a given country. Conversely, the sign of the coefficient on the distance variable is

expected to be negative as the distance variable is thought to be positively correlated with transactions costs

incurred in trade between Japan and a given country. As discussed in Blomström, Lipsey, and Kulchycky

(1988), the sign of the coefficient on per capita GDP is indeterminate a priori. Generally, one would expect a

positive coefficient when the income elasticity of demand is high and a negative coefficient when income

elasticity is low. However, there are also supply-side effects that this variable could represent. For example,

high per capita GDP could also be correlated with a strong comparative advantage in skill-intensive products

and thus low import demand for these products. If this influence is dominant, coefficients could be negative

even in the presence of high income elasticity of demand.

           To this basic gravity model, a measure of employment in Japanese manufacturing affiliates in the

partner country is added to see if there is any relationship between employment in Japanese affiliates and

Japan’s exports to that country, after the standard gravity effects have been accounted for. In this paper, we use

revised estimates of affiliate employment from Fukao, Yuan, and Sakishita (1999) to measure affiliate activity.

Estimates of affiliate employment and sales from this source are the most comprehensive and consistent


Yuan, and Sakishita (1999) include some oil and coal product manufacturing affiliates in chemicals and other
manufacturing. However, these affiliates are relatively small in the Japanese case (see Lipsey, Ramstetter, and Blomström
2000a, Table 1).
  A more troublesome aspect of the focus on manufacturing affiliates is the implicit assumption that the effects of trading
affiliates are negligible, or at least that they do not obscure the effects of manufacturing affiliates.


                                                                                                                         3
estimates of Japanese affiliate activity available. Affiliate employment should be more correlated with affiliate

production than affiliate sales, because sales might include resales of products from the parent firm.3

         The resulting equation is:

(1a) JXH = f1a(GDPH, GDPPH, DISTH, AERH)

where:

JXH = exports by Japan in industry i to country h (million yen, translated from US dollars at period average

exchange rates)4,

GDPH = real GDP in current international prices of country h (million yen, translated from international dollars

at PPP exchange rates),

GDPPH = real GDP per capita in current international prices of country h (million yen, translated from

international dollars at PPP exchange rates)5,



3
  Affiliate value added is closer to the idea of affiliate production. However, as detailed elsewhere (e.g., Lipsey, Ramstetter,
and Blomström (1999; 2000b), one of the biggest problems encountered when using MITI’s MNC survey data (Ministry
of International Trade and Industry, various years, 2000) is the fact that the coverage of the MITI surveys varies greatly
from year to year and from variable to variable within single years. The revised estimates of affiliate employment and sales
from Fukao, Yuan, and Sakishita (1999) include estimates for non-replying firms, resulting in much larger estimates of
affiliate employment. For example, employment of affiliates reporting value added was only 47-89 percent of employment
for all reporting affiliates and only 32-51 percent of revised employment estimates in 1986, 1989, 1992, and 1995 (Lipsey,
Ramstetter, and Blomström (2000a, Table 1). The compilations of revised employment estimates used in this study differ
slightly from the published results Fukao, Yuan, and Sakishita (1999) in some industries. The cause of these differences is
unknown but these differences are very small.

 Japanese export data are calculated from Statistics Canada (1999), using the concordance given in Feenstra, Lipsey, and
Bowen, 1997, pp. 45-60, modified to include chemical fibers in textiles, not chemicals.
5
  Per capita GDP data 1986-1992 are generally taken from Penn World Tables (1995) and 1995 figures are usually
estimated by multiplying the 1992 figure from this source and growth rates (in current international dollars) for 1992-1995
from World Bank (1999). Some missing values are approximated by taking ratios to U.S. per capita GDP from World
Bank (1999) or from adjacent years and multiplying them by U.S. estimates for the missing year. Total GDP is then


                                                                                                                              4
DISTH = distance of country h from Japan6,

AERH = revised employment estimates for Japanese affiliates calculated from panel data compiled by Fukao,

Yuan, and Sakishita (1999) and provided by Ministry of International Trade and Industry (2000).

         Although employment is closely correlated with production, there are differences between distributions

of value added across host countries and distributions of employment. In addition to differences in survey

coverage, these result from differences in average labor productivity across countries and differences in labor

intensity across industries. For example, North American and European economies tend to be larger in terms of

value added than in terms of employment because they are characterized by relatively high average labor

productivity. Chemical industries tend to be larger in terms of value added because they are relatively

capital-intensive. However, in various papers in which we have used both affiliate value added and affiliate

employment (Lipsey, Ramstetter, and Blomström 1999, 2000a, 2000b; Ramstetter 2001), the results were

qualitatively similar regardless of the measure used.

          Equation (1a) is estimated in cross sections of Japan's trading partners for 1986, 1989, 1992, and 1995,

and coefficients on affiliate employment, their significance levels, and the adjusted R-squared values from OLS




estimated as per capita GDP multiplied by total population taken from World Bank (1999). Data for Taiwan are
approximated using real growth rates and exchange rates from International Centre for the Study of East Asian
Development (2000). See Lipsey, Ramstetter, and Blomström (1999, Appendix Table B1) for further details.

 Distance data come from Edward W. Sweetman Co. (1965) and U.S. Navy Department (1943); see Lipsey, Ramstetter,
and Blomström (1999, Appendix Table B1) for further details.



                                                                                                                  5
estimation of equation (1a) are reported in Table 1.7 In general, gravity models performed in accordance with

expectations, though coefficients were not always significant (see Appendix Table A1 for details). The

explanatory power of many of the gravity equations was quite high for cross section analysis as evidenced by

the relatively high values of the adjusted R-squared.

           The vast majority of the 36 coefficients on employment in Japanese affiliates are positive, and a large

number of them are statistically significant at the 5 percent level or better (Table 1). Only in wood, furniture, and

paper, an insignificant Japanese export industry, were there no significant coefficients on affiliate employment.

All but one of the coefficients for the machinery industries are positive and significant. In these industries,

which accounted for over three-fourths of Japan’s manufactured exports,8 Japanese exports are larger to

countries with a relatively large Japanese affiliate presence. The story is similar in chemicals, another relatively

large export industry. In the other relatively large export industry, metals, the results are more mixed with fewer

significant coefficients and negative, though insignificant, coefficients in 1986.




3. Japan’s Manufactured Exports and Employment in U.S. Manufacturing Affiliates


7
 Detailed estimation results for this and other specifications using affiliate value added and alternate estimates of affiliate
employment are reported in Lipsey, Ramstetter, and Blomström (2000a, Appendix Table A1). Here and in subsequent
regressions, White’s heteroscedasticity- consistent variance-covariance matrix is used to calculate standard errors when
White’s F-test for heteroscedasticity is significant at the 5 percent level or better (White 1980).
8
 Machinery categories combined to account for 77 percent of all non-oil manufacturing exports in 1986, 78 percent in 1989,
79 percent in 1992, and 78 percent in 1995. Chemicals (5 percent of the total in 1986, 6 percent in 1989 and 1992, and 7
percent in 1995) and metals (9 percent in 1986, 8 percent in 1989, 6 percent in 1992, and 7 percent in 1995) were the other
relatively large export industries (calculations from Statistics Canada 1999 using the concordance given in Feenstra, Lipsey,
and Bowen 1997, pp. 45-60 modified to include chemical fibers in textiles, not chemicals).



                                                                                                                              6
          If the activities of Japanese affiliates are positively associated with Japanese exports, it is reasonable to

expect that the activity of affiliates from other countries promotes those countries’ exports to the host countries.

Unless the additional exports come entirely from the enlargement of markets or the displacement of host

country suppliers, some could be at the expense of Japanese exporters. To investigate this possibility, we add

employment of majority-owned U.S. affiliates to equation (1a), as follows:

(2a) JXH = f2d(GDPH, GDPPH, DISTH, AERH, UEH)

where

UEH=employment (number) in majority-owned nonbank affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents (data from U.S.

Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1992, 1998),

and all other notation is as defined in equation (1a) above.

In general, economic activity in affiliates of competing U.S. MNCs is expected to be negatively related to

Japanese export levels, so we expect the coefficients on UEH to be negative.

          Equation (2a) is estimated only for 1989 and 1995. As in the previous section, Table 2 reports

coefficients on employment in Japanese and U.S. affiliates, the significance levels of these coefficients, and the

adjusted R-squared values for OLS estimates of equations (see Appendix Table A2 for details). U.S. affiliate

variables are available for relatively small samples (41-48 countries), but the difference in sample size does not

seem to have a substantial effect on the coefficients, probably because the additional countries in the larger




                                                                                                                      7
sample are mostly insignificant with respect to both exports and affiliate employment.9 It is possible to estimate

equation (2a) for only 5 industries instead of 9. Despite these differences, the addition of the U.S. affiliate

variable in equation (2a) does not affect the direction of the relationship between Japanese exports and

economic activity in Japanese affiliates, although some of the coefficients are smaller.

          More specifically, in equation (2a), coefficients on Japanese affiliate employment are positive in all

cases and statistically significant in most (Table 2). The coefficients on U.S. affiliate employment are generally

negative, suggesting that U.S. affiliate production in a market competes with Japanese exports, while Japanese

affiliate production does not at least on net balance. This relationship is similar to that found among U.S.

affiliate production in a country and imports by that country from the United States and from other countries in

Lipsey and Weiss (1981).

          The negative coefficients for U.S. affiliate employment here are significant in metals for both years

and in chemicals in 1989. However, negative U.S. affiliate coefficients in the other industries are not statistically

significant. The coefficient on U.S. employment in transportation equipment is positive and significant in 1989,

contrary to expectations, but that relationship mostly disappeared by 1995. Perhaps a greater presence of U.S.

assembly affiliates in 1989 created a market for Japanese parts and other products. Another possibility is that the

coefficients for this industry may be affected by the fact that some reported U.S.-owned production may be by



9
 Lipsey, Ramstetter, and Blomström, (2000b, Appendix Table A2) also estimate equations (1a) to (1c) using these smaller
samples and the results are very similar to results obtained in the larger samples and reported above.




                                                                                                                      8
U.S. affiliates of Japanese parents and some Japanese exports may be by U.S.-owned Japanese firms.




4. Changes in Japanese export levels

          It is now possible to perform much more reliable analyses of the relationship between changes in

exports during a given period and affiliate activity by using the revised employment estimates based on the

panel data underlying Fukao, Yuan, and Sakishita (1999). This is because the panel data underlying Fukao,

Yuan, and Sakishita (1999) correct many of the coverage problems present in the original MITI data, where

survey response rates vary greatly over time. Following Blomström, Lipsey, and Kulchycky (1988), two

relationships are examined in this respect. One is the relationship between changes in Japanese exports during a

period and foreign affiliate activity in the initial year of the period. The possibility explored in that case is that a

larger affiliate presence discourages the growth of parent exports, even if it is associated with a higher level of

parent exports. The other is the relationship between changes in Japanese exports and changes in foreign

affiliate activity during a period.

         When examining these relationships, the effects of three other factors that may influence changes in

exports are included. The first is the change in partner economy GDP, the second is the level of Japanese

exports to the partner in the initial year, and the third is the change in the ratio of Japanese export prices to the

GDP deflator in the partner economy. The resulting equations are as follows:

(1b) JXHy2-JXHy1 = f1e(GDPHy2-GDPHy1, JXHy1, gPXJPH, AERHy1)




                                                                                                                        9
(1c) JXHy2-JXHy1 = f1f(GDPHy2-GDPHy1, JXHy1, gPXJPH, AERHy2-AERHy1)

where

gPXJPH = the percentage change in the ratio of Japanese export prices (in yen) to the GDP deflator of the

partner economy (in yen, translated from partner currency at annual average exchange rates; calculated from

International Monetary Fund 2000, International Centre for the Study of East Asian Development 2000, World

Bank 1999),

y2 = postscript indicating year 2,

y1 = postscript indicating year 1,

and all other notation is as defined for equation (1a) above.

        In general, the coefficients on the change in partner GDP and on initial exports are expected to be

positive. Estimation results (see Appendix Tables A3 and A4 for details) are mixed in this respect, however.

Coefficients on the change in partner GDP are often insignificant, while coefficients on initial exports are

negative and significant in several cases. In other words, the change in Japanese exports has generally been

smaller in countries where Japanese exports were larger in the initial year. Coefficients on the price variable are

more in line with expectations, being negative in most cases and significant in several equations.

          Table 3 summarizes the most important results of these equations, showing coefficients on measures

of initial Japanese affiliate activity and changes in activity. The relationship between changes in Japanese

exports and affiliate employment in the initial year (equation (1b)) was most often statistically insignificant, but




                                                                                                                 10
the seven statistically significant coefficients were all positive, as were almost all the other coefficients. Changes

in Japanese affiliate employment were positively related to changes in Japanese exports more consistently

(equation (1c)). Half the coefficients were statistically significant and all of those were positive. Thus there is no

evidence that greater affiliate activity or faster growth in affiliate activity competes with the growth of Japanese

exports.

           A potential problem with the OLS estimates of equations (1a), (1b), and (1c) is the possibility that

Japan’s exports and the economic activities of Japanese affiliates are jointly determined. This is possible

partially because a large portion of Japan’s exports are from Japanese MNC parents (e.g., Lipsey, Ramstetter,

and Blomström, 1999, Appendix Table C1) and decisions by Japanese MNCs about the level of exports from

Japan and the level of affiliate activity are likely to be interdependent. Accordingly, in previous research,

Swedenborg (1979) and Blomström, Lipsey, and Kulchycky (1988) used two-stage least squares (2SLS) to

estimate similar equations. We have attempted similar 2SLS estimates of equations (1a), (1b), and (1c).

Unfortunately, we have been unable to find a suitable set of instruments. Thus, the 2SLS results were thus very

poor and are not reported here.10




10
 For additional instruments not included in the equations already, we tried some of the governance indicators from
Kaufman, Kraay, and Zoido-Lobatón, (1999).




                                                                                                                     11
5. The Growth of Japan’s Manufacturing Exports and Affiliates of Competing MNCs

    Just as the greater presence of U.S. affiliates tended to reduce Japanese exports to a host country, it might

also diminish possibilities for Japanese export growth, and more rapid growth of U.S. affiliates might have the

same effect. These possibilities are tested in equations (2b) and (2c) for the one available period, 1989-1995.

(2b) JXHy2-JXHy1 = f2e(GDPHy2-GDPHy1, JXHy1, gPXJPH, AERHy1, UEHy1)

(2c) JXHy2-JXHy1 = f2f(GDPHy2-GDPHy1, JXHy1, gPXJPH, AERHy2-AERHy1, UEHy2-UEHy1)

          In equation (2b) explaining the relationship between changes in Japanese exports and initial year

employment, coefficients were all positive for Japanese affiliate initial employment and negative for U.S.

affiliate initial employment (Table 4). Only one of the positive coefficients for Japanese affiliate employment

was significant (electric machinery). However, the negative coefficients for U.S. affiliate employment were

significant in 3 of the 5 industries. Results from estimating the relationship between changes in Japanese

exports and changes in affiliate employment in equation (2c) were consistent in that coefficients on changes in

Japanese affiliate employment were all positive again, but only one was statistically significant at the

conventional 5 percent level. In contrast, coefficients on changes in U.S. affiliate employment were never

significant or close to it. Thus, although relatively large levels of U.S. affiliate activity often appear negatively

correlated with Japanese export levels and changes in Japanese exports, changes in U.S. affiliate activity appear

largely unrelated to changes in Japanese exports.




                                                                                                                   12
6. Conclusions

            The evidence here is strong that greater activity of Japanese MNCs in a host country, as represented

by affiliate employment, is associated with larger exports to that country from Japan. That is true aside from

standard gravity model influences on exports such as importing country size, per capita income, and distance

from Japan. We are inclined to interpret this relationship as indicating that affiliate production, which is one

aspect of the contest among exporting countries and their firms for foreign markets, raises home country

exports.

           The usual objection to interpreting this positive relationship in this way is that there are always omitted

country characteristics, such as openness, good government, or legal institutions, which simultaneously

encourage inward investment and imports. If that were the main explanation for the positive relationship

between Japanese affiliate activity and Japanese exports, Japanese exports should also be positively related to

U.S. affiliate activity. However, Japanese exports are negatively related to U.S. affiliate employment. That fact

suggests that it is the international rivalry for markets, rather than simultaneity problems, that accounts for the

positive relationship between Japanese affiliate production and Japanese exports, a relationship found in many

studies for the U.S. and Sweden, and other countries as well.

            A positive relation to Japanese affiliate employment is found also for changes in Japanese exports to a

country, and a negative relation to U.S. affiliate employment, confirming the idea that international rivalry for

markets is the cause. Growth in Japanese affiliate employment is positively associated with growth in Japanese




                                                                                                                   13
exports to a country. However, in the one period for which data on the growth of U.S. affiliate employment are

available, we find no relation of Japanese export growth to U.S. affiliate employment growth.

Other manufacturing includes some oil and coal products; chemicals includes some oil products.
OLS=significance levels from ordinary least squares regressions.
White=significance levels use White's heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors and covariances.
F-White (Hetero.) is the F-statistic from a regression of the squares of residuals from an OLS regression on
all independent variables and their squares (no cross terms included).
