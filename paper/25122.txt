Do Survey Expectations of Stock Returns Reflect Risk-Adjustments?

                                          ABSTRACT

Motivated by the observation that survey expectations of stock returns are inconsistent with
rational return expectations under real-world probabilities, we investigate whether alternative
expectations hypotheses entertained in the asset pricing literature are consistent with the survey
evidence. We empirically test (1) the notion that survey forecasts constitute rational but risk-
neutral forecasts of future returns, and (2) the notion that survey forecasts are ambiguity averse/
robust forecasts of future returns. We find that these alternative hypotheses are also strongly
rejected by the data, albeit for different reasons. Hypothesis (1) is rejected because survey return
forecasts are not in line with risk-free interest rates and because survey expected excess returns
are predictable. Hypothesis (2) is rejected because agents are not always pessimistic about future
returns, instead often display overly optimistic return expectations. We speculate as to what kind
of expectations theories might be consistent with the available survey evidence.

1    Introduction
Expectations play an important role in macroeconomics and asset pricing. The
predominant approach in these fields is to impose the assumption of rational expec-
tations, which equates the subjective probability distribution perceived by the agents
within the model with the objective probability distribution perceived by an outside
observer equipped with a large sample of data generated by the model. The rational
expectations approach is elegant, internally consistent, and it eliminates the need
to empirically study the formation of subjective expectations—but the assumption
about expectations underlying it could be false. Recognizing this, Manski (2004) calls
on researchers to collect survey data on expectations. Measurement of expectations
allows researchers to consider alternatives to the rational expectations assumption
in an empirically disciplined way.
    A growing body of research in asset pricing follows this approach by examining
survey data on investor stock market return expectations. This literature finds that
the time-series dynamics of investor return expectations in surveys are in conflict
with the predictions of influential rational expectations asset-pricing theories. Mod-
els like Campbell and Cochrane (1999) generate volatile asset prices and predictable
returns by making risk premia counter-cyclical. By virtue of the rational expecta-
tions assumption, the subjective beliefs of investors in these models agree with the
objective distribution, and hence these theories predict that the representative in-
vestor perceives counter-cyclical expected returns. In contrast, the survey evidence in
Vissing-Jorgensen (2003), Bacchetta et al. (2009), Adam, Marcet and Beutel (2017)
and Greenwood and Shleifer (2014) suggests that investor return expectations are
pro-cyclical: Subjective expected returns are higher following high realized stock
market returns and in times of high price-dividend ratios.
    In these studies of return expectations, and more generally in much of the litera-
ture using survey measures of expectations, researchers interpret the elicited survey
expectations as a representation of subjective beliefs that are distinct from respon-
dents’ preferences. More specifically, the typical interpretation assumes that people
do not confound the probability of a state of the world with the desirability of
this state when they answer survey questions about subjective beliefs. Recently,
Cochrane (2011) suggested that a particular form of confounding of beliefs and pref-
erences could reconcile rational expectations models with the survey evidence (see
also Cochrane (2017)). Cochrane asserts that

     ”If people report the risk-neutral expectation, then many surveys make
     sence [sic].” (p. 1068)
    Under risk-neutral expectations, outcomes are weighted by their probabilities
multiplied with the marginal utility associated with the respective outcome (and
rescaled so that the weights sum to one). In other words, risk-neutral expectations
give more weight than the actual (physical) expectation to outcomes in high marginal
utility states.
    While the traditional interpretation of non-confounding of beliefs and preferences
may be plausible—after all, without evidence to the contrary, it seems natural start
with the assumption that people report what they are asked to report—its validity
is ultimately an empirical question. In this paper we therefore examine the empirical
validity of Cochrane’s assertion. Return expectations are an excellent setting for
studying this issue because asset pricing theory provides a sharp prediction: risk-
neutral expectations of returns on traded assets should equal the risk-free rate. For
instance, if a survey respondent is asked to state the expected rate of return on
a diversified portfolio of stocks over the next 12 months, Cochrane’s risk-neutral
expectations hypothesis predicts that the respondent should respond with the 12-
month risk free rate as their expected rate of return.
    We use several different surveys of individual investors, professional investors,
and Chief Financial Officers (CFO) covering various sample periods from the 1980s
until recently. The implication of the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis that ex-
pected returns equal the risk-free rate is strongly rejected. Unconditionally, survey
expectations of stock market returns exceed the risk-free rate by 1 to 5 percentage
points depending on the survey and sample period and the difference is highly sta-
tistically significant. Conditionally, the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis predicts
that deviations of survey expected returns from the risk-free rate should be random
measurement errors that are unrelated to cyclical variables. However, we find that
for almost all surveys and forecast horizons, the stock market’s price-dividend (P/D)
ratio predicts the direction of the deviation. Specifically, for individual investors and
CFOs, the deviation is pro-cyclical: expected stock returns exceed the risk-free rate
when the P/D ratio is high.
    Overall, the empirical evidence strongly rejects the hypothesis that survey re-
spondents report a risk-neutral expectation. As we show, this is a rejection in a very
general sense. We can allow for differences in opinion, heterogeneous preferences,
and biased subjective beliefs and we still obtain that risk-neutral expected returns
equal the risk-free rate. In the absence of trading frictions, heterogeneous individuals
should adjust the risk-profile of their portfolio and their borrowing and lending such
that their future time-discounted expected marginal utilities align with the current
risk-free rate. As a consequence, their risk-neutral expected rates of return are all
equal to the risk-free rate. The rejection in our tests thus implies that there exists


                                           3
no internally consistent probability measure that can reconcile the observed survey
data with the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis in a frictionless setting.
    These results also hold up if we replace Treasury yields with variable mortgage
rates as alternative risk-free rate proxy. To the extent that there is a friction-induced
wedge between borrowing and lending rates, a collateralized borrowing rate may be
a better proxy for the risk-neutral expected return than a Treasury rate. However,
using this alternative risk-free rate proxy does not materially change the results.
    While the data clearly reject the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis for survey
expected returns, this still leaves open the possibility that preferences and beliefs
are confounded in other ways. For example, Manski (2017) reviews several exam-
ples from the literature in which individuals appear to overestimate the probability
of extremely bad outcomes such as death or being a crime victim. In asset pric-
ing, a distorted probability measure that overweights bad outcomes can be used to
represent ambiguity aversion or concerns about model misspecification (Hansen and
Sargent (2001)). Bhandari, Borovička, and Ho (2016) use survey expectations of
macroeconomic variables to estimate such distorted probabilities. However, the fact
that decision-making of ambiguity averse or robustness-seeking individuals can be
modeled using a distorted probability measure does not imply that survey responses
would necessarily reflect such distorted probabilities. For this reason, we investigate
this issue empirically.
    If ambiguity aversion or robustness-seeking is reflected in the beliefs elicited in
surveys, we should find that survey expected returns should be pessimistically biased
relative to rational expectations of returns. To test this prediction, we compare
survey expected returns to realized rates of return. Unconditionally, we find that the
expected stock market returns reported in surveys are approximately unbiased as
forecasts of realized returns. Conditionally, taking into account predictable variation
in the wedge between survey expected returns and realized returns, we find that
investors are roughly as many times optimistic as they are pessimistic. These findings
are inconsistent with the idea that survey expectations have a pessimistic bias due
to ambiguity aversion or robustness concerns.
    In summary, our findings show that the expected returns elicited in surveys are
not risk-neutral expectations. More generally, we do not find evidence of marginal
utility weighting or a distortion towards overweighting of bad outcomes in survey
expectations. The fact that the (pro-cyclical) empirical time-series dynamics of ex-
pected returns reported in surveys differ starkly from the (counter-cyclical) predic-
tions of leading rational expectations models therefore cannot be explained away by
positing that individuals report risk-neutral expectations. It does not appear possi-
ble to simultaneously match asset price dynamics and the survey evidence without


                                           4
entertaining some departure from rational expectations, such as extrapolative expec-
tations (Barberis et al. (2015)), learning about underlying trends in price growth
(Adam et al. (2016, 2017)), or learning from life-time experience (Collin-Dufresne,
Johannes, and Lochstoer (2016), building on Malmendier and Nagel (2011, 2016)).
    In our analysis, we work with survey data that provides respondents’ point ex-
pectations of stock market returns or stock price changes. A potential alternative
would be to work with surveys that elicit quantiles of respondents’ subjective dis-
tributions. Manksi (2017) highlights advantages of probabilistic expectations data
and he surveys research based on such data. For the specific purpose in our paper,
however, point expectations are preferable. The risk-neutral expectations hypothe-
sis makes sharp predictions about point expectations of asset returns, but we would
not be able to derive testable predictions about quantiles of subjective asset return
distributions without additional auxiliary assumptions about the functional form of
marginal utility. Nevertheless, our findings are still relevant for the literature on
probabilistic survey expectations. Our evidence that point expectations do not ap-
pear to be distorted by risk-adjustments also provides support for interpreting the
responses to probabilistic survey questions as an expression of respondents’ subjec-
tive distribution without confounding of beliefs and preferences.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we derive
testable implications of the risk-neutral expectations and pessimistic expectations
hypotheses. After describing the data sources in section 3, we present the empirical
results in 4. Section 5 concludes.


2    Hypotheses about Survey Expectations
Let Rt+1 denote a one-period return on a stock market index realized over the period
t to t + 1 and let Rtf denote the one-period return offered by a risk-free asset over
the same periods. As a benchmark, we consider an investor i who can freely trade
in both instruments. The effects of trading constraints will be discussed below. The
investor’s first order conditions imply that the returns must satisfy
                                           i
                                1 = EtP [Mt+1
                                          i
                                              Rt+1 ]                                (1)
                                         Pi
                                         i
                                1 = Et [Mt+1 ]Rtf ,                                 (2)
          i
where Mt+1  is the agents’ one-period stochastic discount factor (SDF) from t to t + 1
      P i
and Et is an expectations operator that is based on some (potentially subjective)
probability measure P i . Specific asset pricing theories give rise to specific forms of
the SDF i or make specific assumptions about P i , but we shall not be concerned with

                                           5
this here: the testable implications derived below will rely exclusively on equations
(1) and (2) being satisfied for some M i and some probability measure P i . In fact,
we can even allow M i and P i to differ across investors.
    Equations (1) and (2) assume that agents can (at the margin) freely trade in the
stock and in the bond market. This is in line with the assumptions made in a wide
range of representative agent asset pricing models, e.g., the ones in the tradition of
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) or Bansal and Yaron (2004). Limited participation
models, e.g., the one considered by Guvenen (2009), postulate that some agents only
trade in the bond market but have no access to the stock market, while others have
access to both markets. For agents without access to the stock market, equation (1)
will not necessarily be satisfied. For agents with access to both markets, equations
(1) and (2) both hold. To avoid that our empirical results are tainted by limited
stock market access, we shall consider below mainly survey sources for which we
know that survey respondents do have stock market access.

2.1     Risk-Neutral Expectations
Let Eti [.] denote the expectations of individual i measured in a survey.
   The hypothesis put forward by Cochrane (2011, 2017) is that survey returns are
expectations of risk-neutral stock returns, i.e.,
                                             "                  #
                                                     i
                                           i     M
                         Eti [Rt+1 ] = EtP      Pi
                                                    t+1i  Rt+1 + εit ,      (3)
                                               Et Mt+1

where the term pre-multiplying Rt,t+1 inside the expectations operator is a Radon-
Nikodym term that transforms the ‘physical’ probability of future states, which enter
                                       i
the computation of the expectation EtP [·], into a ‘risk-neutral’ or ‘marginal-utility
weighted’ probability.1 The measurement error εit captures the fact that we measure
   1
     Let st denote the state in t and pi (st+1 |st ) the physical probability (implied by P i ) of tran-
sitioning from st to state st+1 in t + 1. The risk neutral probability ni (st+1 |st ) of reaching state
st+1 given state st is then

                                                                  M i (st+1 |st )
                             ni (st+1 |st ) ≡ pi (st+1 |st )      i                  ,
                                                               EtP [M i (st+1 |st )]
so that under the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis, we get
                                                           i
                                       Eti [Rt+1 ] = Etn [Rt+1 ] + εt ,
          i
where Etn [·] is the expectations operator that integrates over states using the probabilities
ni (st+1 |st ).

                                                       6
the true expectations only with noise.
    Note that Cochrane’s (2011, 2017) hypothesis is stronger than what is stated in
equation (3): it additionally postulates that P i is a ‘rational’ or ‘objective’ proba-
bility measure. This additional constraint, however, turns out not to be relevant for
the arguments that follow, prompting us to proceed with the more general case in
which agents are allowed to have objective or subjective beliefs.
    Equation (3) implies that future returns that materialize in states in which
marginal utility and thus the SDF is high (low) are treated by agents as if they
are more (less) likely than under the objective measure and thus lead to an upward
(downward) ‘distortion’ of the expected returns relative to plain return expecta-
tions. Under the risk-neutral return hypothesis, survey expectations can thus look
‘distorted’, when wrongly interpreting them as plain return expectations. Therefore,
the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis could potentially help reconcile rational ex-
pectations asset pricing theories with the survey evidence.
    Equation (3) together with equations (1) and (2) implies

                                   Eti [Rt+1 ] = Rtf + εit ,                           (4)

which shows that under the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis survey expectations
of future stock returns must equal - up to a measurement error - the risk-free interest
rate. This is intuitive, as under the risk-neutral measure all subjectively expected
returns are identical and equal to the risk-free interest rate. This implication of
the risk-neutral return hypothesis can be tested empirically. Specifically, since it is
possible to interpret returns as nominal returns and the stochastic discount factor as
a nominal discount factor, one can test equation (4) directly using nominal return
expectations from surveys and nominal risk-free interest rates. A failure of equation
(4) to hold will thereby imply that there exists no (objective or subjective) probability
measure P i that is consistent with the risk-neutral return hypothesis.
    Let Et [Rt+1 ] denote the mean (or median) of a cross section of survey return
forecasts {Eti [Rt+1 ]}. Since equation (4) holds for every investor, it also holds for the
mean (median) of these survey return expectations, i.e.,

                                   Et [Rt+1 ] − Rtf = εt ,                             (5)

where εt is the cross-sectional mean (median) of the individual measurement errors
εit . We assume E[εt ] = 0, but we allow εt to be autocorrelated over time.
      Unconditional test. We can then examine the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis
by estimating a in
                          Et [Rt+1 ] − Rtf = a + εt .  (RN-U)                      (6)

                                              7
and testing the null hypothesis H0 : a = 0.
    Conditional test. In addition to this prediction about unconditional means, the
risk-neutral expectations hypothesis also implies a strong prediction about the time-
series dynamics: Since the wedge Et [Rt+1 ]−Rtf should be zero except for measurement
error, it should not be correlated with any covariates that are uncorrelated with
the measurement error. For example, macroeconomic variables or standard market
return predictors in asset pricing should not correlate with the wedge. On the other
hand, this wedge would be strongly correlated with such variables under interesting
alternative hypotheses. For example, if respondents report rational expectations
without risk-adjustment, the wedge in reported expectations should be equal to the
conditional market risk premium (absent measurement error). Any covariates xt that
are correlated with wedge Et [Rt+1 ] − Rtf should predict Rt+1 − Rtf with the same sign.
We therefore consider the specification

                    Et [Rt+1 ] − Rtf = a0 + a01 xt + εt .   (RN-C)                  (7)

where the vector xt includes predictor variables that could, for example, capture
variation in Et [Rt+1 ] − Rtf . The risk-neutral expectations hypothesis implies H0 :
a0 = 0 ∧ a1 = 0.

2.2    Pessimistic Expectations
A less extreme hypothesis than the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis is one where
investor expectations are pessimistically biased, but not all the way down to the risk-
free rate. For example, investors that are averse to ambiguity or that are seeking
robustness make decisions as if they hold pessimistically biased expectations about
asset returns compared with rational expectations. The SDF in these models can
                     i
be represented as Mt+1   = Ait+1 Qit+1 , where Ait+1 is a conventional marginal utility-
based SDF and Qit+1 , with Et [Qit+1 ] = 1, can be viewed as a belief distortion that
overweights bad states of the world.
    Whether expectations reported in surveys reflect these belief distortions is an
open question. Bhandari, Borovička, and Ho (2016)), for example, assume so. How-
ever, this need not be the case. Even if investor choices and asset prices can be
accurately characterized by viewing Qit+1 as a belief distortion, this does not imply
that when investors are asked to state their expectations in a survey, they report
the expectations distorted by Qit+1 . Whether they do so is an empirical question
that we investigate here. Resolving this issue is important for interpretation of sur-
vey measures of expectations and also for the empirical measurement of ambiguity
aversion.

                                              8
      The hypothesis that the belief distortion affects survey expectations implies

                                   Eti [Rt+1 ] = Et [Qit+1 Rt+1 ] + εit .                            (8)

Since R is the return on a risky asset that pays off systematically more in good
states, its payoff is negatively correlated with Q. Therefore,

                 Eti [Rt+1 ] = Et [Rt+1 ] + cov(Qit+1 , Rt+1 ) + εit < Et [Rt+1 ] + εit              (9)

i.e., the belief distortion leads to a pessimistic bias in expectations.2
     Since (9) holds for every individual, it also holds for the mean (or median)

                                      Et [Rt+1 ] < Et [Rt+1 ] + εt                                 (10)

where εt is the cross-sectional mean (median) of the individual measurement errors
εit .
    Unconditional test. Based on (10) we can then examine the pessimistic expecta-
tions hypothesis by estimating the average pessimism bias b ≡ E[Et (Rt+1 )−Et (Rt+1 )]
in
                            Et [Rt+1 ] − Et [Rt+1 ] = b + et ,                  (11)
where et = Et (Rt+1 ) − Et (Rt+1 ) − b is a composite residual with E[et ] = 0 that
contains the measurement error εt as well as the time-varying part of the beliefs
wedge that is not due to εt . We allow et to be serially correlated. The inequality
(10) implies H0 : b < 0.
    However, Et [Rt+1 ] is unobservable. One approach is to substitute in Rt+1 =
Et [Rt+1 ] + ηt+1 , which yields

                        Et [Rt+1 ] − Rt+1 = b + et − ηt+1               (PE-U1)                    (12)

A potential problem with this approach is that average realized returns can be sub-
stantially different from rational conditional expected returns over extended periods
of time. Since some of our survey series are quite short, this could be a serious
problem. For example, the 1990s were a period in which return predictions from
forecasting regressions based on the dividend yield (which indicated low expected re-
turns) differed substantially from (high) average realized returns during this period.
If survey expectations are on average below realized returns during this period, this

may not be an indication of pessimistic beliefs but instead reflect sampling error.
Put differently, since even somewhat precise estimation of expected returns requires
very long sample periods, just replacing Et [Rt+1 ] with realized returns could be very
inefficient.
    An alternative and likely more efficient approach is to substitute the expected
returns Et [Rt+1 ] in (11) by the fitted value, Êt [Rt+1 ], from the predictive regression

                                      Rt+1 = k0 + k10 zt + ut ,                                  (13)

where zt includes commonly used return predictors, e.g., the dividend yield, and ut
is a potentially serially correlated residual. The fitted value is also a noisy estimate
of the conditional expected returns, but it should be substantially more precise than
the average realized return over a relatively short time period. In particular, to yield
more precise estimates, the first stage regression to generate Êt [Rt+1 ] could be run
on a sample that is much longer than the time series of survey expectations. Such a
longer time series helps reducing small-sample biases in the predictive regression.
    For this approach to be valid in terms of consistency, zt does not necessarily
have to be in the information set of survey respondents, as this would not bias the
estimate of the unconditional mean wedge b.3 Using this approach, we estimate the
coefficient b in

                     Et [Rt+1 ] − Êt [Rt+1 ] = b + et + ωt ,         (PE-U2)                    (14)

where ωt ≡ Et [Rt+1 ] − Êt [Rt+1 ], and test H0 : b < 0. Since Êt [Rt+1 ] is a generated
variable, we need to adjust the standard errors accordingly. Appendix A provides
the asymptotic distribution.
    Conditional test. Pessimism due to ambiguity aversion would not only imply
pessimism relative to rational expectations on average, but also conditionally, period
by period. As already indicated in (11), the expectations wedge may be time-varying.
Since the inequality (10) holds in every state, it also holds if we condition on a vector
of covariates xt , with E[εt |xt ] = 0, so that

                                 E{Et [Rt+1 ] − Et [Rt+1 ]|xt } < 0                              (15)

Assuming that this conditional expectation is approximately linear in xt , we have

                             Et [Rt+1 ] − Et [Rt+1 ] = b0 + b01 xt + et ,                        (16)
   3
      However, if zt is not in the information set, then statistical power is lost, as any deviation of
Êt [Rt+1 ] from Et [Rt+1 ] adds noise.

                                                  10
where et = εt + Et [Rt+1 ] − Et [Rt+1 ] − E{Et [Rt+1 ] − Et [Rt+1 ]|xt } and so E[et |xt ] = 0.4
The pessimism hypothesis implies that b0 + b01 xt < 0. For this linear model to
be consistent with this inequality, xt needs to be suitably bounded. The rational
expectations alternative implies b0 = 0 ∧ b1 = 0.
    We can again follow two approaches to deal with the unobservability of Et [Rt+1 ]
in (16). The first approach is to substitute in Rt+1 = Et [Rt+1 ] + ηt+1 , which yields

                 Et [Rt+1 ] − Rt+1 = b0 + b01 xt + et − ηt+1           (PE-C1)                (17)

For E[ηt+1 |xt ] = 0 to hold, we require that xt is in the information set of survey
respondents. As before, this approach suffers from the fact that Rt+1 is an extremely
noisy proxy for Et [Rt+1 ].
   The second approach substitutes the fitted value, Êt [Rt+1 ], from the predictive
regression (13), which yields

                Et [Rt+1 ] − Êt [Rt+1 ] = b0 + b01 xt + et + ωt       (PE-C2),               (18)

where ωt = Et [Rt+1 ] − Êt [Rt+1 ], as before in the unconditional case above. To have
E[ωt |xt ] = 0, we need that xt is in the information set of survey respondents and is
included in zt . We show in Appendix A how to obtain the asymptotic distribution
of the estimator in this case.


3       Data
We use data on stock market return expectations from several different data sets,
which, to the best of our knowledge, cover all available quantitative data on U.S.
stock market return expectations of individuals who are not professional forecasters.
Table 1 provides summary statistics for the different survey data sets.

3.1     Survey data sources
The first data set is the Duke CFO Global Business Outlook, a quarterly survey
conducted by Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business and CFO magazine. As
Table 1 shows, the sample contains about 400 observations per quarter. Respondents
    4
    At this point, we do not need to assume that xt is in the time-t information set of survey
respondents. If it’s not, all it means is that we cannot replace E{Et [Rt+1 ]|xt } by E[Rt+1 |xt ].
However, for implementation of the estimation in terms of observables below, we will need the
assumption that xt is in the survey respondents information set.

in the survey provide the rate of return they expect on the S&P500 index over the
next year. We obtain the median and mean responses from this survey.
    The second data set is the UBS/Gallup survey.5 The survey is based on a na-
tionally representative sample. But to participate in the survey, respondents need
to hold stocks, bonds, or mutual funds of a combined value of at least $10,000. We
use data from February 1999 onwards when the survey was conducted on a regular
monthly basis until 2007 with about 700 observations per month. We also observe
whether the respondent household holds more than $100,000 in stocks, bonds or
mutual funds. As Table 1 shows, this subsample of wealthy households accounts for
somewhat less than half of the sample. We use data from two survey questions about
expected returns. The first questions asks about the return that the respondent ex-
pects from an investment in the stock market during the next twelve months. This
question is available until April 2003. The second expectations question asks for the
return that the respondents expect on their own portfolio. This question was in the
survey until October 2007.
    The third data set is a series constructed by Nagel and Xu (2018) that uses addi-
tional surveys to extend the UBS/Gallup survey forward and backward in time. We
use the data from 1987m6 onwards when observations are available monthly without
gaps. In this series, the missing market return expectation in the UBS/Gallup survey
from 2003 to 2007 is imputed from the own portfolio return expectation as the fitted
value from a regression of expected market returns on own portfolio expectations in
the part of the sample where both are available. This series further includes mean
one-year return expectations from Ameriks et al. (2016) (one survey in 2014). The
series is then extended using data from surveys that do not have percentage return
expectations, but coarser measures of investor beliefs. This is done by regressing
the available return expectations on the average reported probability of a rise in the
stock market in the Michigan Survey of Consumers (available from 2002 to 2016) and
the fitted value is used to extend the percentage expectations series. This extended
series is then regressed on a measure of the proportion of respondents expecting a
rise in the stock market in surveys conducted by the Conference Board (1987-2016,
monthly) and the fitted value used to extend the expected return series.
    The final two data sets are surveys are from Robert Shiller and the Investor
Behavior Project at Yale University.6 The surveys are based on two samples: wealthy
individual investors and institutional investors. Each individual response includes the

day on which the survey was completed. The data set starts in January 1999 and we
use data until August 2015. The average number of responses per quarter is 75 (60)
for the individual (institutional) investor data set. Survey respondents are asked
to forecast the percentage change in the Dow Jones Industrial Index over various
horizons (3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 10 years).

3.2    Matching with returns data
In the tests of the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis, we compare survey expecta-
tions to risk-free rates over a matched maturity. For maturities from 3 to 6 months,
our baseline tests use daily U.S. Treasury Bill yields, obtained from the FRED
database at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. For maturities from one to
ten years, we use daily zero-coupon yields from Gürkaynak et al. (2007).7 We also
explore alternative specifications in which we use the 1-year adjustable mortgage rate
from the FRED database as a proxy for individuals’ collateralized borrowing rates.
Since this series has been discontinued at the end of 2015, the empirical results using
mortgage interest rate have 2015 as their sample end. We convert all yields into
effective yields over the relevant maturity.
    For each survey source and survey forecast horizon we use the risk-free interest
of a corresponding maturity prevailing at the reported survey date. For the CFO
survey, we know a reference date, which is a day very close to when the survey was
sent (by fax). The survey administrators request a response within a few days from
this reference date. We match the survey responses with the risk-free rate on the
reference date. For the UBS/Gallup survey, we know the 2-3 week period in which
the survey took place and we use the average daily yield during this period. The
extended UBS/Gallup series is monthly and we match survey expectations with the
yield at the end of the month preceding the survey month. For the Shiller data
sets, for which we observe the response date of each individual survey response,
we match each survey response with the interest rate prevailing on the day of the
survey. Since the Shiller surveys ask about price growth on the DJIA, but the test of
the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis requires a total return, we adjust the price
growth series by adding the DJIA dividend yield at the end of the month preceding
the survey date, adjusted for the relevant forecasting horizon assuming the dividend
yield stays constant.
    In tests of the pessimism hypothesis, we compare survey expectations with returns
or price growth of stock market indices. In case of the CFO survey, we match the

survey expectations with the total return on the S&P500 index over the one-year
period starting from the reference date. For the UBS/Gallup survey, we use the
return of the same series over the one-year period starting from first day of interview
period. For the monthly extended UBS/Gallup series, we use a one-year total return
on the S&P500 index from the end of the month prior to the survey month. For the
Shiller surveys, we use price growth on the DJIA realized over the relevant horizon
starting from the date of individual response.
    Having computed the wedges between survey expectations and returns, we then
aggregate the data to time series by computing means or medians within months or
quarters as shown in the second and seventh column of Table 1.

3.3    Matching with conditioning variables
In several tests, we use the price-dividend (P/D) ratio as a conditioning variable
(RN-C, PE-C1, PE-C2). We use the S&P500 P/D ratio for the CFO and UBS
surveys, the CRSP value-weighted index P/D ratio for the UBS extended series and
the PE-C2 test with the Shiller survey, and the DJIA P/D ratio for the PE-C1 test
with the Shiller surveys. In terms of timing, we use the P/D ratio measured at the
end of the last month preceding survey reference date for the CFO survey, at the
end of the last month preceding first day of interview period for the UBS survey, and
at the end of the last month preceding the date of the individual response for the
Shiller surveys.
     Furthermore, some tests use an estimate of objective conditional expected returns
Êt [Rt+1 ] that we construct from a predictive regression with the price dividend ratio
(PE-U2, PE-C2). We use monthly returns or price growth and the S&P500 P/D
ratio for the CFO survey and the CRSP value-weighted index P/D ratio for all the
other tests. When we construct the fitted value Êt [Rt+1 ], we do so using a P/D ratio
that is timed relative to the survey date in the same way as explained above, with
the exception of the Shiller survey where we use the P/D ratio at the end of the
quarter preceding the interview quarter. We construct multi-period return forecasts
by using multi-period realized returns on the left-hand side of equation (13).


4     Empirical Results
4.1    Risk-neutral expectations hypothesis
Table 2 reports results for the RN-U test based on equation (6) using Treasury rates
as risk-free rates. This test looks at the most basic implication of the risk-neutral

                                          15
expectations hypothesis: Are subjective expected returns on average equal to the
risk-free rate over the forecast horizon? As the table shows, the answer is a clear no.
For surveys from all sources and horizons except the Shiller individual investor survey
using medians over a 10-year horizon, the subjective expected returns elicited in the
surveys exceed risk-free rates by several percentage points. As the t-statistics and
p-values show, we can reject the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis at extremely
high levels of significance. There is also a remarkable degree of consistency across
different types of survey respondents. Subjective expected returns exceed risk-free
rates, contradicting the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis, for business practition-
ers (CFOs), professional investors, wealthy individuals, and individual investors.
    The risk-neutral expectations hypothesis not only implies that the unconditional
average subjective expected excess return is equal to the risk free rate, but also
that this equality holds conditionally, state by state. The RN-C tests based on (7)
reported in Table 3 shed light on this conditional version of the risk-neutral expec-
tations hypothesis. We use Treasury rates as risk-free rates and the P/D ratio as
the regressor xt that could drive time-variation in subjective expected excess returns
under the alternative hypothesis. We obtain small-sample bias-adjusted coefficient
estimates and simulate F -statistics under the null hypothesis of risk-neutral expec-
tations, as described in Appendix B.
    The main test of the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis is the test of the joint
hypothesis a0 = 0 and a1 = 0. As the results in Table 3 show, this hypothesis is
rejected at the 5% level for all but 4 of the 27 survey series. Like the unconditional
tests in Table 2 the conditional tests here indicate that there is a substantial wedge
between the subjective expectations of returns and risk-free rates.
    To what extent does this wedge vary with the P/D ratio? The bias-adjusted
point estimates of a1 point to an interesting difference between individual and pro-
fessional investors. For almost all survey series with individual investor respondents
and CFOs, the estimates of a1 either indicate a statistically significant positive re-
lationship of subjective expected excess returns to the P/D ratio, or the estimates
are not significantly different from zero. In contrast, the subjective expected excess
returns of professional investors in the Shiller survey are, with one exception (mean
series at 10-year horizon), negatively related to the P/D ratio at the 5% significance
level. For both individuals, CFOs, and professionals, however, the joint hypothesis
of a0 = 0 and a1 = 0 is overwhelmingly rejected.
    The statistically weak relationship between subjective expectations and the P/D
ratio in Table 3 contrasts with the much stronger relationship documented in Green-
wood and Shleifer (2014). The key difference is that here we examine subjective
expected excess returns while Greenwood and Shleifer use expectations of total re-

 This table presents tests of the RN-U hypothesis. The column labeled a reports the mean of the
subjective expected return (in terms of percent) in excess of the risk-free rate (based on Treasury
securities) over the relevant horizon. The t-statistics and p-values are based on a Newey-West

Figure 1: Fitted values from regression (7) of subjective expected returns in excess
of Treasury rates on the P/D ratio in the UBS extended sample




turns as dependent variable. During our sample period, the P/D ratio and Treasury
rates are positively correlated and hence subtracting the risk-free rate from the sub-
jective expected return weakens the positive relationship with the P/D ratio, see also
the analysis in Adam, Marcet and Beutel (2017), which presents regression estimates
for both excess returns and plain returns.
    However, for the UBS extended series, where we have the longest time series,
and hence more statistical power than for the shorter series, we can still reject the
hypothesis a1 = 0 with a high level of statistical confidence. Figure 1 shows the
fitted values of subjective expected returns in excess of Treasury rates based on the
bias-adjusted point estimates of a0 and a1 along with two-standard-error bands from
the RN-C test regression (7) for the UBS extended sample. The figure shows that
the estimated subjective conditional expected excess return is, in conflict with the
predictions of the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis, far above zero throughout
the whole sample. The lower boundary of the two-standard-error bands never in-

                                         19
clude zero anywhere. Since the survey expectations in a given period likely contain
substantial measurement error, the projection in Figure 1 might provide a better
description of the time-series dynamics of the true subjective expectations than the
raw measures of subjective expected excess returns. But even the raw series of
Et [Rt+1 ] − Rtf never dips below zero.
    The results we have presented so far could potentially be rationalized under the
risk-neutral return hypothesis if individuals are borrowing constrained and face very
high shadow interest rates, with the consequence that their risk-neutral expectations
of stock returns could be substantially higher than Treasury rates. However, the
fact that the RN-U and RN-C tests reject the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis
for the subsample of wealthy investors in the UBS survey, the Shiller individual in-
vestor survey (which is also based on a sample of wealthy individuals), CFOs, and
professional investors in the Shiller survey cast doubt on this alternative explana-
tion. First, for these samples of wealthy investors and professionals, the borrowing
constraints story does not appear plausible—especially if it requires shadow rates
that are four or more percentage points above Treasury rates. Second, the point
estimates of a for the CFO, UBS wealthy, and Shiller individual survey at the 1-year
horizon in Table 2 are very similar to the a estimated from the full UBS sample,
which suggests that the on average less wealthy individuals in the full UBS sample
are not systematically different from wealthy investors and professionals in terms of
their subjective expected return.
    A more subtle friction-based explanation could be that there is a wedge between
borrowing and lending rates. If the borrowing margin is relevant for many house-
holds, the Treasury rates that we have used so far may not be the relevant interest
rates in households’ Euler equation (2). Instead, borrowing rates may be more rele-
vant. For this reason, we re-run the RN-U and RN-C tests with subjective expected
excess returns calculated relative to one-year adjustable mortgage rates. We use
a collateralized borrowing rate rather than an unsecured borrowing rate to avoid
contamination by a substantial credit spread.
    Table 4 presents the results. The basic message from this table is that there isn’t
much difference to the earlier tests with excess returns relative to Treasury rates.
For example, in the unconditional test, we still reject the risk-neutral expectations
hypothesis for all (one-year horizon) series, just as we did in Table 2. The point
estimates for a are slightly smaller, but all of them are still substantially greater
than zero by about one to five percentage points. Similarly, for the conditional test
of the hypothesis a0 = a1 = 0, we reject the null at a 5% level for all but one
of the survey expectations series. Overall, taking into account the potential effects
of differences in borrowing and lending rates doesn’t help much to rescue the risk-

Table 4: Unconditional and Conditional Tests of the Risk-Neutral Expectations Hy-
pothesis: Adjustable Mortgage Rates as Risk-free Rate
 This table presents tests of the RN-U and RN-C hypotheses using one-year adjustable mortgage
rates as risk-free rate to compute excess returns. We use only survey series where the forecasting
horizon is one year. For the unconditional test RN-U, the column labeled a reports the mean of the
subjective expected excess return. The corresponding p-values are based on a Newey-West estimator
with 4 lags for quarterly data and 12 lags for monthly data. For the conditional test RN-C, the
columns labeled a0 and a1 report the intercept and slope coefficients, respectively, from regressions
of subjective expected excess returns on the lagged price-dividend ratio. We report the a1 estimates
multiplied by a factor of 1000. They are bias-adjusted for small samples, as described in Appendix
B. The last two columns report Monte Carlo p-values obtained by simulating F -statistics under
the null hypothesis, as described in Appendix B.

neutral expectations hypothesis.

4.2    Pessimism hypothesis
The results so far suggest that subjective expectations of returns exceed risk free
rates by substantial amounts, which is inconsistent with the risk-neutral expecta-
tions hypothesis. However, this still leaves the possibility that their expectations are
pessimistically biased relative to objective expectations of returns under the real-
world probability measure. The alternative is that survey respondents simply do
what the survey asks them to do: provide the expected return under their perceived
real-world probability measure. In this section, we report results from tests of this
pessimistic expectations hypothesis.
    Table 5 reports the results from unconditional tests. The set of columns labeled
PE-U1 presents results from estimating equation (12). A positive (negative) estimate
for the coefficient b indicates that the subjective return expectation exceeds on aver-
age (falls on average short of) the realized returns. The table also reports p-values for
a one-sided test of the weak pessimism hypothesis b ≤ 0. It shows that one cannot
reject weak pessimism for more than two thirds of the subjective expectations series.
However, the weak pessimism hypothesis includes b = 0 and only one third of the
t-statistics turn out to be negative. Moreover, none of the t-statistics would allow to
reject the alternative null hypothesis of unconditional optimism. If anything, there
is thus a tendency towards unconditional optimism rather than pessimism. Overall,
there is little evidence of deviations from unconditional unbiasedness of return ex-
pectations. In particular, the mean bias is also not significantly different from zero
for the UBS extended series for which we have the longest time series and (among
the 1-year horizon series) the smallest standard error and highest statistical power.
Subjective expected returns thus appear to be, on average, close to unbiased, which
is inconsistent with a substantial pessimism bias.
    One concern with the PE-U1 tests could be that realized returns are just too
noisy to provide much statistical power when we compare subjective expected returns
with realized returns, especially given the relatively short sample for which survey
expectations are available. This issue is addressed in the set of columns labeled PE-
U2 in table 5, which compares the subjective return expectations with fitted values
from a regression of realized returns on the lagged dividend yield estimated over
the period 1926-2017. The reported estimates in table 5 show that almost all point
estimates of b move closer to zero. The absolute value of the t-statistics, however,
are often bigger than with PE-U1 test because the standard errors of the estimation

 This table presents unconditional tests of the pessimism (PE-U) hypothesis. The columns labeled
with PE-U1 report the mean of the subjective expected return in excess of the realized return
over the forecast horizon along with the associated t-statistic and p-value based on a Newey-West
estimator with 4 lags for quarterly data and 12 lags for monthly data. The columns labeled with
PE-U2 report the mean of the subjective expected return in excess of the fitted value from a
regression of the relevant return or price growth for each survey on the lagged P/D ratio, with
regression parameters estimated with data from 1926-2017. The t-statistics and p-values in this
case are computed based on the asymptotic approximation outlined in Appendix A, including a
Newey-West estimator of the covariance matrix using 4 lags for quarterly data and 12 lags for
monthly data.

become smaller, consistent with an increase in statistical power.8 Overall, the picture
remains mixed. Some estimates of b are larger than zero, while some are smaller,
but again with the tendency towards optimism being slightly more prevalent: we can
reject the weak pessimism hypothesis at the 5% level for 11 of the 27 series, while
the weak optimism hypothesis is rejected in only one instance. By and large, this
test again suggests that subjective expectations are in unconditional terms not far
from being unbiased.
    Table 6 presents conditional tests of the pessimism hypothesis. Using the es-
timated coefficients from equations (17) and (18), it tests for all observed price-
dividend and expectations pairs, whether one can reject at the 5% level conditional
pessimism (thus implying optimistic expectations) or reject conditional optimism
(thus implying conditional pessimism). It then reports the share of observations for
which such rejections can be achieved. For the remaining share of observations, i.e.,
one minus the reported share of rejections of optimism and pessimism, no definite
conclusion can be reached at the considered significance level.
    The PE-C1 version of the test in Table 6, which is based on equation (17), looks at
the predicted wedge between subjective expected returns and subsequently realized
returns; the PE-C2 version of the test, which is based on equation (18), calculates
the wedge as the difference between the subjective expected return and the fitted
value from a predictive regression of realized returns, where the predictive regression
uses the lagged price-dividend ratio and is estimated over the period 1926-2017.
    The first notable result from Table 6 is that many observations can neither be
classified as optimistic nor as pessimistic. From a purely statistical point of view,
subjective expected returns thus are many times in the vicinity of objective expected
returns. Nevertheless, for a substantial share of observations we can reject return
pessimism. This is especially true for the UBS surveys. For other surveys, e.g.,
the Shiller individual surveys, the share of rejections of optimism and pessimism are
roughly balanced (PE-C1) or tilted in favor of rejecting optimism (PE-C2). Overall,
whether tests reject more often optimism or more often pessimism appears to depend
on the survey source. Since surveys cover different sample periods, this suggests
that the direction of rejections depends on the sample years. This conjecture is
supported by Figure 2, which uses the UBS extended sample and reports the fitted
values of subjective expected returns in excess of the estimated objective expected
returns on the P/D ratio, along with two-standard-error bands from the PE-C2
test regression (18). The deviations of subjective expected returns from estimated
objected expected returns is pro-cyclical. In boom times, like the late 1990s, investors

     This increase in statistical power occurs despite the fact that the standard errors are adjusted
for the estimation uncertainty coming from the first-stage predictive regression.

                Table 6: Conditional Tests of the Pessimism Hypothesis
 This table presents tests of the PE-C hypothesis where we regress on the lagged P/D ratio the
subjective expected returns in excess of realized returns (PE-C1) or the subjective expected return
in excess of the fitted value from a regression of realized returns on the lagged P/D ratio (PE-
C2), where the last regression is estimated over the period 1926-2017. Based on these regression
estimates, we determine, at every point in time, whether we can reject the pessimism hypothesis
(weakly negative predicted subjective excess return) or the optimism hypothesis (weakly positive
predicted subjective excess return) at a 5% level. In the PE-C1 case, the regressions are bias-
adjusted as described in Appendix B. In the PE-C2 case, the t-statistics for this test are computed
based on the asymptotic approximation outlined in Appendix A, including a Newey-West estimator
of the covariance matrix using 4 lags for quarterly data and 12 lags for monthly data.

are too optimistic. Following crashes, like in early 2009, investors are too pessimistic.
The UBS/Gallup survey includes observations from the late 90s, but no observations
from the financial crisis and its aftermath. In contrast, the Shiller surveys include
observations from the financial crisis and subsequent years. This partly explains why
these other surveys on average have a lower share of optimistic observations than the
UBS/Gallup survey.
    Overall, the results in Tables 5 and 6 show that while subjective expectations
are in unconditional terms close to unbiased, there is a substantial time-varying
conditional bias. This conditional bias flips sign and is often an optimism bias,
inconsistent with the pessimistic expectations hypothesis.

5    Conclusion
Our empirical findings show that subjective stock return expectations from a num-
ber of different surveys are not consistent with the idea that survey respondents
report expectations under a risk-neutral probability measure. We show that both
the unconditional and conditional properties of subjective return expectations de-
viate substantially from the prediction of the risk-neutral expectations hypothesis
which predicts that subjective expected returns are equal to a maturity-matched
risk-free rate. Allowing for differences in borrowing and lending rates or restricting
the sample to individuals who are unlikely to be borrowing-constrained does not
change this basic conclusion.
    More generally, we don’t find evidence that individuals report “risk-adjusted”
expectations that are pessimistically distorted relative to the empirical distribution
of stock returns. Unconditionally, average subjective expected returns are close to
average realized returns without a significant bias. Conditionally, there are substan-
tial deviations of subjective expected returns from the objective expected returns
generated by empirical predictability regressions, but these deviations are optimistic
in some periods and pessimistic in others, and they cancel out on average.
    Our results therefore suggest that the predictable time-variation in the subjec-
tive expectations error around this unconditional mean of approximately zero is the
most interesting property of these aggregated return expectations series that research
should further investigate. For example, learning from experience (Malmendier and
Nagel (2011, 2016)), return extrapolation (Barberis et al. (2015)), or learning from
price growth (Adam et al. (2016, 2017)) could contribute to these time-varying
subjective expectations errors.

A       Asymptotic distribution of test statistics
This appendix describes asymptotic distributions of test statistics that take into
account uncertainty due to the generated regressor in the tests PE-U2 and PE-C2.

A.1     Test PE-U2
Using Êt as short form for Êt [Rt+1 ] and Et for Et [Rt+1 ], we can rewrite (14) as

                              Et = b + Êt + et − (Êt − Et )                           (A.1)

and we can treat this as a generated regressors problem with the coefficient on Êt
known and equal to one.
   With the first stage regression written as

                                   Rt+1 = Zt0 k + ut+1                                  (A.2)

where Zt ≡ (1, zt0 )0 , k = (k0 , k10 )0 and Êt = Zt0 k̂.
    The derivation follows Wooldridge (2001), Appendix 6A.
    Let T1 be the sample size of the survey data and T2 the size of the sample used to
estimate Êt [Rt+1 ], with T2 > T1 . When we take limits, T1 → ∞, we keep φ = T1 /T2
fixed, so that T2 → ∞ at the same rate.
    Usual OLS calculations yield
                                              T2         h                      i

    By the central limit theorem, as T1 → ∞, with φ fixed, T1 (b̂ − b) is asymptoti-
cally normal.
    In the simplest case with Zt ut+1 and et uncorrelated at all√leads and lags, and
with et serially uncorrelated, we get an asymptotic variance of T1 (b̂ − b) of

                           Var[et ] + φGC −1 E[Zt Zt0 u2t+1 ]C −1 G0 .                                        (A.10)

With correlation between et and Zt ut+1 , the asymptotic variance becomes
                                                   p
      Var[et ] + φGC −1 E[Zt Zt0 u2t+1 ]C −1 G0 − 2 φGC −1 Cov(et , Zt ut+1 ).                                (A.11)

We can estimate the first term in (A.10) and (A.11) as
                                                   T2

and the covariance term in (A.11) as
                                            T2

and φ = T1 /T2 .
   The empirical implementation is based on further generalization of the above
cases. To account for serial correlation of {et }, the first term in (A.10) and (A.11) is
replaced by

To account for serial correlation if {ut+1 }, the expectation in the second term in
(A.10) and (A.11) is replaced by

Finally, to account for serial correlation between et and Zt ut+1 , the covariance in the
third term in (A.11) is replaced by

The variance terms introduced by (A.16)–(A.18) should be estimated using HAC-
estimators. The empirical implementation employs the Newey-West estimator.

A.2     Test PE-C2
The derivation follows the same lines as above in the PE-U2 case. Bring Et [Rt+1 ]
to the RHS of (16) and treat like a generated regressor with coefficient constrained
to one. The only difference to earlier derivation to the PE-U2 case is that here we
estimate slopes as well as a constant. As a result, we get

                                      h               p i
                                  C −1 Ω̃ + φW − 2 φṼ C −1 ,                                  (A.21)

where the variance term Ω̃ is defined by

                     Ω̃ = lim Ω̃T ,       where Ω̃T ≡ (1/T1 )E[X 0 ee0 X],                     (A.22)
                           T1 →∞

the variance term W is defined by

                    W = lim WT ,          where WT ≡ (1/T2 )E[Z 0 uu0 Z],                      (A.23)
                           T1 →∞


and the variance term Ṽ is defined by
                                                          p
                                                           φ/T1 E[X 0 eu0 Z].
                                                               
                    Ṽ = lim ṼT ,      where ṼT ≡                                            (A.24)
                          T1 →∞


One should pick consistent estimators of Ω̃T , WT , and ṼT depending on the properties
of sequences {et } and {ut+1 }. As in the PE-U2 test, the numerical implementation
uses the Newey-West estimator.


B      Small-sample bias adjustments of test estimates
This appendix describes the small-sample bias adjustments performed in the tests
RN-C and PE-C1.
   Consider the system

                             Et [Rt+1 ] − Rtf = a0 + a1 xt−1 + ut ,                            (A.25)
                                          xt = ρ0 + ρ1 xt−1 + ξt ,                             (A.26)
                                          ut = χut−1 + ηt + λξt ,                              (A.27)

                                                  33
where ηt and ξt are independent i.i.d. normal random disturbances. Equation (A.25)
is the RN-C test regression equation (7) from the main text, but here for a scalar
regressor xt−1 which is the P/D ratio in our empirical implementation. In the case
of the PE-C1 test, we replace Rtf and ut in equation (A.25) by Rt+1 and ut+1 so
that (A.25) becomes the PE-C1 test regression equation (17) from the main text.
Equation (A.26) captures the fact that xt is persistent. Equation (A.27) allows
for non-zero covariance in the residuals of equations (A.25) and (A.26), and for
persistence in the residuals of equation (A.25). In the special case without persistence
(χ = 0), equation system (A.25)-(A.27) reduces to one similar as that considered in
Section 2 in Stambaugh (1999), although there with realized returns as dependent
variable. Since the empirical evidence suggests that χ > 0, we consider the more
general case.
    For the empirically plausible case with χ 6= 0, the regressor xt=1 and the residual
ut in equation (A.25) depend both on lagged values of ξt , whenever λ 6= 0. OLS
estimates of the coefficients (a0 , a1 ) in equation (A.25) are then asymptotically biased.
Furthermore, even if χ = 0, OLS estimates suffer from a small-sample bias for λ 6= 0
(Stambaugh (1999)). To address both issues, we proceed as follows:

   1. Estimate equation (A.26) using OLS and perform Monte-Carlo simulations to
      correct for the small-sample bias of the OLS estimates of ρ0 and ρ1 .

   2. Lag equation (A.25) by one period, multiply by χ, and subtract the result from
      equation (A.25). This delivers

                     Et [Rt+1 ] − Rtf = a0 (1 − χ) + χ(Et−1 [Rt ] − Rt−1
                                                                     f
                                                                         )          (A.28)
                                        +a1 xt−1 − χa1 xt−2 + λξt + ηt ,

      which can be estimated using non-linear least squares (NLLS), given the ob-
      served explanatory variables and the estimates of ξ from step 1. This delivers
      consistent estimates for χ, λ, ση2 , a0 and a1 .

   In the RN-C test the remaining steps are as follows.

   3. Compute the value of the F -statistic from our hypothesis tests H0 : a = b = 0
      and H0 : b = 0.

   4. Derive the small sample distribution of the F -statistic. This is done by simulat-
      ing (A.25)-(A.27), using our parameter estimates (with some of the parameters
      changed to the value they assume under the considered null). Estimate (A.28)
      on the simulated data and compute the F -statistic for the simulated data.

                                            34
5. Compute the small-sample bias corrected estimates of a0 and a1 by using the
   NLLS estimates from step 4 to perform a bias correction of the NLLS estimates
   from step 2. These bias corrected estimates of a0 and a1 are reported in the
   tables of the main text.

In the PE-C1 test the remaining steps are as follows.

3. Simulate (A.25)-(A.27), using parameter estimates from Step 2. Estimate
   (A.28) on the simulated data.

4. Compute the small-sample bias corrected estimates of a0 and a1 by using the
   NLLS estimates from step 3 to perform a bias correction of the NLLS estimates
   from step 2. Use these bias corrected estimates of a0 and a1 and the covariance
   matrix from step 2 to test for pessimism or optimism of observations at every
   point in time.
