            BONUSES, OVERTIME, AND EMPLOYMENT       KOREA VS. JAPAN



                                 ABSTRACT


     This paper exanined the bonus and wage behavior in Korea.
We found that both bonuses and wages in Korea respond to economic

conditions much more than their counterparts in Japan.                   This

finding may reflect the fact that the Korean labor niarket is niuch

closer to   a   spot market rather than              a   long—term contract
(lifetime employment)     niarket.      Hence the bonus/wage ratio         is

apparently insensitive to economic conditions in Korea, unlike in

Japan (Freemand and Weitzinan).        When "overtime" coniponent of the

wage is separately examined,         it responds to econoniic conditions

less than bonuses but more than base wages.

1. Introduction

     This paper establishes stylized facts on the degree of bonuses and

overtime payments       in    total     compensations,                and    their   sensitivities        with

respect    to    economic     conditions          in    Korea.         Results       are     compared,    when

possible, to those in Japan.

     Motivation for this paper is                      three-fold.          First,    a bonus system in

Japan has been studied in the context of a "share economy' in a series of

papers by Weitzman.         Among other findings, movements of the bonus-wage ratio

in Japan are positively correlated with profits, and other economic perfor-

mance variables, which is taken to be an evidence for profit-aharing. Korea,

coo, has a bonus system,              although bonuses are paid four times                          a year    in


Korea as    opposed to        twice    a year in Japan.                 The bonus portion of total

compensation      in Korea      is    still       low compared          to    Japan,       but    rising very

quickly.

     Weitzman (1986) and Freeman and Weitzman (1987) examined a hypothesis

that bonuses in Japan play a role of profit sharing proposed by Weitzman

(1984).     Freeman and Weitzman showed, among others, that the Japanese bonus

is much more sensitive to economic conditions,                              such as profits and value

added, than the base wage.             Thus, some of unexpected profits are distributed

as bonuses to workers, that is the idea of profit sharing.                                   We will examine

the same hypothesis for Korea.

      Second, overtime wages are examined as an alternative flexible part of

workers'    compensation.            Some   remain skeptical                 about    the    flexibility       of

bonuses with respect to economic conditions, despite the work by Freeman and

Weitzman,       in which overtime           payments         are      not    separated from base             wage

payments.        A major portion of bonuses are                         negotiated          in   annual   labor

negotiation       [Shunto].      Thus,        a    source        of    flexible      wages       responding    to



  6/13/89         Bonus-1.txt                      -     1   -
 economic conditions is not bonuses but flexible overtime hours and payments.

The overtime pay may automatically adjust workers' compensation depending on

 firms' profitability.

        Third,   a comparative study of Korea and Japan may be cast in a much

larger framework of search for an East Asian model for economic growth.                           In

the 1960s and 1970s, the Japanese miracle of rapid economic growth prompted

a   scrutiny on      the   Japanese   economy,       emphasizing    its   difference       from        a


western, neoclassical model)-         Recently, a miracle of rapid economic growth

has been repeated by other Asian neighbors, such as Korea and Taiwan.                              A

search for comnon ingredients, such as bonuses, for rapid economic growth

leads to a comparative study of Japan and Korea.2

        Recently,   a comparison of the Korean and Japanese labor market have

become popular; Ono (1989) compares the aspect of seniority wage and Ahn

(1982) examines the aspect of lifetime employment.                   Ono (1989)         finds that

"age"    is   a better explanatory variable            than   the   length   of experiences,

internal and external to the current employer,                  both in Japan and Korea.

Ono's analysis using microdata of the both countries                         is    a valuable

contribution.       He tries to measure major determinants of wages by regressing

the wage      on schooling,    internal   and external experiences,              age,     size-of-

employer dummy variables.       The finding supports the idea of a seniority wage

structure in both countries.          Ono gives an interpretation, beyond just a

confirmation of       "seniority structure."            He    concludes   that    the wage        is

deternined for "life security needs't            (subsistence) of the household,              that

varies with age.       However, finding a high R2for a model including age does

not necessarily discriminate the subsistence wage hypothesis from other

explanations.

        There is one seminal work toward a test of the profit sharing

hypothesis in Korea.      Joon W. Kim (1988) attempted to apply the Freeman and

Wettzman model     to   the   Korean data.       He   concludes from his     studies with

manufacturing sectoral data that bonuses are more responsive to profits (and

other economic performance variables)            than wages.    We have     improved over

Kim's results.     First, his data set unfortunately had missing observations

in 1973 and 1982, which we have filled.                Second, we have applied various

tests related to the hypothesis other than the one attempted by Kim.                Third,

we explicitly test both in Japan and Korea that the flexibility of bonuses

relative to overtime pay which is known to play a role of slack adjustment.

        The rest of this paper is organized as follows.             Next section will be

an overview of the Korean labor market.                In Section   3,   econometric tests

developed by Freeman and Weitzman will be applied to the comparable Korean

data.     Section 4 will examine the flexibility of overtime compensations, as

opposed to bonuses, using both Korean and Japanese data.                  The last section

will summarize the findings of this paper.


2.     Korean Labor Market: An Overview

(i) Mobility.

        The workers' mobility in Korea is currently much higher than that of

Japan. However, the average length of the service, the quit rate (by age and

by size of the firm) and other indicators in the present Korea are quite

comparable to the situation in Japan of the 1920s and 1930s, when lifetime

employment system started to become popular among skilled workers                   in the

booming industries,      according to Ahn (1982).           For example,     the five-year

average separation rate in Korea between 1975 and 1979 was 5.2%, while that

in Japan between 1924 and 1928 was 4.7%.              From this evidence and others, Ahn



     6/13/89    Bonus—1.txt              —   3   —
suggests that Korea may be ready                 to       adopt a    lifetime employment aystem.

High mobility of Korean workers is also documented by Soonkon Kim (1983)

During the 1970s, the separation rate in Korea was on average at 5%, while

it was 1.5% in Japan and a little over 4% in the United States (Kim (1983;

p.3)).      In 1979, 68.4 percent of workers had a tenure less than 10 years;

31.4 percent between 10 and 20 years; and only 0.2 percent had a tenure more

than 20 years (Kim (1983; p.6)).                     Kim (1983; p.13) concludes that "Korean

employers have not yet developed seniority-related welfare benefit programs

designed to prevent high turnover.'

(ii) Bonuses

     Next,    let   us     establish how prevalent bonuses                  are    in   Korea.        The

significance of bonuses            in    total       compensations       can be    measured      in   the

bonus/(monthly wage) ratio.             Figure 1 shows the time-series of the amount of

bonuses (for a year) in equivalent of (monthly) wages.4                           It shows that the

bonus-wage ratio in Korea has increased rapidly and it                            is about the        same

level with that of Japan in late 1950s.                       The Japanese experiences show that

the bonus-wage ratio had increased during its "rapid growth period," but has

declined since      the    first       oil crisis of 1973-74.              The casual reading of

trends shown in          this graph suggests that the bonus-wage ratio increases

while the economy enjoys rapid,              and probably more than expected,                    growth.

However, how bonus responds to temporal economic fluctuations around the

trend should be examined carefully.

     Table    1   shows the sectoral decomposition of the bonus/wage ratio in

Korea.   It is clearly observed that bonus ratios of different sectors move

together,     presumably     in    a    procyclical           fashion.    However,      the   range     of

sectoral numbers is quite wide.

                          Insert Figure 1             about here


 6/13/89          Bonus—1.txt                    -    4   -
        Next, in order to establish that not only top managers but also blue-

collar workers have received bonuses, we have to look at how many of the

workers receive them.               In 197],      more than 90 percent of all workers                   in

manufacturing sectors received some types of bonuses.                              Moreover,    70.5% of

production workers and 72.3 percent of office workers received bonuses at

scheduled months,             while about     7   percent    received occasional bunuses               and

about 13 percent receive both scheduled and occasional bonuses.                                 (See Ahn

(1982;    section 9.4)             This    implies     that bonus        payment    is   a   wide-spread

institution.

(iii)     Reasons for bonuses --            a survey

        Next,     let    us   examine whether        there   is     an    established view on why

bonuses are paid in Korea.                In a survey of reasons for giving bonuses, cited

in Ahn      (1982;       p.250),    a     supplement    to   workers'       life    (needs     in   living

condition)       is a majority.5           Profit sharing is not at all (except for 6.3%

for the medium-size firms) recognized as a reason for bonuses.                               A decision

for giving bonuses is mainly made unilaterally by the employer (62%), while

some of them (26%) are negotiated at the time of annual labor negotiations

(Ahn (1982; p.251).

        If these results are taken at the face value, bonuses are a result of

unilateral benevolence by employers in order to give a supplemental income

to workers who suffer from poor living conditions.                           In particular, "profit

sharing" is not at all credited in the literature as a reason of handing out

bonuses.        This description seems to be far from a profit sharing hypothesis

envisioned by Weitzman.

        However,        a bonues-as-benevolence hypothesis,                indicated by the above-

mentioned survey (and also Ono (1979)), may contradict with other facts in

the     survey.         Regularly-paid bonuses must            be    expected by employees.             If



 6/13/89           Bonus—1.txt                    — 5   —
workers expect bonuses to be paid four times a year,                  it would be hard to

unilaterally skip one, unless employees receive a good explanation, such as

an operating deficit or a negative profit.                       Moreover, paternalistic

employers may afford benevolence only when they earn more than enough.                            In

sum, findings tn survey resuLts may provide no definite answer with respect

to the nature of bonuses.         Only a careful empirical analysis answering a

following question can give a more informed reasoning.                    Are bonuses (or the

bonus/wage   ratio)   sensitive     to   corporate     profits,      even    if     it    may    not

consciously recognized by employers?

(iv) Historical Origin.

     About   the   historical     origin       of bonuses   in    Korea,     there       are    only

speculations.      While   some   sustpect that       the Japanese firms brought the

practice of bonuses during the occupation era (1910-1945), some think that

bonuses are a traditional idea in Korea: "If [bonuses] were a result of the

Japanese influence, it would be difficult to explain how quickly the [bonus

system spread after the independence."               (Ahn   (1982,   p.     247))        Moreover,

bonuses are paid twice a year in Japan and four times a year in Korea; and

it was only after the Second World War that the Japanese firms                       (in Japan)

broadened bonus payments to blue-collar workers,              and sharply increased

the wage-bonus ratio as the economy enjoyed the sustained high-speed growth

as shown in Figure 1.       Therefore, we tend to think that the Korean bonus

system has developed independently from the Japanese influence.                      We could

not find, at present, any other writings, as to how wide spread bonuses were

among Korean firms prior to the Japanese occupation.

3.    Analysis of Bonuses in Korea

(i)     Definitions

        First of all,           some terminologies are defined.                    First, annual payments

(total compensations) are divided into two parts, bonuses and monthly wages.

"Monthly wages" are defined as contractual payments that are regularly paid

every month [that is,               "Kimatte Shikyu Sareru Kyuyo"                    in Japanese] used in

                                        Note that this definition includes overtime                                 pay.
Freeman and Weitznian.

"Bonuses"        are special payments               that are not included in monthly wages.6

Second, monthly wages can be divided into "wage base,"                                      [Shotei naij             and


Thvertime pay"               [Shotel gal].       An overtime premium in Korea and Japan                               is


about 25%,        as opposed to 50%            in the United States.                 Definitions and data

concerning bonuses, wages and employment in Korea and in Japan are                                                quite


comparable.            In the rest of this section,                   wages" means "monthly wages,"

including "overtime pay."

 (ii)    Economic Fluctuations and Bonuses

        Weitzman (1986) and Freeman and Weitzman (1987) found that                                           in Japan

bonuses respond to profits more than wages, suggesting that bonuses play a

mechanism of profit sharing.                  We now take the profit-sharing hypothesis as a

working hypothesis                for   Korea.           First,   a       specification by                Freeman    and


Weitzman is used,              so that coefficients of our Korean equation are directly

 comparable to those of the Japanese equation by Freeman and Weitzman.

 Ln(B(t)/W(t)) — a0 + a1t +               b*x(t)     +    c*LnB(t-l)       +   d*LnW(tl)        +   e(t)
 where    x(t)         is    an economic      condition,          that     is,     one     of       the    following:

                  operating        profits       (PROF),     Corporate           value     added          (VA),   Gross
 Corporate

 domestic products (GDP), or Corporate net sales (NS).                                   A constant and a time

                             included    in   the    regression.               A positively significant                    b
 trend     is    also

 implies        that        the bonus/wage ratio           increases when the              economic condition


                                          Bonus-2.txt             -   7    -
improves.      Put differently, bonus            is   a contingent pay so that it              is more

responsive to economic conditions than the wage.                       All variables are deflated

by relevant components of Wholesale Price Index.

     Table 3-1 shows how the bonus-wage ratio responds to various economic

conditions.        (Coefficients of a constant, a time trend and lagged bonus and

wage variables are not reported in this table.)                       Although magnitudes of the

bonus/wage elasticities with respect to various economic conditions in Korea

are quite comparable to the Japanese counterparts, but they are not always

statistically significant at the 5% level.                   For all industries, no economic

condition has a significant coefficient.                  For the manufacturing sector, the

result    is   more     favorable    to    the    hypothesis         that   bonus   is   not    just    a


disguised wage.         Both corporate value added and corporate net sales show

positive estimates which are statistically significant.                              In particular,

profits do not appear to have a statistically significant impact on the

bonus/wage ratio.           These evidences appear to cast some doubts on the profit-

sharing hypothesis.

     Among the 2-digit manufacturing industries (shown in panel C) textiles,

apparells      and    leather    show     positive,     significant         coefficients       for    any

economic conditions.              VA and NS are often found significant in the

investigation of the 2-digit manufacturing sectors.


                            Insert Table 3-1 about here


     In     sum,      the    evidence     for     the   profit-sharing hypothesis                    from

investigating the bonus/wage ratio appears to be weaker in Korea than in

Japan.      In particular,        corporate operating profits do not influence the

bonus/wage ratio in any aggregation level.                   However, corporate value added,

and net sales in manufacturing secor,                has    a       significant influence on             the


bonus/wage ratio.

     The next test,       that is also adopted from Freeman and Weitzman is to

estimate the bonus and wage equations separately.                                In each equation,        an

economic condition variable and the lagged dependent variable are included.

In Table     3-2,    estimated coefficients          of    economic             conditions    are     shown.

(Again,    coefficients    of    a   constant    term,          a       time    trend   and   the     lagged

dependent variable are not reported in the table.)


                        Insert Table 3-2 about here


     Two observations from Table 3-2 are obvious.                              First, when responses of

bonuses and ages are compared within Korea,                         bonuses respond to economic

conditions more than wages, as Freeman and Weitzman found in Japan.                                  Second,

when an international comparison can be conducted, both bonuses and wages in

Korea     are    found more      sensitive      to    economic                 conditions     than    their

counterparts in Japan.

     The first observation is not inconsistent with findings in Table 3-1,

in which        the bonus/wage    ratio was      found not               particularly sensitive           to


economic conditions in Korea.          Imat is implied by both findings is that the

difference in elasticities of bonuses and wages with respect to economic

conditions is not statistically significant.                        This        is most evident in the

case of profits.        The bonus elasticity to profits is very large in Korea:

0.54 for all industries (0.09 in Japan) and 0.73 for manufacturing sectors

(0.14 in Japan).       This is a strong evidence for a profit sharing hypothesis

in Korea.        However, the wage also responds to profits in Korea:                            027 for

all industries (-0.05 in Japan) and 0.56 for manufacturing industries (-0.05

in Japan).       These evidences for a profit sharing hypothesis are not incon-


                                  Bonus-2.txt             - 9       -
sistent with weak evidences in Table 3-1, which use the bonus/wage ratio as

the left-hand side variable, because both a numerator and a denominator the

bonus/wage    ratio changed strongly with economic conditions,                           leaving      the

ratio rather unstable.

     Table    3-2    (panel   C)        shows    a   summary result concerning all             2-digit

manufacturing industries and with respect                        to    all candidates    of   economic

conditions,    the bonus elasticities are greater than the wage elasticities.

However, elasticities with respect to value added                         and net sales are greater

than those with respect to profits.

     In sum, both bonuses and wages respond positively to favorable economic

conditions in Korea, and those elasticities in Korea are larger than their

counterparts in Japan.             Is    there any good explanation for these findings

from institutional arrangements                  in Korea?        As explained,     there     are   some

evidences that the lifetime employment system is not (yet) instituted in the

Korean labor market.          Hence,          the market is more or less           a    "spot" market

rather than a long-term contract market in Korea.?                         Higher profits or sales

increase labor demand, which in turn increases bonuses and wages.                             Then,    it


is natural that wages,        as well as bonuses, respond to economic conditions

through changes in labor demand.

        The third test of bonus behavior is to examine bonuses as a function of

wages and economic conditions.                   Since bonuses are determined months after

wage negotiations, wages may be regarded as "predetermined" when a bonus

month    comes.     If bonuses          are     simply   a   disguised wage,       coefficients        of

economic conditions are not significant                      in       a regression of bonuses with

wages on the right-hand side.                 On the other hand, if bonuses are determined

solely by profit sharing, then the wage coefficient would be insignificant.



                                    Bonus-2.txt              -    10 -
Hence, the following equations are estimated:


    Ln(B(t)) — a0 + a1t + b*x(t) + c*LnB(t-1) + d*LriW(t) + e(t)


where b — 0, if bonuses are disguised (fixed markup of) wages; and d — 0 if

bonuses are solely "sharing."            Table 3-3 shows the regression results.


                        Insert Table 3-3 about here


        The estimation for the manufacturing sector with value added produced

reasonable estimates for the profit-sharing hypothesis: b                                0 and insigni-

ficant d.       That equation also implies that the base line for (log) bonus in

year t is determined by 47 percent of bonus in year t-l and 66 percent of

wage in year       t.   If value added increased by                    10   percent,      then bonuses

increase by 2 percent above the base line.

        Using   profits,   neither       b    nor   d    is    significant,        not    implying    one

hypothesis or the other.          Estimates involving other economic variables                       show

that the negative coefficients on wage, though insignificant, contradicting

with expected signs.

        Results among 2-digit manufacturing sectors are mixed.                             For example,

estimates for the paper and printing sector support the wage-markup

(disguised wage) hypothesis; while a result for the fabricated metal and

products sector suggests the profit sharing hypothesis.

(iii)     Bonuses and Employment

        Although results     in    the       preceding        subsection     are    suggestive       of   a


scenario in which bonuses responding to economic conditions, and much more

so than Japan, some suspicions still remain as to whether bonuses determined

in a market (like wages), or a part of profit-sharing. One way to further

differentiate these two hypotheses is to estimate an employment equation (a


                                  Bonus-2.txt             —     11 —
reduced form of the labor demand and supply functions),                                   and see whether

bonuses and wages have different coefficients on employment.

        In order to differentiate the effect of bonuses and wages on employment

behavior, EMP,        the following two specifications have been adopted:


Ln(EMP(t)) = a + bbl*Ln(W+B) + b2LnB(t) +                     bb4x(t)      +   bbSEMP(t-l)         +   ebx(t)
Ln(EMP(t)) — a + b 1*Ln(W+B) + b3LnW(t) + bw4X(t) +                            bwsEMP(tl)          +   ewx(t)

If bonuses are just disguised wage, then coefficients of b2 and b3 should be

insignificant.          We hasten         to    add that these          equations,            at   the    present

specifications, suffer from the possible simultaneity bias, which should be

corrected.

        Results are shown in Table 3-4 (which should be compared with Freeman-

Weitzman Table V) .            As   in the case of Japan, coefficients of bonuses have

positive      signs     and    those     of wages have negative                  signs,       a    surprisingly

consistent result. However, standard errors seem to be larger in the Korean

case.        In sum,    a hypothesis of bonus being                   a profit-sharing instrument

receives a mild support, if not a strong one, from a correct sign pattern in

the employment equation, with somewhat weaker significance levels, in Korea.


                            Insert Table 3-4 about here


        In   order     to     check     the    simultaneity noted above,                  a       simple vector

autoregression model with employment, wages, and bonuses is examined.                                           An

economic condition,            i.e. ,   PROF,    VA,   GDP,       or NS,       is used as          an exogenous

variable. Only one lag is allowed due to the degree of freedom problem.

(Results are not reported in this version of the paper.) There is no reason

to reject interdependence between the three variables.                              However, there is a



                                        Bonus-2.txt           -    12 -
weakly,     at   about   the   ten    to     twenty percent    significance      level   in    all

industries, from bonuses to employment.                (A similar conclusion was obtained

by Freeman and Weitzman for Japan.)               Hence, there is no statistical support

for running regressions among the three variables, and results in Table 3-4

should be taken with this caveat.

4.    Overtime Payments in Korea

       In the preceding section, we have established that bonuses are

contingent on economic fluctuations in Korea.                  Elasticities of bonuses with

respect to economic conditions in Korea are even greater than in Japan.

However,     it is also found that monthly wages strongly respond to economic

fluctuations in Korea in contrast to Japan.                 One might suspect that much of

the   monthly wage       fluctuations         comes   from overtime       payments,   which,    as

explained in subsection 3(1), is part of 'monthly wage."                      In this section,

the behavior of overtime payments are separated from the monthly wage and

examined carefully.

       When there is a demand shock, the first thing that the firm would do is

to    ask   employees    to    work       overtime.    Since   a   boom    may   be   temporary,

employment may not be adjusted when the hiring and firing costs are large.

In addition, bonuses could be paid if profits exceeded its anticipation.

Only when an increase in the product demand sustains,                     the employment level

will be adjusted.

       An adjustment in overtime pay almost automatically follows an adjust-

ment in hours, while bonuses carry                     a   discretionary portion of            the

compensation adjustment. There is no a priori reason to believe that whether

bonuses become more sensitive to economic conditions than overtime payments.

However, if bonuses as a profit sharing mechanism are to be emphasized,                         it


should be established that bonuses are more flexible than overtime payments.


      Bonus-3.TXT                     -    13 -
Otherwise,    the pay flexibilities may be regarded as a reflection of hours

adjustment.

     First,    the behavior of the (overtime)/(base wage) ratio, depending on

various economic conditions, is examined.            Table 4-1 for the overtime ratio

parallels Table 3-1 for bonuses.           In order to compare the overtime and bonus

sensitivities, the (bonus)/(base wage) and the (overtime)/(base wage) terms,

using the same denominator, are regressed on the same independent variables.


                      Insert Table 4-1 about here


     The table shows that the sensitivities of overtime pay with respect to

economic conditions are,         most of the time,     smaller than that of bonuses.

Although coefficients on economic conditions are insignificant for the all-

industries level,     they are significant at the manufacturing level.               Among

the 2-digit manufacturing industries, results using overtime are in general

not much different from those using bonuses.               This shows that overtime pays

in manufacturing sectors behave procyclically with economic conditions.

     Next we examine how the change in an economic condition affects various

components of compensations.            Table 4-2, which is in parallel with Table 3-

2, compares changes in each of bonuses, overtime payments, and the base wage

responding to profits, value added, CDP or net sales.


                      Insert Table 4-2 about here


     In Korea,      for   both    the     all-industries    and    aggregate-manufacturing

levels, all types of compensations have large and statistically significant

coefficients on most of the economic conditions.                  The sensitivity of bonus

is much greater than that of overtime, and the overtime sensitivity in turn



    Bonus-3.TXT                   -     14 -
is greater than the base wage sensitivity.           Even for 2-digit msnufscturing

sectors, the order of msgnitudes in sensitivities is mostly confirmed.                      Thst

is,   denoting by    e(x)   the   elasticity    of   x with   respect      to    an   economic

condition, the following is true in Korea:

      e(bonus) > e(overtime) > e(wsge bsse).

However, this nice relationship is not confirmed in Jspsn.                      Sometimes the

bonus sensitivity is much smaller than the overtime sensitivities, although

it is typicslly larger than the bsse wsge sensitivity.

      From these findings, we may conclude thst bonuses are more responsive

to economic fluctuations than overtime pay, at least in Korea.                        Hence,     a


suspicion thst overtime pay is more flexible thsn bonuses is now refuted by

the dats in Japan.     The conclusion would be much wesker in Jspan.

      Table 4-3 examines an alternative apecificstion for overtime psy, in

parallel with Table 3-3 for bonuses.           In this specificstion, economic condi-

tions hsve significant coefficients less often than Table 4-2 at the all-

industries and the sggregate manufacturing sector.              In general, this speci-

fication does not give us much insights on the determinant of overtime psys,

except   that   in manufacturing      sector,     overtime    psy   does    respond      to     sn

economic conditions.


                       Insert Table 4-3 sbout here


       Table 4-4,    in psrallel with Tsble 3-4,        examines whether the overtime

psy and the wsge base have different impacts on employment. No significant

 coefficient was obtained for overtime pay or the wage base                      at   the     all-


 industries level.     This is the same pattern of signs that was found in Table

 3-4 contrasting bonuses and monthly wages.                   Hence, we may apply an

 interpretation similar to one given to Table 3-4.             Overtime payments have a


      Bonus-3.TXT                 - 15 -
role quite different from wage base.                            Overtime payments are clearly

procyclical       (to employment), while the wage base                 is negatively correlated

with employment.         This    is quite consistent with any prediction from 'abor

demand     theory with         temporal       fluctuations.       Typically,     overtime     payments

behave much like bonuses in increasing employment.


                         Insert Table 4-4 about here


        In sum,    an investigation into overtime payments reveals that bonuses

and overtime payments play similar roles.                           Both respond to economic

conditions,       with   the    elasticity         of bonuses being greater           than    that   of

overtime payments.            Both have an effect to increase an employment level,

with the marginal contribution of overtime pay being greater than bonuses.

However, a further work is needed on roles of bonuses and overtime payments

in adjustments in hours, compensations, and employment.

5.    Further Investigations

(i)     Labor Market Conditions

        One of the often-heard criticism of the profit-sharing hypothesis, in

particular when the hypothesis                     is    empirically applied,         is     that the

hypothesis ignores labor market conditions, which are usually considered

to be central in the wage determination.                    In the case of wage negotiation,

an influence of the unemployment rate, for example, is important, because it

signals     the    excess      supply       condition     and    changes   relative    strength      in

negotiation.       However, an answer to the              following criticism is not obvious:

Would the amount of bonuses differ if the unemployment rate                            is    different

given     the   level    of    net profits?         In    this    sub-section,     effects     of    the

unemployment rate on the bonuses and overtime will be examined.                               To this



      Bonus-3.TXT                       -   16 -
end, the following specification is used:

ln(y(t)) — a0 +     a1t   +   bln(x(t))   +    cln(y(t-l))   +   d(UE(t))
where y — (B, OT, WE) and x is one of the economic condition variables used

in the preceding section, namely (PROF                       VA,   GDP,     NS).     Results are

summarized in Table 5-1.


                                Insert Table 5-1 about here


       There are two observations on this table.                 First, even if the unemploy-

ment rate    is   added to      the equation,       one of the salient features of              the


elasticities      with    respect   to     economic    conditions      still       holds,   namely,

e(B)>e(OT)>e(WB).         Therefore,      it   seems that adding the unemployment rate

does not change results obtained in the preceding section.

        Second, although the unemployment rate negatively influences bonuses,

overtime pay, and wage bases, as theory would expect, it is most significant

for the wage base equation.             Certainly, the unemployment rate is important

in wage (rate) negotiations, but may not be so in the bonus determination.

        This finding is a further evidence against a bonus-as-disguised-wage

hypothesis, in that bonuses and base wages are two different things in how

each responds to an economic condition and a labot market condition.

(ii)     Pooled Regression

        Since we have used annual data, as Freeman and Weitzman did, the number

of observations is not so large in Korea.               One trick to overcome the problem

of small samples is to use both time-series and cross-section data.                           Table

5-2 (A) shows a result of a pooled regression with sectoral and year dummy

variables.     Its panel (A-l) shows a familiar result, that the elasticity of

bonus with respect to an economic condition is greater than that of the

monthly wages.      Therefore, we may conclude that this result is a robust one.


       Bonus-3.TXT                  -    17 -
                          Insert Table 5-2 about here


      A null hypothesis that sectoral dummy variables are collectively zero

is tested in Table 5-2, panel (A-2).           The hypothesis is not rejected in the

wage equation and rejected in the bonus equation,                for each of the three

types of economic conditions: Bonuses are very sector-specific, while the

wage is non-sector specific. In other words,              the wage is determined in an

entire economy, due to high cross-sector mobilities.

      A different specification is attempted in Table 5-2 (B), where a trend

term is used instead of year dummy variables, while sector-specific

elasticities are introduced.         In this specification, the null hypothesis of

common intercepts and common elasticities            is    tested.      The hypothesis    is


rejected, implying that the ways bonuses and wages respond to an economic

condition are quite different from one sector to another.

6.   Concluding Remarks

      This paper examined the bonus system of Korea in contrast to that of

Japan.    The bonus-wage ratio        in Korea has been increasing rapidly and,

currently, the ratio is about the same as that of Japan in late 1950s.

      In Korea, not only bonuses but also monthly wages move procyclically

with economic conditions, so that the bonus-wage ratio does not necessarily

appear   to   be   sensitive   to   economic    conditions.    This     contrasts   to   the

movements of the Japanese bonus/wage ratio and the monthly wage.

      One might suspect that the flexible wage in Korea is due to overtime

payments that are included in "monthly wages."              When the overtime pay and

the wage base are separated,        it is revealed that not only overtime but also

wage base fluctuate with economic conditions.               In Korea,    the elasticities



     Bonus-3.TXT                -   18 -
with respect to economic conditions              are ordered as    the bonus    elasticity

being the greatest, the overtime next, and the wage base the smallest.                   This

tendency is not so clear-cut in Japan.

    Both bonuses      and overtime payments have            a   positive   effect on      the

employment level in Korea.            However,   a futher investigation is needed to

uncover   a    mechanism    of   hours,    employment,    and   payment    adjustments     in

response to economic fluctuations in Korea and in Japan.

    When the unemployment rate is added to a list of independent variable,

the wage base is found to be most sensitive to this labor market indicator.

Bonuses and overtime pay tend to be influenced more by economic conditions,

such as net sales and profits, more than the unemployment rate.

     Lastly, pooled regressions were conducted to check whether we might

have been misled using small-sample regressions.                The bonus elasticity was

found to be greater than the wage elasticity, a familiar result, even in the

pooled regressions.        Sectoral dummy variables are found to be not common for

all sectors.

     Although we investigated the Korean bonus system in various manners,

more questions came up as soon as we solved one question.                   The following

topics are left for future research.             Is there any tendency that mobility of

workers has declined due to a development of the bonus system in Korea? How

does the firm adjust overtime, bonuses, and employment?              Does the bonus/wage

ratio in Korea change systematically and significantly with respect to the

length of service and with the size of establishments, as in Japan?                 If so,

does the sectoral disparity in the size of the bonus/wage ratio and in the

bonus elasticities reflect any institutional, demographic differences amond

the sectors? In any case, we hope that this paper stimulates more research

on the Korean labor market with comparative perspectives.

1.   Widespread bonuses,   including those to blue-collar workers,        have been

identified as one of the distinctive features of the Japanese labor market.

Other prominent features include lifetime employment and seniority wages and

promotions.     These Japanese     features have been examined for       example by

Hashimoto (1979) and Hashimoto and Raisian (1985).      In these papers, workers

in Japan are found to stay in the same firm longer than those in the U.S.

and wages in Japan depend on age as well as the length of service in the

same   firm.   Moreover,   the   earning-age profile   in Japan    is   shown   to   be

steeper than that in the United States.


2.     Susan Collins   (1988) compared the investment-saving balances of Japan

and Korea, since both countries achieved a rapid economic growth supported

by high investment.     She found that Japan slowed investment when the balance

of payments worsened, avoiding borrowing from abroad, while Korea borrowed

from abroad when the domestic saving dropped below an investment target.


3. However, a question arises with this interpretation.           If subsistency is

the reason, why is there a significant differential between large and small

firms?    Why does the aggregate wage payment increase over time?           I   think

that the finding does not contradict with other possible explanations, for

example a long-term contracting model.


4. The share of bonuses in an annual compensation can be easily calculated

by (share in annual compensation) = (bonus ratio)/(12+bonus ratio)


5.   73.6 % on overall average; 68% for small (200-499 employee) firms,              75%

for medium-size (500-999) firms, and 83.3% for large (1000+) firms.

6.   To be exact,    special payments include not only bonuses but also other

special payments.      However, the portion of "other payments" is very small,

so that we regard special payments as bonuses.


7.   It has been established that wages in Japan are much more flexible than

wages in the United States; and employment in Japan is much more stable than

that in the United States.     These findings are explained in that Japan needs

wage flexibility in order to keep lifetime employment.               If this logic can be

extended to Korea, then the Korean wage flexibility that is higher than the

Japanese flexibility should imply          the       super   stability   of   employment   in


Korea.   As will be shown in below, employment in Korea is not more stable

than in Japan.      However, workers in Japan and the United States tend to stay

a long time in the same firm, while workers in Korea seem to change jobs

much more often.      In the spot market both wages and employment respond to

economic conditions.

Compensation for workers are classified as follows.
Yearly compensation =      Bonus   +   12*(Monthly     Wage)

onth1y Wage = Wage Base + Overtime Pay

"Monthly Wage" corresponds to "Kimatte Shikyu Sareru Kyuyo" in
Japan.    Thisis the variable used as   "wage" by Freeman and
Weitzman.
