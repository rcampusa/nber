We study the lags with which new technologies are adopted across countries, and their long-run penetration
rates once they are adopted. Using data from the last two centuries, we document two new facts: there
has been convergence in adoption lags between rich and poor countries, while there has been divergence
in penetration rates. Using a model of adoption and growth, we show that these changes in the pattern
of technology diffusion account for 80% of the Great Income Divergence between rich and poor countries
since 1820.

1        Introduction
We have very limited knowledge about the drivers of growth over long periods of time. Klenow
and Rodrı́guez-Clare (1997) show that factor accumulation (physical and human capital)
accounts only for 10% of cross-country differences in productivity growth between 1960 and
1985. Clark and Feenstra (2003) find similar results for the period 1850-2000. What accounts
for the bulk of growth dynamics over the long term, and why do these drivers differ across
countries?
        This paper explores whether the dynamics of technology can help us account for the
cross-country evolution of productivity and income growth over the last 200 years. We are
particularly interested in understanding if the technology channel can account for the dra-
matic increase in cross-country differences in per-capita income over the last 200 years, a
phenomenon known as the Great Divergence (e.g., Pritchett, 1997 and Pomeranz, 2000).
        The strategy we follow to study the role of technology on income dynamics has two parts.
The first part consists in exploring the evolution of technology adoption patterns. Using
a comprehensive dataset with direct measures of the diffusion of the large number of tech-
nologies, we study how various dimensions of technology adoption have evolved over time
in different groups of countries. With this analysis, we uncover some general cross-country
trends in technology adoption. Second, we study the implications of these adoption trends
for the evolution of income growth across-countries over the last 200 years.
        Technology has probably arrived everywhere. Comin and Hobijn (2010) find that the
lags with which new technologies arrive to countries have dropped dramatically over the last
200 years. Technologies invented in the nineteenth century such as telegrams or railways
often took many decades to first arrive to countries. In contrast, new technologies such
as computers, cellphones or the internet have arrived on average within a few decades (in
some cases less than one) after their invention. The decline in adoption lags has surely
not been homogeneous across countries. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the reduction in
adoption lags has been particularly significant in developing countries, where technologies
have traditionally arrived with longer lags.1 This evidence would imply that adoption lags
have converged across countries. But, if technology has arrived everywhere, why has income
diverged over the last two centuries?
        To explore this puzzle, we recognize that the contribution of technology to a country’s
productivity growth can be decomposed in two parts. One part is related to the range of
technologies used, or equivalently to the lag with which they are adopted. New technologies
embody higher productivity. Therefore, an acceleration in the rate at which new technolo-
gies arrive in the country raises aggregate productivity growth. Second, productivity is also
affected by the penetration rate of new technologies. The more units of any new technology

(relative to income) a country uses, the higher the number of workers or units of capital that
can benefit from the productivity gains brought by the new technology.2 Thus, increases in
the penetration of technology (or as we call it below, the intensive margin of adoption) also
raise the growth rate of productivity.
      To identify adoption lags (extensive margin) and penetration rates (intensive margin) of
technology, we follow a strategy similar to Comin and Hobijn (2010) and Comin and Mestieri
(2010). To illustrate our strategy, consider Figures 1a and 1b which plot respectively the
(log) of the tonnage of steam and motor ships over real GDP in the UK and Indonesia and
the (log) number of computers over real GDP for the U.S. and Vietnam. One feature of
these plots is that, for a given technology, the diffusion curves for different countries have
similar shapes, but displaced vertically and horizontally. Comin and Hobijn (2010) show that
this property holds generally for a large majority of the technology-country pairs. Given the
common curvature of diffusion curves, the relative position of a curve can be characterized
by only two parameters. The horizontal shifter informs us about when the technology was
introduced in the country. The vertical shifter captures the penetration rate the technology
will attain when it has fully diffused.
      These intuitions are formalized with a model of technology adoption and growth. Crucial
for our purposes, the model provides a unified framework for measuring the diffusion of specific
technologies and assessing their impact on income growth. The model features both adoption
margins, and has predictions about how variation in these margins affect the curvature and
level of the diffusion curve of specific technologies. This allows us to take these predictions to
the data and estimate adoption lags and penetration rates fitting the diffusion curves derived
  2
      In our context, this is isomorphic to differences in the efficiency with which producers use technology.

from our model.
       Using the CHAT data set,3 we identify the extensive and intensive adoption margins for
25 significant technologies invented over the last 200 years in an (unbalanced) sample that
covers 132 countries. Then, we use our estimates to study the cross-country evolution of
the two adoption margins. We uncover two new empirical regularities. First, cross-country
differences in adoption lags have narrowed over the last 200 years. That is, adoption lags have
declined more in poor/slow adopter countries than in rich/fast adopter countries. Second, the
gap in penetration rates between rich and poor countries has widened over the last 200 years,
inducing a divergence in the intensive margin of technology adoption. Figure 1 illustrates
these patterns. The horizontal gap between the diffusion curves for steam and motor ships in
the UK and Indonesia is much larger than the horizontal gap between the U.S. and Vietnam
for computers (131 years vs. 11 years). In contrast, the vertical gap between the curves for
ships in the UK and Indonesia are smaller than the vertical gap between the diffusion curves
of computers in the U.S. and Vietnam (0.9 vs. 1.6).
       After characterizing the dynamics of technology, we explore their consequences for the
cross-country dynamics of income both analytically and with simulations. Taking advantage
of the simple aggregate representation of our model, we derive two analytical results. (i) The
dynamics of technology adoption in our model generate S-shaped transitions for the growth
rate of productivity. (ii) Simple approximate expressions for the half-life of the system are
derived. Despite not having physical capital, habit formation or other mechanisms to generate
slow transitions, half-lifes are an order of magnitude larger than in the neoclassical model when
evaluated at our estimated parameter values.4
       We also use simulations to evaluate quantitatively the model’s predictions for the cross-
country income dynamics. In particular, we simulate the dynamics of income in two repre-
sentative economies (one “advanced” and one “developing”). After feeding in the dynamics
of technology adoption we have uncovered in the data, the model generates cross-country
patterns of income growth that resemble very much those observed in the data over the last
two centuries. In particular, in developed economies, it took approximately one century to
reach the modern long-run growth rate of productivity (2%) while in developing economies it
takes twice as much, if not more. As a result, the model generates a 3.2-fold increase in the
income gap between rich and developing countries, which represents 80% of the actual fourth-
fold increase observed over the last two centuries. The model also does well in reproducing
the income gap between rich and developing countries circa 1820, and the observed growth
dynamics for the countries in the bottom quarter and tenth of the world income distribution,
   3
     See Comin and Hobijn (2009) for a description of the data set. Comin and Hobijn (2004) and Comin et al.
(2008) have used it in alternative set-ups.
   4
     For example, after a one-time permanent shift in the growth rate of invention of new technologies (which
captures the Industrial Revolution) the half-life for income is approximately 120 years. A standard measure of
the half-life for the neoclassical growth model is 14 years.

and for the different continents.
       It is important to emphasize that, when evaluating the role of technology for cross-country
differences in income, we take into account that income affects demand for goods and services
that embody new technologies. In our baseline model, the restriction that our model has a
balanced growth path implies that the income elasticity of technology demand is equal to
one. Because this implication of the model may be restrictive, we study the robustness of
our findings to allowing for non-homotheticities in the demand for technology. That is, we
allow the income elasticity of technology demand to differ from one. Taking advantage of the
three-dimensional nature of our data set, we identify this elasticity from the time variation in
income and technology adoption in three countries (U.S., UK and France) for which we have
the longest time series for technology.5
       Our findings are robust to allowing for non-homotheticities. In particular, (i) we obtain
very similar trends for the cross-country evolution of adoption lags and the intensive margin,
and (ii ) we observe that the productivity gap between rich and developing countries increases
by a factor of 2.6 over the last 200 years, which accounts for 67% of the Great Divergence.
       This paper is related to the literature that has explored the drivers of the Great Divergence.
One stream of the literature has emphasized the role of the expansion of international trade
during the second half of the nineteenth century. Galor and Mountford (2006) argue that
trade affected asymmetrically the fertility decisions in developed and developing economies,
due to their different initial endowments of human capital, leading to different evolutions of
productivity growth. O’Rourke et al. (2012) elaborate on this perspective and argue that
the direction of technical change, in particular the fact that after 1850 it became skill-biased
(Mokyr, 2002), contributed to the increase in income differences across countries, as Western
countries benefited relatively more from them. Trade-based theories of the Great Divergence,
however, need to confront two facts. Prior to 1850, the technologies brought by the Industrial
Revolution were unskilled-bias rather than skilled bias (Mokyr, 2002). Yet, incomes diverged
also during this period. Second, trade globalization ended abruptly in 1913. With WWI,
world trade dropped and did not reach the pre-1913 levels until the 1970s. In contrast, the
Great Divergence continued throughout the twentieth century.
       Probably motivated by these observations, another strand of the literature has studied the
cross-country evolution of Solow residuals and has found that they account for the majority
of the divergence (Easterly and Levine, 2002, and Clark and Feenstra, 2003). Our paper
takes a strong stand on the nature of the Solow residuals over protracted periods of time
–technology–, measures it directly, and shows the direct importance of technology dynamics
for cross-country income dynamics.6
   5
     We allow the income elasticity of technology demand to vary across technologies according to their invention
date. Specifically, we estimate common income elasticities for technologies invented in fifty year intervals (i.e.,
pre-1850, 1850-1900, 1900-1950 and post-1950).
   6
     Our analysis is also related to a strand of the literature that has studied the productivity dynamics after


                                                        4
    Finally, our paper makes three contributions to the analysis of technology dynamics. First,
building on the class of models and estimation developed by Comin and Hobijn (2010) and
Comin and Mestieri (2010), we are the first to document the evolution of adoption margins
across countries. In particular, we uncover the convergence in adoption lags and the divergence
in the intensive margin of adoption in the last 200 years. Second, this is the first paper that
studies analytically transitional dynamics within this class of models. Third, this paper
evaluates quantitatively the role of technology dynamics in shaping cross-country income
dynamics. It shows that the transitional dynamics generated by the model are very protracted
and that they play a key role in generating the Great Divergence. In contrast, previous
quantitative analyses only explored how technology levels affected cross-country steady-state
income levels.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3
estimates the extensive and intensive margins of adoption and documents the cross-country
evolution of both adoption margins. Section 4 characterizes key features of the model tran-
sitional dynamics. Section 5 simulates the model to quantify the effect of the technology
dynamics on the cross-country growth dynamics. Section 6 conducts robustness checks, and
Section 7 concludes.


2     Model
We present a simple model of technology adoption and growth. Our model serves four pur-
poses. First, it precisely defines the intensive and extensive margins of adoption. Second,
it illustrates how variation in these margins affects the evolution of the diffusion curves for
individual technologies. Third, it helps develop the identification strategy of the extensive and
intensive margins of adoption in the data. Fourth, because ours is a general equilibrium model
with a simple aggregate representation, it can be used to study the dynamics of productivity
growth.

2.1    Preferences and Endowments
There is a unit measure of identical households in the economy. Each household supplies
inelastically one unit of labor, for which they earn a wage w. Households can save in domestic
bonds which are in zero net supply. The utility of the representative household is given by

the Industrial Revolution. Crafts (1997), Galor and Weil (2000), Hansen and Prescott (2002), Tamura (2002),
among others, provide different reasons why there was a slow growth acceleration in productivity after the
Industrial Revolution. The mechanisms in these papers are complementary to ours.

where Bt denotes the bond holdings of the representative consumer, Ḃt is the increase in bond
holdings over an instant of time, and rt the return on bonds.

2.2      Technology
World technology frontier.– At a given instant of time, t, the world technology frontier is char-
acterized by a set of technologies and a set of vintages specific to each technology. To simplify
notation, we omit time subscripts, t, whenever possible. Each instant, a new technology, τ ,
exogenously appears. We denote a technology by the time it was invented. Therefore, the
range of invented technologies at time t is (−∞, t].
       For each existing technology, a new, more productive, vintage appears in the world frontier
every instant. We denote vintages of technology-τ generically by vτ . Vintages are indexed by
the time in which they appear. Thus, the set of existing vintages of technology-τ available
at time t(> τ ) is [τ , t]. The productivity of a technology-vintage pair has two components.
The first component, Z(τ , vτ ), is common across countries and it is purely determined by
technological attributes. In particular,

                                     Z(τ , v) = e(χ+γ)τ +γ(vτ −τ )                                     (4)
                                               = eχτ +γvτ ,                                            (5)

where (χ + γ)τ is the productivity level associated with the first vintage of technology τ and
γ(vτ − τ ) captures the productivity gains associated with the introduction of new vintages
vτ ≥ τ .7
       The second component is a technology-country specific productivity term, aτ , which we
further discuss below.
       Adoption lags.– Economies typically are below the world technology frontier. Let Dτ
denote the age of the best vintage available for production in a country for technology τ .
Dτ reflects the time lag between when the best vintage in use was invented and when it was
adopted for production in the country; that is, the adoption lag.8 The set of technology-τ
   7
     In what follows, whenever there is no confusion, we omit the subscript τ from the vintage notation and
simply write v.
   8
     Adoption lags may result from a cost of adopting the technology in the country that is decreasing in
the proportion of not-yet-adopted technologies as in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1997), or in the gap between
aggregate productivity and the productivity of the technology, as in Comin and Hobijn (2010).


                                                      6
vintages available in this economy is Vτ = [τ , t − Dτ ].9 Note that Dτ is both the time it
takes for an economy to start using technology τ and its distance to the technology frontier
in technology τ .
    Intensive margin.– New vintages (τ , v) are incorporated into production through new
intermediate goods that embody them. Intermediate goods are produced competitively using
one unit of final output to produce one unit of intermediate good.
    Intermediate goods are combined with labor to produce the output associated with a given
vintage, Yτ ,v . In particular, let Xτ ,v be the number of units of intermediate good (τ , v) used
in production, and Lτ ,v be the number of workers that use them to produce services. Then,
Yτ ,v is given by


                                         Yτ ,v = aτ Z(τ , v)Xτα,v L1−α
                                                                   τ ,v .                                   (6)

The term aτ in (6) represents factors that reduce the effectiveness of a technology in a country.
These may include differences in the costs of producing the intermediate goods associated with
a technology, taxes, relative abundance of complementary inputs or technologies, frictions in
capital, labor and goods markets, barriers to entry for producers that want to develop new
uses for the technology, etc.10 As we shall see below, aτ determines the long-run penetration
rate of the technology in the country. Hence, we refer to aτ as the intensive margin of adoption
of a technology.
    The goal of the paper is to measure these two adoption margins in the data and then study
how they affect productivity growth. The nature of the drivers of adoption of the equilibrium
adoption margins is irrelevant for this goal. Therefore, we can simplify the analysis by treating
these margins of adoption as exogenous parameters.11
    Production.– The output associated with different vintages of the same technology can be
combined to produce competitively sectoral output, Yτ , as follows
                                    Z      t−Dτ     1
                                                              µ
                                                     µ
                             Yτ =                  Yτ ,v dv         ,    with µ > 1.                        (7)
                                        τ

Similarly, final output, Y, results from aggregating competitively sectoral outputs Yτ as follows
                                      Z     τ̄     1
                                                           θ
                                                    θ
                                Y =                Yτ dτ        ,       with θ > 1.                         (8)
                                            −∞
   9
     Here, we are assuming that vintage adoption is sequential. Comin and Hobijn (2010) provide a micro-
founded model in which this is an equilibrium result rather than an assumption. We do not impose this
condition when we simulate the model in Section 5.
  10
     Comin and Mestieri (2010) discuss how a wide variety of distortions result in wedges in technology adoption
that imply a reduced form as in (6).
  11
     See Comin and Mestieri (2010) and Comin and Mestieri (2010) for ways to endogenize these adoption
margins as equilibrium outcomes.

τ for which τ = t − Dτ .

2.3    Factor Demands and Final Output
We take the price of final output as numéraire. The demand for output produced with a
particular technology is
                                                               θ
                                                            − θ−1
                                               Yτ = Y pτ            ,                                      (9)

where pτ is the price of sector τ output. Both the income level of a country and the price of
a technology affect the demand of output produced with a given technology. Because of the
homotheticity of the production function, the income elasticity of technology τ output is one.
Similarly, the demand for output produced with a particular technology vintage is

where pτ ,v denotes the price of the (τ , v) intermediate good.12 The demands for labor and
intermediate goods at the vintage level are

    Perfect competition in the production of intermediate goods implies that the price of
intermediate goods equals their marginal cost,

This expression is quite intuitive. The productivity of a technology, Zτ , is determined by the
intensive margin, the productivity level of the best vintage used (i.e., embodiment effect), and
the productivity gains from using more vintages (i.e., variety effect). Adoption lags have two
effects on Zτ . The shorter the adoption lags, Dτ , the more productive are, on average, the
vintages used. In addition, because there are productivity gains from using different vintages,
the shorter the lags, the more varieties are used in production and the higher Zτ is.

       satisfying the budget constraint (2) and (3).

         gives the demand for labor and intermediate goods for each technology and vintage,
         equations (11) and (12), for the output produced with a vintage (equation 10) and for
         the output produced with a technology (equation 9).

         where v̄τ denotes the last adopted vintage of technology τ .

   4. The resource constraint holds:

                                               Y        = C + X,                                    (21)
                                               C = (1 − α)Y.                                        (22)


       Combining (20) and (11), it follows that the wage rate is given by

                                            w = (1 − α)Y /L.                                        (23)

Combining the Euler equation (19) and the resource constraint (22) we obtain that the interest
                                                                            Ẏ
rate depends on output growth and the discount rate r =                     Y    + ρ.
       Equation (17) implies that output dynamics are completely determined by the dynamics
of aggregate productivity, A. Below, we explore in depth how productivity has evolved in
response to changes in χ, γ, adoption lags, and the intensive margin. For the time being, it
is informative to study the growth rate of the economy along the balanced growth path. A
sufficient condition to guarantee its existence, which we take as a benchmark, is when Dτ
and aτ are constant across technologies.13 In the case that we make the simplifying (and
empirically relevant) assumption that θ = µ, aggregate productivity can be computed in
closed form.14 Omitting technology subscripts, we find that
                                                        θ−1
                                           (θ − 1)2

                                A=                                 a e(χ+γ)(t−D) .                  (24)
                                          (γ + χ)χ

Naturally, a higher intensity of adoption, a, and shorter adoption lags, D, lead to higher
aggregate productivity. Along this balanced growth path, productivity grows at rate χ + γ
and output grows at rate (χ + γ)/(1 − α).15
  13
     Comin and Mestieri (2010) show in their microfounded models of adoption that this is a necessary and
sufficient condition.
  14
     As we discuss below, this is what we observe in our estimation.
  15
     For utility to be bounded, this requires the parametric assumption that (χ + γ)/(1 − α) < ρ.

3     Technology Dynamics
To assess the effect of changes in technology adoption on income dynamics, first it is necessary
to uncover the evolution of the extensive and the intensive margin. In this section, we describe
the estimation procedure we use to measure the intensive and extensive margins of adoption
for each technology-country pair. This is not the main goal of the paper, as a similar exercise
has already been done (albeit with less technologies) in Comin and Hobijn (2010) and Comin
and Mestieri (2010). Then, we explore the novel question of whether there are any significant
trends in the evolution of these adoption margins across countries.

3.1    Estimation strategy
We derive our estimating equation by combining the demand for sector τ output, (9), the sec-
toral price deflator (16), the expression for the equilibrium wage rate (23), and the expression
for Zτ , (15). Taking logs we obtain

                                                θ
                                   yτ = y +        [zτ − (1 − α) (y − l)] ,                                   (25)
                                               θ−1

where lowercase letters denote logs.
    From expression (15) we see that, to a first order approximation, γ only affects yτ through
the linear trend. As we show in the Appendix C, this allows us to do a second-order approx-
imation of log Zτ around the starting adoption date τ + Dτ as

                                                                                γ
                 zτ ' ln aτ + (χ + γ)τ + (µ − 1) ln (t − τ − Dτ ) +               (t − τ − Dτ ) .             (26)
                                                                                2

Substituting (26) in (25) gives us the following estimating equation

          yτc t = β cτ 1 + ytc + β τ 2 t + β τ 3 ((µ − 1) ln(t − Dτc − τ ) − (1 − α)(ytc − ltc )) + εcτ t ,   (27)

where yτc t denotes the log of the output produced with technology τ , ytc is the log of output,
ytc − ltc is the log of output per capita, εcτ t is an error term, and the country-technology specific
intercept, β c1 , is equal to
                                                           γ    γ 
                                 β cτ 1 = β τ 3 ln acτ + χ +    τ − Dτc .                                     (28)
                                                             2     2

Equation (27) shows that the adoption lag Dτc is the only determinant of horizontal shifts in
the curvature of the diffusion curve. Intuitively, longer lags imply fewer vintages available for
production and, because of the diminishing gains from variety, the steepness of the diffusion
curve declines faster than if more vintages had been already adopted. Equation (28) shows
that, for a given adoption lag, the only driver of cross-country differences in the intercept β cτ 1


                                                         11
is the intensive margin, acτ . A lower level of acτ generates a downward shift of the diffusion
curve which, ceteris paribus, leads to lower output associated with technology τ throughout
its diffusion and, in particular in the long-run.
       We can identify differences in the intensive margin relative to a benchmark. For consis-
tency with our simulations below, we take as benchmark the average value for the 17 devel-
oped countries that Maddison (2004) defines as Western countries.16 Formally, we idnetify
the intensive margin as:

                                         β c1,τ − β W
                                                    1,τ
                                                       estern
                                                               γ
                              ln acτ =                        + (Dτc − DτW estern ).                           (29)
                                                 β 3,τ         2

       When bringing the model to the data, we shall see that some of the technology measures
we have in our data set correspond to the output produced with a specific technology, and
therefore equation (27) is the appropriate model counterpart. Other technology measures,
instead, capture the number of units of the input that embody the technology (e.g. number of
computers). The model counterpart to those measures is Xτ . To derive an estimating equation
for these measures, we integrate (12) across vintages to obtain (in logs) xcτ = yτc + pcτ + ln α.
Substituting in for equation (27), we obtain the following expression which we use to estimate
the diffusion of the inputs that embody technology17

           xcτ t = β cτ 1 + ytc + β τ 2 t + β τ 3 ((µ − 1) ln(t − Dτc − τ ) − (1 − α)(ytc − ltc )) + εcτ t .   (30)

       The procedure we use to estimate (27) and (30) consists in two parts. For each technology,
we first estimate the equation jointly for the U.S., the U.K. and France, which are the countries
for which we have the longest time series.18 From this estimation, we take the technology-
specific parameters β̂ 2τ and β̂ 3τ . Then, for each technology-country pair, we re-estimate β cτ 1
and Dτc imposing the technology specific estimates of β̂ 2τ and β̂ 3τ we have obtained in the
first stage.19

     Note that there are two minor differences between (27) and (30). The first difference is that in the first
equation β τ 3 is θ/ (θ − 1) , while in the second it is 1/(θ − 1). The second difference is that, in the second
equation, the intercept β cτ 1 has an extra term equal to β τ 3 ln α.
  18
     In the case of railways, we substitute data of the UK with German data because we lack the initial phase
of diffusion of railways in the UK. In the case of tractors, we substitute U.S. data with German data for the
same reason. We proceed as Comin and Hobijn (2010) and calibrate µ = 1.3 to match price markups from
Basu and Fernald (1997) and Norbin (1993). We take α = .3 to match the labor income share.
  19
     Note that the coefficients β 2τ and β 3τ in (27) are functions of parameters that are common across countries
(θ and γ). Therefore their estimates should be independent of the sample used to estimate them. An advantage
of using this two-step procedure is to avoid the problem that in the estimation of a system of equations, data
problems from one country can contaminate the estimation of the common parameters across equations, and
thus, the estimates for all countries. Using a small set of countries for which data are most reliable to identify
the common technological parameters circumvents this problem. Reassuringly, Comin and Hobijn (2010) show
that for a large majority of technology-country pairs, it is not possible to reject the null that β 3τ is common


                                                          12
    In section 6.2, we relax the homotheticity in production implied by equation (8) and
allow the elasticity of yτc t with respect to income to differ from one. Our two-step estimation
procedure allows to estimate the income elasticity, β τ y , (along with β 2 and β 3 ) from the
diffusion curve in the baseline countries and then to impose these estimates when estimating
the equation for all the technology-country pairs. Effectively, what this means is that we
estimate β τ y from the time series variation in technology and output for the baseline countries
and then assume that the slope of the Engel curve is constant across countries. Given that
the baseline countries have long time series that for many technologies cover much of its
development experience, we consider this to be a reasonable approximation.

3.2    Data, estimation and summary statistics
We implement our estimation procedure using data on the diffusion of technologies from the
CHAT data set (Comin and Hobijn, 2009), and data on income and population from Maddison
(2004). The CHAT data set covers the diffusion of 104 technologies for 161 countries over
the last 200 years. Due to the unbalanced nature of the data set, we focus on a sub-sample
of technologies that have a wider coverage over rich and poor countries and for which the
data captures the initial phases of diffusion. The 25 technologies that meet these criteria
are listed in Appendix A and cover a wide range of sectors in the economy (transportation,
communication and IT, industrial, agricultural and medical sectors). Their invention dates
also span quite evenly over the last 200 years. It is worthwhile remarking that the specific
measures of technology diffusion in CHAT match the dependent variables in specification (27)
or (30). In particular, these measures capture either the amount of output produced with the
technology (e.g., tons of steel produced with electric arc furnaces) or the number of units of
capital that embody the technology (e.g., number of computers).
    We only use in our analysis the estimates of adoption lags that satisfy plausibility and
precision conditions.20 These two conditions are met for the majority of the technology
country-pairs (67%). For these technology country-pairs, we find that equation (27) provides
a good fit for the data with an average detrended R2 of 0.79 across countries and technologies
(Table 9).21
    Tables 1 and 2 report summary statistics for the estimates of the adoption lags and the
intensive margin for each technology. The average adoption lag across all technologies and
countries is 44 years. We find significant variation in average adoption lags across technologies.
across countries when estimated separately country by country.
   20
      As in Comin and Hobijn (2010), plausible adoption lags are those with an estimated adoption date of no
less than ten years before the invention date (this ten year window is to allow for some inference error). Precise
are those with a significant estimate of adoption lags Dτc at a 5% level. Most of the implausible estimates
correspond to technology-country cases when our data does not have the initial phases of diffusion. This
makes it hard to separately identify the log-linear trend from the logarithmic component of the diffusion curve.
   21
      To compute the detrended R2 , we partial out the linear trend component, γt, of the estimation equation
and compute the R2 of the de-trended data.

The range goes from 7 years for the internet to 121 years for steam and motor ships. There is
also considerable cross-country variation in adoption lags for any given technology. The range
for the cross-country standard deviations goes from 3 years for PCs to 53 years for steam and
motor ships.
   We also find significant cross-country variation in the intensive margin. The intensive
margin is reported as log differences relative to the average adoption of Western countries.
To compute the intensive margin we follow Comin and Mestieri (2010) and calibrate γ =
(1 − α) · 1%, α = 0.3, and use a value of β 3,τ that results from setting the elasticity across
technologies, θ, to be the mean across our estimates, which is θ = 1.28. The average intensive
margin is -.62, which implies that the level of adoption of the average country is 54% of
the Western countries. More generally, there is significant cross-country dispersion in the

intensive margin. The range goes from 0.3 for mail to 1.1 for cars and the internet. These
summary statistics for the estimates of adoption lags and the intensive margin of adoption
are very consistent with those in Comin and Hobijn (2010) and Comin and Mestieri (2010)
which use smaller technology samples and estimate other versions of diffusion equations (27)
and (30).

3.3   Evolution of adoption lags and the intensive margin
To explore the cross-country evolution of the adoption margins, we follow Maddison (2004)
and divide the countries into two groups: “Western countries”, and the rest, labeled “Rest of
the World”or, simply, non-Western. Figure 2 plots, for each technology and country groups,



                                               15
the median adoption lag among Western countries and the rest of the world. This figure
suggests that adoption lags have declined over time, and that cross-country differences in
adoption lags have narrowed. Table 3 formalizes these intuitions by regressing (log) adoption
lags on their year of invention (and a constant). Column (1) reports this regression for the
whole sample of countries. We confirm the finding in Comin and Hobijn (2010) that adoption
lags have declined with the invention date, on average. Then, we run the same regression
separately for the two groups of countries. (See columns 2 and 3.) We find that the rate of
decline in adoption lags is almost a 40% higher in non-Western than in Western countries
(i.e., 1.12% vs. .81%). Hence, there has been convergence in adoption lags between Western
and non-Western countries.
    Do we observe a similar pattern for the intensive margin? To explore this question,
Figure 3 plots, for each technology, the median intensive margin among Western and non-
Western countries. This figure suggests that the gap between Western countries and the rest
of the world in the intensive margin of adoption was smaller for technologies invented at the
beginning of the nineteenth century than for technologies invented at the end of the twentieth
century. Table 4 provides econometric evidence for this finding. It reports the regression
of the intensive margin on the invention year and a constant. Column (3) shows that, for
non-Western countries, the intensive margin has declined at a .54% annual rate. Recall that
we define the intensive margin in equation (29) relative to the Western countries. As one
would expect, column (2) shows that, for Western countries there is no trend in the intensive
margin. Hence, Table 4 documents the divergence in the intensive margin of adoption between
Western and non-Western countries over the last 200 years.


4    Income Dynamics: Analytic Results
After uncovering new cross-country patterns of technology diffusion, in the remaining of the
paper, we study their implications for the evolution of income growth. Given the novelty
of the model, we start by providing some analytic intuitions about the growth dynamics in
the model. Then, in the next section, we use simulations to quantify the consequences of
technology dynamics for income.
    Our previous analysis of balanced growth (equation 24) showed that changes in the growth
rate of the technology frontier, χ + γ, generate changes in long-run growth. Moreover, any
change in adoption margins is a source of additional transient growth. In this section, we
analyze the transitional dynamics that follow from changes in these parameters. For the sake
of clarity, we proceed sequentially. First, we study the sources of growth when the growth rate
of the technology frontier is constant. Then, we study the transitional dynamics generated
after an acceleration in the growth rate of the technological frontier. We conclude our analysis
by exploring the effects of a one-time change in the adoption lag and the intensive margin.

4.1       Balanced Growth
As described in Section 2, the first vintage of a new technology and a new vintage for all past
technologies appear at each instant of time. Thus, the set of technologies available at time t
is given by [−∞, t − Dt ), and the set of vintages of a given technology is [τ , t − Dτ ) where τ
is time of invention of the technology and Dτ the corresponding adoption lag. Let a dot and
the letter g denote time derivatives and growth rates, respectively. Taking the time derivative
of (17) and using (15) and (18), we find that

The first term in (31) captures the growth imputable to a new technology being introduced in
the economy. This term has three parts. (1 − Ḋt ) captures the rate at which new technologies
are introduced at instant t. If the adoption lag Dt does not change (i.e., Ḋt = 0), only one new
technology arrives in the economy at instant t. But, if adoption lags decline (i.e., Ḋt < 0),
the flow of new technologies in the economy is greater than one. The effect on growth of the
arrival of new technologies depends on two factors. The first is the inverse of the elasticity of
substitution between technologies (θ − 1). The more substitutable are different technologies,
the smaller the gains from having a new technology available for production. The second is the
share of the new technologies in output, i.e., (Zt−Dt /Y )1/(θ−1) .22 The higher the productivity
embodied in a technology, the larger the impact of its arrival on GDP growth. Note that,
the share of a new technology in GDP depends both on its intensive margin and its vintage
(t − Dt ).
       The second term in (31) captures the increases of productivity due to the introduction
of new vintages of already adopted technologies. The contribution to overall growth is an
average of different sectoral growths gZτ weighted by the sector’s share in total output. Note
from (32) that the productivity of new technologies grows faster than for older ones because
of the larger gains from variety when fewer vintages of a technology have been adopted (i.e.,
for small t − τ − Dτ ). Eventually, gZτ converges to γ, the long-run growth rate of productivity
embodied in new vintages.

4.2       Transitional dynamics after an acceleration in frontier growth
How does the economy respond to a permanent, instantaneous increase in the growth rate
of the technology frontier? Let’s suppose the growth rate of the frontier increases at time T
from gOld to γ + χ. According to Mokyr (1990) and Crafts (1997), this acceleration in the
technology frontier growth captures the Industrial Revolution. For the time being, we keep
the adoption margins constant, and denote them, respectively, by D and a.
       Let’s decompose output and output growth as follows
                                                                            θ−1                                θ−1

where YOld is the output produced with pre-Industrial technologies, and YM odern is the output
produced with Modern technologies. Let’s denote by s the output share of Modern technolo-

       It is clear from (34) that changes in growth may come from the evolution of the sectoral
growth rates, gOld and gM odern , or from changes in the output share of the Modern sector,
s. The next proposition characterizes the evolution of output produced with Modern and
pre-industrial technologies.

    Note that here we are assuming that output produced with pre-Modern technologies keeps increasing


                                                               20
stead, has two components that change over time: a log-linear trend, (χ + γ)t, and a transient
source of growth, h(t). The log-linear trend captures the higher productivity embodied in
Modern technologies and vintages (embodiment effect). This term drives long-run growth.
The transient term h(t) is S-shaped and eventually reaches a ceiling, so it does not contribute
to long-run output growth. This term originates from the gains from variety of having more
vintages and more technologies in production. In an initial phase, the increment in productiv-
ity from the arrival of Modern vintages is larger due to gains from variety. Hence, the initial
convexity of h(t). At some point, though, the decreasing marginal gains from variety strike
and h(t) becomes concave and eventually plateaus.
    Next we describe the shape of the transition to the new balanced growth path.

Proposition 2 The transition of the growth rate of aggregate output from the pre-Industrial
balanced growth path to the Modern balanced growth path is S-shaped. The growth rate starts
the transition from its initial value gOld . It is increasing and convex first, then concave. It
approaches asymptotically the long-run growth rate (χ + γ)/(1 − α) from above, thus declining
in a convex manner. In the case that γ = χ  gOld , the growth rate is increasing for t < t∗
and decreasing thereafter with inflexion points ti1 and ti2 , such that ti1 < t∗ < ti2 , where

    From (34), we know that the growth rate in the economy is a weighted average of the
growth of the Modern and Old sectors. The weights correspond to the output share of
Modern and pre-Modern technologies. Hence, the dynamics of the growth rate are pinned
down by the behavior of s(t)(gM odern (t) − gOld ). The intuition for the result is that the share
of the Modern sector s(t) inherits the properties of the transient component h(t), so that the
weight on Modern output s(t) is increasing and has an S-shape.
    If growth in the Modern sector was only given by the embodiment effect (the log-linear
trend, χ + γ), Modern output would grow at a constant rate. In this case, output growth
would be given by (1 − α)gY = (1 − s)gOld + s(χ + γ). It follows from this expression that ag-
gregate output growth would be increasing over time reaching (χ + γ)/(1 − α) asymptotically.
independently from the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Thus, we are assuming that productivity of Old
vintages does not increase with the Industrial Revolution. In Appendix D, we analyze the case in which new
vintages of Old technologies become also more productive with the Industrial Revolution. The differences that
we obtain are qualitatively minor, and quantitatively insignificant for the relevant parameter range.


                                                             21
Furthermore, gY would mimic the S-shape of the Modern sector output share, s. However,
Modern output grows faster than the log-linear trend because of the transient growth com-
ponent h(t). Thus, aggregate output growth will overshoot its long-run level (χ + γ)/(1 − α).
Whether this over-shooting is quantitatively important depends on whether when the weight
on Modern growth becomes close to one, the growth rate of the Modern sector is substantially
higher than (χ + γ)/(1 − α). Our simulations, e.g. Figure 4b, suggest that this effect is not
substantial.
    Next, we compute the speed of transition to the new balance growth path to assess the
protractedness of the transition.

Proposition 3 Approximating the transient term h(t) by its long-run value, the half-life of
the output gap and the growth rate are

where the output gap is defined as the ratio of output in the Modern balanced growth path
relative to current output.

    The first term in both equations captures the fact that there is a lag between the advent
of the Industrial Revolution and when a country starts adopting Modern technologies (i.e.,
the extensive margin). The second term captures the evolution of the transition conditional
on having started to adopt Modern technologies. In particular, the term inside the brackets
reflects the ratio of the productivity of pre-Modern output at the time of the Industrial
Revolution to the Modern sector (and, hence, long-term level of output). Intuitively, if the
output produced with pre-Modern technologies is “high”, it takes longer for Modern output
to become the major driver of output per capita. This slows down the transition to the new
balanced growth path. On the other hand, this effect is mitigated if the difference between
the new and old growth rates χ + γ − gOld is large.

4.3     Changes in Adoption Margins
Next, we study how changes in the adoption lag and intensive margin affect the transitional
dynamics. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that qualitatively our analytic results continue to
hold.
    We consider a one-period, permanent change of adoption lags and the intensive margin
from its pre-Modern levels to their average Modern levels.25 Formally, we pose the following
  25
     In Appendix B, we extend the results to the case where these margins evolve linearly over time, and show
that the same qualitative results remain.

       Note the similarity of these results with the previous propositions, where we only allowed
for an acceleration of the frontier growth. This is the case for two reasons. First, changes
in the adoption margins do not affect the pre-Modern sector. Second, up to a re-scaling of
adoption lags, growth in the Modern sector does not depend on whether the adoption margins
are the same before and after the Industrial Revolution. Hence, the shape of the transition
to the Modern growth era is not affected by the changes introduced in (43). However, the
changes in the adoption margins have a quantitative impact on the transitional dynamics.

This can be seen in expressions (47) and (48) for the half-lives, which depend on both Old
and Modern levels of adoption.
         To assess the protractedness of the model’s transitional dynamics, we use Proposition 4 to
calculate the half-lives during the transition to the new steady state. We calibrate D and a
using information on the averages of both margins from our estimates from Tables 3 and 4.27
The first two terms in the expressions for the half-lives (47) and (48) capture the extensive
margin of adoption. The sum of these terms is approximately 40 years in our calculation
(which almost coincides with the sample average lag of 44 years). The last term in the half-
life expressions reflects output dynamics once adoption has started. Our calculations yield a
value for this last term of 86 years for the half life of the output gap and 124 years for the
half life of the growth rate. Hence, the resulting half-lives are 125 years for the half-life of the
output gap and 163 for the half-life of the growth rate, showing how protracted dynamics are.


5         Income Dynamics: Simulation Results
We use our model to evaluate quantitatively the effects of dynamics in technology diffusion on
the cross-country evolution of economic growth. We explore three questions: (i) The model’s
ability to generate pre-industrial income differences, (ii) the protractedness of the model’s
transitional dynamics, and (iii) the model’s account of the Great Divergence.
         Calibration.– To simulate the model we need to calibrate four parameters. First, we take
α = .3 to match the labor income share. Second, we need to specify the path for the world
technology frontier. Prior to year T = 1765 (year in which James Watt developed his steam
engine), we assume that the technology frontier grew at 0.2%. This is the growth rate of
Western Europe according to Maddison (2004) from 1500 to 1800.28 After 1765, the frontier
growth rate, χ + γ, equals (1 − α) · 2% per year. This ensures that Modern growth along
the balanced growth path is 2%. The literature has not determined what fraction of frontier
growth comes from increases in productivity due to new technologies (χ) and new vintages
(γ). In our baseline simulation, we split evenly the sources of growth in the frontier between
γ and χ and conduct robustness checks to show the robustness of our findings.
         Finally, we need to calibrate the elasticities of substitution between technologies, which
we assume are the same and equal to 1/(θ − 1). We back out the value of θ from the estimates
of β τ 3 . The average value we estimate for θ is 1.28, which is very similar to the values implied
by the estimates of price markups from Basu and Fernald (1997) and Norbin (1993). Thus,
we set θ = 1.28.
    27
     The rest of the parameters we take from our baseline calibration, which is explained in Section 5. These
parameters are χ = γ = 1%, θ = 1.28. We take the estimated adoption levels in 1820 as proxies for the Old
margins of adoption, and the Old growth gOld = .2%. In Appendix F, we show the details of the calculation.
  28
     Alternatively, we can set, without any significant change to our findings, the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution at 1779, year of invention of the first technology in our sample, the mule spindle.



                                                      24
      Initial income differences.– In our model, differences in productivity along the pre-industrial
balanced growth path are due to differences in adoption lags and in the intensive margin in
the pre-Modern era. Since pre-Modern growth was roughly constant (e.g., Maddison, 2004),
we assume that pre-Modern levels of adoption were constant and coincide with th adoption
levels that we estimate for the beginning of our sample. Our estimates from Tables 3 and 4
imply that the difference between the average adoption lag in the sample of Western countries
and the rest of the world is 49 years in 1820. The average gap in the (log) intensive margin
is 0.39. With this assumption and using Maddison’s estimates of pre-industrial growth in
Western Europe (0.2%) to calibrate the pre-industrial growth rate of the world technology
frontier, equation (24) implies an income gap between Western countries and the rest of the
world of 90%.29 This is in line with the results from Maddison (2004), who reports an income
gap of the same magnitude. Hence, the pre-industrial income differences generated by our
model account for those observed in the data.
      Protracted dynamics.– Next, we explore the protractedness of the model transitional dy-
namics. To this end, we consider the average country in our sample, and suppose that there
is a one time permanent increase in the growth of the world technology frontier (γ + χ) like
the one we observed in the Industrial Revolution (so that the balanced growth rate increases
from 0.2% to 2%). The average country is parametrized so that its adoption lag and its degree
of penetration rate are constant and equal to the average adoption lag and intensive margin
across countries over our sample of technologies. In particular, the resulting D is 44 years and
the intensive margin is 54% of the Western level. Figure 4 plots the transition of the output
gap and income growth rate for this representative economy. The output gap is defined as
the ratio of output in the Modern balanced growth path relative to current output. In the
figure, we can see that the model generates a very slow convergence to the new balanced
growth path. The half-life of the output gap relative to the Modern balanced growth path is
117 years, while for output growth it is 145 years. These half-lives are an order of magnitude
higher than the typical half-life in neoclassical growth models (e.g., Barro and Sala-i-Martin,
2003).
      There are three reasons why our model generates such protracted dynamics. First, the
long adoption lags (44 years) imply that it takes this amount of time for the new technologies
(which embody the higher productivity gains) to arrive to the economy. Until then, there
is no effect whatsoever in output growth. Second, for a given growth in the Modern sector
output, its impact in GDP depends on the share of the Modern sector (see equation 34). Since
the Modern sector’s share increases slowly, so does aggregate output. Third, the growth rate
of the Modern sector is initially very small and grows progressively (see Proposition 1).
      Cross-country evolution of income growth.– To evaluate the model’s power to account for
the Great Divergence, we simulate the evolution of output for Western countries and the rest
 29
      That is, exp(.2% · 49 + .39/(1 − α)) = 1.9.

  Notes: Simulation results and median growth rates from Maddison (2004). We use 1913 instead of 1900
  to divide the sample because there are more country observations in Maddison (2004). The growth rates
  reported from Maddison for the period 1820-1913 for non-Western countries are computed imputing the
  median per capita income in 1820 for those countries with income data in 1913 but missing observations
  in 1820. These represent 11 observations out of the total 50. We do the same imputation for computing
  the growth rate for non-Western countries for 1820-2000. This represents 106 observations out of 145.
  For the 1913-2000 growth rate of non-Western countries, we impute the median per capita income in 1913
  to those countries with income per capita data in 2000 but missing observations in 1913. These represent
  67 observations out of the total 145.


of the world after feeding in a (common) one time permanent increase in frontier growth
and the estimated evolutions for adoption lags and the intensive margin for each group of
countries reported in Tables 3 and 4.30 The results from this exercise are reported in Figure
5 and Table 5.
       The model generates sustained differences in the growth rates of Western and non-Western
countries for long periods of time. Output growth starts to accelerate at the beginning of the
nineteenth century in the Western economy, converging to the steady state growth of 2% in
the early twentieth century. For the non-Western country, instead, growth does not increase
from the pre-industrial rate until the end of the nineteenth century. Growth in the non-
Western country slowly accelerates, but it is still around 1.5% by year 2000. The gap in
growth between both countries is considerable. Annual growth rates differ by more than 0.7%
for over 100 years. The peak gap is reached around 1915 at 1.1%. From then, the gap declines
monotonically until reaching around 0.6% by 2000. Table 5 reports the average growth and
growth gaps of our simulation comparing it to Maddison (2004). The patterns and levels in
our data trace quite well Maddison’s.
       The sustained cross-country gap in growth produced by the model leads to a substantial
gap in income per capita. In particular, our model generates a 3.2 income gap between the
Western countries and the rest of the world. Maddison (2004) reports an actual income
widening by a factor of 3.9 between Western countries and the rest of the world since the
  30
    We assume that after the last technology invented in our sample (the internet, in 1983), the estimated
margins remain constant at their 1983 values. This ensures that both groups of countries exhibit the same
long-run growth. This assumption is quantitatively inconsequential, as it only affects the dynamics of the last
ten years of our simulations. If anything, it tends to understate the effect of technology dynamics.


                                                      26
Industrial Revolution. Hence, most of the variation (82%) in the income gap between Western
and non-Western countries in the last two centuries is accounted for.
   The simulation does also well in replicating the time series income evolution of each country
group separately. For Western countries, Maddison (2004) reports a 18.5-fold increase in
income per capita between 1820 and 2000. Approximately 19% of this increase occurred
prior to 1913. In our simulation, we generate a 14-fold increase over the same period, and
16% of this increase is generated prior to 1913. For non-Western countries, Maddison (2004)
reports an almost 5-fold increase, with around 37% of the increase being generated prior
to 1913. Our simulation generates a 4.3-fold increase in the 1820-2000 period with 32% of
this increase occurring in pre-1913. The fact that we underpredict the time series increase
in output reflects, in our view, that we are not accounting for the accumulation of factors
of production over this time period (e.g., human capital), which also contributed to income
growth.
   The role of initial conditions and changes in adoption lags.– After showing that the model
does a remarkable job in reproducing the cross-country dynamics of income growth over the
last two centuries, we dissect the mechanisms at work. We start this task by simulating
the dynamics of our model after a common acceleration of the technology frontier for both
countries. To this end, we keep constant at their initial level the adoption lags and intensive
margin in each country. Figure 6 shows that these initial conditions are an important source
of cross-country income divergence. In particular, longer adoption lags in the non-Western
country imply a delay of 80 years to start benefiting from the productivity gains of the
Industrial Revolution. As a result, the income gap increases by a factor of 2.3 by year 2000.
   Of course, this estimate does not provide an accurate assessment of the contribution of
adoption lags to the Great Divergence because adoption lags did not remain constant over
the last 200 years. As we have shown in Section 3.2, cross-country differences in adoption
lags have declined. To assess more precisely the role of adoption lags in cross-country growth
dynamics, we simulate the evolution of our two model economies after a common acceleration
in frontier growth, allowing for the evolution of adoption lags that we estimated from the
data. The intensive margins are kept constant at pre-industrial levels. Figure 7a presents
the results from this simulation. It is clear that cross-country differences in adoption lags are
a key driver of income divergence during the nineteenth century. In particular, prior to the
non-Western countries starting to adopt Modern technologies, the income gap reaches a level
of 2.1. However, after that, the faster reduction in adoption lags in non-Western countries
induces higher growth rates in this group of countries than in Western countries during the
twentieth century. As a result, during the twentieth century income converges, and the relative
income between the two countries is almost equalized at pre-industrial levels by 2000.
   The role of the intensive margin.– The income dynamics induced by adoption lags suggest
that the evolution of the intensive margin may be necessary to explain why the Great Di-


                                               27
vergence continued during the twentieth century. To study this hypothesis, we simulate the
evolution of the two economies following the acceleration of the common technology frontier,
and feeding in the estimated dynamics of the intensive margin. In this simulation, we keep
adoption lags constant at their pre-industrial levels.
   Figure 7b presents the dynamics of income growth in each country. The first observa-
tion is that the divergence in the intensive margin of technology generates a very significant
divergence in income growth between Western countries and the rest of the World. In this
simulation, the growth acceleration in non-Western countries starts much later than in the
baseline (Figure 5). This is a consequence of omitting the productivity gains from a reduction
in adoption lags in non-Western countries. Another perspective on this same issue is that the
decline in the intensive margin reduces productivity growth by a magnitude that, initially, is
equivalent to the gains brought by the industrial revolution to non-Western countries.
   We also see in Figure 7b that Western countries grow less than in the baseline, especially
during the nineteenth century. This is a reflection of the productivity gains brought by the
reduction in adoption lags for Western countries. Furthermore, as shown in the bottom panel
of Figure 7b, the growth gap between the two groups of countries during the nineteenth
century is smaller when we omit the evolution of the adoption lags. Despite that, the growth
rate of non-Western countries falls behind during the first half of the twentieth century. This
gap does not begin to close until the second half of the twentieth century. In this simulation,
the income gap between Western countries and the rest of the world has increased by a factor
of 3.8 by year 2000.
   To sum up, the findings from our simulations are as follows:

  1. The model is capable of generating a Great Divergence. Income per capita of Western
     countries relative to the rest of the world increases by a factor of 3.2 over the last 200
     years. This represents 80% of the actual increase in the income gap observed in the
     data.

  2. Our model generates very protracted transitional dynamics due to the length of the
     adoption lags and to the time it takes for new technologies to become significant in
     aggregate output.

  3. Large cross-country differences in adoption lags explain much of the income divergence
     during the nineteenth century between Western countries and the rest of the world.

  4. The Great Divergence continued during the twentieth century because of the divergence
     in penetration rates (i.e., intensive margin of adoption) between Western countries and
     the rest of the world.

Next, we show that the findings from the previous section are robust to alternative (i) cal-
ibrations, (ii) assumptions about the income elasticity of technology, and (iii) definitions of
the samples of rich and poor countries.

6.1     Calibration of γ and χ
The results discussed above assumed that the productivity growth after the Industrial Rev-
olution was equally shared between the productivity growth of new technologies (χ) and of
new vintages (γ). Given the difficulty of calibrating the contribution of these two sources of
growth, we study the robustness of our findings to the relative contributions of new technolo-
gies and new varieties to balanced growth. To this end, we redo our baseline simulation under
two polar assumptions. Figure 8a depicts the dynamics of productivity growth when balanced
growth comes only from the development of better vintages (i.e., χ = 0), while 8b shows the
polar case, in which all productivity growth comes from the adoption of new technologies (i.e.,
γ = 0).
    We draw two conclusions from this exercise. First, the main findings of the paper are robust
quantitatively and qualitatively to the source of long-run growth. In particular, the income
gap between Western and non-Western increases by a similar magnitude as in the benchmark
(2.9 when growth comes from γ, 3.6 when it comes from χ, and 3.2 in the benchmark). Second,
the income gap between Western and non-Western countries is larger when growth comes only
from the adoption of new technologies. Intuitively, in this case, for a given technology, all
vintages have the same productivity. Hence, the marginal gains from expanding the range of
varieties for a given technology are decreasing over time. This implies that the gains from
convergence in adoption lags (i.e., vintages of new technologies being adopted at the same
rate between Western and non-Western countries) are less important in this case.

6.2     Non-homotheticities in production
Next, we explore the robustness of the dynamics of adoption margins once we allow for non-
homotheticities in the production function. Non-homotheticities alter our baseline estimating
equation (27) by introducing an income elasticity in the demand for technology, β τ y , poten-
tially different from one,

      yτc t = β cτ 1 + β τ y ytc + β τ 2 t + β τ 3 ((µ − 1) ln(t − Dτc − τ ) − (1 − α)(ytc − ltc ))) + εcτ t .   (49)

To estimate (49), we use the same strategy as in the main specification. We first use the
time series variation in the diffusion curves of the United States, the United Kingdom and
France to estimate the elasticity parameter β τ y (jointly with β τ 2 , β τ 3 ). However, by relaxing

the theoretical constraint that β τ y 6= 1, we encounter a potential collinearity of income and
the time trend. In practice, we can identify the income elasticity if we group technologies by
their invention date in four groups: pre-1850, 1850-1900, 1900-1950 and post-1950. Then, we
perform a non-linear version of seemingly unrelated regressions. We estimate jointly (49) for
all technologies in a given time period with the restriction that the income elasticity has to
be common across technologies of the same period. This allows us to identify four elasticity
terms, β T y , where T indexes the four periods in which we have divided the sample. Table 6
reports the elasticities we find. They range from 1.58 in the pre-1850 period to 1.99 in the
1850-1900 period.
       Once we have obtained the estimates for the income elasticity, we proceed as in the baseline
estimation, but instead of using an income elasticity of one, we use the income elasticity that
we have estimated.31 We estimate for each country

       yτc t = β cτ 1 + β̄ T y ytc + β̄ τ 2 t + β̄ τ 3 ((µ − 1) ln(t − Dτc − τ ) − (1 − α)(ytc − ltc ))) + εcτ t .   (50)

where β̄ τ 2 , β̄ τ 3 and β̄ τ y are the values of β τ 2 , β τ 3 and β τ y estimated in the first step.
       To compute the intensive margin, we proceed as in the baseline model and calibrate the
intermediate goods share to α = .3 and the embodied productivity growth to be γ = (1−α)·1%
(i.e., half of the long-run productivity growth). Finally, for the elasticity of substitution across
technologies, we use the average value we estimated, θ = 1.24.
       The summary of our estimates by technology of the intensive and the extensive margin
are reported in Tables 10 and 11. The estimates obtained allowing for non-homotheticities
are similar to our baseline estimates. The correlation between the adoption lags estimated
allowing for non-homotheticities and the baseline model is 98%. For the intensive margin, the
correlation is 89%. More importantly, the patterns of convergence of adoption lags and diver-
gence of the intensive margin remain. Tables 12 and 13 show the evolution of adoption lags
and intensive margin. We see that the convergence rate (measured as the difference between
the coefficients of Western and non-Western countries) is -.44% per year, while in the baseline
  31
    That is, given the income elasticity of a technology β T y , we first estimate the common technological
parameters of 49 for each technology using the U.S., the U.K. and France. Note that this means that we
re-estimate β τ 2 , β τ 3 for each technology instead of using the estimates from the joint estimation. This is to
allow the estimation to be the most flexible possible.


                                                             30
case it was -.31% per year. Hence, if anything, adoption lags close faster. The divergence rate
in the intensive margin is reduced by 19% when allowing for non-homotheticities relative to
the baseline model (the regression coefficient estimated on the time trend is −.44%, versus
−.54% in the baseline model). However, the divergence is still very significant. After feeding
these trends, we observe that the productivity gap between Western and non-Western coun-
tries increases by a factor of 2.6 over the last 200 years, which accounts for 67% of the Great
Divergence. We conclude that our findings are robust to allowing for non-homotheticities in
demand.32

6.3    Alternative definitions of non-Western
Finally, we extend the analysis to alternative country classifications to Maddison’s Western/non-
Western. We conduct two exercises. First, we focus on the countries that were in the bottom
25th and 10th percentile of the income distribution in year 2000. We also report the model
predictions for the evolution of productivity growth for various continents.
    Table 7 shows that initial technology adoption patterns accounted for cross-country dif-
ferences in productivity circa 1820 in the world’s poorest economies (see the first row of Table
7). For example, in 1820, based on the observed differences in technology adoption between
Western countries and those in the bottom 10%, the model predicts that the average income
in Western countries should be 2.9 times the average income of the bottom 10% countries. In
Maddison’s data we observe that the actual income ratio is 2.8.
    Technology dynamics are also important to account for the evolution of income between
1820 and 2000 for the two new country groupings (see the second row Table 7). For example,
our model predicts an accumulated income gap between Western countries and the bottom
10th of 17.2, while in the data the actual gap was 17.6.
    Table 8 reports the results from a similar exercise after grouping countries by continent.
This table shows that technology dynamics in each continent have induced income dynamics
that resemble closely those observed in the data over the last two centuries. As in the baseline
case, the model tends to underpredict the average growth rates during the nineteenth century.
However, the correlation between the actual growth rates across continents between 1820 and
1913 and those predicted by the model is 0.99. For the period 1913-2000, the correlation
between actual and predicted income growth is 0.94. We conclude that technology dynamics
account well for income dynamics when looking at narrower country groupings either based
on income levels or on geographical locations.
  32
     Another robustness check that we have performed is to group technologies by sector rather than invention
dates to compute the income elasticity. These categories are listed in Appendix A. The results in this case are
also very similar to our baseline results and we do not report them.

    is for the calculation of the pre-1820 bottom 10th countries, for which we have imputed the minimum
    subsistence level estimated by Maddison to missing income per capita data in 1820. This means that the
    line 1820-2000 reports relative income gap only for countries with 1820 data, while the Cumulative line
    uses data for all countries with data in 2000. If Maddison’s data were balanced, the accumulated value
    in 2000 should equal to the product of the gap generated prior to 1820 and from 1820 to 2000.

    group income reported in that year.


7      Conclusions
In what has now become a classic paper, Klenow and Rodrı́guez-Clare (1997) show that factor
accumulation accounts for 10% of cross-country variation in productivity growth between 1960
and 1985 leaving for the TFP residual a staggering 90% of the variation in income growth.
What drives variation in income growth over the long-term?
     In this paper we have explored one potential driver: the dynamics of technology adoption.
Using a stylized model of adoption that fits well diffusion curves for individual technologies,
we have identified two margins of adoption: adoption lags and the penetration rates. Analyz-
ing the panel of adoption lags and penetration rates for 25 technologies and 132 countries, we
have uncovered two new facts. Adoption lags have converged across countries over the last
200 years, while penetration rates have diverged. Feeding in these patterns into the aggre-
gate representation of our model economy we have evaluated the effects of the cross-country
evolution of adoption patterns on the cross-country evolution of income growth.


                                                      32
   The main finding of the paper is that the evolution of adoption patterns accounts for
the vast majority of cross-country evolution of income growth for many country groupings.
Hence, this shows that adoption dynamics are at the core of the Great Divergence that has
taken place over the last two centuries.
   Our findings motivate some new questions that we plan to pursue in future research.
Probably the main one is why has the intensive margin of adoption diverged. Future work
shall formulate hypotheses about the nature, drivers and sources of dynamics for the inten-
sive margin of adoption. These explorations will complement our analysis towards a fuller
understanding of cross-country income dynamics.

This simulation corresponds to the transition to the new balanced growth path after an acceleration
of the technological frontier from .2% to 2% for a country with a constant lag as the average lag in
our sample (44 years) and average intensive margin (54% of the U.S. productivity level). The star *
denotes the half-life.

B        Transitional Dynamics with Linear Trends in Adoption
In this appendix, we extend the analysis of the model’s transitional dynamics to the case
where the adoption margins change continuously. As shown in Section 3, the evolution of
the intensive margin and adoption lags has been smoother than in (43). A more realistic
characterization of the evolutions of the extensive and intensive margins is given by:33

                                              are the trends in the adoption lags and intensive margin,
respectively.
  33
    The specification we have estimated in Section 3.2 differs slightly from (43) in that in Section 3.2 we fit a
linear trend to the log adoption lag while in (43) the trend is fit to the level. Both approaches seem sensible to
us and, quantitatively, there are no significant differences between them. The linear trend is more amenable
to analytical manipulation.

Proposition 5 Let the evolution of adoption margins be given by (51). Pre-Industrial pro-
ductivity is described by YOld (t) = AOld egOld t . Modern productivity is a continuous, increasing
function,

where A0 , A1 are positive constants, ga = d1 (χ+(1+d1 )γ)−(1+d1 )a1 , h0 (t) is S-shaped in the
sense that it is continuous, increasing, convex for any t < tc and concave thereafter, reaching
a ceiling value as time approaches infinity. h1 (t) is a continuous function defined as the CES
aggregator (with elasticity          1
                                    2−θ )   of e−χt h0 (T̄ ) and h(t − T̄ ). In the case that χ, γ  a1 , d1 and
d0 < T it is S-shaped (increasing, initially convex and eventually concave reaching a ceiling).
The transition from the old growth rate to Modern growth has two S-shaped transitions.34

       The most noticeable property of the evolution of Modern output is that, the evolution
of adoption margins affects trend growth in Modern sector output during the transition.
Specifically, the decline in the adoption lags accelerates the embodiment effect at the rate ga
because more technologies and vintages are brought into production. This raises trend growth
by d1 (χ + (1 + d1 )γ). Similarly, an acceleration in the intensive margin of new technologies
increases the productivity embodied in new technologies increasing trend growth by −(1 +
d1 )a1 .
       Proposition 5 points to the sources of cross-country differences in growth patterns. In
particular, it highlights, at least, three relevant dimensions. Differences in the initial adoption
lag, d0 , generate differences in the growth acceleration brought by the arrival of Modern
production technologies. Differences in the trends in adoption lags, d1 , and in the intensive
margin, a1 , affect the magnitude of the growth acceleration,ga , along the transition.
       One further implication of Proposition 5 is that the growth effects of a gradual reduction
in adoption lags depend separately on χ and γ beyond its sum. In other words, productivity
gains embodied in new technologies and in new vintages are not isomorphic. This is the
  34
       The expression for h0 (t) is very similar to h(t),
                                                                      d2

See Appendix E for the expression of h1 . The reason for having two S-shaped transitions is that we effectively
have two regimes and the transition is S-shaped for both. Hence, it can be the case that if ga is not very close
to zero (which is what happens in our calibration for the non-Western country), we observe a transition to
balanced growth χ + γ in two steps. First, while we are in the regime τ ∈ [T, T̄ ] the growth rate converges to
χ + γ + ga (in an S-shaped way), and once we enter the regime τ > T̄ , the economy grows from χ + γ + g0 to
gm an that transition looks again as an S-shape. In the case that χ + γ + g0 > χ + γ, we would observe an
inverse S-shape.

case because productivity gains embodied in new vintages, γ, lead to higher productivity for
both new and already adopted (Modern) technologies, while increases in the productivity
embodied in new technologies only affects output growth through the productivity of newly
adopted technologies.35

     We could also characterize the half-lives of this system in a similar manner to the main text. We obtain
                                                                T̄

We can further simplify the expression of ln Zτ by using the first order Taylor approximation
ln(1 + x) ' x for small x, yielding

                                                                                  γ

Equation (26) is obtained then by direct substitution.


D     Evolution of the Output Produced with Old Technologies
      when Old Vintages Become more Productive after the In-
      dustrial Revolution
Suppose that the change in the technology frontier is an instantaneous increase in the growth
rate of the technology frontier, from χo + γ o to γ + χ, that takes place at time T . We keep the
intensive and extensive margins constant at their pre-Industrial levels in this initial exercise.
To lighten up notation, we make the innocuous simplifying assumption that α = 0.

Proposition 6 Suppose that before the adoption of Modern technologies, the economy is in
a balanced growth path with growth rate χo + γ o , so that output is

                                          Y (t) = Ae(χo +γ o )t .                               (59)

After an economy starts adopting Modern technologies, output produced with Old technologies
is

                                   YOld (t) = Ao eγ o t d(t)θ−1 ,                               (60)

                                                                                                 γo
where Ao is a positive constant, d(t) is an increasing, concave function, with initial value   χo +γ o
and limt→∞ d(t) = 1. The output produced with Modern technologies is as in Proposition 1.

Proof    For output produced before a country starts adopting Modern technologies, τ < T ,
we have that equation (24) holds, and hence
                                                           θ−1

Once the adopted technologies are τ > T , the output produced with technologies with τ < T
grows only due to new vintages appearing and being more productive

Equation (60) follows from arranging the terms appropriately. It is immediate to verify that
                 γo
d(Do + T ) =   χo +γ o   and limt→∞ d(t) = 1. Taking the derivative of d(t), we have that it is
positive and the second derivative negative, which completes the proof.
    Note that if we assume that pre-Modern technologies were equally productive χo = 0,
we obtain exactly equation (35). If χo > 0 then there is an adjustment after the Industrial
Revolution coming from the fact that only better vintages contribute to growth in the pre-
Modern output. In any case, as χo + γ o  χ + γ, this transition is of no significance for the
transition to Modern growth and can be disregarded.

                    χ+γ
for ∆t < θ−1γ ln     χ   and concave thereafter.
   For the output produced with pre-Modern technologies, we have that by assumption, it
grows at rate gOld . In other words, as new vintages of Old technologies do not experience an
increase in productivity (and there keep appearing Old technologies at the gOld rate). Letting
(1 − α)gOld = (γ o + χo ), we can repeat the previous steps for the output produced with old
technologies. Note that, by assumption, the pre-Modern economy was in a balanced growth
path before the Industrial Revolution. This implies that the transient factor hOld (t) = 1.
Which gives,

Alternatively, this could have been derived by noting that dY /dt = gOld with the appropriate
boundary condition.

Indeed, in this case adoption margins do not change and DM = DO , aM = aO . This is noted
for future reference. Inspection of this term reveals that the last fraction has a very high
value if we assume γ M = 1% and γ O = χO = .1% (its numerical value is 5000). The other
two terms are also greater or equal than one. So, we have that κ  1.

It can be verified that the value of (78) at t = 0 is always positive (it is (κ(θ − 1))−1 and that
it is zero as t → ∞. Next, we show that (78) approaches zero from below as t → ∞. Note
that the sign of the derivative depends on the sign of the second line of equation (78), as the
first line is always positive. Moreover, note that the fastest growing term in the second line is
       (γ+χ−gO )t
−χγe      θ−1       . Thus it is immediate to verify that for t high enough, this term will dominate
in the second line of (78) and hence the derivative will be negative. Note moreover that we
have that there exists a t∗ such that for t < t∗ , equation (78) is increasing and it is decreasing
thereafter. We have shown already that at t = 0, the second line is positive.
   Next, we decompose the second line of (78) as the sum of two functions, one positive and
another negative. We show that the negative function decreases faster than the rate at which
the positive function increases. Thus, there is only one change of sign of the derivative at t∗ .
The second line of (78) can be written as,
                                                                            (χ−gO )t

To avoid a taxonomical analysis, we discuss only the case in point which is γ, χ  gO . In this
case the derivative of the positive terms is

                                      χγ(χ + γ)                  χt

                                        θ−1

while the derivative of the negative terms is

                                                     χγ(χ + γ) (χ+γ)t

Looking at the ratio (in absolute values) of the two, it is clear that initially the positive terms
grow faster (recall that κ  1). Thus, the term in the second line of (78) initially increases.
Eventually, it is the negative terms that grow faster, making the second line of (78) to decline
and eventually become negative. Note however that the first term of (78) is always decreasing.
Thus the magnitude of the negative slope will be attenuated by this first term.
   To gain some quantitative insight on when (78) ceases to be positive, assume that γ =
χ  gO . In this case, (78) simplifies to

In this case, we can solve explicitly for the time in which there is a change of sign,
                                                    √ p                      

Assuming that χ = γ = 1% and D = 45 years, this gives a t∗ = 240 years. At this point, the
value of the growth rate is g(t = 240) = 2%, so the decreasing part of the growth rate is of
no numerical significance.

First, it can be verified that the value of the second derivative at t = 0 is                      κ(θ−1)2
                                                                                                             .   Hence,
as long as 2γ + χ > 3gO , the curve is initially convex (which is indeed true as χ + γ ∼ 2% and
gO ∼ 0.2%. Second, asymptotically, the term that dominates is the last term of f (t), (96),
because it is the one that grows at the fastest rate, as long as γ > gO . This implies that the
curve is asymptotically convex.
   Next we are interested in whether the terms in (91) can make f (t) negative, and hence the
growth rate of the economy concave. Using basic results from calculus we can guarantee that
there exists a concave region. Recall that the growth rate is twice-continuously differentiable.
It asymptotes continuously a constant value as t → ∞ and approaches it from above. Moreover
we have shown that it is initially convex and asymptotically convex. Hence, the growth rate
has to be concave for some range of t. For one thing, it is impossible to have an increasing,
convex and bounded function over R+ . For another, we can apply Rolle’s theorem on the
derivative of the growth rate g 0 (t). We have already shown that g 0 (t) takes at least two times
the initial value (at t = 0 and some time after, as we have shown that g 00 (t = 0) > 0 and
g 0 (t∗ ) = 0 ). So given that g 0 (t) is a continuous function, it is decreasing in some region.
   To have a sharper characterization, we study again the case χ = γ  gO . In this case

We can thus solve analytically for the region in which the curve become concave by solving




                                                          53
for the zeros of f (t). Which yields, the following two solutions

                               ti2 =                                                                       .               (99)
                                                                                    χ

Quantitatively, using the same parametrization as before, we have that ti1 = 110 and ti2 = 261.
Inspection of equations (85), (99), and (99) shows that

                                                                         t1 < t∗ < t2 .                                   (100)

Thus we have an S-shape in the sense that growth rate is increasing and convex for t < t1 ,
then increasing and concave t ∈ [t1 , t∗ ], then decreasing and concave for t ∈ [t∗ , t2 ] and finally,
convex and decreasing for t > t2 , asymptotically converging to (γ +χ)/(1−α). Quantitatively
we have found that g(t∗ ) − (γ + χ)/(1 − α) is very small. Thus, in this case the “overshooting”
above the long-run growth rate is not quantitatively important.36

Proof of Proposition 3 We start with the half-life of the growth rate. The definition of
the half-life is

      In the explanation in the text we refer to an interpretation that claims that the evolution of the share s(t)
is S-shaped. Here we outline part of the analysis. Note that

abusing notation substituting t ≡ ∆t and taking the explicit derivatives of the share, it can be verified that
the sign of (103) coincides with the sign of

                                egt h02 − h00 (t)h(t) − g 2 h(t) + 2gh0 (t) + h00 (t) .

Using the properties derived in Proposition 1 for h(t) that the first and second derivative vanish for large t,
it is immediate to verify that the limit as t approaches infinity of (104) is positive. Similarly, when a country
starts to adopt technologies of the Industrial Revolution (for t = 0 after the change of variables), equation
(104) simplifies to −h00 (0) < 0. So we he have that the share on pre-Modern output is initially concave and
eventually becomes convex. Hence, the share on Modern output is initially convex and eventually concave.

where we are taking the normalization T = 0. As stated before, we proceed by averaging h(t)
to make the problem analytically solvable, which yields,
                                                                                           

Finally, note that if in the approximation of the averages we would have taken a large T , we
would have obtained that < h(t) >' 1 and that gh ' 0. In this case, α ' 1 (as χ + γ  gO )
and we would obtain the result reported in the paper. This shows the result for the half-life
of the growth.

Qualitatively, note that the output gap will be growing over time until Y (t) reaches the
Modern balance growth path, in which case the output gap becomes constant. In fact, by
construction, limt→∞ Ỹ (t) = 1. Moreover, as discussed Ỹ (t) is an increasing function.37 The
definition of the half-life is

                                            1
                                    Ỹ (0) + (1 − Ỹ (0)) = Ỹ (t1/2 ).                                (114)

We know that real income per capita in the world since the Industrial Revolution until 2000 has
increased on average 15-fold. Supposing that the Industrial Revolution started in 1765 with
James Watt’s steam engine invention, we have that in this time period, the income per capita
of a fictional country on the technological frontier would have increased exp(2%·235) = 108.4-
fold by 2000. Suppose further that by year 2000, Ỹ (t = 2000) ' 1. This means that
            15
Ỹ (0) '   108.4   = 0.14. In interest of having a simple expression, we proceed by assuming that
1  .14, so that the left hand side of (114) is approximately 1/2. In this case, the half-life
definition simplifies to
                                               1

       Following the same steps as in the derivation of the half-life of the growth rate (i.e.,
approximating the average of h(t) by its long-run level), one obtains that

Using that θ = 1.3, we can further simplify by using that 2 θ−1  1. Taking logs and solving
for t1/2 we obtain (41).

Proof of Proposition 4           With the definition of the evolution of the intensive and extensive
margins (43), we have that Old and Modern output is calculated as in Proposition 1. Applying
the definition of evolution of margins we just have to substitute D for DOld in the computation
for Old output and D for DM odern in the computation of Modern output. The rest of the

    As we discussed, the transitional dynamics can feature an overshot of the long-run growth, in which case
the output gap can be decreasing after surpassing Ỹ = 1. However, for purposes of our calculation this is not
a relevant range.

Proof of Proposition 5 The derivation for output of the Old sector is as in Proposition 1. Next,
we characterize Modern output. First, we analyze the case in which τ < T̄ . Note that the range of
integration for a given technology that is being used goes from [τ , t − Dτ ], where t denotes current time
and Dτ is the lag of technology τ . Without loss of generality, normalize the advent of the Industrial
Revolution T = 0. Recall the parametrization on the evolution of the margins of adoptions, which
in this range we simply denote by Dτ = d0 − d1 τ and ln aτ = a0 − a1 τ . To map Dτ into the time
space, note that the first technology will be adopted at time t = d0 and that the range of available
technologies at time t can be written as [0, t − (d0 − d1 (t − d0 ))] = [0, (1 + d1 )(t − d0 )]. The range
of vintages of technology τ at time t is given by the difference between the time the last adopted
vintage and the time of adoption of the first one, vτ ∈ [τ , t − Dτ ]. The output produced using modern
technologies can be written as

Moreover the left hand side equals the right hand side at t = d0 , establishing the result claimed for
t > d0 . Finally, the result that limt→∞ h0 (t) = 0 follows directly from taking the limit of h0 (t). QED

This last expression is indeed satisfied for t = d0 (as is the same expression we evaluated before). Note
that the left hand side is an increasing function that tends to infinity, while the right hand side is a
decreasing function that tends to minus infinity. Thus, at some t∗ ≥ t0 this inequality will cease to be
true, and (θ − 1)2 h00 (t) < 0 in that range. Finally, the result that limt→∞ h00 (t) = 0 follows directly
from taking the limit of h00 (t). QED
    We briefly discuss how the behavior of h(t) can inform our analysis on f (t) and its derivatives.
Using equation (126) it is immediate to verify that f 0 (t) inherits the properties of h0 (t), and hence,
f 0 (t) is increasing and f 0 (d0 ) = limt→∞ f 0 (t) = 0. Similarly, using (129), we conclude that gf is
increasing and gf0 (d0 ) = limt→∞ gf0 (t) = 0. Moreover limt→∞ f 00 (t) = 0. It can be verified too that
                      (1+d +d2 +d3 )γ

    Next we analyze the case in which τ > T . (the time corresponding to the transition is t =
d0 + T /(1 + d1 ). Note that the output produced with Modern technologies can be divided in the
output produced using technologies τ ∈ [0, T ] and the subsequent technologies, τ > T . The output

Note that this is an increasing function. Write output produced Ym0 (t) = C(Aegt − B)θ−1 . The time
derivative is

It is clear that (137) is asymptotically positive. Whether or not it is always positive, depends on
whether
                                        AegT − B > A(θ − 2),

which depends on parametric assumptions.
    Next we derive the output produced with τ > T using in equation (65) in which case the adoption
margins are constants and we denote T ≡ ti

    Note that the results we have derived for t < T apply directly to Ym1 because the transient part
of (142) is a particular case of the case analyzed previously for d1 = a1 = 0. In this case, taking the
second derivative of h(t) one can find a closed form expression for the threshold t∗ above which h(t)

A sufficient condition for h0 (t) to be increasing for all t ≥ T is that d0 < T . That is the initial lag has
to be relatively small compared to the transition period. For the second derivative, we have that

This shows already that asymptotically, (i.e., for large t) h00 (t) < 0. Similar to the analysis of the first
derivative, we have that evaluated at t = T , a sufficient condition for equation (161) to be positive is
d0 < T . In this case we would have an S-shape.

with ∆t = t − T. It is immediate to verify that y is an increasing function (as it is the sum of two
increasing functions). Thus, s is decreasing over time. Taking the second derivative over time of s,
                                                                                             
one finds that the sign of the second derivative is the same as the sign of ẏ 2 − (1 + y)ÿ 2 , using that

Using the fact that h(T ) = ḣ(T ) = 0, ḧ(T ) = γ, we have that ẏ(T )2 − (1 + y(T ))ÿ(T )2 is

                               g02 C02 e2g0 T − (1 + C0 eg0 t )(g02 C0 eg0 T + C1 γ) < 0.                                (166)

Thus, s is initially concave. That is, there exist a ε > 0 such that if t ∈ [T, T + ε] then ẏ(t)2 − (1 +
y(t))ÿ(t)2 < 0.
    Next, using that limt→∞ h(t) = χ/γ(χ + γ), limt→∞ ḣ(t) = 0 and limt→∞ ḧ(t) = 0, we find that
                                                                                                  

                         t→∞                                                 t→∞       γ(χ + γ)

Hence, the asymptotic behavior depends on whether χ ≶ γ(χ + γ). Note that given that both χ and
γ are on the order of 1/100, we have that χ > γ(χ + γ), and hence s is asymptotically convex.38


F      Computation of the Half-Lives Reported in the Main Text
We use the microfoundations for AM odern and AOld derived in (69) and (73), respectively. As
in the baseline model, we assume that growth is evenly split between χ and γ, both for Modern
and pre-Modern growth. This implies that to match long-run growth rates of 2% and .2% for
Modern and pre-Modern growth, we have that χ = γ = (1 − α)1% and χo = γ o = (1 − α).1%.
Using that θ = 1.3, we have that
                                                                                   θ−1

    For example, in the baseline case, we have that χ = γ = (1 − α)1%, so that the asymptotic behavior is

convex 100  > (1 − α) 100 100
                              . In fact, under the assumption that χ = γ, the condition for an asymptotic convex
                       50%
behavior is that χ < 1−α .

Taking the ratio of intensive margins of Modern and pre-Modern as the ratio of the intercept
of our estimated diffusion regression to the post-1820 average (see regression (1) in Table 4),
                aOld                     −.24−180·.0034
we have that   aM odern   = exp(−.24 −         2        )   = 1.2. Finally, for adoption lags, we take
DOld from the intercept of regression (1) in Table 3 and DM odern as the post-1820 average.
We have DOld = exp(4.37) = 80 years and DM odern = exp 4.37+4.37−180·.011
                                                                          

   Using equations (47) and (48) and the values we have calculated we can proceed and
calculate the half-lives. The total we find that

                                     tgap
