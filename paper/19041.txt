This handbook chapter seeks to document the economic forces that led the US to become an urban
nation over its two hundred year history. We show that the urban wage premium in the US was remarkably
stable over the past two centuries, ranging between 15 and 40 percent, while the rent premium was
more variable. The urban wage premium rose through the mid-nineteenth century as new manufacturing
technologies enhanced urban productivity; then fell from 1880 to 1940 (especially through 1915) as
investments in public health infrastructure improved the urban quality of life; and finally rose sharply
after 1980, coinciding with the skill- (and apparently also urban-) biased technological change of the
computer revolution. The second half of the chapter focuses instead on the location of workers and
firms within metropolitan areas. Over the twentieth century, both households and employment have
relocated from the central city to the suburban ring. The two forces emphasized in the monocentric
city model, rising incomes and falling commuting costs, can explain much of this pattern, while urban
crime and racial diversity also played a role.

I. Introduction

       Over its two hundred year history, the US has become an urban nation. Workers and

firms flowed to cities following urban-biased productivity shocks, including the new

manufacturing technologies of the first and second industrial revolution and, more recently, the

advent of computerization. In addition, workers were drawn to cities by improvements in the

quality of urban life, especially in public health.

       Seminal work in urban economics by Rosen (1978) and Roback (1982) suggests that the

urban wage and rental premia can be used to disentangle these competing explanations for urban

growth. Novel wage and rent series for urban and rural areas back to 1820 (wages) and to 1918

(rents) show that the urban wage premium in the US was remarkably stable over the past two

centuries, ranging between 15 and 40 percent, while the rent premium was somewhat more

variable, reaching above 70 percent in 1940 and again more recently.

       Despite this overall stability, fluctuations in urban wage and rental premia provide insight

into the economic forces underlying city growth. Urban premia rose from 1870 to 1940 as new

manufacturing technologies enhanced urban productivity and then again after 1980, coinciding

with the skill- (and apparently also urban-) biased technological change of the computer

revolution.

       Changes in urban wages and rents reflect both the productivity of economic activity and

the quality of life in urban areas. Historical episodes provide useful variation to document the

presence of agglomeration economies in cities and to understand the mechanisms through which

density enhances productivity. An extensive literature documents that the urban public health

investments of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century led to dramatic reductions in urban




                                                                                                 2
mortality; newer work has collected and analyzed data on public health improvements at the

neighborhood level.

       As urbanization continued, the location of workers and firms within metropolitan areas

began to decentralize. Over the twentieth century, both households and employment relocated

from the central city to the suburban ring. The two forces emphasized in the monocentric city

model, rising incomes and falling commuting costs, can explain much of this pattern, while

urban crime and racial diversity also played a role.

       The housing units and commercial buildings that make up a city are often more durable

then the city’s population itself. The last section discusses the problems associated with “vintage

capital” in cities – including the lingering housing stocks in declining cities as well as the

coordination failures that delay redevelopment in existing neighborhoods.



II. Urbanization rates, 1790-2010

       Since the country’s founding, the US population has been moving from rural to urban

areas and from smaller towns to larger cities. Figure 1 displays population trends over the past

two centuries. The figure reports the share of the population that lives in an urban place, defined

as a town with 2,500 or more residents, as well as the share of the population that lives in a

metropolitan area. Metropolitan areas are geographic units defined by the Census Bureau to

include one or more contiguous counties anchored by a central city of a sufficient size. The

number of metropolitan areas increased over time from 66 in 1900 to 373 by 2010. As a result,

the metropolitan share shown in Figure 1 increased both because existing areas attracted a larger

share of the population and because the number of metropolitan areas expanded over time.




                                                                                                 3
         The US population experienced little growth in urbanization in the first decades of the

nineteenth century, with the urbanization rate remaining below 10 percent. From 1830 to 1930,

the pace of urbanization accelerated quickly, with the urban share of the population increasing

more than six-fold from 9 to 56 percent. After a decade of stasis in the 1930s, the urban share

again increased rapidly from 1940 and 1970 and then more slowly from 1970 to 2010, reaching

81 percent in 2010. The share of the population living in a metropolitan area tracks the urban

share closely.1

         The trends in Figure 1 classify locations as “urban” (or “metropolitan”) if they reach a

certain population threshold. However, within the US, cities varied tremendously in their size

and population density over time and across regions. Figure 2 graphs county-level population

density for the median resident by region. Despite the rapid expansion of urbanization after 1830,

population density rose more slowly through the nineteenth century. In the Northeast, the growth

in population density accelerated after 1890, whereas density in other regions only began

increasing rapidly after 1940 (West) or 1970 (South). Regional gaps in population density are

driven both by variation in urbanization rates and by differences in density within urban areas.



III. Historical Background

         The pattern of urban growth over time and across regions was shaped by historical shifts

in industrial composition and transportation technology. The towns and cities of the early- to


1
  The South has long lagged behind other regions in urbanization rates, although this gap has narrowed over time. As
shown in Figure 1.1, in 1900 only 18 percent of southern residents lived in an urban area, compared to 66 percent of
the Northeast. By 2010, the South had caught up with the Midwest but both regions still lagged behind the West and
the Northeast. Wright (1986) attributes this gap to differences between free and slave agriculture. He argues that free
farmers held their wealth in land and therefore supported transport improvements, which indirectly supported city
growth. Southern plantation owners, in contrast, held their wealth in slaves, the value of which was not tied to a
particular place. In addition, farmers of staple grains sent their produce to town to be processed, while southern
planters processed cotton on plantation. Meyer (1988) provides some empirical evidence to support this hypothesis,
although further research on the history of this regional urbanization gap is needed.

                                                                                                                     4
mid-nineteenth century served as “central places” for their agricultural hinterlands. As the US

economy shifted from agriculture to manufacturing over the late 1800s, cities expanded their

functions from central places for the trade and shipment of agricultural products to the location

of industrial activity.2 The transition from waterways to rail as the primary modes of locomotion

also influenced the ascendancy of various cities at particular moments in time.

         In the early period, towns emerged as hubs for surrounding farmers to process and sell

their crops and, once there, to purchase consumer goods and specialized services, such as legal

and financial assistance. Weiman (1988) provides a useful case study of this process in Atlanta.

The location of these central places was strongly influenced by geographic advantages, such as

the presence of waterways and the proximity to rich farmland, but it was also reinforced by

human investments in supportive infrastructure – a process that Cronon (1992) refers to as

“second nature.” New York City, for example, was built around a natural harbor that provided

access to domestic and international markets. In addition, the Hudson and East rivers offered

connections to agricultural land in upstate New York and Long Island. The fertile farmland in

these areas supported a large rural population that generated a customer base for the services

offered in the city. Beyond these natural advantages, New York City’s ascendancy was

strengthened by investment in the Erie Canal, which linked upstate New York to the Great Lakes

and thereby expanded the city’s set of easily accessible markets.

         The natural advantages that shaped the historical locations of cities in the US changed

over time as innovation rendered existing transportation infrastructure obsolete. The stagnation

of St. Louis in the twentieth century offers one such example. St. Louis sits at the junction of the

2
  Michaels, Rauch and Redding (2012) argue that the shift from agriculture to manufacturing can explain why
population growth is not correlated with initial population density at low density levels but becomes positively
correlated with initial density at intermediate density levels. At low density levels, they argue, population growth is
driven by agricultural shocks, which are mean reverting, whereas at higher density levels, population growth is due
to shifts into non-agricultural employment, which is stronger in areas with higher initial density.

                                                                                                                     5
Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Furthermore, the Mississippi river narrows at this point,

preventing the passage of large steamboats traveling from New Orleans and requiring traders to

offload their cargo onto smaller boats to complete their journey to northern markets. This

confluence of trade created an opportunity for commercial activity and, hence, St. Louis

emerged. Yet, as river transport was eclipsed by rail, which minimized the need for these trans-

shipment points, St. Louis became overshadowed by Chicago as the largest city in the Midwest

(Cronon, 1992, p. 296).3

           Even as natural advantages diminish, forces of path dependence can preserve a relatively

stable array of city locations as long as there are sufficiently strong “agglomeration economies,”

by which the productivity advantages of proximity to other firms either leads existing firms to

stay in place or encourages new firms to locate in the area. Even St. Louis, which has been

surpassed in regional prominence, remains a city of 320,000 residents anchoring a metropolitan

area of nearly 3 million in a location that was historically valuable, despite the fact that there

might be little independent reason to build a city in this location today. Bleakley and Lin (2012)

illustrate this point further by examining the contemporary fate of cities located at historical

portage sites.

           With the growth of the railroad, transportation costs fell and manufacturing

establishments no longer needed to remain close to local customers. Instead, manufacturing firms

could concentrate production in regions that offered productive advantages, such as an

abundance of natural resources (Kim, 1995), or access to broader markets (Klein and Crafts,

2012). Furthermore, the switch first from water power to coal-fired steam power in the 1840s

and, eventually, to electricity freed up firms from locating close to power sources (Chandler,

1972; Rosenberg and Trajtenberg, 2004; Kim, 2005). By 1920, 69 percent of manufacturing

                                                                                                 6
employment occurred in a metropolitan setting, compared to only 43 percent of general work

activity.4



IV. Theoretical framework

           As the relative advantages of urban and rural locations change over time, where do

workers choose to settle and where do firms choose to operate? A Rosen-Roback model of firm

and worker location generates predictions about how the relative wages and rents in urban areas

change with the desirability of urban locations. We then use these predictions to interpret

historical time series of urban factor prices.

           Consider a group of workers and firms, each free to move between a set of cities. Cities

are endowed with a fixed quantity of land (L) and distinguished by an amenity level (S). S can

include consumer amenities (e.g. cultural activities) that attract workers as well as productive

amenities (e.g. access to natural waterways) that attract firms. In each city i, workers receive a

wage (wi) and allocate their resources between a consumption good (Xi) and land for housing

(Lhi). Firms in location i produce consumption good Xi with a combination of labor, land for

production (Lpi) and – if relevant – the productive amenity Si. Wages and rents adjust until, in

equilibrium, each firm and worker is indifferent between locating in all possible cities.

Implicitly, the model assumes that the consumption good can be shipped without cost between

markets, a condition that limits the applicability of the model in the nineteenth century but may

be a reasonable approximation in the twentieth century.

           Cities will grow either if workers are attracted to the area by a new consumer amenity or

if firms are attracted to the area by a new producer amenity. First, consider a new producer

amenity such as a new port for international shipping in city i. Firms move to city i to take
4
    Authors’ calculations from the IPUMS sample (Ruggles, et al., 2008).

                                                                                                  7
advantage of this local productivity boost. Firms in city i are now willing to pay higher wages

because each worker generates more output, thereby inducing workers from elsewhere to move

to city i. As firms and workers move to the area, competition over the fixed land resource drives

up rents, offsetting the increase in wages and equalizing worker utility across locations. Despite

the productivity advantage in city i, the need to pay higher rents and higher wages together

ensure zero profits for firms. Therefore, we can infer that cities whose growth is due to the

arrival of a new productive amenity will offer higher wages and charge higher rents.

       Next, consider a new consumption amenity like the development of a new theater district.

This consumption amenity will attract workers to the area and thereby drive up rents. Firms

facing higher rents will lower their demand for land, thereby reducing workers’ marginal product

and their wage. The combination of higher rents and lower wages counterbalance the higher

consumer amenity level, equalizing worker utility across cities. Therefore, we can conclude that

cities whose growth is due to a new consumption amenity will offer lower wages and charge

higher rents. Note that, in both cases, the model predicts that urban growth is accompanied by

higher rents; what distinguishes between producer- or consumer-led growth is the correlation

between urban growth and wages.



V. Urban wage and rent premia in the United States, 1820 to 2010

       The Rosen-Roback model can be combined with long-run series of urban wage and rental

premia to infer the underlying causes of urban growth in the US over time.

       We use Census and American Community Survey data from the Integrated Public-Use

Microdata Series (IPUMS) to construct wage series for the period 1940 to 2010 and rental series

for the period 1930 to 2010. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) Cost of Living



                                                                                                8
Survey Series, the Iowa State Census and the Census of Manufacturing permit us to extend the

series back to 1820 for wages and 1918 for rents (Ruggles, et al., 2008).5,6 Wages are calculated

for working-age men who are currently employed (i.e. not unemployed and not out of the labor

force) and who report earning non-negative annual wage and salary income.7 The rent series is

calculated using contract rents.8 All dollar figures are inflation-adjusted to 2010 values using the

urban consumer price index from the BLS for 1913 onward and from David and Solar (1977)

before 1913. Before 1918, the series compares urban to rural workers using the 2,500 resident

threshold; after 1918, we compare metropolitan to non-metropolitan workers.9

         Figure 3 shows the US urban wage premium for the period 1820 to 2010, along with the

underlying urban and rural wages; Figure 4 portrays the corresponding rent series for the period

1918 to 2010. Both the wage and rent premia are positive over the entire period – the wage

premium ranges between 13 and 42 percent over nearly two centuries, while the rent premium

ranges between 25 and 102 percent – suggesting a consistent productivity advantage for urban

areas despite the considerable decade-by-decade volatility in the series.

         Taken together, the figures broadly illustrate four episodes of urban evolution in the US.

In the early nineteenth century (1820-1870), our series is characterized by fairly flat wages in the


5
  The Weeks Report database, collected from the 1880 U.S. Census, also provides wage data for the mid-to-late
nineteenth century period. However, because it is a retrospective survey of a non-random sample of surviving
manufacturers and does not report the number of employees at each firm, it is inferior to the Census of
Manufacturing for our purposes. In particular, we found that reported wages in rural and urban areas were
substantially closer together in the Weeks Report data than in the Census of Manufacturing, likely because the rural
firms that kept retrospective payroll records were larger and less remote than the typical rural firm.
6
  Other cost of living surveys in the BLS series could not be used to extend the rent series beyond 1918. The data
from the 1888-1890 survey do not provide sufficient geographic precision, only identifying respondents’ state of
residence, while the microdata for 1901 were destroyed.
7
  In addition, we restrict our sample to men in the civilian labor force who are not living in group quarters or on a
farm and not currently attending school. Given the data at hand, the nineteenth century observations contain only
manufacturing workers while the twentieth century series is calculated using workers employed in all industries.
8
  Calculations using total income or gross rent, when available, yielded similar findings.
9
  Calculations using a consistent definition (such as an incorporated city of at least 2,500) or a consistent geography
(such as the metropolitan statistical areas as of 1900, those as of 2000, or those consistently identifiable in the
IPUMS data set) produced qualitatively similar results.

                                                                                                                     9
manufacturing sector within urban and rural areas and a steady urban wage premium of around

20 percent.10 From 1870 to 1940, we find steadily rising wages in both urban and rural areas and

a rising urban wage premium, which increased from 17 percent to 37 percent. Together with the

fact that workers continued to move to the cities during this period, the heightened wage

premium suggests that cities were becoming more productive centers of economic activity during

the second industrial revolution.11

         The third episode, spanning from 1940 to 1980, is characterized by rapidly rising wages

and rents together with declines in the urban wage and rent premia. Over this period, wages more

than doubled in each sector while the urban wage premium fell substantially, from 37 percent to

22 percent. At the same time, urban and rural rents also increased while the urban rent premium

declined substantially, from 86 percent to 48 percent. According to the Roback model, a

simultaneous decline in both the urban wage and rental premia suggests that productive

amenities in cities were falling relative to those in non-metropolitan areas – perhaps due to the

construction of interstate highways and the rise of trucking, which minimized the need to be near

fixed transportation nodes in central cities (e.g. train depots or ports). For a fixed housing supply,

then, as assumed in the Roback framework, we would expect population to shift away from

urban areas. Yet throughout this period, the urbanization rate continued to rise. Taken together,


10
   The urban wage premium appears to rise much more over this period if, instead of using wage data from the
Census of Manufacturing, we instead rely on wage data for three occupation categories (unskilled, blue collar and
white collar) from Lindert and Williamson (forthcoming). The premia based on this source are represented in Figure
3 by the open white circles and are explained in more detail in the figure’s notes.
11
   Although systematic data on urban and rural rents are not available for this period, we do have information on
farm land values (Pressley and Schofield, 2001). We compare farm values in metropolitan and non-metropolitan
counties nationwide and in a subsample of counties that changed from non-metropolitan to metropolitan status (or
vice versa); we use the IPUMS definition to classify counties as “metropolitan.” In both cases, we observe a
declining urban land value premium from 1880 to 1920. One determinant of agricultural land values in areas near
cities is the opportunity cost of developing this land for other urban uses. Taken literally, the decline in both urban
wage and urban land value premia would suggest that the relative productivity of urban areas was declining over this
period, which we find unlikely. Instead, this pattern may simply reveal the heightened productivity of areas far from
urban centers for agricultural use over this period given the improvements in transportation that facilitated bringing
agricultural products to market.

                                                                                                                   10
these trends suggest that the growth in the urbanization rate in the mid-twentieth century was

likely driven by an increase in urban housing supply. The substantial amount of homebuilding in

the suburban ring in the decades after World War II reduced urban rents, thereby leading to an

increase in urban residence despite the loss of relative urban productivity.

       The fourth episode, from 1980 to the present, is characterized by another sustained

increase in both urban wage and rental premia. The urban wage premium grew from 22 to 34

percent over this period. Likewise, the rent premium jumped from 48 to 66 percent. At the same

time, the urbanization rate grew modestly. In light of the Roback model’s predictions, these

trends imply that urban areas enjoyed a boost in productivity – coinciding with the diffusion of

the personal computer and later the Internet. It is often suggested that the skill-biased

technological change of this era contributed to rising income inequality by education level. What

is less well known is that computerization was also associated with rising inequality between

metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. In other words, computers and cities appear to be

complements; computers may facilitate the types of learning or worker-firm matching that take

place in cities (Wheeler, 2001).

       One caveat to the above analysis is the issue of worker quality. The Roback model

assumes that all workers supply one identical unit of labor. Yet if the highest quality workers are

attracted to city living, then the urban wage premium could simply be due to higher-quality

workers sorting into cities, rather than to underlying changes in urban productivity for workers of

a fixed quality. Furthermore, it is possible that changes in sorting patterns over time could

account for a rising (or falling) urban wage premium if the most talented rural dwellers leave for

the city, thereby lowering the average rural wage and, at the same time, either increasing or




                                                                                                11
decreasing the urban wage depending on how these in-migrants compare to the existing urban

population. For a modern approach to this selection problem, see Glaeser and Mare (2001).



VI. Agglomeration economies

        Our historical wage and rental series suggest that the productivity of urban areas, relative

to their rural counterparts, has fluctuated over time. Urban productivity appeared to increase

sharply from 1980 to 2010. Perhaps as a result, academic interest in the concept of

“agglomeration economies,” or the potential productivity advantages of being in close proximity

to other firms, has expanded tremendously in recent years.12 This section emphasizes the

contributions of economic history to this growing field, both in documenting the presence (or

absence) of agglomeration economies in various historical settings and in using these historical

episodes to distinguish between possible mechanisms underlying the forces of agglomeration.

        The use of historical data allows scholars to chronicle the strength of agglomeration

economies over long periods of time and to contrast the role of agglomeration economies under

different technological regimes. Davis and Weinstein (2002) examine regional population

growth in Japan over the past 8,000 years. In particular, they highlight the persistence of this

spatial distribution even in the face of the decimation of many cities during World War II. The

authors claim that the post-war rebound of Japanese cities is more consistent with a story of

locational fundamentals, in which cities arise in areas that are blessed with innate productive

advantages, than a story of agglomeration economies, in which initial density confers

productivity advantages. Yet, they also demonstrate that the most productive regions of Japan

  Google scholar catalogs fewer than 2,000 papers that mention the words “economics” and “agglomeration” in the
year 1995-96. Ten years later, this number had increased to more than 11,000, expanding at a pace twice as fast as
the recorded number of hits for the word “economics” alone. We acknowledge that this measure may not be exact
because the relative reliance on terms used to describe agglomeration economies (such as “increasing returns” and
“external economies”) may have changed over time.

                                                                                                               12
grew relatively more populous after industrialization, suggesting that agglomeration economies

may have played a larger role over time.

         The emergence of agglomeration economies in Japan only after industrialization is

echoed in the findings of Bleakley and Lin (2012), who document the long-run growth of early

American cities established at portage sites. Portage sites emerged at river rapids when early

travelers needed to disembark and carry their boats, generating opportunities for trade. Even as

the initial raison d'être for these cities disappeared with the advent of canals, railroads, and

trucking, these portage cities maintained their size advantage well into the twentieth century.

While locational fundamentals provided the initial impetus for the location of portage cities, the

long-term growth differentials suggest that these cities were subject to forces of agglomeration.13

         Although the benefits of agglomeration have been present throughout the industrial

period, our long-run wage and rent series suggest that these forces have strengthened in recent

decades. A burgeoning literature in urban and labor economics documents the presence of these

spillovers at the firm level; Moretti (2004b) and Rosenthal and Strange (2004) provide useful

reviews of this contemporary literature. Recent studies like Fu (2007), Greenstone, Moretti and

Hornbeck (2010), and Baum-Snow and Pavan (2012) continue to advance this research agenda.14

         Beyond documenting the presence of agglomeration economies, it is also important to

understand the mechanisms by which proximity to other firms may generate productivity

advantages. A growing literature is utilizing the historical record to shed light on possible




13
   Ahlfeldt, et al. (2012) argue that agglomeration economies are also likely at work within cities. In particular, they
show that employment centers near East Berlin experienced falling land prices as the Cold War partition cut them
off from workers and customers but rebounded soon after reunification.
14
   In contrast, Buenstorf and Klepper (2009) present evidence from the U.S. tire industry suggesting that industrial
clustering occurs through “heredity” as successful parent firms generate spinoffs, rather than through forces of
agglomeration.

                                                                                                                    13
benefits of locating in a city, including access to larger product markets, larger input markets,

and larger numbers of similar firms from which to learn new production techniques.

          In the early nineteenth century, the large customer base available in cities allowed urban

firms to economize on transportation costs. Sokoloff (1988) demonstrates the importance of

market size in the nineteenth century by focusing on geographic variation in innovation, an

economic activity with high fixed costs that often only becomes profitable if the resulting

product can be sold in high volume (e.g., Krugman 1991). Sokoloff finds that, in the first half of

the nineteenth century, patenting rates were higher in urban areas and along navigable rivers and

canals.

          With the rapid decline in transport costs in the late nineteenth century, the importance of

access to a large local customer base receded. Instead, agglomeration economies may now arise

due to the advantages of large labor markets in urban areas. Contemporary white collar and

technical jobs require specialized knowledge or experience and, thus, educated workers are often

more productive at firms that are well-matched to their specific skills. The potential for finding

better matches in the labor market provides an edge to firms locating in large urban areas. Costa

and Kahn (2000) explore the role of thick labor markets in generating agglomeration economies

by focusing on the location choices of dual-career couples. They find that college-educated

couples are more likely to live in large metropolitan areas and that this sorting has increased in

recent decades alongside the growth in the urban wage premium.

          Marshall (1890) theorized that the forces of agglomeration are strongest between firms in

related industries that can more easily share ideas, workers, and inputs and output linkages.

Offering a historical test of this hypothesis, Bostic, Gans, and Stern (1997) contrast possible




                                                                                                  14
industrial externalities within large U.S. cities in the late nineteenth century; their findings point

to an important role for agglomeration externalities in urban growth.

         Moving beyond the concept of city-wide agglomeration forces to that of specific inter-

industry linkages is a promising direction for future work.15 Hanlon (2012), for example, traces

the asymmetric effects of the cotton blockade during the American Civil War on the growth rates

of various industries in cotton- and wool-producing towns in England. He finds that industries

closely related to textiles, such as machine tools, experienced much slower employment growth

during and after the Civil War in cotton-producing towns, both relative to industries less

connected to textiles and relative to similar industries in wool-producing towns. That is, the

removal of certain links in the local industry mix seems to have particularly strong and long-

lasting impacts on firms in related industries.

         Another promising direction for new research on agglomeration is the use of historical

conditions to generate cross-city variation in persistent factors that may contribute to

contemporary economic growth. Moretti (2004c), for instance, uses the historical allocation of

land grant universities as an instrument for the share of a city’s workforce with a college degree.

Glaeser, Kerr and Kerr (2012) and Bunten et al. (2013) leverage the historical location of mining

activity and other heavy industry to predict which areas will lack high levels of entrepreneurship

today.




15
  Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr (2010) provide a general framework for measuring patterns of coagglomeration between
industry pairs in a single cross section. They find that sharing inputs, workers and ideas all contribute to
coagglomeration, in that order of importance. Hanlon and Miscio (2013) are extending this framework to historical
data (1850-2000), in part to determine whether the patterns of coagglomeration and the channels generating such
coagglomeration have changed over time.


                                                                                                              15
VII. Amenities and disamenities in cities: The case of public health

        In addition to taking advantage of the productivity advantages of density, workers may

choose to locate in cities to enjoy the amenities of proximity to other households and firms.

Recent work by urban economists tends to emphasize the positive aspects of density – namely,

that cities offer a wider array of shopping venues, cultural events, and bars and restaurants

(Glaeser, Kolko, Saiz, 2001; Sinai and Waldfogel, 2004). However, in the past, the negative

aspects of density likely outweighed the positive, most importantly the spread of communicable

and water-borne disease. Simply put, cities were deadly places until the spread of investments in

clean water and sewer systems.16 The role of public health in moderating urban mortality rates

has been studied extensively in economic history, historical sociology and epidemiology.

        In 1900, death rates, particularly infant mortality, were substantially higher in urban areas

than in rural areas, in large part due to infectious disease (Condran and Crimmins, 1980; Haines,

2001).17 Part of the urban wage premium in the nineteenth century may have been a

compensating differential for the health costs borne by urban residents (Figure 4).18 The urban

mortality penalty and corresponding wage premium both declined in the early twentieth century

as cities began investing in clean water systems, sewage control and sanitation. Early work by

Gaspari and Woolf (1985) on these investment projects in 122 cities in 1910 finds that the extent

of sewer lines in an area has a negative association with mortality rates.

16
   The case of urban public health illustrates that the sharp division between productive and consumption amenities
does not always hold. Improvements in public health may have attractive to both consumers and firms, if healthy
workers were more productive on the job (see, for example, Arora, 2001).
17
   Cain and Hong (2009) show that survival rates were higher in smaller cities than in larger cities in a late
nineteenth century sample of men who served in the Union Army. Kesztenbaum and Rosenthal (2011) use French
military records to study the health consequences of moving to a city from a rural area. They find that rural
newcomers enjoy a survival advantage for the first few years of urban residence but, within a decade, converge to
the high mortality rates present in the city. Having been born in the city does not appear to confer a survival
advantage due, say, to immunities to transmitted diseases but neither did growing up in a rural area save migrants
from the deadly conditions of the city due to improved childhood nutrition.
18
   Williamson (1982) demonstrates that locations in England with higher infant mortality rates in the mid- and late-
nineteenth century had higher wages, thereby compensating workers for this extra risk.

                                                                                                                 16
        Cutler and Miller (2005) substantially improve on this analysis by following a subset of

14 cities from 1900 to 1930. The cities most likely to invest in clean water technology may have

been those most susceptible to severe disease outbreaks or, alternatively, may have been those

with the largest tax base and an otherwise healthy population. By following cities over time,

Cutler and Miller can control for fixed differences across cities and instead estimate how a city’s

health record changes after implementing a new public health project. They find that cities

experienced a 13 percent reduction in total mortality after the introduction of their first clean

water systems, primarily due to a decline in deaths from water-borne disease. By this estimate,

clean water alone can explain nearly half of the urban mortality decline in the early twentieth

century.19

        Looking ahead, we believe that the recent explosion of data collection at the

neighborhood level within cities is a promising trend in the study of urban public health.

Kesztenbaum and Rosenthal (2012) compile information on mortality and sewer infrastructure,

along with income and rents, for the 80 quartiers of Paris. In the mid-nineteenth century, the

average life expectancy in Paris was five years lower than in the rest of the country; yet at the

same time there was a twelve (!) year gap in life expectancy between residents of the healthiest

and least healthy neighborhoods within Paris. In Paris, building owners had to pay a fee to

receive a hook-up to the sewer main and so early sewer infrastructure widened the health

disparity between wealthy and poor neighborhoods. In the US, in contrast, Troesken (2002)

argues that even African-Americans, often a city’s poorest residents, benefited from the

provision of water and sewerage systems, especially in cities with lower levels of residential


19
   Ferrie and Troesken (2008) analyze Chicago’s three distinct water projects from 1867 to 1917. They find that each
project reduced death both from typhoid fever, a typical water-borne disease, and from seemingly-unrelated causes
of death. This pattern is consistent with the epidemiological theory that reductions in water-borne disease
strengthened the population’s resistance to other health shocks.

                                                                                                                17
segregation. The Center for Population Economics at the University of Chicago will soon release

comprehensive neighborhood data for eight US cities. This data will allow scholars to measure

local variation in disease and mortality rates and to understand how US cities were able to reduce

disease in poor areas through public health investments (if, indeed, this result is borne out in the

broader data).20

        In a related study, Villarreal (2012) shows that historical variation in the health

conditions between neighborhoods can have persistent effects on neighborhood quality (as

proxied by housing prices) over time. He focuses on neighborhoods built in the historical

marshland in New York City, which had high rates of water-borne disease in the nineteenth

century. Over time, this health disamenity disappeared as the marshes were drained and

infrastructure for clean water and sewers improved. Yet the housing price disparity between

former marshland and the rest of the city remained – and even grew – over time, in large part due

to the persistent sorting of poor residents into historically disadvantaged areas.



VIII. Location of workers and firms within urban areas

A. Population suburbanization

        Thus far, we have focused on workers’ and firms’ decisions to locate inside or outside of

urban areas. Once inside an urban area, workers and firms have the choice to settle in many

possible locations, some closer to the central city and others on the periphery. Over the twentieth

century, the share of households and firms located in the central city has declined substantially.

Figure 5, which was originally published in Boustan and Shertzer (2013), documents trends in

city and suburban growth from 1940 to 2000 for the 103 metropolitan areas anchored by a


20
  Price Fishback, Shawn Kantor and Trevor Kollmann also plan to release neighborhood-level data on XX cities for
the 1930s, including information on XX. For preliminary work using some of this data, see Kollmann (2011).

                                                                                                             18
central city that had at least 50,000 residents by 1970. Over the second half of the twentieth

century, the share of metropolitan residents living in a central city fell from 58 percent to 36

percent. Yet, with the exception of the 1970s, the average central city experienced positive

population growth in each decade.21 Despite population growth in central cities, the suburban

population continued to grow at a substantially higher rate, leading to a steady decline in the

share of the metropolitan population living in central cities.

        The Tiebout model is one useful structure for understanding the location decisions of

households amongst various municipalities in a metropolitan labor market (Tiebout, 1955).

Mobile households within a metropolitan area are free to choose amongst a variety of

municipalities offering different bundles of public goods and tax rates. As incomes rise,

households may shift toward locations with better schools and correspondingly higher tax rates,

which tend to be located in the suburbs. Yet Rhode and Strumpf (2003) caution that the long run

data is not consistent with some aspects of the Tiebout model. The framework implies that, as

transportation costs fall, household sorting should rise. However, in samples of US

municipalities and counties, Rhode and Strumpf show that jurisdictions have converged in their

taxing and spending decisions over time.

        The monocentric city model – jointly attributed to the work of Alonso (1964), Muth

(1969), and Mills (1972) – offers an alternative approach to analyzing spatial location within

metropolitan areas. A core feature of the model is the assumption that all employment is

concentrated in a central business district (CBD). Households then decide whether to locate close




21
  The growth of central cities in Figure 5 is partly driven by the expansion of land area in central cities via
annexation. In 1940, the average city in this sample was 48 square miles; by 2000, it had grown to 117 square miles.

                                                                                                                 19
to or far from the CBD, trading off a shorter commute for the higher rents of parcels closer to the

CBD.22

         According to the monocentric framework, suburbanization will occur – that is,

households will move further from the CBD – when: (1) transportation improvements reduce the

time cost of travel and (2) incomes rise, thereby increasing the demand for land and housing

services and encouraging households to move to the periphery where housing prices (per square

foot) are lower.23 These hypotheses are borne out in the historical record. Margo (1992)

demonstrates that rising real income can explain around 40 percent of suburbanization in the

post-World War II period (1950 to 1980). At the same time, construction of the interstate

highways reduced the time cost of commuting between the central city and outlying towns.

Baum-Snow (2007) uses the original 1947 federal highway plan, which was designed for

purposes of defense and inter-state trade, to instrument for the actual number of highways later

built in a metropolitan area. He finds that another one-third of the change in relative city

population can be explained by the availability of new highways.

         The core economic variables emphasized in the monocentric city model (rising income,

falling commuting costs) explain a large portion of suburbanization over the twentieth century.

Demographic and social changes within cities, including rising crime rates and growing racial

diversity, also encouraged some households to relocate to insulated suburbs via Tiebout-style

sorting. Property crime in urban areas doubled between 1960 and 1990. Cullen and Levitt (1999)

find that a 10 percent increase in city crime rates corresponds to a 1 percent decline in city

22
   The assumption that all employment takes place in the CBD is not well-suited to most American cities, especially
those that developed after the diffusion of the automobile and often feature two or more employment centers. Yet,
despite its stylized nature, this framework generates sensible predictions for the conditions under which the majority
of the population will live close to the city center and the conditions under which it will move further away.
23
   This prediction will hold as long as the income elasticity of demand for land area is greater than the income
elasticity of commuting costs. Glaeser, Kahn and Rappaport (2008) show that, empirically, the income elasticity of
demand for land is not large enough to account for very much of the association between income and suburban
residence.

                                                                                                                  20
population. According to this estimate, the mid-century crime wave should have reduced city

population by at least 10 percent, which, in combination with the other factors above, would

greatly over-explain the decline in city population. Yet, since 1990, crime rates have fallen

almost as dramatically as they initially rose, which may have counteracted some of the initial

mobility response.

         Boustan (2010) exploits variation in black migration from the rural South to northern and

western cities to estimate the role of “white flight” in suburbanization process. She finds that

each black arrival led to 2.7 white departures. By this estimate, white flight can account for

around 10 percent of mid-twentieth century suburbanization, equivalent to the construction of

one new highway. White departures from central cities contributed to a rise in racial residential

segregation; by 1970, 80 percent of black and white households would have needed to switch

residences in order for each neighborhood in a metropolitan area to reflect the racial composition

of the area as a whole (Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor, 1999).

         In the US, suburban households are more likely to be white and affluent (although the

same is not true of many European cities; see Brueckner, Thisse and Zenou, 1999).24 Glaeser,

Kahn, and Rappaport (2008) suggest that, in the US, the rich are more likely than the poor to live

in the suburbs because they tend to commute by car, whereas the poor rely on public

transportation. Given that public transportation is more readily available in city centers, the poor

are more likely to locate downtown.25 In addition, once central cities began to attract poor


24
   The income gap between cities and suburbs in the US has widened over time. In 1940, the typical suburban
resident earned only three percent more than his urban counterpart; by 2000, the city-suburban income gap increased
to 16 percent.
25
   Of course, this association raises the question: why is there more transit in central cities? To a certain extent,
downtown’s identity as a transit center may be a legacy of the historical concentration of economic activity in
central cities and/or may be a natural outgrowth of the design of transit systems in hub-and-spoke arrangements.
Yet, it is also possible that the continued investment in downtown transit is in response to the demands of poor local
constituents, rather than the main cause of their location decisions. Historical analysis could be used to disentangle
the relationship between access to transit and neighborhood poverty.

                                                                                                                  21
residents, this concentration of poverty may have begotten more poverty, either due to an

endogenous clustering of public services and private businesses attractive to the poor or to the

example of peers with weak attachment to the labor force.

       Despite the strong predictive power of models allowing free mobility, households’

optimal location decisions are often circumscribed in reality by the available housing stock,

which is in turn influenced by local zoning restrictions. The first zoning laws were implemented

in the 1910s and were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1926.                 Fischel (2001) models

municipalities as selecting a triad of property taxes, public good and zoning rules to maximize

property values for the median homeowner/voter. In this modified Tiebout approach, zoning

regulations ensure that new households with different preferences are unable to simply move in

and overwhelm the local consensus of taxation and expenditures. Historically, Fischel argues,

zoning enabled municipalities to add industrial employment centers, low-income apartment

buildings, and other disfavored uses only when the use generated municipal revenues capable of

offsetting the nuisance and congestion costs imposed on local residents.

       If zoning enables municipal coordination, then the introduction of zoning laws ought to

have increased property values by improving the fit between resident preferences and local

conditions. McMillen and McDonald (2002) examine the implementation of Chicago’s first

zoning ordinance in 1923 and find that blocks zoned residential such that no industrial uses were

permitted, save for those already in place, experienced an uptick in (estimated) land values

relative to areas zoned to allow both industrial and residential use. Although industrial zones

may be an eyesore to local residents, they also generate additional tax revenue that can be shared

by a broader set of municipal residents; future work ought to address this trade-off.




                                                                                               22
        The rapid implementation of zoning laws around 1920 presents a unique opportunity to

study these processes.26 In San Francisco, this implementation occurred shortly after the

devastating 1906 earthquake and fire – disasters that resulted in a substantial increase in housing

density within the burned area. Bunten and Siodla (2013) provide evidence that the resulting

differences between burned and non-burned areas were codified in the city’s first zoning law in

1921. The authors then use this historical coincidence to shed light on the contemporary effects

of zoning restrictions on housing prices.



B. Employment decentralization

        As population left city centers over the twentieth century, metropolitan employment also

relocated to the open land in the suburbs. Glaeser and Kahn (2001) document that, by 2000, the

majority of both residence and employment was located in the suburbs in the typical

metropolitan area. Information-based industries like finance have not decentralized as rapidly –

hence the density of Manhattan, an extreme outlier – but the majority of cities have experienced

ongoing employment decentralization since at least 1950.

        The decentralization of employment may simply be a byproduct of suburbanization as

firms follow workers out of the city, or it may be driven by independent forces that allow more

efficient production to occur at greater distances from the city center. One factor that may have

encouraged firms to leave central cities was the growing network of interstate highways and the

rise of truck-based transport, which decoupled distribution from downtown rail depots. Indeed,

Baum-Snow (2010) shows that highways did not simply enable citizens to move outward and



26
  Brooks and Lutz (2013) argue that zoning regulations can “lock in” existing levels of urban density, rendering re-
optimization difficult. They demonstrate that density remains higher around historical street car stops in Los
Angeles even eighty years after the street car lines ceased to operate.

                                                                                                                 23
commute inward; rather they appear to have encouraged both households and firms to locate at a

distance from the central city.

       Baum-Snow’s analysis cannot disentangle whether highways first encouraged households

to move to the suburbs with firms following suit, or vice versa. Boustan and Margo (2009a)

analyze this interaction between workers and firms by contrasting the residential choices of

workers whose employers are immobile, such as state government workers in state capitals or

clerks at the US Postal Service, with similar workers whose employers moved to the suburbs.

They find that these government workers are more likely to live downtown, suggesting that

household location decisions are closely tied to firm location. Their results suggest that, if not for

the decentralization of employment, suburbanization rates would be substantially lower today.

Of course, employers may also follow households, so the two effects can be mutually reinforcing

in a decentralized equilibrium.

       The decentralization of employment opportunities has affected groups differently

according to their ability to suburbanize. Boustan and Margo (2009b) present indirect evidence

that urban blacks faced diminished employment opportunities as firms left cities by documenting

a notable uptick in black employment at US Postal Service sorting facilities, a large employer

that remained rooted in downtown areas, as other firms moved to the suburbs circa 1960.



IX. Vintage capital and “lock-in” effects

       Although cities are, most importantly, dense centers of population, they are also made

manifest physically through their architecture. The long-lived nature of urban buildings and

neighborhoods has important implications for how households and firms organize themselves

within and between cities. For instance, new residences can be constructed rapidly, but old



                                                                                                   24
houses decay slowly. This observation generates a number of predictions, which were outlined

by Glaeser and Gyourko (2005). First, housing prices should not increase as a city expands

because the construction sector should satisfy growing demand. Yet housing prices will fall

quickly in contracting cities as demand for the existing housing stock declines. Second, lower

housing prices will compensate residents for falling wages, thereby ensuring a slow decline in

population: while cities can explode overnight, they take decades or more to fade away. In the

meantime, the population of declining cities will be disproportionately low-skilled and less-

attached to the labor force. These predictions may help to explain patterns of rapid boom and

slow decay experienced by many US cities including, most recently, Detroit.

       Intra-city housing dynamics are also affected by the longevity of the housing stock. In

any metropolitan area, high-income residents tend to occupy houses that are newer, larger, and of

higher-quality. As these houses age, their residents may seek newer homes, leaving the older

units to “filter” down to lower-income denizens of the city. Brueckner and Rosenthal (2009)

argue that, initially, filtering helped to explain why rich households were more likely to live in

the suburbs with plentiful new construction. Yet, going forward, they predict that this process

will encourage gentrification of urban neighborhoods as deteriorating homes and neighborhoods

in the central city are redeveloped.

       The distributional consequences of urban gentrification remain an open question. Turning

to history, one particularly controversial incidence of central-city redevelopment was the massive

urban renewal efforts of the mid-twentieth century. Proponents argued that the strong negative

externalities of “slum” neighborhoods could limit economic activity in the rest of the city.

Furthermore, they asserted that private interests were unable to overcome the transaction costs of

redevelopment and so local governments should use eminent domain to assemble land in



                                                                                               25
affected neighborhoods and provide grants and loans to enable redevelopment. Exploiting

differential passage of the necessary laws at the state level, Collins and Shester (2013) find that

redevelopment had a positive and long-lasting effect on city growth across a number of metrics.

        Siodla (2012) studies another (accidental) example of large-scale twentieth-century

redevelopment: the rebuilding of San Francisco following the 1906 earthquake and fire. In the

early twentieth century, San Francisco was growing rapidly and yet its existing housing stock

was primarily composed of low-density single family homes. Areas that were razed by the fire

transitioned more rapidly to a dense streetscape of apartment houses than did neighboring

unburned areas. This differential persisted for over two decades, suggesting that the

redevelopment costs and external coordination problems faced by durable capital owners are

indeed significant enough to prevent rapid re-optimization of the urban capital stock in the face

of shifting demands. Hornbeck and Keniston (2013) provide a model of this redevelopment

process, along with further empirical evidence from the Boston fire of 1872.



X. Concluding remarks

        This chapter analyzes the sources of urbanization over two hundred years of US history.

Using newly-compiled series on urban wage and rental premia, we argue that urban growth in

the US was driven by a combination of urban-biased technological advances that enhanced

productivity in cities and improvements in urban quality of life, especially due to investments in

public health. Interest in agglomeration economies, their causes, and their implications for urban

growth and persistence has been growing in recent years; historical work has much to contribute

to this line of inquiry.




                                                                                                26
        A combination of rising incomes and major road-building projects in the mid-twentieth

century spurred both households and firms to leave central cities and settle in suburbs. Yet cities

and suburbs are not only separated in space but are also jurisdictionally distinct. Aspects of local

political economy, including differences in crime rates and police protection, public

transportation investments, and zoning regulations, reinforced this spatial redistribution.
