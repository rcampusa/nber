We investigate the predictive power of survey-elicited time preferences using a representative sample
of US residents. In regressions controlling for demographics and risk preferences, we show that the
discount factor elicited from choice experiments using multiple price lists and real payments predicts
various health, energy, and financial outcomes, including overall self-reported health, smoking, drinking,
car fuel efficiency, and credit card balance. We allow for time-inconsistent preferences and find
thatthe long-run and present bias discount factors (ƒØ and »ï) are each significantly associated in the
expecteddirection with several of these outcomes. Finally, we explore alternate measures of time
preference. Elicited discount factors are correlated with several such measures, including self-reported
willpower. A multiple proxies approach using these alternate measures shows that our estimated
associationsbetween the time-consistent discount factor and health, energy, and financial outcomes
may be conservative.

I. Introduction

       Time preferences are generally considered to be a primitive of economic decision-making

and so predicted to affect behavior across many dimensions. Economic theories assume that

less-patient individuals are less likely to spend money, time, or resources now to yield benefits in

the future. However, the specific manner in which patience (or future-orientation) affects

intertemporal resource allocation is the subject of ongoing debate. The standard economic model

assumes that agents make consistent intertemporal decisions ‚Äì which implies a constant rate of

discounting. Contrarily, growing evidence from behavioral economics and psychology suggests

that many individuals exhibit present bias, whereby the weight placed on consumption now

relative to tomorrow is greater than that placed on consumption one year from now relative to

one year and a day from now.

       Whether individuals have time-consistent preferences is not merely an academic

question. Time inconsistency may induce inefficient decisions. Present bias, if real, provides a

potential justification for government intervention, since individuals may make decisions in the

present that they will regret in the future ‚Äì a situation that government fiat may avoid

(O'Donoghue and Rabin 2006). For instance, time-inconsistent consumers may be less willing to

invest in energy-efficient technologies (e.g. hybrid cars, home energy improvements) if they do

not account for future savings as much as the standard model assumes; this is a potential

explanation of the energy efficiency gap and rationale for government intervention (Allcott and

Greenstone 2012). Policies related to health behaviors are affected since time-inconsistent

consumers may underinvest in health, e.g. by eating too much, exercising too little, or failing to

buy insurance. Policies designed to encourage retirement savings may also need to

accommodate the potential for time inconsistency (Carroll et al., 2009).
                                                  3


       This paper investigates how elicited time preferences (defined across both time-consistent

and time-inconsistent frames) predict consumer behavior across multiple domains. We

contribute to the literature by considering a much broader range of outcomes than those studied

previously. In so doing, we explore the degree to which consumer choices comport to the

standard economic model or to the new behavioral economic models, and so illuminate how

effective people can be at making decisions that maximize utility in the long run while also

minimizing regret. The results provide direct evidence of the link between both time-consistent

and time-inconsistent preferences and numerous outcomes related to health, energy, and

financial behavior.

       Since no secondary data exist that contain the wide range of information necessary for

this analysis, we field our own survey and measure time preferences with an incentive-

compatible choice experiment about intertemporal tradeoffs, paying out for one of the choices

for randomly-selected respondents to mitigate any hypothetical bias. We use multiple price list

(MPL) questions to compute the standard discount factor, both the present bias and long-run

components of a quasi-hyperbolic (ùõΩùõø) specification, and the coefficient of relative risk aversion

(CRRA). This allows for an empirical test for associations of both time-consistent impatience

and time inconsistency with outcomes related to self-reported health, health behaviors, health

insurance, use of energy-efficient technologies, and financial decisions, while holding risk

preferences constant to avoid erroneously conflating time and risk preferences.

       There is debate in the literature about how well discounting measures elicited from small-

stakes financial tradeoffs actually reflect the rates of time preference used in real-world

decisions. One concern is that the stakes are not high enough for individuals to respond

accurately. Additionally, time preferences may vary across different domains (Chapman and
                                                  4


Elstein, 1995). For instance, questions about intertemporal health choices may predict health

behavior better than time preferences about monetary payoffs. To address these challenges, we

also consider alternative measures of time preferences, including self-reported preferences and

questions specifically tailored to health decisions. These alternate proxies allow us to investigate

whether certain measures predict behavior better overall or in specific domains, and they enable

us to assess how measurement error impacts our estimates from regressions using elicited time

preferences.

       Our data show that time preferences elicited using MPL questions over monetary payouts

are significantly correlated in the expected direction with many outcomes related to health,

energy use, and finances. In regressions controlling for demographic and risk preference

variables, the time-consistent discount factor is significantly correlated with self-reported overall

and mental health, activity limitations, refusal to report weight or height, snacking, smoking,

binge drinking, seat belt use, having health insurance, installing energy-efficient lighting, the

temperature setting on one's thermostat, retirement savings, and credit card balance. The present

bias discount factor ùõΩ is statistically associated in the predicted direction with self-reported

overall and mental health, activity limitations, refusal to report weight or height, smoking, binge

drinking, driving a fuel-efficient car, reporting a well-insulated home, the temperature setting on

one's thermostat, and having non-retirement savings. Our elicited time preferences are also

associated with some but not all of our alternative time preferences proxies. Interestingly, time

preferences elicited from hypothetical questions related to health are generally less significant

predictors of actual health outcomes than are time preferences for monetary outcomes elicited

from MPL questions. Finally, we implement Lubotsky and Wittenberg‚Äôs (2006) method of using
                                                    5


multiple proxies to correct for measurement error and provide evidence that our prior estimated

effects of elicited time preferences on consumer behaviors may be conservative.

       The results therefore suggest that both time-consistent and present-biased discounting

influence many aspects of health, health behaviors, energy use, and financial decisions, with the

relative extent to which each matters varying across different outcomes. The importance of

present bias suggests additional potential implications for policy design, as mentioned above.


II. Background

       Time preferences have been conceptualized in a variety of ways. Among the earliest

modern theoretical frames is from Samuelson (1947). Samuelson assumed that individuals

maximize the present value of a stream of current and future utility. Present value is calculated

by discounting future payoffs by a constant amount in each time period. Future utilities are

weighted less heavily compared to the current level of utility, but in a manner that does not

produce preference reversals (if a person is willing to accept $1 to wait until tomorrow to

consume something, then that person will be willing to accept $1 to delay that same consumption

by a day in any future period). Thus individuals were assumed to select consumption levels in

each time period, xt, to maximize
                                                        ùëá

                                       ùëà(ùë•0 , ‚Ä¶ , ùë•ùëá ) = ‚àë ùõø(ùë°)ùë¢(ùë•ùë° )                            (1)
                                                        ùë°=0

subject to an income/wealth constraint. In Samuelson‚Äôs model, which is still the canonical

approach today, the exponential weighting function ùõø(ùë°) = ùõø ùë° implies constant discounting per

time period; this is the basis for the most common understanding of a ‚Äúdiscount rate‚Äù (from

which the weighting factor ùõø(ùë°) is derived) in economics. In this paper we will label this time-

consistent discount factor as ùõøùëéùë£ùëî .
                                                  6


       In the early 1990s, however, some researchers built an alternative framework based upon

Strotz (1955) that suggested individuals may exhibit systematic biases in their decision-making.

In particular, Ainslie (1991) and Laibson (1997) assume that individuals maximize a discounted

utility stream that places disproportionately higher weight on the present payoffs relative to all

future ones. This ‚Äúquasi-hyperbolic‚Äù discounted utility function takes the form
                                                            ùëá

                                  ùëà(ùë•0 , ‚Ä¶ , ùë•ùë° ) = ùë¢0 + ùõΩ ‚àë ùõø ùë° ùë¢(ùë•ùë° ) ,                        (2)
                                                           ùë°=1

where the parameter ùõΩ corresponds to a time-inconsistent preference for the current payoff

(present bias when ùõΩ < 1) and ùõø is the time-consistent (long-run) component of temporal

preferences. In what follows, we label this pair of preference parameters as ùõΩùëû‚Ñé and ùõøùëû‚Ñé .

       We are, of course, not the first to be interested in empirical issues related to time

preferences. A prior literature examines whether consumers‚Äô preferences are time-consistent (as

opposed to our focus on whether the level of time inconsistency is associated with particular

outcomes), with laboratory investigations going back to Thaler (1981). Other research examines

whether specific aspects of consumer behavior suggest present bias. Individuals' choices about

exercising (Dellavigna and Malmendier 2006), completing homework (Ariely and Wertenbroch

2002), participating in welfare programs (Fang and Silverman 2009), and eating (Ruhm 2012) all

indicate time inconsistency and present bias. Buyers of cars seem to underweight future gasoline

costs (Allcott and Wozny forthcoming). Gillingham and Palmer (2013) describe how several

types of behavioral anomalies, including time-inconsistent preferences, could explain the

‚Äúenergy efficiency gap,‚Äù in which there appears to be underinvestment in energy-saving

technologies.
                                                 7


       Still other investigations estimate the associations between elicited time preferences and

various outcomes, but without distinguishing time-consistent from present-biased behavior. For

instance, connections have been found between time preference and: BMI (Chabris et al. 2008,

Weller et al. 2008, Sutter et al. 2013), exercise (Chabris et al. 2008; Bradford, 2010), smoking

(Bradford, 2010; Sutter et al. 2013), drinking (Sutter et al. 2013), preventive health care

utilization (Bradford, 2010; Bradford et al. 2010), healthy behaviors among hypertensive patients

(Axon et al. 2009), and overall self-assessed health (Van der Pol 2011). Finally, there is research

indicating that present bias is related to a limited set of outcomes such as: smoking (Burks, et al.

2012), credit card borrowing (Meier and Sprenger 2010), BMI (Ikeda et al. 2010; Courtemanche

et al. forthcoming), and ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù mortgages (Toubia et al. 2013).

       Our study's contribution is threefold. First, we examine how survey-elicited time

preferences are related to a large and heterogeneous set of real-world outcomes, including those

across the domains of health, energy, and financial decisions. To our knowledge, we are the first

to estimate the link between elicited time preferences and many of our outcomes: self-assessed

physical and mental health, health-related limitations, snacking, binge drinking, sunscreen and

seatbelt use, variables related to home and automobile energy use, among others. Second, our

study allows for quasi-hyperbolic discounting and disentangles whether the diverse group of

observed relationships are driven by time-consistent preferences (ùõø), present bias (ùõΩ) or both.

We are unaware of prior research on the relationship between elicited time inconsistency and any

of our outcomes, with the exception of smoking, BMI, and credit card debt as noted above.

Third, in our judgment we provide the most thorough attempt to assess how the predictive power

of time preferences elicited over monetary outcomes compares to that of other time preference
                                                        8


measures across different domains, and whether this implies meaningful attenuation bias in

estimates based on elicited monetary measures.


III. Data and Model

        An online survey of 1,325 respondents was conducted using Qualtrics software

(www.qualtrics.com). Respondents were chosen to be representative of the US adult population

(18 and over), using quota sampling based on age, education, and gender. The survey was

conducted in July and August 2013.

Elicited Time Preferences

        We measured impatience and present bias using three "blocks" of multiple price list

(MPL) questions. Each block contains several choices asking the respondent whether he/she

would prefer a smaller, earlier payment or a larger, later payment. We observe respondents‚Äô

choices between receiving money now versus in one month ("red block"); now versus in six

months ("black block"); and in six months versus in seven months ("blue block"). In all cases,

the larger payment (at the later date) was $30, while the smaller payment ranged from $8 to $29.

Each respondent was asked 22 such questions; the values are listed in Table 1.1 Typically

respondents choose the smaller earlier option for a portion of the choices and switch to the larger

later option for the remainder. Shifting between the smaller earlier and larger later options

implies that the subject was indifferent at some point along the interval between the two rows,

which defines a range of values for a time preference parameter.

        Table 1 also lists the implied monthly discount factor for a consumer who is just

indifferent between the larger and smaller payments, along with the percentage of respondents



1
 The time periods were the same as those used in Meier and Sprenger (2010). We adjusted the dollar values of the
payments downward to reflect our budget (and rounded each to the nearest dollar integer).
                                                          9


choosing the larger amount. For instance, in the first row of the red block, a consumer who is

just indifferent between $29 today and $30 in one month has a one-month discount factor of

0.9667 (29 = 30 * 0.9667), and 24.22% of respondents chose $30 in one month over $29 today.

For each block, the percentage choosing a delayed payout increases as the earlier payment

decreases, as expected. Comparing the red block to the black block reveals the anticipated

finding that respondents are less willing to wait for a given (larger) payoff that is farther in the

future. Additionally, these responses provide evidence of present bias. Specifically, time-

consistent consumers should answer each corresponding question in these two blocks the same

way, since in each case there is the same rate of return from an additional one month delay in the

payout. However, for the first three rows we see that substantially more people are willing to

wait a month for the larger payout when both payout options are in the future. When the earlier

payments are $24 or less (in the third through sixth rows), the majority of respondents choose to

wait but there is no difference in the percentage doing so between the red and blue blocks.

         We calculate two sets of discount factor parameters based on the MPL questions. Within

each block of time preference choices, we assume that respondents were indifferent between the

smaller earlier option and the larger later option at the mid-point between the values at which the

respondent switched from earlier to later choices.2 First, we impose time-consistent discounting

using a single monthly discount factor and use non-linear least squares to determine the

parameter ùõøùëéùë£ùëî that best-fits a respondent‚Äôs indifference points for the three blocks of time




2
  If a respondent never switched between earlier or later options, but for example always chose the larger later
option, then we assume he/she was indifferent at the most extreme delayed row. If a respondent switched between
smaller earlier and larger later options multiple times (violating preference monotonicity), we utilized the mid-point
between the first switching row as our measure of indifference. 90% of respondents exhibited zero or one switch for
the black block of questions, and 91% of respondents exhibited zero or one switch for the red and blue blocks. Our
results are robust to either utilizing the last observed switch between smaller sooner and larger later choices, or to
excluding subjects who exhibited multiple switches.
                                                             10


preference questions. Next, we best-fit a respondent‚Äôs choices assuming a quasi-hyperbolic

discounting specification with two parameters ùõøùëû‚Ñé and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé .3

          To combat any hypothetical bias, we paid a random subset of between 5% and 20% of

respondents (depending on the phase of the survey) based on their responses to the MPL

questions. For each chosen respondent, one question was randomly selected as the payout

question.4 Payments were Amazon.com gift cards. To ensure trustworthiness of these payments,

we emailed each winner immediately after the survey completion with one of the professors‚Äô

contact information.

          Table 2 presents summary statistics for our calculated time preference measures. The

time-consistent monthly discount factor ùõøùëéùë£ùëî averages around 0.85, which is low for a monthly

discount factor but consistent with previous literature finding low discount factors when using

MPLs (Meier and Sprenger 2010, Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue 2002). ùõøùëéùë£ùëî exhibits

significant variation; the 25th and 75th percentiles are 0.81 and 0.95 respectively.5 The mean

value of ùõΩùëû‚Ñé is 0.94, indicating that the average respondent is present biased. Once again there is

considerable heterogeneity, with 10 percent of respondents having values below 0.68, 25 percent

lower than 0.85, and 26% above 1.0 indicating future-bias. For a small number of respondents,


3
  An alternative and somewhat simpler way to calculate discount factors is employed by Meier and Sprenger (2010).
They calculate a monthly discount factor for each of the three payout time pairs; call these ùõø0,1 , ùõø0,6 , and ùõø6,7. (That
is, ùõø0,1 is the discount factor calculated using the respondent's answer to the MPL questions about payoffs now vs.
one month from now.) The arithmetic mean of all three of these discount factors is ùõøùëéùë£ùëî ; this assumes time-
consistent discounting. They allow for time-inconsistent discounting by noting that a respondent can have a
different value for ùõø0,1 and ùõø6,7 . If ùõø0,1 < ùõø6,7, then consumers are present-biased. The present bias discount factor
        ùõø0,1
ùõΩùëû‚Ñé =          and the long-run discount factor ùõøùëû‚Ñé = ùõø6,7. A caveat of using this method is that it drops observations
        ùõø6,7
for respondents failing to respond to one or more questions, as well as those with inconsistency in their responses.
Also, the present bias discount factors ùõøùëû‚Ñé and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé are calculated using just the red and blue blocks. In general, our
results are robust to using this alternate calculation.
4
  The payout questions include the MPL questions described here and the lottery questions asked to elicit risk
preferences, described below.
5
  Given the structure of the multiple price list questions, it is not possible to have a discount factor ùõø above 1, since
no questions have a payoff in an earlier period that is greater than the payoff in a later one.
                                                      11


the results suggest implausibly extreme future bias, probably indicating reporting errors, an issue

to which we return below. Because the mean value of ùõΩùëû‚Ñé is less than one, ùõøùëû‚Ñé > ùõøùëéùë£ùëî , on

average. Table 2 shows that this is also true throughout most of the distribution, although the

differences are not huge.

Control Variables

        A caveat to eliciting time preferences using solely MPL questions is that it relies on the

assumption that utility is linear in income. Measuring time preferences without controlling for

risk preferences can lead to misleading results (Andersen, et al. 2008, Andreoni, Kuhn and

Sprenger 2013), although in our application the payoffs are sufficiently small that the assumption

of linearity is likely to be innocuous. Nevertheless, to further reduce the possibility of incorrect

inference, we adopt the strategy of using double multiple price lists (DMPL).6 We included an

additional series of questions about preferences over lotteries (see Andersen et al. (2008), p.

586). In each case, the respondent was asked to choose between two lotteries: both have the

same probabilities of winning larger or smaller amounts, but the actual amounts vary. Table 3

summarizes the lotteries.7 Moving down the table, the difference in the expected value of lottery

B improves relative to that of lottery A. Since Lottery B is always riskier, the risk aversion

coefficient that makes an individual indifferent between the two lotteries increases in the later

rows. Specifically, the risk aversion coefficient is calculated based on the constant relative risk

aversion (CRRA) specification:

                                                           ùëÄ1‚àíùëü
                                                ùëà(ùëÄ) =                                                      (3)

  In addition to DMPL, Andreoni et al. (2013) consider an alternative convex time budgets (CTB) strategy. We use
DMPL, because the computational burden on the participants of the CTB questions would have been too great given
the other questions that are asked in our survey.

  The probabilities and dollar values are taken from Andersen et al. (2008).

where the CRRA coefficient is r and consumption is M.8 Table 3 shows that as the expected

value of B becomes relatively larger than that of A, the number of respondents choosing B (the

riskier lottery) increases. We calculate the CRRA by assuming a respondent was indifferent at

the mid-point between the values at which he or she switched from certain to risky choices.9 The

average CRRA value is 0.422, implying that the typical sample member is risk averse. In our

sample, we observe a negative correlation between CRRA and elicited time preferences (-0.084).

However, excluding CRRA from the set of controls (results available upon request) has little

effect on the regression estimates.

           We also asked respondents a set of questions about demographic characteristics that

included: age (in years), gender, income (in $1,000), race (non-Hispanic white vs. nonwhite or

Hispanic), marital status (married vs. unmarried), education (less than high school, high school

graduate, some college, college graduate, postgraduate) and number of children. Controlling for

these variables allows us to account for many obvious potential confounders of the relationships

between time preferences and consumer behaviors. Appendix Table 1 lists the control variables

and provides their summary statistics.

Dependent Variables

           We explore four categories of dependent variables: 1) health, 2) energy use, 3) finances,

and 4) other measures of time preferences. The health questions were predominantly drawn

from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance

    For instance, for a consumer who is just indifferent between lottery A and lottery B in the first row of Table 3, risk
                                                  201‚àíùëü           201‚àíùëü        38.51‚àíùëü         11‚àíùëü
aversion is the ùëü that solves the equation: 0.2 (     ) + 0.8 (     ) = 0.2 (     ) + 0.8 (     ) so that ùëü = ‚àí0.95.
                                                  1‚àíùëü           1‚àíùëü           1‚àíùëü           1‚àíùëü
See Andersen et al. (2008), p. 590.

  Similar to the time preference methodology, we assumed indifference at the endpoint if a respondent never
switched between certain and risky choices. If the respondent switched between certain and risky choices multiple
times, we utilized the first observed switch. 75% of respondents exhibited zero or one switch for the lottery series.

System (BRFSS) 2011 questionnaire.10 The first subset of these questions relates to self-

assessed health. Respondents were asked if they would say that their health "in general" is

excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. We use this answer to create two binary outcomes:

overall health good or better (versus poor or fair) and very good or better (versus poor, fair, or

good).11 They were also asked the number of days in the past month that their physical and

mental health were not good (two outcomes), and the number of days that their health problems

prevented them from doing their usual activities. We also included two indicators of the

probability of having any health insurance and of self-purchasing insurance conditional on not

having employer-provided or public coverage.

         The next subset of health questions pertain to behaviors. Respondents self-reported their

height and weight, allowing us to compute body mass index (BMI). Since increases in BMI do

not monotonically worsen health, we focus on a binary obesity indicator (BMI‚â•30). To provide

a preliminary assessment of behaviors directly affecting health and through which time

preference may influence weight, we also asked respondents whether they had any non-work-

related exercise in the past 30 days and how many snacks (sweet or salty) they consume on a

typical day. In addition, we included current smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked

per day among smokers, combined into a single variable for cigarettes smoked per day (0 for

non-smokers).12 Respondents were also asked about alcohol use. Since alcohol intake does not

monotonically worsen health, we focus on risky drinking as measured by the number of binge

drinking occasions in the past month (4 or more drinks at one time for women and 5 or more for


10
   That survey is available at: http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/.
11
   We also considered dependent variables measuring for overall health fair or better and excellent health. The
results for fair or better were similar to those for good or better; those for excellent were similar to those for very
good or better.
12
   We considered separate models for smoking status and cigarettes per day among smokers, but the sample size in
the regression containing only smokers was too small to obtain meaningful precision. We therefore are unable to
disentangle whether effects of time preference on smoking occur along the extensive or intensive margins.
                                                       14


men). Finally, we included information on the use of sunscreen and of seat belts, two behaviors

that protect health. Appendix Table A2 reports summary statistics for these health-related

variables.

        The next set of outcomes relate to energy use, with questions predominantly drawn from

the US Energy Information Administration's 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. 13

The first dependent variable indicates whether the respondent owns a high-fuel-economy vehicle

(higher than 25 mpg), with the sample restricted to those owning any motor vehicles. The home

energy outcomes include dummies for respondents having: ever installed compact fluorescent

lights (CFLs) in their homes, a well-insulated home (in their opinion), a programmable

thermostat, and ever conducted a home energy audit. Since renters are not fully incentivized to

invest in energy-saving technologies, we restrict the sample for these variables to persons who

have owned their current home for at least two years. The final outcome in this section is a

continuous measure of the temperature the respondents keep their home in the summer (with the

sample restricted to those with thermostats). Summary statistics on these outcomes, as well as

those discussed next, are provided in Appendix Table A3.

        We also include financial outcomes. We consider only a small set of financial variables

because the literature on these and similar outcomes is relatively well-developed compared to

that on health and energy use (e.g. Meier and Sprenger 2010). The first is whether the

respondent has any credit cards. We view the theoretical prediction for this outcome as

ambiguous: impatience may increase demand for credit, but also lead to a lower credit rating and

therefore reduce access to it. Moreover, sophisticated time-inconsistent individuals may refuse

to have credit cards to constrain their future behavior (i.e. ‚Äúcutting up your credit cards‚Äù). Next


13
  That survey is available at: http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/. Additional questions were taken from
the survey designed for Attari et al. (2010).
                                                         15


is an estimate of total credit card debt, defined only for those with any credit cards. The last two

outcomes are dichotomous and indicate whether the individual has any retirement or non-

retirement savings.

         The final category of dependent variables, also used as covariates in some specifications,

is included to evaluate the relationships between MPL-elicited monetary time preference

measures and other measures. They also help address the concern that time preferences may

differ across domains, in which case discount factors based on monetary tradeoffs may not be

reflective of discount factors applied in health- or energy-related choices, and their estimated

effects on these choices may therefore suffer from attenuation bias.14 We consider five alternate

time preference proxies. The first three are self-reported patience, willpower, and ability to resist

junk food (willpower in a specific health-related domain), answered on a scale of 1 to 10.15 Our

fourth measure is an elicited health-related discount factor, based on a series of hypothetical

questions about drugs for migraine headache relief (Ganiats et al. 2000). In each question, the

respondents are told to suppose that they suffer from debilitating migraines, and that two drugs

are available to them. Both drugs are the same price but only one of them can be used. Drug A

can be taken now, and Drug B will not be available until the future. Drug A will be effective for

12 months, but Drug B (once available) will be effective for 24 months. We then vary the delay

for the availability of Drug B for periods ranging from 6 months to 7 years. We compute each

respondent‚Äôs health-related discount factor from the point at which he/she switches from Drug A

to Drug B, identically to our methodology for discount factors over monetary outcomes.16



14
   For instance, Augenblick et al. (2013) provide experimental evidence that consumers exhibit more present bias in
choices over work effort tasks than in choices over money.
15
   The exact questions are: "How patient are you in general?", "How strong is your willpower/ability to control your
impulses?", "How difficult is it for you to avoid eating a snack food you enjoy (e.g. chocolate chip cookies, ice
cream, potato chips) if it is easily available, even if you are not hungry?"
16
   82% of subjects exhibited zero or one switch for these migraine questions.
                                                           16


         Additionally, we consider another outcome in this category: a score based on responses to

a "Cognitive Reflection Test" (CRT) developed by Frederick (2005). The CRT questions

measure the ability to "reflect" on a response before committing to an answer provided by

intuition.17 Each of the three questions has one answer that springs quickly to mind based on

intuition but is wrong. The questions are:

         (1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How

             much does the ball cost? ____ cents

         (2) If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take

             100 machines to make 100 widgets? ____ minutes

         (3) In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If

             it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take

             for the patch to cover half of the lake? ____ days

For instance, the answer that springs to mind for question 1 is 10 cents, although the correct

answer is 5 cents.18 Frederick (2005) posits that the CRT questions measure how able an

individual is to use ‚Äúsystem 2‚Äù to reflect on the answer provided by "system 1" (using the

terminology coined by Stanovich and West (2000) and popularized by Kahneman (2011)). Since

answering the CRT questions correctly requires the patience to resist the immediately obvious

answer, it is likely related to time preference as well as cognitive ability. Summary statistics for

these alternate time preference variables are reported in Appendix Table A4.

         We hypothesize that individuals with higher discount factors (more patience) will exhibit

better health and healthier behaviors, engage in purchases or actions promoting energy


17
   CRT scores are also positively correlated with several standardized test scores, including the SAT and the ACT
(Frederick 2005, Table 4).
18
   In question 2, the intuitive answer is 100 minutes, but the correct answer is 5 minutes. In question 3, the intuitive
answer is 2 days, but the correct answer is 47 days.

efficiency, and have more savings. This will generally be true for both the time-consistent (ùõøùëû‚Ñé )

and quasi-hyperbolic (ùõΩùëû‚Ñé ) components of preferences. However, we might expect the latter to

be more important for outcomes that may reflect a failure to follow through with intended

actions. For instance, ex ante we might expect impulse decisions such as snacking and binge

drinking to be more heavily influenced by present bias than major purchases such as health

insurance coverage.

Model

        The primary empirical objective is to identify statistically significant associations

between time preferences and the dependent variables. We start by running two specifications

for each outcome. The first models time preferences using the time-consistent discount factor

ùõøùëéùë£ùëî ; the second uses the quasi-hyperbolic discount factors ùõøùëû‚Ñé and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé . These regressions take

the form

                                  ùë¶ùëñ = ùõæ0 + ùõæ1 ùõøùëéùë£ùëî,ùëñ + ùú∏ùüê ùëøùíä + ùúÄùëñ                              (4)

and

                              ùë¶ùëñ = ùõº0 + ùõº1 ùõøùëû‚Ñé,ùëñ + ùõº2 ùõΩùëû‚Ñé,ùëñ + ùú∂ùüë ùëøùíä + ùúñùëñ                        (5)

where i denotes individuals, ùëøùíä is a set of control variables, ùõæ and ùõº are parameters to be

estimated, and ùúÄ and ùúñ are error terms. The control variables are the CRRA score, age categories

(18-20, 21-25, 26-30, ‚Ä¶, 76-80, >80), gender, race (white non-Hispanic versus other), education

categories (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate, and

postgraduate degree), married, family size (0, 1 or 2 children, and 3 or more children); and
                                                         18


indicators for ten income deciles. Missing demographic variables are imputed based on

regressions on the non-missing demographic variables.19

         Our outcomes are a mix of continuous, binary, and count variables. We estimate probit

models for the binary outcomes and negative binomial models for the count dependent variables.

All reported estimates are average marginal effects.20 In order to facilitate comparability of the

estimated magnitudes of the effects of ùõøùëû‚Ñé and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé , we use standardized discount factor variables

(with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one) in all regressions. A one-unit increase in

the discount factors therefore represents an increase of one standard deviation, and the average

marginal effects can roughly be interpreted as the effects of one-standard-deviation increases.

         Throughout the analyses below, we restrict the sample by dropping the 57 respondents

whose values of ùõΩùëû‚Ñé are above the 95th percentile, which is 1.25 in our sample. It is conceivable

that some respondents exhibit future bias rather than present bias, which would indicate a ùõΩùëû‚Ñé

greater than one. However, we believe that many of the very highest values of ùõΩùëû‚Ñé are erroneous

and represent noise stemming from fitting two time preference parameters from a small number

of questions.21 After dropping these respondents, 21.7% of our sample is future-biased. This

proportion is in the middle of the range from the literature.22 Most of our results are maintained,

though somewhat weakened, by including all values of ùõΩùëû‚Ñé . Interestingly, not dropping any



19
   The results are robust (with occasionally slightly less significance) to simply dropping observations with any
missing demographic variables or creating missing value dummy variables and including these observations.
20
   The results are generally similar using linear regressions, though the average marginal effects are often more
precisely estimated by the non-linear models.
21
   For example, 100% of respondents for whom ùõΩùëû‚Ñé > 1.5 say they would take $21 in six months versus $30 in
seven months but 88% of these same individuals state that they would accept $30 in one month versus $21 today.
Although this is consistent with extremely strong future bias, we think it much more likely that this is due to
reporting errors. If we do not drop any respondents, ùõΩùëû‚Ñé reaches as high as 5.423, which seems clearly unrealistic.
22
   Using MPLs similar to ours for time preference elicitation, Meier and Sprenger (2010) find 9 percent of their
sample future-biased; for Ashraf et al. (2006) it is 19.8 percent. See also Sayman and √ñnc√ºler (2009). However,
using a different methodology ‚Äì a non-parametric time consistency check ‚Äì Takeuchi (2011) finds that more
respondents exhibit future bias than present bias.
                                                  19


outliers also eliminates any significant associations between ùõΩùëû‚Ñé and the alternate time

preference proxies, which increases our confidence that these extremely high values of ùõΩùëû‚Ñé

reflect noise rather than genuine future bias.


IV. Time Preferences and Outcomes

        Tables 4-7 present average marginal effects for our main regressions examining the

associations between time preferences and self-reported health, health behaviors, energy use, and

financial outcomes. Here, and throughout the empirical analysis, relatively small sample sizes

reduce the statistical power to reject false null hypotheses. Therefore, while we focus on

statistically significant effects, we will also point out where the relationships are substantial and

in the hypothesized direction but do not reach statistical significance.

Self-Reported Health Status and Health Insurance

        Self-reported health outcomes and health insurance coverage are focused upon in Table

4. All three discount factors are significantly positively correlated with the probability that

respondents are in good or better (as opposed to fair or poor) health. Interestingly, while

individuals with higher ùõøùë† are healthier than their counterparts who discount the future more

heavily, the average marginal effect of a change in standardized present bias (ùõΩùëû‚Ñé ) is about twice

as large as that for standardized ùõøùëéùë£ùëî or ùõøùëû‚Ñé : a 5.5 percentage point increase versus 2 to 3

percentage points (relative to a sample rate of being in good or better health of 83%). However,

the discount factors are insignificant in the very good or better health regressions, suggesting

their influence on overall health occurs primarily in the left tail of the distribution.

        None of the discounting variables significantly influence days not in good physical

health, but all three are negatively and significantly associated with the number of days not in

good mental health. Once again, the magnitude of the coefficient on ùõΩùëû‚Ñé is about twice as large
                                                  20


as that on either ùõøùëéùë£ùëî or ùõøùëû‚Ñé : the average marginal effect of standardized ùõΩùëû‚Ñé is 1.3 fewer days

per month in not good mental health (compared to a standard deviation of 8 days), versus

average marginal effects of both of the standardized ùõøùë† of 0.6 to 0.8 days. However, the main

conclusion, again, is that relatively patient individuals are in better health, with particularly large

effects for persons who are less present-biased. And virtually the same pattern is found for days

with activity limitations, where all three discount factors are negatively and significantly

correlated with the dependent variable, and with predicted effects for standardized ùõΩùëû‚Ñé that are

approximately about twice as large as for standardized ùõøùëéùë£ùëî or ùõøùëû‚Ñé . The bottom line is that

impatient individuals and present-biased individuals have worse overall health, lower mental

health, and more activity limitations than their counterparts who discount the future less heavily.

       The final two outcomes in Table 4 demonstrate that more patient individuals, measured

by either ùõøùëéùë£ùëî or ùõøùëû‚Ñé , are also more likely to have health insurance. This is true for all

consumers (models 6a and 6b), and among the subset who do not have access to insurance

through employers or government and so must purchase it themselves (columns 7a and 7b). This

latter group is the one for whom time preferences seem likely to be most important (since they

directly make decisions to buy health insurance rather than having it come from other sources)

and, consistent with this expectation, patience has a larger predictive effect for them: the

average marginal effect of an increase in either standardized ùõøùëéùë£ùëî or standardized ùõøùëû‚Ñé is a 5

percentage point increase in the likelihood of purchasing one‚Äôs own health insurance (sample

rate 32%), versus a 4 point rise in the probability of having insurance from all sources (sample

rate 73%). Conversely, neither health insurance outcome is correlated with ùõΩùëû‚Ñé , suggesting that

such coverage is unrelated to present bias.

Health Behaviors
                                                         21


         Table 5 examines the health behaviors exercise, smoking, drinking, and sunscreen and

seatbelt use, as well as obesity, which is related to health behaviors. The relationships between

exercise and the time-consistent discount factors are positive, though not quite significant at the

10% level. The average marginal effect of an increase in standardized ùõø is about half a day of

exercise per month (the standard deviation for exercise is 9.96). Patient individuals consume

significantly fewer snacks, with an average marginal effect of ùõø of about 0.2 less per day

(standard deviation 2.37). These findings suggest that high discount rates reduce exercise and

contribute to unhealthy eating. The point estimates further indicate that self-control problems

may be relevant for these decisions, as present-biased individuals snack more and exercise less

than their counterparts. However, neither relationship is statistically significant and the

estimated effect on snacking is only around half as large for ùõΩùëû‚Ñé as for ùõøùëû‚Ñé .

         Models (3a) through (4b) examine smoking and drinking, measured by cigarettes per day

and binge drinking occasions per month.23 The three discount factors are negatively and

significantly associated with both: a one-standard-deviation increase in any of the discount

factors predicts about a one cigarette reduction in daily smoking and a 0.2 to 0.3 occasion per

month decrease in binge drinking (sample standard deviations of both outcomes are 2.2).

Particularly striking are the results in columns (3b) and (4b) which show that time-consistent

discounting and present bias both play a role in explaining substance use. Our finding that

impatient and present-biased individuals are more likely than others to smoke and drink

excessively is consistent with prior literature finding that ùõø is related to smoking and drinking

(Sutter et al. 2013) and ùõΩ to smoking (Chabris et al. 2008).


23
  The results are robust to many other measures of smoking, including an indicator for being a regular smoker or for
having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in one's life. Results are similar but less significant for some other drinking
measures, including number of drinks per week. We prefer to use binge drinking rather than a measure of average
drinking because moderate alcohol consumption is not necessarily unhealthy.
                                                         22


         Mixed results are obtained for the two risk-reducing behaviors ‚Äì sunscreen and seat belt

use ‚Äì that are examined in models (5a) through (6b). Specifically, patient individuals are more

likely to use seatbelts, as expected, but less often use sunscreen.24 The negative correlation

between ùõø and sunscreen use might occur because more patient people are less likely to be out in

the sun at all (e.g. tanning), and therefore less likely to use sunscreen, although the question does

explicitly ask about use while out in the sun. The positive coefficient for the seat belt regressions

(the average marginal effect of ùõø is about three percentage points, compared to a sample rate of

79%) is consistent with our expectations and it is mirrored by a similarly sized but less precisely

estimated coefficient on ùõΩ.

         Lastly, Table 5 examines unhealthy body weight. The results for time preference

coefficients on obesity (models 7a and 7b) are surprising, as both ùõøùëéùë£ùëî and ùõøùëû‚Ñé are associated

with higher rates of obesity, though neither is statistically significant.25 In other words, the point

estimates suggest that patient individuals are more likely to have unhealthy weights, contrary to

other studies finding a negative correlation between discount factor and BMI (e.g.

Courtemanche, Heutel and McAlvanah forthcoming). The final outcome in Table 5 ‚Äì a dummy

for whether respondents‚Äô BMIs are missing ‚Äì sheds some light on this puzzle. Both ùõøùëéùë£ùëî and

ùõøùëû‚Ñé are negatively and significantly associated with the failure to report at least one of the

components of BMI: height or weight. This pattern would be explained if impatient individuals

are more likely to be overweight or obese and consequently more likely to be embarrassed about

their weight (or simply not know it). Consistent with this possibility, 119 out of 121 respondents




24
   The sign of the coefficients on CRRA are similar: more risk-averse individuals are more likely to use seat belts
but less likely to wear sunscreen, though the coefficients are not quite significant at the 10% level.
25
   Results are similar for regressions where the dependent variable is BMI or severe obesity.
                                                           23


for whom the information required to calculate BMI is unavailable do not report their weight in

the survey.26

Energy Use

           Table 6 presents regression results for the outcomes reflecting investments in energy-

efficient technologies. Among vehicle owners, present-biased individuals are much less likely to

have a car with high fuel economy (at least 25 miles per gallon): the average marginal effect of

standardized ùõΩùëû‚Ñé is 7 percentage points, relative to a sample rate of 61%. Coefficients on the ùõøs

are positive but smaller and insignificant. Individuals with low discount factors are also more

likely to have installed energy-efficient lighting but in this case it is the time-consistent discount

factor (ùõø) rather than present bias (ùõΩ) that matters.27 In combination, these results suggest that

car purchases often contain a substantial ‚Äúimpulse‚Äù component whereas those for light bulbs do

not. They provide conflicting evidence on whether the energy efficiency gap (Allcott and

Greenstone 2012) can be explained by present bias; taken at face value the findings suggest that

it may for some energy-efficiency decisions (car fuel economy) but not for others (light bulbs).

           The remainder of Table 6 examines residential energy use. Present-biased individuals are

much less likely to live in a well-insulated residence ‚Äì the average marginal effect of

standardized ùõΩùëû‚Ñé is 7 percentage points, relative to a sample rate of 86% ‚Äì but this outcome is

uncorrelated with ùõø (models 3a and 3b). The next two pairs of models (4a-5b) demonstrate that

the discount factor ùõø is positively correlated with having a programmable thermostat and with

consuming less energy than average: the average marginal effects of the ùõøs for these two

outcomes are between 2 and 4 percentage points (sample rates are 45% for both), although the




26
     54 of 121 also fail to report their height.
27
     These findings are consistent with Allcott and Taubinsky (2013) ‚Äì see their Table A2-1.
                                                 24


effects are not quite significant at the 10% level. Conversely, the correlations of these outcomes

with ùõΩùëû‚Ñé are less significant and even negative for less energy than average. None of the

discount factors are correlated with the likelihood of having had an energy audit. However,

more patient and less present-biased individuals keep their homes warmer (i.e. use less air

conditioning) in the summer: a one standard deviation increase in ùõø predicts an increase of

around 0.3 degrees and the estimated effect for a corresponding rise in ùõΩùëû‚Ñé is around 0.5 degrees.

       The importance of ùõøùëû‚Ñé and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé for this last outcome supports an interpretation that

individuals choose their home temperature partially through a longer-term decision-making

process, where they presumably weigh the benefits of lower temperatures against the costs of

more air conditioning expenses (and perhaps any environmental concerns that they have), but

that some also suffer from self-control problems that cause them to use a more comfortable

(lower) temperature setting that they would view as optimal from a time-consistent discounting

framework.

Financial Outcomes

       Results for financial outcomes are reported in Table 7. Patient individuals are more

likely to have a credit card ‚Äì the average marginal effect of ùõøùëéùë£ùëî is 1.7 percentage points ‚Äì and

they also relatively often have non-retirement savings or retirement savings, although none of

these coefficients are statistically significant. The strongest relationship here is between unpaid

credit card balances and the time-consistent discount factor (either ùõøùëéùë£ùëî or ùõøùëû‚Ñé ), where patient

individuals have significantly lower balances, as expected. Present bias (ùõΩùëû‚Ñé ) is also positively

and significantly correlated with the probability of having non-retirement savings ‚Äì the average

marginal effect is 4.5 percentage points ‚Äì and somewhat less strongly and less significantly so

with the likelihood of having retirement savings. This makes sense since the pre-commitment
                                                25


implied with many types of retirement savings (e.g. automatic deposits of funds from the

paycheck and penalties for early withdrawal) would be expected to reduce the role of present

bias. Conversely, unlike Meier and Sprenger (2010), we do not observe a significant correlation

between present bias ùõΩùëû‚Ñé and credit card balance.


V. Other Time Preference Measures

       We next turn to a consideration of the alternative time preference variables. This section

has two objectives: to evaluate how closely our main elicited time preference measures for

money are related to these alternative measures, and to analyze the extent of attenuation bias

from measurement error in regressions using only the elicited monetary discount factor.

Associations Between Elicited Time Preferences and Alternative Measures

       In Table 8, we examine the relationship between our elicited monetary time preference

measures and the other variables potentially related to time preference. The first three outcomes

are the self-reported indicators of patience, general willpower, and willpower over junk food,

each ranked on a ten-point scale and modeled with negative binomial regressions. These

variables can be thought of as measures of time preferences in their own right or, particularly for

the willpower variables, as measures of hyperbolic discounting.

       Neither self-reported patience nor willpower over junk food is significantly related to the

elicited monetary discount factors. General willpower, however, is positively correlated with

both ùõøùëéùë£ùëî from a specification that assumes time-consistent preferences, and with ùõøùëû‚Ñé and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé

from a quasi-hyperbolic discounting specification. The average marginal effects of standardized

ùõøùëéùë£ùëî , ùõøùëû‚Ñé , and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé on a 10-point willpower score are all between 0.2 and 0.3, or about one-tenth

of a standard deviation. Willpower, or lack thereof, has been hypothesized to be a determinant

of present bias (e.g. see Ruhm, 2012), so that the significant effect on ùõΩùëû‚Ñé makes sense.
                                                 26


However, it is also reasonable to think of willpower as a more fundamental component of time

discounting, potentially explaining the relationship with ùõøùëû‚Ñé .

       The next outcome is the monthly discount factor based on responses to the hypothetical

migraine questions, denoted ùõøùëöùëñùëîùëüùëéùëñùëõùëí . We run a linear regression with all discount factors

standardized. One standard deviation increases in ùõøùëéùë£ùëî , ùõøùëû‚Ñé , and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé are associated with

increases in ùõøùëöùëñùëîùëüùëéùëñùëõùëí of around 0.06, 0.07, and 0.04 standard deviations, respectively, with the

first two of these being significant at the 10% level. These results can be interpreted in two

ways. First, they provide evidence that the elicited discount factors represent actual time

preferences, rather than just noise. Second, the relatively weak relationship raises the possibility

that individuals discount in different ways across different domains (Chapman and Elstein 1995),

or that respondents do not perfectly understand the (fairly complicated) migraine medication

questions, so that these questions measure discount factors with error.

       The results for the last dependent variable in Table 8 show that the monetary discount

factors are significantly correlated with the CRT score, which likely reflects a combination of

patience and cognitive ability. In these negative binomial regressions, the CRT score, which

ranges from 0 to 3, is positively and significantly correlated with both measures of ùõø, with the

average marginal effects being around 0.1. The present bias parameter ùõΩùëû‚Ñé is positive but not

significant. This last result is somewhat surprising, given that this the CRT score has been

viewed as a measure of the ability to resist intuitive but incorrect answers. However, an

alternative possibility is this score is associated with broader measures of cognitive skill which

are either correlated with or a component of time-consistent discounting.

       In sum, our elicited monetary time preference measures are only somewhat predictive of

the other time preference proxies. This could indicate that the alternative indicators are not as
                                                          27


informative about actual discounting behavior as the elicited time preferences. Alternatively,

these other proxies may capture information about one‚Äôs ‚Äútrue‚Äù discount factor beyond that

contained in the elicited small-stakes monetary measures. To the extent that the latter occurs,

our estimated effects on consumer behaviors from Tables 4-7 may suffer from attenuation bias,

and incorporating the other time preference variables may help to mitigate this bias. We

consider this possibility next.

Multiple Time Preference Proxies and Consumer Behaviors

         We assess the extent of attenuation bias in our earlier estimates by implementing the

approach of Lubotsky and Wittenberg (2006) (hereafter LW). They consider the case where

several proxies are available for an unobserved variable, and show that attenuation bias can be

minimized by running a regression including all of the proxies together and computing a

weighted average of their coefficient estimates. This approach has some similarities to factor

analysis, but is superior in our case because the weights are allowed to differ across outcomes,

consistent with the notion of time preferences varying across domains.
                                                              ‚àó
         We apply LW‚Äôs method to our context as follows. Let ùõøùë¶ùëñ be the discount factor applied

by individual i in the domain of outcome y. We do not observe the latent variable ùõøùë¶‚àó . Instead,

we observe ùõøùëéùë£ùëî ‚Äì the elicited discount factor based on small-stakes financial questions and not

allowed to vary for different outcomes ‚Äì and the other proxies discussed above. As mentioned,

we exclude CRT score from the set of proxies since it likely reflects cognitive ability as well as

time preference, which violates the assumptions of the subsequent analysis.28 For the health

outcomes, the included proxies are ùõøùëéùë£ùëî , the migraine discount factor ùõøùëöùëñùëîùëüùëéùëñùëõùëí , and self-




28
  This ambiguity is also why we do not use CRT score as a control variable. Unreported regressions (available
upon request) show that adding it to either the set of controls or proxies does not meaningfully affect the results.
                                                           28


reported patience, willpower, and willpower over junk food. For the energy use and financial

outcomes, there is little rationale for including the health-specific discounting measures so we

only utilize ùõøùëéùë£ùëî , patience, and willpower.29

         Our approach is modeled as
                                                       ‚àó

Where ùë•ùëóùëñ in equation (7) represents the proxy variables. Equations (6) and (7) cannot be

estimated due to the unobservable covariate ùõøùë¶‚àó , but the parameter of interest ùõæ1 can be recovered

from a linear combination of the coefficients from a regression of ùë¶ on all the proxy variables

together:

                                                       ùëò

where ùëò = 5 for the health outcomes and 3 for the energy and financial outcomes. Assuming

that ùõøùë¶‚àó is uncorrelated with ùúÄ and that ‚àÄ ùëó ùë¢ùëó is uncorrelated with ùõøùë¶‚àó and ùúÄ, LW show that ùõæ1 is

estimated with the least amount of bias by

of ùëêùëúùë£(ùë¶, ùë•ùëó ), meaning that ùë•1 ‚Äôs coefficient will have a weight of 1 and the weights for the other

proxies‚Äô coefficients will be less than 1. LW show that when ùë•1 is chosen in this manner, ùõøùë¶‚àó will




29
  In unreported regressions (available upon request), we verify that the health-related discounting proxies offer little
predictive power for the energy use and financial outcomes beyond that of the more general time preference
measures.

have the same scale as ùë•1 . We standardize all our proxy variables before estimating (8), so

regardless of which proxy emerges as ùë•1 ‚Äì which could vary for different outcomes ‚Äì the scale of

ùõøùë¶‚àó will be (approximately) that of a standardized variable, i.e. mean of 0 and standard deviation

of 1. ùõæÃÇ1 from equation (9) can therefore be compared directly to ùõæÃÇ1 from equation (4).30

         Before presenting our results, a few caveats should be discussed. First, it is unclear how

LW‚Äôs procedure should be applied to non-linear models, so we estimate linear models even for

the binary and count outcomes.31 Second, since it is also unclear how LW's method could be

used in the case of two unobserved variables that are potentially both affected by the same

proxies, we did not attempt to implement a multiple proxies procedure featuring a quasi-

hyperbolic specification of ùõΩ and ùõø. Finally, our multiple proxies procedure requires the strong

assumption that all proxies are uncorrelated with the error term in (8). For these reasons, we

consider the results from this section to be robustness checks of our main results as opposed to

our preferred estimates.32

         Table 9 reports the estimated effects of ùõøùë¶‚àó on the health, energy, and financial outcomes.

For comparison purposes, we also present estimates using ùõøùëéùë£ùëî as the only proxy for purposes of

comparison; these estimates are nearly identical to those from Tables 4-7, differing only because



30
   Intuitively, this procedure can be illustrated as follows. Suppose ùõøùëéùë£ùëî = ùõøùë¶‚àó ; i.e. the regression without the
additional proxies ‚Äì equation (4) ‚Äì does not suffer from attenuation bias. The coefficient for ùõøùëéùë£ùëî in (8) is the same
as that from (4), the coefficients for the other proxies in (8) are 0, and ùõæ1 from (9) is the same as ùõæ1 from (4).
Alternatively, suppose ùõøùëéùë£ùëî is a fairly poor proxy for ùõøùë¶‚àó and equation (4) therefore suffers from considerable
attenuation bias. To the extent that the additional proxies add explanatory power to regression (8), ùõæ1 from (9) will
be larger than ùõæ1 from (4), meaning that (9) corrects for at least some of the attenuation bias.
31
   The average marginal effects from our previous probit and negative binomial regressions are very similar to those
from linear regressions, so we do not expect that this limitation is consequential.
32
   Another possible issue is that LW‚Äôs procedure allows for negative weights, and it is not clear how these should be
interpreted. For instance, suppose one proxy is strongly related to the outcome in the expected direction, whereas
another proxy is strongly related in the opposite direction. The ‚Äúwrong-signed‚Äù coefficient could receive a negative
weight, in which case it would count the same toward as ùõæÃÇ1 as if it were ‚Äúright-signed.‚Äù In practice, such strong
wrong-signed correlations are rare in our data, and our conclusions are not meaningfully affected by replacing the
negative weights with zeroes or positive weights of the same magnitudes (results available upon request).
                                                          30


we use linear models here to be consistent with the linear models used for the multiple proxies

approach. Full regression results are in Appendix Tables A5-A8, including the coefficient

estimates, standard errors, and covariance ratios (weights) for each proxy in regression (8), along

with sample sizes.

         The appendix tables show that the alternative proxies are occasionally statistically

significant, but none of them are significant more frequently than the standard measure ùõøùëéùë£ùëî .

ùõøùëéùë£ùëî and self-reported willpower are tied for the most significant associations in the expected

direction (8 of the 26 outcomes for each), with the other three proxies performing worse.33 A

particularly interesting result is that the two health-specific time preference proxies ‚Äì ùõøùëöùëñùëîùëüùëéùëñùëõùëí

and willpower with junk food ‚Äì are worse predictors of health-related outcomes than the

analogous general proxies ùõøùëéùë£ùëî and willpower. ùõøùëöùëñùëîùëüùëéùëñùëõùëí and willpower with junk food are only

significantly associated in the expected direction for 2 and 3 of the 15 health outcomes,

respectively, compared to 6 and 7 for ùõøùëéùë£ùëî and general willpower. Willpower with junk food

does seem to influence the weight-related outcomes exercise, snacking, and obesity, but general

willpower predicts them just as well.

         Turning to the estimated effects of ùõøùë¶‚àó in Table 9, we see that implementing the multiple

proxies approach generally suggests that results using ùõøùëéùë£ùëî may be conservative. In seven cases,

ùõøùëéùë£ùëî was insignificant or had a ‚Äúwrong-signed‚Äù association in Tables 4-7 but becomes

significant in the expected direction using the multiple proxies method. This occurs for the

outcomes very good or better health, exercise, sunscreen use, obesity, well-insulated home, less



33
   While 8 of 26 may not seem like a substantial number of statistically significant associations, note that including
all the time preference proxies together in the same regressions results in considerable multicollinearity. For this
reason, there are many more significant results for the linear combination of these coefficients than there are for any
one coefficient individually.
                                                  31


energy than average, and any credit card. For ten other outcomes ‚Äì good or better health, mental

health, activity limitations, any health insurance, bought own health insurance, snacking, seat

belt use, missing BMI, installed CFL, and summer temperature in the home ‚Äì ùõøùëéùë£ùëî was

significant in the expected direction in Tables 4-7 but the magnitude of its effect increases in

Table 9. In six of these ten cases (good or better health, mental health, activity limitations, seat

belts, installed CFL, and summer temperature), the increase in magnitude is greater than two of

the original estimate‚Äôs standard errors. For fuel-efficient car and programmable thermostat,

neither ùõøùëéùë£ùëî or ùõøùë¶‚àó are significant but the estimate for ùõøùë¶‚àó is notably larger and approaches

significance at the 10% level. In the cases of smoking, binge drinking, and credit card balance,

ùõøùëéùë£ùëî was already significant and the magnitude for ùõøùë¶‚àó is nearly identical. For the final four

outcomes ‚Äì physical health, energy audit, and non-retirement and retirement savings ‚Äì ùõøùëéùë£ùëî and

ùõøùë¶‚àó are both insignificant and their estimated effects are small.

       In sum, for 19 of the 26 outcomes the multiple proxies approach strengthens the results.

We therefore view the findings from Tables 4-7 as conservative. This appears to be especially

true for energy use. Recall that Table 6 provided only weak evidence of an association between

time-consistent discount factor and the seven energy outcomes, with ùõøùëéùë£ùëî only being statistically

significant twice. This number rises to four using the multiple proxies method, with significance

almost being obtained in two other cases.


VI. Conclusion

       This paper provides evidence that many outcomes and behaviors related to health,

energy, and finances are correlated with time preference parameters elicited from MPLs. The

time-consistent discount factor ùõøùëéùë£ùëî is statistically significantly associated, in the expected
                                                 32


direction, with 14 of our 26 outcomes. Using the quasi-hyperbolic specification, ùõøùëû‚Ñé and present

bias ùõΩùëû‚Ñé are significantly related to 13 and 9 outcomes, respectively, in the hypothesized

direction. These are impressive results, given the relatively small sample and the modest

financial payments provided to randomly chosen participants. We also explore alternate time

preference measures, and show that in general they are no better at predicting outcomes than the

standard, MPL-elicited measure. However, a multiple proxies approach to address measurement

error in elicited monetary time preferences suggests that our estimated effects of ùõøùëéùë£ùëî on these

outcomes are likely conservative. Unfortunately, this method is not well suited to simultaneously

examining the present-biased and time-consistent components of discounting, so we cannot say

if our estimates of the coefficients on ùõΩùëû‚Ñé are similarly understated.

       We believe that the findings are actually even more meaningful than they appear at first

glance. Not all of the dependent variables are equally important, and some of the strongest and

most interesting results are obtained for outcomes that we judge to be the most central. For

example, we obtain the striking finding that patient individuals are in better health for all of our

overall measures except days in poor physical health (i.e. for good or better health, very good or

better health (in the multiple proxies regression only), days in bad mental health, and days where

poor health significantly limited activities). Moreover, while both the time-consistent and

present-biased components of discounting have a significant effect, the latter are larger.

       The results are somewhat less consistent for health risks and behaviors, but our

interpretation again is that the findings for some of the riskiest behaviors ‚Äì e.g. binge drinking

and smoking ‚Äì tell a similar story: both ùõøùëû‚Ñé and ùõΩùëû‚Ñé matter but the latter is often more important.

Most other results for health behaviors are in the hypothesized direction, and some that are
                                                         33


anomalous (e.g. the use of sunscreen in the main specifications but not the multiple proxy

regressions) we consider to be smaller health risks.

           Though the estimates for energy use are somewhat mixed, once again some of the

strongest and most interesting results are obtained for outcomes that we think are the most

important. For instance, present-biased individuals are less likely to purchase high-fuel-

economy vehicles, and passenger cars are the largest source of transportation-related carbon

emissions.34 Air-conditioning represents about one-fourth of total home electricity use (the

largest single component),35 and present-biased individuals (as well as persons with low discount

factors more generally) report keeping their houses at higher temperatures during the summer,

probably resulting in significant electricity savings. The results for many of the other energy

outcomes (e.g. whether an energy audit has been conducted or there is a programmable

thermostat in the home) seem likely to generate less energy savings than the factors just

mentioned, although results for these variables are consistent with theoretical expectations more

often than not.

           Present-biased individuals are also less likely to have retirement or non-retirement

savings, a first-order financial consideration, and persons who discount the future less heavily

hold less credit card debt, as anticipated. Our limited data on financial outcomes prevents us

from saying more in this regard, but these results seem informative and potentially important.

            Finally, we examine how well alternative time preference measures perform at

predicting behavior. Self-reported willpower is correlated with all MPL-elicited discount factors

and also with about as many consumer behavior variables as the elicited monetary discount

factor. There is no evidence that time preference parameters obtained from questions

specifically about a health decision are better predictors of health outcomes than the standard

time preference parameters pertaining to monetary outcomes.

       This study suggests many areas for future research. First, would our results persist with

larger samples or with preference elicitation strategies that provided respondents with larger risks

or rewards? Second, do the observed responses of future bias represent true preferences or

measurement error? If future bias exists, how do we explain it and what are the implications for

these types of modeling efforts? Third, which of the outcomes examined in this investigation are

most important and what other outcomes would be critical to analyze? More generally, are there

strategies for deciding which dependent variables, among an almost infinite set of possibilities

and domains, research should study? Fourth, do the phenomena observed in this analysis show

systematic patterns among subgroups stratified by characteristics such as age, gender and

socioeconomic status? Fifth, if present bias matters, what is the role of sophistication versus
