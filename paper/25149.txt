                                          ABSTRACT

Bank balance sheet lending is commonly viewed as the predominant form of lending. We
document and study two margins of adjustment that are usually absent from this view using
microdata in the$10 trillion U.S. residential mortgage market. We first document the limits of the
shadow bank substitution margin: shadow banks substitute for traditional—deposit-taking—
banks in loans which are easily sold, but are limited from activities requiring on-balance-sheet
financing. We then document the balance sheet retention margin: banks switch between
traditional balance sheet lending and selling loans based on their balance sheet strength, behaving
more like shadow banks following negative shocks. Motivated by this evidence, we build and
estimate a workhorse structural model of the financial intermediation sector. Banks and shadow
banks compete for borrowers. Banks face regulatory constraints but benefit from the ability to
engage in balance sheet lending. Critically, departing from prior literature, banks can also choose
to access the securitization market like shadow banks. To evaluate distributional consequences,
we model a rich demand system with income and house price differences across borrowers. The
model is identified using spatial pricing policies of government-sponsored entities and bunching
at the regulatory threshold. We study the quantitative consequences of several policies on lending
volume and pricing, bank stability, and the distribution of consumer surplus across rich and poor
households. Both margins we identify significantly shape policy responses, accounting for more
than $500 billion in lending volume across counterfactuals. Secondary market disruptions such as
quantitative easing have significantly larger impacts on lending and redistribution than capital
requirement changes once we account for these margins. We conclude that a regulatory policy
analysis of the intermediation sector must incorporate the intricate industrial organization of the
credit market and the equilibrium interaction of banks and shadow banks.

Section I: Introduction
Policymakers and researchers have long viewed balance sheet lending by deposit-taking
institutions—traditional banks—as the predominant way loans are supplied to households and firms
(Sunderam 2015). Under this view, banks use deposits to extend loans, which they hold on their
balance sheet until repayment or default. Therefore, traditional banks have been the main focus of
regulation and supervision in financial intermediation. The bank balance sheet view omits two
important aspects of modern financial intermediation.
First, a substantial share of financial activity has migrated to the less regulated shadow banking
sector. 1 For instance, following the increase in bank regulation after the 2008 financial crisis, the
share of shadow bank loan origination more than doubled in the $10 trillion U.S. residential mortgage
market. Shadow banks now account for the majority of new mortgage originations (Buchak et al.
2018). Financial intermediation regulation therefore needs to account for this “shadow bank
migration margin” of adjustment in the supply of financial intermediation. 2 In this paper, we
document the shadow bank migration margin primarily for activities which do not require on-balance-
sheet financing. Banks, by virtue of deposit financing, retain an advantage in balance-sheet intensive
activities. In other words, differences in financing result in market segmentation.
Second, banks themselves sell over 50% of the originated loans instead of holding them on their
balance sheet (see Buchak et al. 2018, Irani et al. 2018, Seru 2019). We document a new margin of
adjustment by traditional banks, which we call the “balance sheet retention margin.” When faced
with shocks, traditional banks adjust their business models, switching from on-balance-sheet lending
to off-balance-sheet lending. The two sets of facts we document suggest that the allocation of
intermediation activity and risks between banks and shadow banks is determined by the industrial
organization of financial intermediation as well as the changing business models of banks. We then
build a workhorse structural model of the financial intermediation sector and demonstrate that these
margins of adjustment are central to understanding consequences of policies such as capital
requirements and monetary policy.
We explore the interaction of banks and shadow banks in two main residential mortgage market
segments in the U.S.—the conforming market and the jumbo market—for two broad reasons. First,
these two segments account for the vast majority of the $17.8 trillion 3 residential mortgages originated
during our sample period (Beraja et al. 2019; Wong 2018; Palmer 2015). Second, the institutional
difference between these segments allows us to study the role of balance sheet capacity. Originating
conforming mortgages does not require as much balance sheet capacity since these loans are eligible

for purchase by Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). Jumbo mortgages, on the other hand,
are not eligible for GSE support and—especially since the disappearance of the private securitization
market after the financial crisis—are more difficult to securitize; the vast majority of jumbo loans are
retained on the lenders’ balance sheets. We exploit this difference to understand the role of banks’
balance sheet capacity in shaping the migration of activity between banks and shadow banks.
We begin by documenting large swings in the share of balance-sheet intensive (jumbo) mortgage
originations during this period. From 2007 to 2009 the share of jumbo originations declined
precipitously relative to easy-to-sell (conforming) mortgages, from 29% to 10%, only to reverse back
to 30% by 2016. These market swings coincided with a dramatic migration of mortgage origination
activity to shadow banks (Buchak et al. 2018). We document that the migration was limited to the
conforming sector, where shadow banks gained 25% of market share from 2008 to 2015. In balance-
sheet intensive jumbo mortgages, shadow banks did not gain market share; traditional banks’ share
persisted well above 80% despite large declines in the quantity they lent.
We argue that this market segmentation arises because traditional banks and shadow banks differ in
their ability to extend balance-sheet intensive (jumbo) and easy-to-sell (conforming) mortgages.
Traditional banks’ comparative advantage in the jumbo market arises from their ability to retain these
loans on their balance sheets. To separate this explanation from alternatives, we exploit the sharp size
discontinuity in the ability to securitize a mortgage. Any mortgage that exceeds the conforming loan
limit becomes a jumbo mortgage and is much more difficult to securitize. This institutional feature is
also a source of variation in our structural estimation.
Most alternative explanations for banks’ comparative advantage in jumbo lending suggest that this
advantage would increase continuously with mortgage size. For example, if richer borrowers prefer
borrowing from banks, one would imagine that borrowers’ demand for banking services would
increase continuously with mortgage size, as one transitions from conforming to jumbo mortgages.
Instead, we find a sharp 25 percentage point (pp) increase in banks’ market share at the conforming
limit. Moreover, balance sheet capacity is the likely cause of market segmentation, as opposed to
other regulatory differences between banks and shadow banks. We compare better-capitalized banks
with larger balance sheet capacity to less well-capitalized banks, which face the same regulation. The
market share of well-capitalized banks jumps by about 10% at the conforming limit. These results
are consistent with the view that the limited balance sheet capacity of shadow banks prevents
migration of balance-sheet intensive activities to the shadow banking sector.
The behavior of mortgage prices is also consistent with our hypothesis. The relative price differential
between jumbo mortgages and conforming mortgages (jumbo spread) experienced significant
variation during our sample period. Periods during which jumbo origination quantity was low were
periods of high jumbo spreads, and vice versa. Moreover, the jumbo spread decreased with the
aggregate relative capitalization of jumbo versus confirming lenders. The contemporaneous decrease
in quantity and increase in price suggests supply shocks (balance sheet capacity of jumbo lenders)
contributed to these aggregate changes.




                                                   2
Last, we show that banks themselves face an important margin of adjustment to balance sheet capacity
shocks, the aforementioned balance sheet retention margin. Banks adjust to a decline in balance sheet
capacity by decreasing lending on balance sheet and increasing originations of loans that are easier
to securitize. In other words, banks’ business models are adaptable. Banks, which are flush with
capital, behave as standard balance sheet models of banking would suggest: they use their capital to
extend loans, which they retain on their balance sheets. However, as banks’ balance sheet capacity
declines, they switch to originating mortgages, which they can sell, behaving more like shadow banks.
Motivated by this evidence, we build and estimate a workhorse structural model of the financial
intermediation sector. It incorporates competition from shadow banks and banks’ abilities to choose
to lend on balance sheet and to sell loans. The model has several goals. First, we want to understand
how the industrial organization of intermediation and the choice of bank business model determine
who originates which types of mortgages, and at which interest rates. Second, we want to use the
model to quantitatively analyze the consequences of capital requirements, access to secondary loan
markets, and unconventional monetary policy on lending volume and pricing, bank stability, and the
distribution of consumer surplus across rich and poor households. In the process, we quantify the
importance of the shadow bank migration and balance sheet retention margins for policy analysis.
The supply side of the model is determined by competing banks and shadow banks, which offer
differentiated mortgages in the jumbo and conforming markets. The central innovation is in modeling
banks. As is common in banking models, banks can originate loans, which they keep on their balance
sheet, and their balance sheet capacity is limited by their capitalization. We differ from standard
models by allowing banks to adjust their business models on the balance sheet retention margin: banks
can choose how many loans to retain versus sell. Shadow banks benefit from a lower regulatory
burden and compete with banks in originating loans, but can only finance loans by selling them.
We model demand using a modified discrete-choice framework featuring rich heterogeneity (Berry
et al. 1995; Nevo 2000). Consumers with heterogeneous preferences over price, quality, and mortgage
size choose among a menu of mortgages offered by various types of originators. This heterogeneity
is important to accommodate realistic consumer substitution patterns and, especially, to capture the
redistributive consequences of policies (see Stroebel and Vavra (2019) and Wong (2018)). Because
markets are segmented, policy interventions have redistributive consequences. For example, if capital
requirements decrease the supply of on-balance-sheet lending, then this policy will likely be costlier
for wealthier borrowers, who are more likely to take jumbo mortgages. We depart from discrete-
choice models by also allowing consumers to choose their mortgage size and, consequently, decide
whether they want a conforming or jumbo mortgage (see Benetton (2019) for an alternative way to
model discrete-continuous choices in the mortgage market).
We estimate demand and supply separately. To identify standard demand parameters, we need to
instrument for price endogeneity. We exploit geographic differences in financing cost of GSE-
conforming mortgages, which arise through political economy considerations and are unrelated to
mortgage demand (see Hurst et al. (2016) for extensive documentation of that fact). Second, we
exploit bunching at the confirming-jumbo cutoff to help estimate consumer preferences for mortgage
size. Intuitively, consumers who bunch at the conforming loan limit choose a smaller than ideal

                                                  3
mortgage. The higher the disutility from taking on a smaller than ideal mortgage, the less bunching
we observe. Having estimated demand, we estimate supply-side parameters using intermediary price
setting and financing decisions.
Our model captures the salient features of the data, such as the market shares of banks and shadow
banks, as well as pricing of mortgages. The model estimates match the extent of bunching at the
conforming discontinuity across markets and price elasticity estimates from the literature (see
DeFusco and Paciorek (2017)). As out-of-sample validation of our model, we study model
performance following policy changes in conforming loan limits. Our model predicts changes that
are quantitatively very close to the realized changes. Moreover, we find that consumers are very price
elastic, with lower price elasticity in the jumbo market. Since this market faces less competition from
shadow banks, it is a source of rents for banks.
On the supply side, our estimates suggest that financing jumbo mortgages is more expensive than
financing conforming mortgages, even when the latter are retained on the balance sheet. The
difference declines with bank capitalization and declines to less than 5 basis points (bps) for very
well-capitalized banks. Moreover, post-2012 increases in the regulatory burden of traditional banks
substantially constrained their mortgage origination. Noncapital requirement-related regulatory
constraints, such as risk of enforcement actions and lawsuits, provided a large advantage to shadow
banks and contributed more to shadow bank migration than the increased capital requirements.
Next, we use our estimated model to consider three policy relevant counterfactuals: changing capital
requirements (Acharya et al. 2011; Benetton 2019); unconventional monetary policy such as QE or
GSE interventions (see Di Maggio et al. (2019) and Wong (2018)); and changing the access to a
secondary loan market through the GSE-conforming limit. These policies lead to changes in the
quantity, pricing, and distribution of mortgage credit, as well as where the credit is held in the
intermediation sector.
One overarching insight from the counterfactuals is that adjustments on the shadow bank migration
margin and the balance sheet retention margin are both critical to understanding quantitative
consequences of policies. For example, the tradeoff between bank stability and lending is much less
severe than anticipated by models that feature only on-balance-sheet lending. Our model predicts that
increasing bank capital requirements from current levels to 9% reduces bank balance sheet lending
by two thirds, but overall mortgage lending declines by only 2.5%. The critical margin of adjustment
in this case is the balance sheet retention margin: while balance sheet lending declines by two thirds,
total bank lending declines by only 9.5% as banks move their lending from retention to selling.
Accounting for migration of lending to shadow banks fills 7% of this gap. Both margins are equally
important in quantitatively shaping responses to other policies. A model of financial intermediation
must therefore account for both of these margins when evaluating policies.
The second general insight is that the overall adjustment depends on whether policy interventions
target traditional banks or secondary markets. When tighter regulation only targets traditional banks
(e.g., increased capital requirements), solely focusing on bank balance sheets overstates the adverse
effect of such polices on overall lending volume. The adjustments on the shadow bank migration


                                                  4
margin and the balance sheet retention margin work to offset the adverse impact. For policies which
tighten the secondary loan market, the shadow bank migration margin exacerbates the effect: lending
contracts for shadow banks leading to a large overall decline in lending. For example, if quantitative
easing increases GSE financing costs by 100 basis points, bank lending actually increases by $53
billion while shadow bank lending decreases by $300 billion. Thus policy analysis, which ignores
the role of bank balance sheet adjustment and shadow bank lending, would result in incorrect
qualitative and quantitative predictions.
The third insight is that interventions aimed at bank stability differ in their redistributive
consequences. For example, increasing capital requirements achieves bank stability by decreasing on-
balance-sheet lending, i.e., reducing jumbo mortgages. Therefore, the cost of bank stability is mainly
borne by higher-income borrowers. An expansion of GSE funding increases the appeal of
securitization, also shifting loans from bank balance sheets and increases bank stability. It does so
while expanding lending and benefiting consumers across the income spectrum, but it comes at the
cost of taxpayers subsidizing GSE lending.
These insights generate implications for regulation that go beyond the U.S. market. For instance, the
Basel regulatory framework proposes a uniform treatment of capital requirements across countries.
The U.K., for example, does not have a large and liquid secondary market for mortgages (Benetton
2019). Our analysis suggests that increasing capital requirements in the U.K. would result in a
substantially higher contraction in lending than in the U.S. due to the absence of bank retention
margin. More generally, regulatory policy response in different economies needs to consider the two
margins of adjustment we highlight above.
More broadly, our work speaks to the theories of banking in the presence of shadow banks (see
Sunderam (2015) and Koijen and Yogo (2016)). The traditional view of banks is that they use deposits
to make loans, which they retain on their balance sheet. Our paper suggests that banks’ choice of
business model depends on both their capitalization and their equilibrium interaction with shadow
banks. On one end of the spectrum are well capitalized banks, which dominate the market for loans
that are retained on the balance sheet. At the other end are shadow banks, which originate to distribute
(OTD). In the middle are poorly capitalized banks with limited balance sheet capacity, whose
participation in the market for retained loans is limited. Thus, we argue that a complete policy analysis
must incorporate the industrial organization of the credit market and the equilibrium interaction of
banks and shadow banks.
Section II: Institutional Setting and Data
II.A U.S. Residential Mortgage Market
The residential mortgage market is the largest consumer finance market in the U.S. As of 2018 there
have been more than 50 million residential properties that have a mortgage with a combined
outstanding debt of about $10 trillion (Source: Corelogic Data). In the U.S., the process by which a
mortgage is secured by a borrower is called origination. This involves the borrower submitting a loan
application and documentation related to his or her financial history and/or credit history to the lender.


                                                    5
We discuss below the main segments of the U.S. residential mortgage market and the associated
lenders active in these markets.
II.A.1 Banks, Shadow Banks, and Loan Origination Business Models
The two main groups of mortgage originators in the U.S. are banks and shadow banks (nonbank
lenders). Buchak et al. (2018) document a decline in traditional bank originations and the growth of
shadow banks, with the shadow bank market share growing from less than 30% to more than 50% by
2015. These originators differ on at least three dimensions. First, banks (traditional banks and credit
unions) partially fund their lending through insured deposits. Shadow banks do not take deposits.
Second, they differ in terms of their business models. There are two business models a loan originator
can follow: portfolio lending or originate-to-distribute. Portfolio lending implies the originator retains
the loan on their balance sheet. Conversely, in the originate-to-distribute model, originators can sell
the loan as well as service rights. Banks engage in both models, with portfolio loans comprising about
40% of their originations during our sample period. Shadow banks, on the other hand, almost
exclusively originate to distribute (see Buchak et al. (2018)). The third difference is in regulation.
Banks face a substantially higher regulatory burden than shadow banks, including capital
requirements; enhanced supervision from a wide set of regulators, such as the FDIC, FED, OCC, and
state regulators; as well as extensive compliance and rules.
II.A.2 Mortgage Products
We focus on two main residential mortgage market segments in the U.S.: the conforming loan market
and the jumbo loan market. Together these two segments account for more than 80% of all U.S.
residential mortgages originated during our sample period (based on the Home Mortgage Disclosure
Act). The largest residential market segment in the U.S. consists of conforming loans. These are
usually extended to borrowers with relatively high credit scores, conservative loan-to-value (LTV)
ratios (e.g., up to 80%), and fully documented incomes and assets. Conforming mortgages must be
below the conforming loan limit, which grew from $417,000 in 2006 to $453,100 in 2018 for a one-
unit, single-family dwelling in a low-cost area, and from $625,000 to $679,650 for the same unit type
in a high-cost area. In addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily
increased these limits in certain high-cost areas to up to $729,500. Mortgages that exceed the
conforming limit are termed “jumbo.”
Conforming loans are much easier to sell than jumbo loans, because conforming loans are eligible for
securitization with the participation of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), while jumbo loans
are not. GSEs allow for substantially easier securitization of conforming mortgages. For example,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two most prominent GSEs, purchase conforming mortgages and
package them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS), insuring default risk. These MBS are
particularly attractive to investors interested in relatively safe assets. In 2017, conforming loans in
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac comprised about 50% of the
outstanding residential loans (Source: Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Data).
Because jumbo mortgages are ineligible for GSE financing, they are issued without government



                                                    6
guarantees. Consequently, these mortgages are significantly more difficult to securitize, and the vast
majority are retained by the originators.
II.B Description of Datasets
Our paper brings together a number of datasets which we describe below:
HMDA: Mortgage-level application data is the main source for market shares across lender and
product types. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) collects the vast majority of mortgage
applications in the United States, along with their approval status. In addition to the application
outcome, the dataset includes loan type, purpose, amount, year of origination, and location
information down to the applicant’s census tract. It further contains demographic information on the
applicant, including race and income. Important for this analysis, it includes the originator’s identity,
which we link manually across years. Finally, it documents whether the originator sells the loan to a
third party, and if so, whether the loan purchaser is a GSE. An important caveat with the sales data is
that if the originator retains the loan through the end of the calendar year and sells it in the subsequent
year, it is recorded in HMDA as a non-sale. We use data beginning in 2010 and ending in 2016.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan Origination Data: These datasets, provided
both by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, contain origination data from the GSEs’ thirty-year, fully
amortizing, full-documentation, single-family, conforming fixed-rate mortgage purchases. 4 The loan-
level data contain information on the loan, property, and borrower, including loan size, interest rate,
loan purpose, property location, borrower credit score, loan-to-value ratio, and, importantly, the
identity of the lender that sold the loan to the GSE. We use these data to calculate average interest
rates by lender type and market.
Black Knight McDash Loan-Level Mortgage Performance Dataset: Black Knight is a private
company that provides a comprehensive, dynamic loan-level dataset on mortgages, including loans
serviced by the ten largest U.S. mortgage servicers, accounting for approximately 75% of all
mortgages in the U.S. as of year-end 2010 (data vendor estimate). Importantly for our purpose, Black
Knight includes information on both jumbo and GSE loans and includes loans retained on banks’
balance sheets. Much like the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac data, Black Knight McDash data contain
interest rates and a large number of borrower- and loan-specific characteristics, including FICO score
at origination, loan-to-value ratio, five-digit zip code of origination, loan purpose, and whether the
loan is fixed or adjustable-rate. The Black Knight McDash data also include dynamic data on monthly
payments, mortgage balances, and delinquency status.
BlackBox: BlackBox is a private company that provides a comprehensive, dynamic loan-level dataset
with information about more than twenty million privately securitized subprime, Alt-A, and prime
loans originated after 1999. These loans account for about 90% of all privately securitized mortgages

4
  The dataset does not include adjustable-rate mortgage loans, balloon loans, interest-only mortgages, mortgages with
prepayment penalties, government-insured mortgage loans such as Federal Housing Authority loans, Home Affordable
Refinance Program mortgage loans, Refi Plus™ mortgage loans, or nonstandard mortgage loans. The dataset also
excludes loans that do not reflect current underwriting guidelines, such as loans with originating LTVs over 97% and
mortgage loans subject to long-term standby commitments, those sold with lender recourse or subject to other third-party
risk-sharing arrangements, or those acquired by Fannie Mae on a negotiated bulk basis.

from that period. Much like the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac data, the Blackbox data contain interest
rates and a large number of borrower- and loan-specific characteristics, including FICO score at
origination, loan-to-value ratio, five-digit zip code of origination, loan purpose, and whether the loan
is fixed or adjustable-rate. The BlackBox data also include dynamic data on monthly payments,
mortgage balances, and delinquency status.
U.S. Census Data: We use metropolitan statistical area-level data from the U.S. Census and
American Community Survey between 2010 and 2015. In particular, we use incomes,
homeownership rates, and home values.
Federal Reserve Bank Data: We use banking regulatory call reports to measure bank capital ratios,
assets, deposits, and other data from bank balance sheets.
II.C Lender Classification
We classify lenders as in Buchak et al. (2018). 5 Briefly, a “bank” is a depository institution and a
“shadow bank” is not. This definition parallels that of the Financial Stability Board, which defines
banks as “all deposit-taking corporations” and shadow banking as “credit intermediation involving
entities and activities outside of the regular banking system.”
Section III: Empirical Analysis
We present a set of empirical facts regarding price, quantity, and composition of mortgage credit, and
industrial organization of the market. These facts motivate our analysis and model, shedding light on
the drivers of the comparative advantage of banks and shadow banks. Table 1 shows summary
statistics for the main datasets used in our analysis.
III.A Aggregate Facts
III.A.1 Bank Balance Sheets, Jumbo vs. Conforming Volumes, and Prices
We start by documenting three related trends, which we document in Figure 1. As the capitalization
of the banking sector declined from 2007 to 2009, we observe a decline in the share of on-balance
sheet (jumbo) mortgage originations and an increase in the relative price of these mortgages. From
2009 onwards these trends reversed: as the capitalization of the banking sector increases, balance
sheet (jumbo) mortgage originations increase and the relative price of these mortgages declines. We
next discuss these trends in more detail.
Figure 1A presents the relative share of the jumbo market in the overall origination volume. This
share declined sharply from 28% in 2007 to about 10% in 2009. From 2009 onwards, the jumbo share
experienced a substantial increase, reaching about 30% in the 2015 to 2016 period. Figure 1B, which
shows total origination volumes, illustrates that this trend was driven by changes in the jumbo market:
the jumbo market collapsed before recovering to earlier levels.
Figure 1C shows that these contractions in the jumbo market share were accompanied by increases
in the relative interest rates of jumbo mortgages to conforming mortgages, the “jumbo spread,” and

vice versa. Before the crisis, the aggregate data showed virtually no aggregate jumbo spread. As the
quantity of jumbo mortgages contracted towards 2009, their relative price increased by almost 40
basis points, and as much as 70 basis points in early 2009. As the market share of jumbo mortgages
recovered, the jumbo spread decreased by up to 60 basis points. The positive correlation between
aggregate price and quantity suggests that supply shocks may be partially responsible for driving the
aggregate trends. If the contraction in jumbo quantity was solely driven by demand for jumbos (e.g.,
due to a decline in house prices), we should also observe a decrease in the pricing of jumbo mortgages.
We next show that changes in the capitalization of the banking sector are a candidate source of these
supply shocks. Figure 1D illustrates that the banking sector capitalization originally declined,
bottoming out in 2009, and then began increasing. Figure 2A and 2B show that the series are in fact
related: there is a strong positive association between bank capitalization and quantity of jumbo
originations. Overall, these patterns suggest that as traditional bank capitalization declines, the
amount of on-balance sheet (jumbo) lending declines and their relative pricing increases. In other
words, these aggregate facts are consistent with the idea that a decline in the balance sheet capacity
of the banking sector serves as a supply shock to on-balance-sheet lending, at least relative to lending,
which can be securitized.
III.A.2 Shadow Bank Migration and Banks’ Business Model Adjustment
The jumbo and conforming market segments experienced large changes in their market structure,
which can be captured in two trends. The first trend is related to the migration of residential mortgage
origination activity to shadow banks. Prior work shows that during this period, 25 pp of market share
migrated to shadow banks (Buchak et al. 2018). Central to this paper, we show that the migration of
shadow banks did not take place in balance-sheet intensive jumbo lending. Bank market share in the
jumbo market has remained roughly constant, varying between 85% and 95%. This contrasts with the
conforming market, in which bank market share declined by over one third, from slightly under 80%
in 2007 to about 50% in 2016 (Figure 3A). In other words, the contraction and later expansion in the
amount of jumbo lending is mainly driven by changes in originations by traditional banks. The
changes in the conforming market, on the other hand, are driven by changes in both shadow and
traditional bank originations.
We next document that traditional banks adjusted their business models during this period. One
possible way to interpret the facts above is that traditional banks uniformly contracted their lending
across markets, but shadow banks chose to only expand in the conforming market. This was not the
case. Figure 3B shows that as banks’ capitalization decreased from 2007 to 2009, the share of jumbo
mortgages in their lending declined from 30% to 10%. As bank capitalization increased, they shifted
their originations back to on-balance-sheet lending with jumbo mortgages comprising more than 40%
of their originations by 2016. In other words, banks appear to adjust to capitalization and other
regulatory shocks by switching between the classic banking model (originating and retaining loans)
and the originate-to-distribute model (shadow bank model). We call this margin on which banks can
adjust the “balance sheet retention margin.”

III.A.3 Summary of Aggregate Facts
The aggregate facts we document are consistent with the idea that banks and shadow banks differ in
their ability to extend jumbo and conforming mortgages, resulting in market segmentation. We argue
that this market segmentation arises because jumbo mortgages are mainly kept on the balance sheets
of lenders. Since shadow banks do not have much balance sheet capacity, they mainly originate to
distribute, which is limited to the conforming market.
Such market segmentation implies that a decline in the balance sheet capacity of the banking system
leads to a relatively larger contraction in traditional jumbo mortgage supply through two channels.
First, shadow banks, lacking balance sheet capacity, respond to rising bank constraints by expanding
in the conforming market, but cannot do so in the jumbo market. Second, traditional banks, lacking
balance sheet capacity, tilt their activity towards conforming originations and away from retaining
loans on balance sheet. The larger contraction in the supply of jumbo mortgages leads to an increase
in their relative price, i.e., an increase in the jumbo-conforming spread.
III.B Micro evidence
In this section, we provide micro-level evidence consistent with the aggregate facts, which narrows
down the potential interpretations of the forces driving the aggregate data.
III.B.1 Market Segmentation at the Conforming Loan Limit
We exploit the conforming loan size limit discontinuity to reject alternative explanations of market
segmentation between banks and shadow banks. One alternative explanation of traditional banks’
large market share in the jumbo market is that wealthy borrowers who are more likely to take up
jumbo mortgages also have larger demand for other banking services. In other words, the alternative
explanation is that banks specialize in large loans, which also happen to be jumbo loans. As we
discussed in Section II, there is a sharp loan amount cutoff to qualify as a conforming loan. Borrowers’
demand for banking services should increase somewhat continuously with mortgage size, rather than
jump exactly at the conforming cutoff. The ability to securitize a mortgage, on the other hand,
discontinuously drops at the conforming loan amount. Thus, observing a discontinuous jump in the
bank market share at the conforming limit would reject the demand alternative.
We first confirm that the probability of a loan being retained on balance sheet indeed discretely jumps
at the conforming loan limit. As Figure 4A shows, the fraction of loans retained on lenders’ balance
sheets discontinuously jumps from about 25% just below the conforming loan limit to about 70% just
above the conforming loan limit.
To test whether banks specialize in large loans or in jumbo loans, we confirm that their market share
discretely increases at the conforming loan limit in Figure 4B. Banks’ market share of loans just below
the cutoff is roughly 65%, whereas bank market share above the cutoff is roughly 80%. The results
suggest that banks have a comparative advantage in originating jumbo loans because these loans are
difficult to sell.
We next more formally test whether balance sheet financing share and bank market share discretely
jump at the conforming loan limit discontinuity. We focus on mortgages within 1% of the conforming

                                                  10
cutoff and estimate the extent of the discontinuity at the conforming loan limit using the following
regression discontinuity specification:
                            𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 × 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′ Γ + 𝛾𝛾𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (1)
where 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a {0,1} indicator variable for whether the loan i in census tract l originated in year
t is financed on the balance sheet or originated at a bank, respectively. 𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖 is an indicator for
whether the loan size is above the conforming loan limit in the time-county of origination, and the
corresponding coefficient 𝛽𝛽 is the object of interest. 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′ is a vector of loan-level controls including log
loan size, log applicant income, and dummy variables for race, ethnicity, sex, loan type, loan purpose,
occupancy, and property type. 𝛾𝛾𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 is a census tract-origination year fixed effect, which absorbs any
variation in local conditions over time, as well as regulatory differences. In other words, we examine
the effect by comparing loans from the same census tract and year around the conforming limit,
adjusting for observable borrower differences. For robustness, we also experiment with larger
samples, those within 5%, 10%, and 25% of the conforming loan limit.
Table 2A shows that loans directly above the conforming loan limit experience about 50 pp increase
in the share of loans financed on the balance sheet. Increasing the bandwidth above 1% produces
similar results, as shown in columns 2–4. In 2015, the most recent year in our sample with complete
data coverage, this association is even stronger: the share of loans financed on the balance sheet jumps
by about 47 pp to 62 pp above the conforming loan limit (columns 5–8).
Table 2B shows that loans directly above the conforming loan limit are nearly 25 pp more likely to
have been originated by a traditional bank, as opposed to a shadow bank. As above, when considering
only loans originated in 2015, this difference grows to 38 pp. Increasing the bandwidth above 1%
produces similar results, as shown in columns 2–4. The results around the discontinuity illustrate that
traditional banks specialize in originating mortgages, which have to be retained on the balance sheet,
and not simply mortgages, which are large.
III.B.2 Within-Bank Analysis: Balance Sheet Capacity and the Balance Sheet Retention Margin
In the previous section, we look at market segmentation between banks and shadow banks. In this
section, we look within banks. We do so for two reasons. First, we use within-bank analysis to show
that balance sheet capacity is driving banks’ comparative advantage in the jumbo market, rather than
other regulatory differences with shadow banks. Second, we provide microevidence for the balance
sheet retention margin within banks.
Market Segmentation and Balance Sheet Capacity: Conforming Loan Limit Discontinuity
Our findings above are consistent with the idea that banks’ ability to finance loans with their balance
sheets generates a strong comparative advantage in the segment for difficult-to-sell loans—i.e., jumbo
loans. However, balance sheet capacity is not the only differentiating factor between banks and
shadow banks; for example, shadow banks are subject to a very different regulatory burden than
traditional banks (see Buchak et al. (2018)). If low balance-sheet capacity is the source of market
segmentation between banks and shadow banks, then we should observe similar segmentation
between well-capitalized and poorly capitalized banks.

                                                               11
We again study originations around the conforming loan limit. We define a bank to be well capitalized
if its capital ratio is in the top 25% of bank capital ratios in the given year. Figure 4C plots the well-
capitalized banks’ share of overall bank lending by conforming loan limit percentile. Well-capitalized
banks’ market share jumps discontinuously by about 10 pp at the cutoff, suggesting that these banks
possess a comparative advantage in jumbo mortgage lending. We formally test for the discontinuity
in Table 3. First, within the sample of banks loans, the fraction of loans retained on the balance sheet
significantly jumps above the conforming loan limit (Table 3A). Second, the fraction of loans
originated by the well-capitalized banks substantially increases at the conforming loan limit (Table
3B). These results suggest that the balance sheet capacity of well-capitalized banks gives them a
comparative advantage in the jumbo sector relative to both shadow banks and poorly capitalized
traditional banks, leading to market segmentation.
Balance Sheet Retention Margin
In the aggregate data we document that banks’ business models adjust to shocks in balance sheet
capacity. They shift away from originating balance-sheet intensive loans (jumbo), and towards loans
they can sell (conforming) when their capitalization declines. Here, we provide microevidence of the
balance sheet retention margin.
Figure 5A shows a simple scatter plot of banks’ shares of loans retained on the balance sheet as a
function of their capital ratios. The plot illustrates a strong positive relationship between bank
capitalization and the share of loans they choose to retain versus sell. Figure 5B shows that this is the
case within banks as well. Banks that experience a decrease in balance sheet capacity are more likely
to sell loans, rather than retain them on the balance sheet. In other words, banks change their business
models with changes to their balance sheet capacity. As banks’ balance sheet capacity declines, they
shift towards the originate-to-distribute model and then move back towards portfolio lending as their
balance sheet capacity improves.
We more formally investigate whether traditional banks are more likely to retain a larger share of
originated mortgages on their balance sheet if they are better capitalized using the following
specification:
                                                                          ′
                          𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝑅𝑅𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑏𝑏 + 𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 Γ + 𝜖𝜖𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏   (2)
Where Retainbt is the percentage of loans retained on the balance sheet by bank b in year t; CRbt is a
bank’s capital ratio; γb are bank fixed effects, controlling for differences in banks’ propensities
towards portfolio lending, as well other time invariant differences in business models; γt are time
fixed effects, which absorb any aggregate changes that would affect the business model of banks,
including aggregate demand or supply fluctuations that would affect the propensity to retain loans on
the balance sheet; Xbt contains bank controls, including log number of originations, log bank assets,
deposits to liabilities, log of the average loan size and applicant income of the bank’s originations,




                                                           12
and log of the number of unique census tracts in which the bank lends. These specifications are
estimated for both levels and changes in these variables. 6
Table 4 shows that banks that experience a 1 pp increase in their capital ratio increase the share of
originations retained on their balance sheets by about 4.5 pp (Column 2). Columns 3 and 4 show that
across banks, better-capitalized banks originate more jumbo loans, but this effect disappears within
banks. Columns 5 and 6 show that the within-bank balance sheet retention margin occurs on the
dimension of conforming loans. In other words, as banks capitalization increases, they increase the
share of conforming loans they retain on the balance sheet. Because the secondary market for jumbo
loans is limited, banks can only adjust their balance sheet effect by adjusting originations, which is
costly. The large effect of capitalization on retention of conforming loans suggests this is the easiest
margin of adjustment, which banks can make without adjusting their originations substantially. 7
These micro-level results support the aggregate evidence, which suggested that banks vary their
business models on the conforming side in response to changes in their own capitalization.
III.B.3 Relative Product Pricing
The aggregate results indicate that balance sheet contraction of traditional banks leads them to
contract supply of jumbo mortgages, increasing the jumbo spread. The aggregate jumbo spread may
partially reflect the differences in the mortgage composition, since jumbos are larger and cater to a
different population segment. To shed more light on conforming and jumbo loan pricing, we examine
the mortgage interest rates around the conforming limit in Figure 6 and compare the period during
which the spread was high (2008) with the period in which the spread was low (2014). Similar to
aggregate data, there is a sharp discontinuity of about 30 to 40 basis points at the conforming loan
cutoff in 2008 (Figure 6B). By 2014 (Figure 6C), on the other hand, we observe much more modest
increase in mortgage rates on loans above the conforming loan limit.
As we discussed above, the positive correlation between aggregate price and quantity and bank
capitalization suggests that supply shocks were at least partially responsible for driving the aggregate
trends. If the contraction in jumbo lending in the 2007–2009 period was solely driven by demand for
jumbos (e.g., due to a decline in house prices), we should also observe a decrease in the pricing of
jumbo mortgages. Instead we find the opposite effect: jumbos are relatively more expensive in times
of low jumbo-market share.
III.B.4 Consumer “Bunching” at the Conforming Loan Cutoff
There is well-known bunching at the conforming limit—i.e., there is a mass of borrowers right below
the conforming loan cutoff (e.g., DeFusco and Paciorek (2017)). A consumer who would, all else
equal, prefer a jumbo mortgage may therefore prefer to choose a cheaper conforming mortgage

6
  Mian and Sufi (2018) show that non-core deposit liability financing played an important role in the run-up to the financial
crisis. Our main results on capital ratios are robust to the inclusion of non-core deposit financing share and the core deposit
financing share (Table A3).
7
  Due to differences in risk weighting due to regulation, jumbo origination requires more capital than conforming loans.
An alternative explanation of our findings could be that some banks have a desire to originate more jumbo loans and,
because of regulatory reasons, such banks have to increase their capitalization. This is unlikely to be driving our findings.
The reason is that we find this relationship also holds for conforming loans.

                                                              13
instead. Presumably such consumers would choose the largest possible mortgage that is still
conforming. We confirm this bunching in Figure 7A.
We document a spike in borrower income below the conforming loan limit (Figure 7B). Larger
mortgages are, on average, taken out by people with larger incomes. This implies that the bunching
at the discontinuity draws from a higher-income population than what the mortgage size would
suggest. A large spike in income would suggest that even very wealthy borrowers are willing to take
up a smaller mortgage in exchange for lower rates. We formalize this intuition in the model and
exploit the moments related to this bunching to estimate the model.
Section IV: Model of Mortgage Demand and Supply
Motivated by the evidence from the previous sections, we build and estimate a structural model of
the U.S. residential mortgage market, which features banks competing with shadow banks for
consumers. The model has several goals. First, we want to understand how the industrial organization
of financial intermediation and the choice of bank business model determine who originates which
types of mortgages, and at which interest rates. Second, we then use the estimated model to
quantitatively analyze the consequences of capital requirements, access to secondary loan markets,
and unconventional monetary policy on lending volume and pricing, bank stability, and the
distribution of consumer surplus across rich and poor households. Moreover, we quantify the
importance of the shadow bank migration and balance sheet retention margins for policy analysis.
Our model builds on Buchak et al. (2018) but is substantially richer in several dimensions on both the
demand and supply sides. Most importantly, our model accounts for the market segmentation between
products which can easily be sold, and those that cannot (conforming versus jumbo mortgages), both
on the demand and supply sides. We briefly discuss some salient features of the supply and demand
sides before describing the model in detail.
On the supply side we explicitly model different financing choices across intermediaries. The supply
side of the market consists of three types of lenders, banks, and two distinct types of shadow banks:
non-fintech shadow banks, and fintech shadow banks. 8 These financial intermediaries engage in two
activities: loan origination and financing. Intermediaries can finance mortgages two different ways:
portfolio (balance-sheet) lending or originate-to-distribute. In portfolio lending the intermediary
finances the mortgage from its own funds. Therefore, differences in lenders’ internal funds—i.e.,
balance sheet capacity—will change their willingness to engage in this activity. Furthermore, capital
requirements put regulatory restrictions on the amount of portfolio lending in which a bank can
engage. Alternatively, intermediaries can originate to distribute: they finance the mortgage by selling
it to a third-party financier through GSEs. Of course, an intermediary can engage in both types of
financing simultaneously. We also allow banks to face regulatory pressures beyond capital
requirements. These can arise from legal or regulatory enforcement actions, or the anticipation of
future actions on the part of regulators or prosecutors. These regulatory pressures constrain banks’
lending activity even if banks are well capitalized. In Section V.E, we relax the assumption that


8
    During our estimation period all traditional banks are classified as non-fintech (see Buchak et al. (2018)).

                                                               14
balance sheet capacity is fixed and allow banks to alter balance sheet capacity through equity issuance
and asset sales.
Following the current institutional setup of the U.S. mortgage market, a central distinction between
jumbo and conforming mortgages is that only conforming mortgages can be financed by originating
to distribute; jumbo loans are portfolio loans. Moreover, only banks can access deposits, which give
them the ability to finance portfolio loans. 9 Shadow banks can only originate to distribute. With this
setup, our model generates endogenous market segmentation between traditional and shadow banks
and within the traditional banking sector between well-capitalized and poorly capitalized banks. In
Section V.E we extend our analysis to allow jumbo mortgage securitization.
On the demand side, we build a rich discrete-continuous choice framework with an application to the
mortgage market. Importantly, we allow preferences of borrowers to be correlated with their income
and house prices. These differences in preferences, especially for larger mortgages, play a critical role
in studying the distributional aspects of policies.
IV.A Demand
A market 𝑐𝑐 in year t is defined at the MSA-loan purpose level. For example, a market may be
borrowers in New York City attempting to refinance their mortgages. Each market has 𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 𝐼𝐼𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
consumers, with an ideal mortgage size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 , and 𝑗𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽𝐽 lenders.
Lenders can offer up to two types of products: conforming and jumbo mortgages. Conforming
mortgage amounts that are available to an individual borrower, 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , have to satisfy two constraints.
First, the amount must be below the market-specific conforming loan limit ����  𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , which is $417,000 in
most markets during our estimation period. Second, the loan has to satisfy the individual-specific
                        ����� × 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 is the LTV constraint times the borrower’s house price. Then the
LTV constraint, where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿
individual’s maximum conforming loan size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the minimum of the market-level conforming
level, and the LTV constraint:
                                                     ����
                                      𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = min{𝐹𝐹       �����
                                                       𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 , 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 × 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 }
                                                                                                             (D.1)


Any mortgage that does not satisfy these two conditions is a jumbo mortgage. Jumbo mortgages must
also satisfy the LTV constraint, i.e., the chosen mortgage size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ ≤ �����
                                                                        𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 × 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 . Let 𝑔𝑔 ∈ {𝐶𝐶, 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁} denote
whether the mortgage is conforming (C) or jumbo (NC). Conditional on an offered rate, consumers
can choose any loan size subject to the limits described above.
Consumers’ utility from a mortgage depends on the mortgage interest rate 𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , the chosen mortgage
size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ , which can differ from the ideal mortgage size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 , and the convenience or quality of the service

 Because banks have access to a subsidized funding of their balance sheet through insured deposits, one can model the
shadow bank decision not to engage in balance sheet lending as a competitive outcome with a corner solution.

A consumer’s utility declines in the mortgage rate 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , with 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 measuring the consumer-specific
sensitivity to interest rates.
Borrower 𝑖𝑖’s mortgage amount 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ can be smaller than her ideal mortgage size, 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 . If that is the case,
she suffers a disutility 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 𝐼𝐼(𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ < 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 ), 10 where the borrower-specific coefficient 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 measures the extent
of disutility and I is the indicator function. This can occur when the borrower’s ideal mortgage is a
jumbo 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 > 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , but the borrower chooses a mortgage under the conforming limit 𝐼𝐼�𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ < 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝐼𝐼�𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 >
𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �, or when a binding LTV constraint prevents the borrower from obtaining their ideal jumbo
mortgage 𝐼𝐼�𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖∗ > 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 �𝐼𝐼(𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 > �����
                                        𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 × 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 ).
Consumers also value mortgages on dimensions other than size and price. For example, conforming
mortgage approval and administrative procedures differ from those of jumbo mortgages. We allow
consumers to have different preferences over these non-rate attributes of conforming relative to jumbo
mortgages, captured by 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 . Consumers also value lenders’ convenience and/or service quality.
Intuitively, consumers like to borrow from fintech shadow banks such as Quicken Loans because they
offer a convenient way to interact online. 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 measures convenience differences between
lenders. 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the year-lender type invariant quality difference, 11 and 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is a year-lender market-
specific unobservable. 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is estimated as a year-lender type fixed effect, and is thus observable by
the researcher, while 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is not. Last, borrowers’ preferences over lenders differ idiosyncratically,
which is captured in the i.i.d. T1EV borrower-specific utility shock 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . For example, some
borrowers prefer to borrow from JPMorgan Chase over Quicken because they have a bank account
with the former, making it easier to transact.
The ideal mortgage size, interest rate sensitivity, relative preference for a conforming loan, as well as
the cost of departing from the ideal mortgage size are consumer specific. Consumers’ preferences are
drawn from a distribution, where the distribution is a function of income and house prices in a market.
Specifically, let Β𝑖𝑖 ≡ (𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 , 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 , 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 )′ describe consumer preferences, then:
                                                                       � + Π(𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐷𝐷

  A consumer will never choose a mortgage which is too large.

  Because of large changes in the quality of fintech providers over time, we allow the quality of fintech shadow banks to
evolve over time as well.

                                                                                             16

characteristics such as income and house prices (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐷𝐷

borrowers, and their preferences over mortgage size can differ. Σ scales normal i.i.d. shocks

in their price elasticity or ideal mortgage size. The demand parameters to be estimated are then 𝜃𝜃𝑑𝑑 =
(Β�, Π, Σ). 12

Consumers choose the mortgage that maximizes their utility by choosing between offered mortgages,
subject to an LTV constraint. If they do not choose a mortgage, they choose an outside good with a
fixed utility, 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖0 . In other words, given product characteristics for each mortgage offered in the market

𝐴𝐴𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 (⋅) denotes the set of demographic characteristics 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 and idiosyncratic shocks 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖⋅𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 such that

mortgage lender 𝑗𝑗 offering product 𝑔𝑔 in market 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐:

Note that the size of mortgages a consumer chooses is implicitly captured in expression D.4. If a
consumer prefers a jumbo-sized mortgage and chooses a jumbo mortgage, she does so at the ideal
size or at the LTV constraint. If instead this consumer chooses a conforming mortgage, she will
choose the largest conforming mortgage possible subject to the LTV constraint, which implies
bunching at the conforming loan limit.

IV.B Mortgage Supply
There are 𝑁𝑁𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 banks, 𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 non-fintech shadow banks, and 𝑁𝑁𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 fintech shadow banks in market ct.
Lenders choose simultaneously which mortgages to originate across all markets and how to finance

  We directly draw log 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 , log house prices and log income from normal distributions. In consequence, the distribution

to retain as portfolio loans on the balance sheet 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , and how many to finance (the remainder)
                                           𝑏𝑏
through GSE securitization 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Jumbo mortgages cannot be securitized and are retained
                                       𝑏𝑏
on the balance sheet 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Each bank has only one balance sheet across markets in which
                              𝑏𝑏             𝑏𝑏
it participates. Denote by 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = ∑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 the amount of type g mortgages that lender j chooses to
retain on the balance sheet. In other words, suppose the bank originates conforming loans in the New
York City and Houston MSAs, and it chooses to finance $100 million on its balance sheet. From a
financing perspective, it does not matter which market these loans were originated in.
IV.B.1 Origination
Mortgage origination is costly, beyond the mere financing cost of a mortgage. Lenders incur non-
financing costs such as costs of an appraisal and title check, document processing, and loan closure,
which involve labor and equipment. We designate the per-dollar origination cost of lender j of
mortgage type g as 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , and the total origination cost in market ct is:

                                                � 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗                                   (S.1)
                                                 𝑔𝑔

This specification allows for different origination costs across banks, non-fintech shadow banks, and
fintech shadow banks. For example, this heterogeneity allows us to capture potential cost savings
from technology employed by fintech shadow banks who use less labor in lending.
IV.B.2 Financing and Regulatory Burden
Recall that mortgages can be financed two ways. Conforming mortgages can be sold to GSEs, i.e.,
OTD. Alternatively, conforming and jumbo mortgages can be financed by using a bank’s internal
funds as portfolio loans. These two types of financing can have different costs.
Originate-to-Distribute Financing
Lenders can securitize conforming mortgages though GSEs. Since GSEs purchase mortgages at
predetermined prices, all lenders face the same originate-to-distribute financing cost in a given
market, which we model as an ability to obtain funding for a conforming mortgage at a rate
𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 = 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏 + 𝜎𝜎 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 . Here 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏 represents the underlying financing costs of funding absent any costs
arising from intermediation and captures the current interest rate environment in the macroeconomy.
𝜎𝜎 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 captures additional costs coming from the lender using GSE financing, which can include the
guarantee fee (g-fee) charged by the GSEs for coverage of projected credit losses from borrower
defaults in the securitized pools. In other words, when the firm originates-to-distribute a mortgage, it
earns the spread on the mortgage rate minus the financing and non-financing origination costs 𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 −
𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 − 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 for every dollar of the mortgage. Reflecting the post-crisis period, which we study, we
assume that securitization is only available for conforming loans; jumbo loans must be retained on
balance sheet. One could easily account for a jumbo securitization in the same way (see Section V.E).




                                                          18
Costs of Portfolio Lending
The cost of portfolio lending depends on the composition of the lender’s balance sheet and the amount
of equity capital 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . A lender sources financing at the firm level and has one balance sheet comprising
mortgage assets across markets. There are two types of assets held on a lender’s balance sheet:
mortgages—the amount of which is chosen by the lender in each market—and other assets in the
            𝑏𝑏
amount 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . The choice of the latter is determined outside the model and represent other assets that
the bank chooses to hold on the balance sheet such as government bonds or commercial loans which
it did not securitize. Lenders also differ in the amount of equity capital 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . The amount of equity and
the asset composition of the balance sheet jointly determine the cost of portfolio lending for an
intermediary. While these quantities are fixed in the baseline model, in Section V.E we allow for
costly equity issuance as well as liquidating of non-mortgage assets.
A lender’s risk-adjusted capital ratio 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 depends on the banks equity capital 𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 and banks’ risk-
                       𝑏𝑏                       𝑏𝑏
weighted assets 𝜉𝜉𝑜𝑜 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + ∑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝜉𝜉𝑔𝑔 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 :
                                                                          𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
                                               𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 =          𝑏𝑏                       𝑏𝑏            (S.2)
                                                          𝜉𝜉𝑜𝑜 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + ∑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝜉𝜉𝑔𝑔 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

Where 𝜉𝜉𝑔𝑔 represents the risk weight of mortgages of type g and 𝜉𝜉𝑜𝑜 represents the risk weight of other
assets the bank holds. Since jumbo mortgages have higher risk weights, they use up more statutory
capital per dollar of actual lending. A bank’s capital needs to be below its statutory capital requirement
𝜌𝜌̅ if it wants to lend on its balance sheet.
The per-dollar cost of financing a portfolio loan of lender j depends on its capitalization:
                                                  𝑝𝑝                                        −𝜙𝜙         (S.3)
                                                𝜎𝜎𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏 + 𝜎𝜎 𝑏𝑏1 �𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝜌𝜌̅ �

As before, 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏 represents the underlying financing costs of funding in the macroeconomy.
                         −𝜙𝜙
𝜎𝜎 𝑏𝑏1 �𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝜌𝜌̅ �         is the shadow cost of balance-sheet funding above this base rate. The closer a bank’s
risk-adjusted capital ratio is to the statutory requirement, i.e., the smaller �𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝜌𝜌̅ �, the larger the
cost of portfolio loan financing. 𝜙𝜙 and 𝜎𝜎 𝑏𝑏1 parameterize the extent of this cost. This formulation
captures the fact that banks choose a capital buffer above the hard capital requirement. The micro-
foundations of such a buffer can be generated in a dynamic setting but are not the central interest in
this paper (see Corbae and D'Erasmo (2019)). We assume that balance sheet lending by shadow banks
is prohibitively expensive. This assumption captures in reduced form the notion that shadow banks
do not have access to a subsidized deposit funding and must use external financing instead.
Regulatory Burden
Banks face regulatory pressures beyond capital requirements. These regulatory pressures constrain
banks’ lending activity even if banks are well capitalized. Rather than changing costs of lending,
which we model directly, regulatory burdens may also reduce traditional banks’ activity on the
extensive margin. For example, risk constraints and fear of enforcement or lawsuits may sometimes


                                                                         19
prevent a traditional bank from lending to a given borrower altogether (Buchak et al. 2018). We
capture this type of regulatory burden through parameter 1/𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 .
For banks, the probability of lending to a specific borrower of mortgage g in market ct is scaled by a
factor 𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 . A higher 1/𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 (lower 𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ) captures a relatively constrained bank; a lower 1/𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 (higher
𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 ) captures a relatively unconstrained bank. These shocks are i.i.d. across lender-borrower pairs,
which accounts for the uncertainty that a bank faces with respect to which loans may be subject to
these issues ex post.
IV.B.3 Choosing Mortgage Rates and Financing
Taking other lenders’ actions as given, an individual lender maximizes its profits by setting interest
rates across all markets and chooses how many mortgages to retain on its balance sheet. Denote by
𝒓𝒓𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 the set of prices of all products, conforming and jumbo, across all markets for lender j at time t,
𝒓𝒓𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 = {𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 : ∀𝑐𝑐, 𝑔𝑔}. Lender j chooses each rate. Since all jumbo mortgages are securitized, the only
decision in addition to setting interest rates is how many, if any, conforming mortgages to retain on
                                 𝑏𝑏                                  𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺                       𝑏𝑏
the balance sheet 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗        , and how many to securitize, 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗    = ∑𝑐𝑐�𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 �. Then the lenders
choose interest rates and the amount of conforming mortgages to retain on the balance sheet by
maximizing profits:

                                                                                          𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺        𝑏𝑏               𝑝𝑝

The first term, labeled rate income, is the yearly income that the lender earns from the loans that it
has made, equal to the sum of interest rates times mortgage volumes across all loan types and markets.
The second term, labeled origination cost, is the costs the lender occurs in originating the loans, such
as the wages of mortgage brokers, advertising, and administrative expense. The third term, labeled
financing cost, is the financing cost of the mortgage, reflecting the costs of either GSE or balance-
sheet financing, depending on the lender’s optimal financing cost.
Intermediaries’ profits comprise interest rate income (either collected by themselves or through
servicing rights), origination costs, and financing costs. Note that interest rates enter profits both
directly and indirectly through market shares. Market shares are also affected by regulatory
constraints. In other words, the amount of mortgages originated, 𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , is implicitly a function of both
the interest rates of the lender 𝒓𝒓𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 , other lenders 𝒓𝒓−𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 , and the regulatory burden parameter 𝜁𝜁𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 , which
we omit for ease of notation.
IV.B.4 Equilibrium
We study symmetric equilibria. Demand is characterized by consumers’ choice of mortgages and
market share equations. Consumers maximize utility-taking prices and lender characteristics as given.
Supply is characterized by intermediaries’ maximization in S.4. Banks, non-fintech shadow banks,
and fintech shadow banks set mortgage rates across all markets in which they participate. Moreover,



                                                                                    20
banks decide how many of the mortgages to retain on the balance sheet. A common balance sheet
implies that a lender cannot set prices across markets independently.
IV.C Estimation
We estimate the demand and supply parameters separately. To estimate the model, we aggregate the
loan-level data to market-lender-type observations. A market is defined as an MSA-year-loan
purpose, e.g., refinances in New York City in 2013. In each MSA-year, we measure demographic
data including means and standard deviations of log incomes and log house prices from the ACS data.
Within MSA-years, we separate markets into mortgages originated for new purchases and mortgages
originated for refinances, the idea being that a borrower looking for one type of loan is not in the
market for another type.
We compute risk-adjusted interest rates in a market by projecting out FICO and LTV differences. We
then project each loan’s actual interest rate to its predicted interest rate differences so that each loan
in the market has the market-wide average FICO score of roughly 760. This adjustment ensures that
across markets and lenders we are comparing interest rates of similarly risky borrowers. Next, we
aggregate from the loan level to the time and market level by taking the average of these residualized
interest rates across product and lender types.
We obtain the number of unique lenders (𝑁𝑁𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 , 𝑁𝑁𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 , and 𝑁𝑁𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 ) by taking the median number of lenders
per census tract within the MSA. This captures the typical number of loan offerings from each type
of lender that a borrower faces. Market size is defined as one-tenth of the total number of households
in the case of new originations—under the assumption that one-tenth of households are potentially in
the market for a new home per year—and as the total number of outstanding mortgages in the case of
refinances. We estimate the model using data between 2010 and 2015.
IV.C.1 Demand Estimation
Our estimation roughly follows Berry et al. (1995) and Nevo (2000), with several differences. The
first important difference is that borrowers choose loan quantity, in addition to choosing whether to
take up a mortgage. In other words, while Berry et al. (1995) is a discrete-choice model, our model is
discrete-continuous. Therefore, in addition to estimating standard preferences for interest rates
(governed by 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 ) and non-price attributes of mortgages (governed by 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 and 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 ), we have to
estimate the preferences for mortgage size. These are governed by a borrower’s (unobserved) ideal
mortgage size 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 , and the disutility of choosing a mortgage which is too small, 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 . The most significant
departure from the standard Berry et al. (1995) and Nevo (2000) type of estimation is the use of the
discontinuity at the conforming loan limit in addition to aggregate data. In other words, we introduce
bunching-style identification into a structural model.
To identify consumer preferences, we need to instrument for prices. We exploit an institutional feature
of how GSEs set interest rates of conforming mortgages. Hurst et al. (2016) show that, for political
economy reasons, mortgage pricing for GSE loans does not adjust for spatial risk. In other words, in
some areas the financing cost of a conforming mortgage is higher than in other areas, and is unrelated
to mortgage demand. Accordingly, we use the variation in mortgage pricing across regions to obtain


                                                        21
relative variation in conforming and jumbo interest rates that is driven by GSE institutional constraints
and not by borrower demand.
In addition to aggregate data, we also exploit several novel micro-level data moments. First, we use
the mean and standard deviation of realized loan sizes for jumbo and conforming loans within a
market. Second, we use two moments around the conforming limit discontinuity: the market share of
borrowers who obtain conforming loans exactly at the conforming loan limit (see Figure 7A) and the
income difference between borrowers exactly at the conforming loan limit and those nearby (see
Figure 7B).
Identification Discussion:
While all moments jointly identify the parameters of the model, here we provide an informal
discussion of how different moments in the data relate to the identification of different parameters.
As in Berry et al. (1995) and Nevo (2000), the aggregate market shares allow us to identify the
distribution of preferences for interest rates and non-price attributes of mortgages, once we instrument
for price. The price variation induced by the GSE cost shocks allows us to identify the price sensitivity
for consumers, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 . Variation in market shares for a given interest rate across lenders allows us to
estimate consumer preferences over non-price attributes, 𝑞𝑞𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Intuitively, if Quicken has a
larger market share for mortgages for a given interest rate, it must be because consumers value
Quicken’s convenient mortgage screening and documentation system.
Jointly with the aggregate moments, the micro-moments allow us to estimate the preferences for other
parameters of the model. Intuitively, consumers who choose a jumbo mortgage choose the mortgage
at their ideal size (subject to the consumer-specific LTV constraint). Similarly, consumers who
choose a conforming mortgage below the conforming limit choose a mortgage at their ideal size
(subject to LTV constraint). Intuitively, the mean and standard deviation of realized loan sizes for
jumbo and conforming loans within a market are very informative about the distribution of ideal loan
sizes 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 , once we account for the behavior at the discontinuity.
The parameter 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 governs behavior at the discontinuity, and consequently the distribution of loan
sizes around the discontinuity are highly informative in identifying these parameters. Recall that a
consumer choosing a smaller-than-ideal mortgage suffers disutility 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 . Consider a consumer whose
ideal mortgage size is greater than the conforming limit. She has three choices: obtain a jumbo
mortgage at the ideal size, obtain a conforming mortgage that is too small—perhaps at a lower rate,
or exit the market entirely. When 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 is large, she will be unlikely to take a smaller conforming loan
unless the interest rate differential and her price sensitivity are large. In contrast, when 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 is small she
is more likely to take a conforming mortgage exactly at the conforming loan cutoff. Therefore, all
else equal, 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 governs the amount of bunching at the conforming loan cutoff. Large 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 leads to less
bunching and small 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 leads to more bunching. Consequently, the average level of 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 is identified
from the observed bunching in the data, and 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ’s covariance with income and house price is identified
by how bunching varies with income and house prices in the data.
Besides taking a smaller conforming loan, the consumer has the option to obtain a jumbo loan or exit
the market entirely. If 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is high, holding the conforming market share fixed, then jumbo loans are

                                                     22
highly inconvenient and the consumer is more likely to exit the market entirely rather than obtain a
jumbo loan. In contrast, when 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is low, jumbo loans are relatively convenient and the consumer is
more likely to remain in the market. That is, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 governs the missing mass of borrowers whose ideal
loan size is jumbo, but because jumbo loans are inconvenient and conforming loans are too small,
decide to exit the market entirely. Observe from Figure 7A that there is indeed a missing mass of
jumbo borrowers: the density of mortgages drops discontinuously above the conforming loan limit in
excess of the bunching at the limit. That is, consumers value the convenience of conforming
mortgages. Put another way, holding market size constant on the extensive margin, 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 governs the
relative market shares of conforming and jumbo mortgages, with a high 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 leading to relatively more
conforming loans. Consequently, the average level of 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is identified from the relative market shares
of conforming and jumbo loans holding overall market shares fixed, while 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 ’s covariance with
income and house price is identified based on how these relative market shares vary with wage and
house prices in the data.
The last micro-moment we match is the income difference between borrowers exactly at the
conforming loan limit and those nearby (see Figure 7B). Intuitively, the larger the income spike at the
discontinuity, the less sensitive the higher-income population is to taking a mortgage which is smaller
than ideal. This moment aids in identifying the correlation between income and preferences for a
jumbo mortgage, i.e., the structure of the correlation in the random coefficients.
Model Fit: Targeted Moments and Simulated Responses to Real Policy Changes
We estimate the model over the period 2010–2015. The demand parameter estimates are shown in
Table 5. By construction, the model fits market shares data. The model also fits the size distribution
of mortgages in the data quite well. Figure 8B shows the model replicates the average amount of
bunching at the conforming loan limit generated by our model. Figure 8A shows that the model can
replicate the qualitatively bunching patterns across markets and does well in quantitatively matching
the extent of bunching. We overestimate the extent of bunching in the markets with the most
bunching. Intuitively, these are markets with the highest demand for jumbo mortgages. The difference
between data and model estimates is likely due to approximating the desired loan size with a log-
normal distribution. Markets in which desired loan sizes are large will also be high variance, so the
log-normal distribution will put a lot of mass to the right.
We also examine the fit of the model by confronting it with actual policy changes. We exploit changes
to conforming loan limits over time in the U.S. mortgage market between 2007 and 2016. We compute
market outcomes using model estimates, and compare model-predicted changes to those from the
data. The main variables of interest at the level of county and origination year are jumbo origination
share (%Jumbo), bank origination share (%Bank), and the mass of borrowers at conforming limit
cutoff (%AtCutoff). The main explanatory variable captures the change in conforming limit in a given
county in a given year. We measure increases as the percentage difference between the conforming
loan limit in year t in county c and the conforming loan limit in 2007 for the same county c:
                                                                      𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
                                𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 =                     −1
                                                                   𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐2007


                                                           23
The origination amount weighted mean of 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is 10.2% and the median is 0. The
specifications to test the impact of these limit increases on jumbo and bank share are as follows:
                     %𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝐽𝑜𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐                         (3)
                     %𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑓𝑓𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐                   (4)
                     %𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐                           (5)
Where 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 and 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 are county and year fixed effects, respectively.
Specification (3) investigates whether jumbo share of originations declines along with conforming
loan limit increases. Column 1 of Table 6 shows that increasing the conforming loan limit by 1%
leads to an approximately 0.35% reduction in the jumbo share in the county. These estimates from
actual data compare well with model counterfactual estimates where we simulate a similar change in
conforming limits and assess the response. Table 11 finds a similar reduction of 0.31%. As the
conforming loan limit increases, there is a significant shift towards conforming loans.
Specification (4) tests the extent of declines in bunching, which is measured as the number of
conforming originations within 0.1% of the conforming loan limit. Column 2 of Table 6 shows that
when the conforming loan limit increases the mass of borrowers exactly at the conforming loan cutoff
decreases, suggesting that many of these borrowers would have selected larger loans had the
conforming loan limits not been in place, and now that the limit has been relaxed, they are able to
select larger, now conforming loans. As Figure 8B shows, the model closely captures the market
shares of borrowers within a 5% band both above and below the conforming loan limit.
Specification (5) tests whether bank market share declines. Column 3 of Table 6 shows that a 1%
increase in the conforming loan limit decreases bank market share by roughly 0.03% percentage
points. Again, this estimate from actual data is consistent with that produced by our model (see
counterfactual in Table 11), which finds that a 1% increase in the jumbo loan limit leads to roughly a
0.08% decrease in bank market share around the limit. 13
Price Sensitivity
Our estimates of mean price sensitivity in Table 5 suggest that borrowers are quite price elastic, and
the differences in price elasticity are small. The mean parameter 𝛼𝛼� = 1.14 from Table 5A implies a
price elasticity of roughly 4.4. This estimate is close to DeFusco and Paciorek (2017), who estimate
the elasticity from the conforming loan discontinuity using a different approach. The estimate of 𝜎𝜎𝛼𝛼2 =
0.07 in Table 5C suggests moderate borrower differences in price elasticity, ranging from 4 to 5.12
for borrowers two standard deviations above and below the mean in price sensitivity. Second, for a

13
   We also measure the change in bank market share as more jumbo loans are originated by using the following
specification: 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 . The results in Table 6, Column 4 find a positive and
significant association between bank share and jumbo share. This coefficient, here estimated as roughly 0.25, is roughly
in line with the relationship suggested in the model from Tables 9, 10, and 11, which finds that bank share increases by
roughly 0.50 percentage points per percent increase in jumbo market share. Note that variation in jumbo share from the
regression above obtains from all sources, such as variation in demand, supply, and policy, whereas the cross-validating
variation in the model comes entirely from policy variation where one would expect a stronger relationship between
jumbo share and bank share.

                                                                      24
given level of income, borrowers who buy more expensive houses are less price elastic with respect
to mortgages. This makes sense: customers who are willing to purchase a larger house are also more
willing to pay a higher interest rate. Conditional on the house price, on the other hand, higher-income
households are more price elastic. In other words, the household which bought a more frugal home
relative to its income is also more price elastic when choosing a mortgage. Since jumbo mortgages
cater to borrowers in high house-price areas, this implies that they cater to a less price-elastic part of
the borrower population, allowing, all else equal, higher markups earned on these mortgages.
Distribution of Ideal Mortgage Sizes
The preference for mortgage size is a central driver of consumers choosing jumbo versus conforming
mortgages. As Table 5B shows, the ideal mortgage size is larger for wealthier individuals, with an
elasticity of 0.38: as income rises by 1%, the desired mortgage size increases by 0.38%. This estimate
is close to the heuristic that household debt should not exceed 30% of household income. Desired
loan size also increases with house prices, with an elasticity of approximately 0.39.
Consumers borrow below their ideal size either due to LTV constraints or because they choose a
cheaper and more convenient conforming mortgage instead of the desired jumbo. Borrowers find
departures from their ideal mortgage size costly. For borrowers who would otherwise prefer a jumbo
mortgage, we estimate a mean disutility of taking a smaller loan to be 𝛽𝛽̅ = 5.79, which is equivalent
to roughly a 5.1% higher interest rate. This estimate reflects the fact that consumers are on average
very price elastic, but jumbo borrowers are still willing to take a more expensive jumbo mortgage.
Therefore, these borrowers must place a high value on the additional funds provided by a jumbo
mortgage. That is intuitive: taking out a smaller conforming mortgage may prevent the borrower from
purchasing a home or result in purchasing a substantially smaller home than they desire.
Borrowers with high income are less sensitive to taking smaller loans, while borrowers with high
house prices are more sensitive to taking smaller loans. This is not surprising: High-income borrowers
are likely to be able to adjust to smaller loan sizes by putting up more of their own money. Borrowers
buying high-price homes, on the other hand, are more dependent on larger loan sizes and consequently
are less willing to substitute a small conforming loan for a large jumbo loan. Finally, we find a positive
and substantial preference for conforming loans overall as opposed to jumbo loans, possibly reflecting
the costs of qualifying for and obtaining a jumbo loan (e.g., increased screening/loan documentation
requirements, additional time and effort needed to obtain a jumbo loan relative to conforming loan).
The preference for conforming mortgages explains the substantially smaller market share of jumbo
mortgages relative to the house price distribution.
IV.C.2 Supply Estimation and Results
To estimate the supply-side parameters, which govern intermediaries’ behavior, we use the revealed
preferences of intermediaries in setting interest rates and choosing how many loans to retain on the
balance sheet. We estimate parameters governing the costs of origination for the three types of
intermediaries we observe, the financing cost of balance sheet lending, and the costs of originate-to-
distribute. Intuitively, using demand estimates, we can compute the markups that intermediaries earn.
We use lenders’ pricing decisions, combined with these markups, to infer the costs of lending. For

                                                   25
example, if an intermediary is charging higher prices for a given markup, this implies that the
intermediary is facing higher lending costs, which the lender passes on to consumers. Recall that for
a bank, the cost of portfolio lending depends on its current capital ratio 𝜌𝜌𝑗𝑗 , the statutory capital
requirement 𝜌𝜌̅ , other parameters such as the risk weights 𝜉𝜉𝑔𝑔 and 𝜉𝜉𝑗𝑗 , and the type of mortgage. To the
extent that low capitalization indeed causes a higher cost of portfolio lending, the model implies how
these higher costs should be passed through to different types of mortgages given estimated demand.
Table 7 shows the estimated parameters. Because we estimate costs using intermediaries’ pricing
decisions, we cannot separate the baseline origination and financing costs. Intuitively, if a bank’s
baseline financing costs increase by 0.5% (50 basis points), but origination costs decline by 0.5%, the
costs of making a loan do not change. Since mortgage demand is quite price elastic the markups are
quite moderate, with an average markup of 1.6 pp.
As banks’ capitalization declines, their financing costs rise. To better understand the different costs
of mortgages, Figure 9 plots total marginal costs for different levels of excess bank capitalization,
defined as the difference between the bank’s capital ratio and the statutory requirement, 𝜌𝜌 − 𝜌𝜌�.
Several aspects are worth discussing. First, well-capitalized banks have a cost advantage over poorly
capitalized banks because they can lend with lower-cost balance sheet financing. Even poorly
capitalized banks have a cost advantage over shadow banks. While all intermediaries can finance
mortgages through GSEs, the model estimates that banks can do so more cheaply than shadow banks.
This estimate likely reflects the advantage of banks in originating mortgages: the existing pool of
bank customers means they have a lower customer acquisition cost, and the existing relationship with
the customer may make document processing and screening for irregularities in mortgage applications
easier. The baseline costs of originating and financing a mortgage varies from 4.3%–4.8%, reflecting
the low markups in this market. This represents the cost of financing and originating a new purchase
mortgage if a bank were flush with capital.
Second, financing jumbo mortgages is more expensive than financing conforming mortgages, even
when the latter are retained on the balance sheet. Jumbo mortgages’ risk weight is 2.5 that of
conforming mortgages, i.e., a dollar in a jumbo mortgage tightens the capital constraint more than a
dollar of conforming mortgages, resulting in higher financing cost. 14 This difference declines with
bank capitalization. In other words, if the capital constraint is loose, then a higher risk weight has a
small cost. For a bank whose capital exceeds the statutory capital by 3%, the additional financing cost
is around 50 bps; at 10% of capital above the statutory limit the cost difference declines to 5 bps.
Quantitatively, these numbers are reasonable. In 2009, a time period outside of the estimation
window, the typical bank originator of a jumbo loan had an excess capital ratio of roughly 7%.
According to our model, this corresponds to a roughly 4.5% marginal cost. At the same time, the
typical bank origination of a conforming loan had an excess capital ratio of roughly 6.7%, which



14
  Exposures to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises receive 20% risk weights; exposure to first-lien mortgages on
owner-occupied single-family houses receive a 50% risk weight. See: https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/mercatus-
barth-primer-capital-standards-v1.pdf.

                                                        26
corresponds to roughly a 4.35% marginal cost. This implies a negative conforming-jumbo marginal
cost spread, which is roughly in line with patterns in Figure 1C.
Finally, the model suggests that originating refinancing mortgages is less costly than originating
mortgages for purchase by approximately 5–10 basis points. In refinancing, lenders benefit from
many on-the-ground activities having already taken place at the time of purchase, such as a title check,
structural examination, and negotiations between buyer and seller, which reduces costs.
IV.C.3 Bank Regulatory Burden and Fintech Quality
Table 8 shows two primary reasons why banks have been losing market share during the period from
2010 to 2015: an increase in the regulatory burden from 2012 onwards and the entrance of new fintech
competitors. Part of the reason why banks have lost market share during the period is an increase in
capital requirements, which has increased their costs of funding, as we discuss above. On the other
hand, the period following the crisis has been profitable, increasing banks’ capitalization and undoing
some of the capital requirement increases. Despite that, banks have lost substantial market share in
the conforming market. Table 8 explains these trends.
The regulatory burden measures the noncapital requirement-related regulatory constraints faced by
the banking sector relative to shadow banks, such as risk of enforcement actions and lawsuits, which
constrain bank origination. The estimates show that the banking sector regulatory burden even
declined a bit, but then started increasing from 2012 onwards. This is the period of implementation
of the Dodd-Frank Act, the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and increased
mortgage lawsuit activity targeted at traditional banks. These results are consistent with those of
Buchak et al. (2018), who estimate the regulatory burden in a simpler model, but on a longer sample,
and show reduced-form evidence on the different aspects of the regulatory burden such as tougher
regulatory enforcement and lawsuits leveled against banks. The substantial changes in the regulatory
burden emphasize that the singular focus on capital requirements misses a large degree of regulatory
and enforcement changes in the banking sector following the crisis, which a model has to account for.
The second reason that banks have been losing market share over this period is the entrance of new
fintech lenders. These fintech lenders entered on the promise of providing a better user experience,
with a more consumer-convenient online interface. Table 8 suggests that it took fintech until 2013 to
achieve that, and they were only successful in the market for mortgage refinancing. Our post-2013
results are consistent with consumer survey evidence, which consistently measure high consumer
satisfaction associated with borrowing from Quicken Loans, the largest fintech lender. 15 The model
estimates suggest that fintech are at a disadvantage in the market for new originations, i.e., when the
borrower is purchasing a house. These borrowers on average prefer non-fintech shadow banks over
the whole sample, although by 2012 the disadvantage has decreased significantly. This result is
consistent with the idea that the online origination is not well-suited to originating new mortgages,
which require on-the-ground activities such as a structural examination (Stroebel 2016).

Section V: Counterfactual Policy Analysis
In this section, we use the estimated model to study the consequences of several policy changes. Our
baseline scenario is based on 2015 lending volumes, as reported in HMDA, together with 2015
regulatory policies. 16 We evaluate the effects of policies on the amount, distribution, and pricing of
loans, as well as the resulting market structure. Broadly, we analyze the consequences of policy
changes along two dimensions. The first is mortgage origination and redistribution, which analyzes
the policy from the perspective of potential borrowers: how many mortgages of each type are
originated, at which prices, and to which borrowers. Because policies have a differential impact across
borrowers of different incomes, they have distributional consequences and affect inequality. The
second dimension is implications for bank stability. Because policies impact bank profits and balance-
sheet loan retention, they have implications for bank stability. These counterfactuals also allow us to
evaluate how predictions of policy consequences change, once we account for the impact of the
balance sheet retention margin and the shadow bank migration margin. The individual counterfactuals
are useful because they analyze the consequences of specific policies. We summarize the robust
patterns and insights we obtain across counterfactuals in Section V.D.
V.A Changes to Bank Capital Requirements
We first study the consequences of changing capital requirements. The level of the capital requirement
is one of the main tools used by policymakers to regulate banks. Our motivating facts in Section III.B
suggest that when traditional banks face a higher regulatory capital constraint, they reduce lending on
balance sheet. The lending contraction will be lower than implied by a decline in balance sheet lending
because banks adjust on the balance sheet retention margin, keeping fewer of the originated loans on
the balance sheet. Moreover, shadow banks will step into the gap and provide some loans as well.
The extent of shadow bank migration in response to capital requirements is now acknowledged as an
important margin to consider in policy proposals. 17 Our counterfactual allows us to quantify the
magnitude of the adjustment along these margins. Taking the 2015 market as given, we
counterfactually study the impact of increasing and decreasing capital requirements relative to the 6%
baseline. Table 9 and Figure 10 show the results.
We first preview the results, which we describe in more detail below. Intuitively, capital requirements
tighten the capital constraint, increasing banks’ cost of lending on the balance sheet. Therefore, capital
requirements increase stability in the banking sector at a cost of substantially fewer jumbo mortgages.
The decline in overall lending is much smaller than suggested by balance sheet contraction. The
decline is partially offset through the balance sheet retention margin: banks switch from on-balance-
sheet jumbo to originating conforming loans that they do not retain on the balance sheet. Shadow

16
   Note that our baseline shadow bank market share (39%) is the fraction of loans originated by shadow banks in the
combined conforming and jumbo issuance volume. Accounting for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing
Administration, a loan segment in which shadow banks originated about 75% of loans in 2015, increases the overall
shadow bank market share to about 50% (see Buchak et al. (2018)).
17
   For instance, the “Minneapolis Plan” of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve proposes substantially increased capital ratios,
above 20%. One of the critical inputs involves projections on the amount of activity that could migrate to the shadow
banking sector (https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/special-studies/endingtbtf/final-proposal/summary-of-the-
minneapolis-plan-to-end-too-big-to-fail).

                                                            28
bank migration also offsets some of the decline in originations. The cost of capital requirements is a
decline in bank profits and consumer surplus of higher-income individuals. In other words, tightening
capital requirements trades off bank stability with welfare of high-income consumers and bank
profits. The effect is asymmetric. As we show below, lowering capital requirements primarily
operates on the balance sheet retention margin: it increases the share of mortgages retained on bank
balance sheets, but would otherwise have little effect on mortgage origination. Raising capital
requirements, on the other hand, operates both on the balance sheet retention margin and the shadow
bank migration margin. It decreases the share of mortgages on bank balance sheets but increases the
number of loans originated by shadow banks.
Mortgage Origination and Redistribution
Increasing and decreasing capital requirements have an asymmetric impact on mortgage origination.
Cutting capital requirements by half, to 3%, would result in a very modest increase of $16 billion in
the total volume of mortgage origination (to $1,779 billion), driven primarily by increases in jumbo
lending. The market structure of lending would be relatively unchanged and jumbo rates would
decline by 15 bps. Both high-income borrowers and banks benefit from loosening capital
requirements, but the benefits are small, with consumer surplus increasing by $3 billion 18 and lender
profits increasing by $3 billion. These gains in consumer surplus fall primarily to high-income
individuals, with individuals in the top income quartile gaining roughly $47 in consumer welfare,
compared to $6 for individuals in the bottom income quartile.
Increasing capital requirements, on the other hand, causes significant changes to mortgage
origination. Consider increasing the capital requirement from 6% to 9%. Total mortgage originations
decline somewhat, by $54 billion, but results in a large shift from jumbo to conforming mortgages,
and from banks to shadow banks. Jumbo origination shrinks by $151 billion, or 40%, relative to the
market with capital requirement of 6%. This decrease in jumbo mortgage supply results in a 44 basis
point increase in jumbo rates relative to the baseline jumbo interest rate of 5.05%, while the
conforming rate remains virtually unchanged at 4.88%, resulting in a large increase in the jumbo
spread. These increases in interest rates are driven almost entirely by increases in banks’ marginal
costs of originating jumbo loans on balance sheet rather than changes in markups, and these marginal
costs increase by 46 basis points over the baseline markup of 1.6 pp.
Approximately two-thirds of borrowers who would have obtained jumbo loans still obtain mortgages,
with about one-third choosing not to borrow. $97 billion worth of mortgages shift to the conforming
market. Banks and shadow banks each capture approximately $49 billion of these originations,
resulting in a 4 pp increase in the share of loans originated by shadow banks. In other words, the 9.5%
decline in bank lending substantially overestimates the consequences of increasing capital
requirements on mortgage origination, which declines by 3% only. This migration away from jumbo
lending at banks and towards conforming lending at shadow banks illustrates the importance of the
shadow bank migration margin. Increased capital requirement results in a $54 billion net decrease in

mortgage lending. This incomplete migration towards shadow banks illustrates that tighter capital
regulations on the banking sector are not being completely absorbed through the shadow bank
migration channel. Thus, the notion that shadow banks might pick up the slack in bank lending
entirely is not correct.
Higher capital requirements primarily hurt banks and higher consumers in higher-income zip codes
where there is a greater demand for jumbo loans. Given the capital requirement of 9%, bank profits
decrease by roughly $24 billion, while shadow bank profits are essentially unchanged. As capital
requirements increase, banks lose their comparative advantage of financing loans on balance sheet.
Total consumer surplus declines by roughly $45 billion, and a typical borrower sees her consumer
surplus decline by roughly $1,617 under the 9% capital requirement scenario versus the baseline.
Welfare effects differ significantly within the income distribution, with the majority of these declines
occurring for borrowers in high-income markets that rely on jumbo lending. The top income quartile
markets see consumer surplus decline by roughly $32 billion, while consumer surplus in the bottom
income quartile markets declines by only $1 billion. The decline in consumer surplus occurs along
two margins: (i) the borrowers who still borrow jumbo loans now pay higher rates and (ii) the
borrowers who switched to conforming mortgages, or exited the market, now do not borrow the
optimal amount. Finally, it is important to note that these losses have to be weighed against possible
welfare gains of moving risk from bank balance sheets (e.g., Egan et al. 2017).
Bank Stability
There are two dimensions through which capital requirements affect bank stability: retaining
mortgage risk on bank balance sheets, and bank profits. Even a small reduction in capital requirements
results in a large increase in the share of loans retained on the bank balance sheets. Reducing capital
requirements to 4.5% expands the balance sheet holdings of mortgages by 54% (~$360 billion
annually). Conversely, the primary consequence of increasing capital requirements is a large decline
in on-balance-sheet lending. As capital requirements increase to 9% and balance sheet financing
becomes significantly more expensive, the share of balance-sheet financed lending drops from 37%
to 14%, and banks’ balance sheet holdings of mortgages drop by 63%. In other words, capital
requirements operate primarily on the balance sheet retention margin. These large adjustments starkly
illustrate the importance of the bank balance sheet retention margin in responding to increases in
capital requirements. This risk is instead shifted to GSEs and indirectly to taxpayers, who insure these
mortgages. Offsetting somewhat the decrease in risk is also a decrease in expected bank profits, which
decline with tighter capital requirements.
V.B Secondary Market Interventions: Quantitative Easing
Instead of targeting banks, financial intermediation policies can target secondary markets for loans.
One set of such major policies during the last financial crisis was referred to as quantitative easing
(QE). The Federal Reserve intervened in the securitization market by purchasing large amounts of
GSE-guaranteed mortgages, hoping to decrease the rates at which GSEs purchased mortgages from
originators, and, in turn, easing access to mortgages. Estimates suggest mortgage rates declined



                                                  30
between 20–100 bps across different QE operations. 19 We model QE as a decrease in the GSE
financing costs, which was also the stated intent of the policy. To better understand the implications
of secondary market interventions, we also experiment with increasing GSE rates. Such an increase
could reflect the reversal of the QE policy or increase in the guarantee fees charged by the GSEs for
coverage of projected credit losses from defaults in the securitized pools. The results are shown in
Table 10 and Figure 11.
One can compare secondary market interventions with a relaxing of capital requirements, since QE
was used in part to encourage lending by banks who had experienced a contraction in capital. Our
results suggest that both policy interventions result in more mortgages, but impact different parts of
the market. Therefore, they have dramatically different distributional consequences across the income
spectrum and result in markedly different allocations of mortgage risk in the economy.
Mortgage Origination and Redistribution
Our counterfactuals suggest that the main effect of QE is to decrease conforming loan rates and
increase conforming mortgage lending volumes significantly: a 25 bp decrease in GSE rates leads to
an essentially one-to-one decrease in conforming loan rates and roughly $193 billion of new
conforming mortgage origination. Jumbo interest rates and volumes are largely unaffected. Aggregate
consumer surplus increases by roughly $35 billion, driven by both increased lending and lower
interest rates for existing borrowers.
An increase in GSE financing costs has a relatively smaller impact on interest rates and on lending
volumes because banks adjust on the balance sheet retention margin. A 25 bp increase in the cost of
a securitized conforming mortgage only leads to a 12 bp increase in conforming loan rates. As GSE
financing costs increase, banks make significant adjustments along the bank balance sheet retention
margin and substitute away from GSE financing and towards cheaper balance sheet financing. In this
scenario, conforming mortgage origination declines by only $88 billion, in comparison to the $193
billion increase caused by an equivalent GSE rate decrease. Jumbo origination volumes decrease
slightly because the increased conforming loan balance sheet financing crowds out jumbo lending
and increases jumbo origination costs slightly. Aggregate consumer surplus declines by roughly $17
billion, with individuals in higher-income markets seeing declines of roughly $8 billion, compared to
$1 billion in low-income markets.
This asymmetry in response to rate increases and decreases is more apparent in more extreme
scenarios. A 100 bp decline in GSE financing costs leads to roughly a 100 bp decline in conforming
interest rates. In contrast, a 100 bp increase in GSE financing costs leads to only a 33 bp increase in
conforming interest rates. This asymmetric response of interest rates again reflects the importance of
the bank balance sheet retention margin. As banks retain more loans on the balance sheet, the
sensitivity of mortgage interest rates to GSE rates decreases. Interestingly, absorbing these costs
through more balance sheet lending reduces banks’ ability to originate jumbo mortgages, leading to
slightly higher jumbo rates and slightly lower volumes. The implications for lending volumes and

19

                                                         31
consumer welfare are similarly asymmetric, with a 100 bp decrease leading to origination volume
increases of roughly $1,012 billion and consumer surplus gains of $169 billion, compared to
origination volume decreases of $249 billion and welfare losses of $51 billion for a 100 bp increase.
Unlike banks, shadow banks are very sensitive to changes in the securitization market: a 100 bp
increase in the GSE financing costs leads to a 13 percentage point decline in the overall shadow bank
market share and a 16 percentage point decline in the shadow bank share of conforming loans.
Shadow bank lending volume shrinks substantially by around 44%. Banks’ ability to shift to balance-
sheet conforming loans gives them a comparative advantage when GSE rates rise.
Bank Stability
In the baseline scenario, conforming loans comprise roughly 42 percent ($280 billion) of balance
sheet lending, but even a slight decline in GSE funding costs creates large enough incentives to move
these loans from bank balance sheets to be sold. In other words, banks respond to QE by shifting
conforming loans off the balance sheet along the balance sheet retention margin. This endogenous
shift explains why conforming interest rates are so sensitive in particular to decreases in GSE
financing costs: when GSE financing is cheaper, all conforming originations are GSE financed, and
so further changes to GSE rates are passed through roughly one-to-one to conforming loan rates. QE
also expands traditional bank profits, increasing them by $8 billion, or roughly 6% for a 25 basis
points decrease in GSE rates.
In contrast, banks are able to respond to increases in GSE financing costs by shifting originations
onto their balance sheets. In response to the 100 bp GSE cost increases, the balance sheet financing
share increases substantially, from 37% to 75%, which mutes the effect on rates and aggregate lending
volumes. Once GSE financing costs increase, the cheap on-balance sheet funding of banks gives them
a large comparative advantage and banks adjust on the balance sheet retention margin. Bank profits
are initially unaffected as GSE costs increase because lending volumes decrease overall, which is
offset by increases in more profitable balance sheet lending. However, for larger increases in GSE
costs, the latter effects dominate as borrowers substitute more and more towards loans financed on
bank balance sheets, and bank profits increase by a small amount.
This counterfactual illustrates how the effects of QE differ substantially from capital requirements.
Both increases to capital requirements and increases to GSE financing costs have the effect of
contracting mortgage origination. However, an increase in GSE financing cost leads to much larger
contraction of aggregate lending volume compared to the increases in capital requirements. This is
because an increase in the GSE financing costs directly affects the lending ability of both banks and
shadow banks and ends up contracting lending substantially. On the other hand, increases in the
capital requirements target only banks. As a result, shadow banks end up alleviating the adverse
effects of an increase in the capital requirements on aggregate lending volume by increasing their
lending though the migration margin.
V.C GSE Reform: Changes to Conforming Loan Limits
We next consider changing conforming loan limits, which has been actively debated in the context of
GSE policy reform (see Hurst et al. (2016)). This policy has been actively changed since the beginning

                                                 32
of the crisis, with the explicit purpose of intervening in the mortgage market. During the 2006–2016
period, conforming loans were generally limited to a $417,000 cap. As we illustrate in Figure 1, at
the beginning of the crisis the jumbo market experienced a contraction, which was particularly
relevant for high housing-cost markets. In order to increase lending in these areas, the Economic
Stimulus Act of 2008 temporarily increased the conforming loan limit in high-cost areas by as much
as $729,750. The policy of higher limits has persisted since then, although the limit for high-cost
areas was subsequently reduced to $625,000. 20 The limit is subject to an ongoing policy debate
regarding the potential downsizing of the GSE role by progressively lowering conforming loan
limits. 21 Moreover, because the policy caps loan amounts, its consequences differ substantially across
markets with different house prices and households with different mortgage demands. We experiment
with several scenarios and show the results in Table 11 and Figure 12.
Mortgage Origination and Redistribution
We first consider expanding GSE coverage by increasing the conforming loan limit by 25%. For most
markets, this means increasing it from $417,000 to roughly $520,000. This counterfactual highlights
the redistributive impact of expanding GSE coverage because of the changed market structure.
Increasing conforming loan limits leads to increases in overall and conforming volume, decreases in
jumbo volume, and increases in consumer welfare, especially in high house-price areas. Total
origination volumes increase by roughly $200 billion, with conforming origination volumes
increasing by roughly $310 billion and jumbo originations decreasing by roughly $110 billion. This
expansion of GSE coverage leads to increases in shadow bank market share by roughly 4 pp.
Consumer surplus increases by roughly $88 billion in the highest-income markets, while it increases
by only $11 billion in the lowest-income markets. Borrowers in high-income areas gain most, since
more loans at the ideal mortgage size are now conforming, which are cheaper and more convenient.
Finally, it is interesting to consider the two scenarios of unifying conforming loan limits across
counties, reverting to pre-crisis policies. Column 5 of Table 11 considers setting all limits to the
$417,000 lower limit; Column 6 considers setting all limits to the $625,000 higher limit. While
lowering the limit decreases lending volumes overall and raising the limit increases lending volumes
overall, these gains are not evenly distributed. Decreasing limits in all markets to $417,000 has
essentially no impact on low-income area consumer surplus, while it significantly reduces high-
income area consumer surplus, decreasing it by roughly $51 billion relative to the baseline scenario.
On the other hand, increasing limits across all markets to $625,000 significantly increases high-
income consumer surplus among both low- and high-income areas, with the majority of the welfare
gains accruing to high-income areas and high-income borrowers. Borrowers in high-income areas see
consumer welfare increase by $106 billion, while borrowers in low-income areas see consumer
welfare increase by only $17 billion.
Bank Stability


20
   Due to progressive increases in conforming loan limits from 2017 onwards, by 2019 the conforming loan limit reached
$484,350 in most markets and up to $726,525 in high-cost areas.
21
   See, for example: https://www.housingwire.com/articles/27344-affordability-concerns-surface-in-conforming-loan-
limit-debate [accessed October 2, 2018].

                                                         33
While changes to the conforming loan limit mechanically have a large impact on conforming loan
volumes, interestingly the impact on loan retention is less direct. Decreasing the conforming loan
limit by 25% raises the share of loans financed on balance sheet by 12 percentage points. This increase
is driven largely by increased jumbo lending as a share of overall lending, which increases by 12
percentage points. Increasing the conforming loan limit has a muted effect on the share of balance
sheet financing, which declines from 36% to 31%. While a substantially greater share of mortgage
originations is conforming, banks continue to retain a significant share of these originations on
balance sheet rather than selling them. They replace jumbo on-balance-sheet lending with conforming
on-balance-sheet lending. That is, banks’ response along the balance sheet retention margin is small
even though their ability to sell loans increases. Increasing conforming loan limits does impact the
distribution of profits between banks and shadow banks, with banks’ profits decreasing and those of
shadow banks’ increasing as the latter now originate and distribute to a larger segment of the market
where banks once dominated.
There is an interesting difference between the effects of lowering conforming loan limit (Table 11
and Figure 12) versus increasing capital requirements (Table 9 and Figure 10) on aggregate lending
volumes. Both polices decrease aggregate lending volumes. However, in the case of increased capital
requirements, both shadow bank migration and changes to bank balance sheet retention alleviate the
adverse effect of policy on the aggregate lending volume. In other words, in the case of tighter capital
requirements, solely focusing on bank balance sheet data would overstate the adverse effect of such
policy on overall lending volume. On the other hand, in the case of lowering the conforming loan
limit, the shadow banking sector amplifies the adverse impact on aggregate lending volume as this
policy also causes a contraction of shadow bank lending. 22
To summarize, the conforming loan limit has significant effects not only on overall lending volumes
and lender market shares, but especially on the distribution of welfare and profits in the mortgage
market. Extending conforming loan limits beyond their current level increases consumer surplus, but
these gains are primarily felt in the highest-income areas, as is the impact of the current policy of
having higher limits in high-cost MSAs. The consequences of this policy for the distribution of
mortgage risk in the economy are relatively limited, with banks retaining substantial amounts of
mortgages on their balance sheets.
V.D Summary from Counterfactuals.
Large Effect of Shadow Bank Migration Margin and the Balance Sheet Retention Margin
One overarching insight from the counterfactuals is that both adjustments on the shadow bank
migration margin and the balance sheet retention margin are critical to understanding policy
consequences. For example, we show that the tradeoff between bank stability and lending is much
less severe than anticipated by models, which focus only on balance sheet lending. Figure 13A
illustrates this visually by showing a change in the aggregate mortgage origination volume (in billions

22
  This observation may help explain why lowering the conforming loan limit has a much bigger adverse aggregate effect
on lending volume compared to raising capital requirements: an almost $200 billion reduction due to a decline of
conforming loan limit by 25% compared to about a $16 billion reduction in aggregate lending volume due to increasing
capital ratios by 25% (from 6% to 7.5%).

                                                         34
of dollars) across various bank capital ratio requirements (in percentages) relative to the baseline
scenario. Roughly, the difference between total bank lending response and on-balance sheet bank
lending response—indicated by the dashed arrow—captures the importance of the balance sheet
retention margin, while the difference between aggregate lending response, including shadow banks
and the total bank lending response—indicated by the solid arrow—captures the importance of the
shadow bank migration margin.
While higher capital requirements lead to a substantial decline in the bank balance sheet lending
volume, the overall decline in the bank lending volume is considerably smaller because banks expand
off-balance-sheet lending through loan sales. The shadow bank migration margin further moderates
the adverse impact of bank capital requirements aggregate lending. For example, our model predicts
that increasing bank capital requirements from current levels to 9% (Table 9 and Figure 10) reduces
bank balance sheet lending by two-thirds, but overall mortgage lending declines by only 2.5%. One
margin of adjustment that is important is the balance sheet retention margin: total bank lending
declines by only 9.5% as banks adjust their lending from retention to selling. Accounting for
migration to shadow banks fills another 7%, leaving the net decline to be just 2.5%.
It is clear from this example as well as other counterfactuals that a model of financial intermediation
must carefully account for both of these margins when evaluating policies. This insight extends well
beyond the U.S. market. For instance, the U.K. does not have a large and liquid secondary market for
mortgages. Therefore, the impact of financial regulation will differ substantially from the perspective
of consumers as well as bank stability. The current Basel regulatory framework proposes a uniform
treatment of capital requirements across countries. Our framework suggests that increasing capital
requirements in the U.K. would result in a substantially higher contraction in overall lending since
the bank retention margin in absent in the U.K. Thus, the consequences of imposing similar
regulations across countries could result in dramatically different responses depending on the market.
Policy Intervention Targeting: Banks or Secondary Markets?
The second general insight is that the adjustment depends on whether policy interventions target
traditional banks or secondary markets. The concrete examples we analyze are capital requirements
versus secondary market interventions such as the GSE premium (QE), conforming loan limits, or, as
in extensions below (Section V.E), having a jumbo securitization market. When tighter regulation
only targets traditional banks, as is the case with increased capital requirements, solely focusing on
bank balance sheets overstates the adverse effect of such polices on overall lending volume. The
adjustments on the shadow bank migration margin and the balance sheet retention margin work to
offset the adverse impact of tightening. For policies that tighten the secondary market, such as
increasing the GSE financing cost or lowering the conforming loan limit, the balance sheet retention
margin still offsets some of the adverse effect as shown in Figure 13B and 13C. The shadow bank
migration margin, however, exacerbates the effect by lending contracts for shadow banks, leading to
a large overall decline in lending. Ignoring the role of shadow banks can yield not only the wrong




                                                  35
magnitude of the aggregate effect, but also the wrong direction (see Figure 13B, which compares both
the bank-to-bank and shadow bank responses). 23
This insight has direct consequences for how empirical researchers approach measuring policy
consequences and modeling the intermediation sector. When financial regulations and policies
change, researchers typically use bank balance sheet data to measure the consequences. Our
counterfactuals suggest that drawing quantitative conclusions solely based on bank balance sheet data
can be extremely problematic, and difficult to debias without an explicit model of bank retention and
shadow bank migration margins.
Bank Stability and Income Redistribution
The third insight is that interventions to achieve bank stability differ in their redistributive
consequences. For example, increasing capital requirements achieves bank stability by decreasing on-
balance-sheet lending, i.e., reducing jumbo mortgages. Therefore, the cost of bank stability is mainly
borne by higher-income borrowers. An expansion of GSE funding increases the appeal of selling
loans, also shifting loans from bank balance sheets and increasing bank stability. It does so while
expanding lending and benefiting consumers across the income spectrum, but comes at the cost of
taxpayers subsidizing GSE lending.
V.E Model Extensions: Raising Equity, Asset Sales, and Jumbo Securitization
Our baseline model is already rich, accounting for equilibrium interactions between banks and
shadow banks across several markets, as well as allowing banks to adjust their business models on
the balance sheet retention margin. Nevertheless, we limit the model complexity to components which
are necessary to match the patterns in the data. In this section, we extend the model on several
dimensions. We allow banks to issue equity and sell existing assets so they can adjust their balance
sheet capacity endogenously. Second, we investigate whether our conclusions would change if a
securitization market for jumbo mortgages were to arise in the future.
Endogenous Balance Sheet Capacity: Bank Equity Issuance and Asset Sales

In the baseline model we assume that issuing loans on the balance sheet becomes increasingly more
expensive because banks have a fixed balance sheet capacity. We first extend the model to allow
banks to issue equity in order to finance their originations. If a bank wants to keep a mortgage on the
balance sheet at a fixed capital ratio, the cost of external funding is a fixed premium over GSE
financing costs. This approach nests banks choosing any desired debt-to-equity ratio: If a bank has
chosen a certain (arbitrary, not necessarily the current) debt-to-equity ratio, financing an additional
mortgage requires only the issuance of enough equity to keep the debt-to-equity ratio constant at the
same cost.



23
   Notably, the equilibrium response of the shadow bank sector is quite important in explaining the aggregate lending
response to various policies. For example, lowering the conforming loan limit by 25% results in $294 billion decline in
lending (Table 11 and Figure 13C). The contraction of lending by shadow banks ($207 billion), accounts for 70% of the
aggregate lending response.

                                                          36
Another way banks can obtain additional balance sheet capacity is to sell existing assets. Recall that
banks hold assets other than mortgages on its balance sheet. In the baseline model, the quantity of
these assets is fixed. Since adding mortgages on the balance sheet is increasingly more expensive, the
bank could choose to sell its assets and substitute these for mortgages. We assume these other assets
have a fixed opportunity cost (return). For ease of modeling, we assume that these assets yield a
premium over GSE-securitized mortgages that the bank could instead hold.
Intuitively, allowing banks to choose balance sheet capacity changes the model the following way.
When a bank is close to its capital requirement, balance sheet lending becomes very expensive. At
that point, banks have the option to finance new jumbo originations by raising external financing or
selling assets. The advantage of doing this, from the bank’s perspective, is that it does not raise the
financing costs on its inframarginal assets. Since equity issuance is more expensive than GSE
financing, banks will always finance conforming mortgages through GSE financing or existing
balance sheet equity, rather than through new equity issuance.
To understand the effect of endogenous balance sheet capacity, we study the impact of raising capital
requirements. We set the cost of issuing external funds and the opportunity cost of holding
nonmortgage assets at 25 bps above GSE funding. Note that this is not the cost of equity financing—
it is the cost of external financing holding leverage ratios fixed. The results are shown in Appendix
Table A1. As one would expect, endogenous balance sheet capacity mutes the effects of raising capital
requirements. Raising capital requirements to 9% decreases lending volumes by only $1 billion and
increases jumbo interest rates by 7 basis points. The effects on consumer welfare are also muted. The
large adjustment occurs on the share of loans that are financed through expanded balance sheet
capacity. With the baseline capital requirements of 6%, roughly 8% of loans are financed through
new balance sheet capacity. Increasing capital requirements to 9% increases this to 21%. As shown
in Figure A3, when capital requirements are 3% no jumbo loans are financed through new issuance;
with capital requirements at 9%, nearly all jumbo loans are financed with new capital.
Jumbo Mortgage Securitization Market

We conduct our policy analysis using the institutional environment from 2015: While conforming
mortgages can either be securitized or retained on the balance sheet, there is no securitization market
for jumbo mortgages. As our model suggests, if bank balance sheets become significantly impaired,
the premium on jumbo mortgages rises. If the effect is persistent, one might imagine that a
securitization market for jumbo mortgages would arise, as they did pre-financial crisis. We introduce
a securitization market for jumbo mortgages by allowing jumbo mortgages to be sold on a secondary
                                                                          𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔
market. Similar to how conforming securitization has a fixed cost 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 , we assume that jumbo
                                   𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗
securitization has a fixed cost 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡        .
The introduction of jumbo securitization has two effects. First, traditional banks now face a tradeoff
between financing jumbo mortgages on balance sheet versus financing jumbo mortgages through
securitization. When bank capital is closer to the capital requirement, on-balance sheet financing costs
for jumbo mortgages rise. When these costs are sufficiently high, banks choose to switch to external
financing through securitization. Second, the introduction of jumbo securitization allows shadow

                                                  37
banks to engage in jumbo loan origination. In other words, shadow banks now compete with
traditional banks also in the jumbo lending market.
To understand the effect of introducing jumbo securitization markets, we assume that jumbo
securitization would be 25 bps more expensive than conforming securitization, since it is not
supported by GSE. The results are shown in Appendix Table A2. The introduction of a jumbo
securitization market would change the equilibrium even at the baseline 6% capital requirement, with
a large market share migration towards shadow banks. Jumbo lending would increase by $46 billion,
which would be partially offset by a $32 billion decrease in conforming lending, as some conforming
borrowers substitute towards jumbo loans. Shadow banks’ origination would increase by $42 billion,
$28 billion of which would come at the expense of traditional banks. Shadow banks market share of
jumbo loan originations would jump 14%. This market increases consumer welfare by $92 billion,
with $54 billion of these gains falling to the highest-income markets, while only $5 billion of these
gains accrue to the lowest-income markets.
After the introduction of jumbo securitization markets, changes to capital requirements have muted
effects on overall lending volumes and welfare. In other words, the tradeoff between bank stability
and mortgage origination becomes even less severe than our baseline model would suggest. This is
because the bank balance sheet retention margin and the shadow bank migration margin now apply
to jumbo loans in addition to conforming loans.
Increasing capital requirements to 9% decreases lending volumes by only $5 billion, in comparison
to the decrease of $54 billion when there are no jumbo securitization markets. Without jumbo
securitization markets, increasing capital requirements increases jumbo origination costs because
these mortgages must be retained on balance sheet. With jumbo securitization, in contrast, as higher
capital requirements increase balance sheet lending costs, banks can adjust on the retention margin.
Figure A4 illustrates these dynamics. Panel A shows that while origination volume falls slightly as
capital requirements are raised, the effects of higher capital requirements are much smaller. Panel B
shows that there is a large margin of adjustment along the share of jumbo mortgages that are
securitized. With the baseline 6% capital requirement, roughly 50% of jumbo originations are
securitized. With a 9% capital requirement, nearly all jumbo loans are financed through securitization.
Additionally, shadow banks can now originate jumbo mortgages, and so the shadow bank migration
margin functions in all segments of the market.
These extensions suggest that the importance of the shadow bank migration margin and the balance
sheet retention margin play an important role when it comes to policy. The existence of securitization
markets—conforming, jumbo, or both—gives lenders considerable flexibility in mortgage financing.
Analyses that overlook this and focus on, for example, only bank balance sheet lending, miss
significant economic forces and lead to misleading policy analyses.
Effects Due to House Price Changes
In our counterfactuals, we abstract away from general equilibrium effects on house prices due to
tractability. It is possible that by changing access to credit, house prices will endogenously change
(Palmer 2015). While important to consider, we argue that the feedback effects onto house prices are

                                                  38
likely to be small in the majority of our counterfactuals. First, in the case of capital requirements, we
find that the overall impact on lending volumes is small due to the shadow bank migration and balance
sheet retention channels. Because the effect on the overall amount of credit is small, house price
responses are likely to be small. Quantitatively, Adelino et al. (2013) study changes to the conforming
loan limit and find that houses constrained by the conforming loan limit see prices declines of only
0.5%. In our model, house prices feed back into desired loan size. Our estimates predict that a 0.5%
reduction in house prices is associated with roughly a 0.2%, or $400, decrease in desired loan size on
average. This is a small decrease relative to the average desired loan size of $220,000, as well as the
large variation in estimated desired loan size across markets and borrowers. Finally, in the case of
unconventional monetary policy, credit expansion in GSE lending would tend to increase house
prices, thereby acting to mute the overall impact of the counterfactual policy. This would not,
however, impact our broader point concerning how lending growth is allocated among bank balance
sheets, bank securitization, and shadow banks.
Section VI: Related Literature and Conclusion
VI.A Related Literature
The increased amount of bank-like activity taking place outside the traditional banking system has
attracted increased attention. Buchak et al. (2018) analyze the recent dramatic growth of shadow
banks and fintech lenders in the residential mortgage market and find that the regulatory burden faced
by traditional banks and growth of financial technology can account for a large part of the recent
shadow bank growth. Fuster et al. (2018) provide complementary evidence that suggests fintech
lenders adjust supply more elastically than other lenders in response to exogenous mortgage demand
shocks, thereby alleviating capacity constraints associated with traditional mortgage lending. Kim et
al. (2018) discuss potential liquidity risks faced by shadow bank lenders. Irani et al. (2018) focus on
corporate loans and study the role of bank capital regulation in the growth of shadow banks. Our
paper focuses on the limits of shadow banks, which arise from their lack of balance sheet capacity,
and points out that banks’ ability to adjust their business models to balance sheet capacity shocks
makes them similar to shadow banks. We explore the consequences of these two features on the
structure of the mortgage market both in segments where originate-to-distribute is common and in
segments where it is less common. In addition, our structural model allows us to assess the role of
capital requirements, government credit subsidies, and unconventional monetary policy on the overall
distribution of mortgage credit across borrowers, as well as on bank stability.
Our paper is also related to a growing literature that uses structural models to study industrial
organization in the context of consumer finance. Egan, Hortaçsu, and Matvos (2017), for example,
study banking competition and financial fragility through the context of a structural model of demand
for bank deposits, and Egan, Lewellen, and Sunderam (2017) structurally decompose the sources of
bank value. 24 Similarly, Aguirregabiria, Clark, and Wang (2019) structurally estimate the economies
of scope between bank deposits and loans. Buchak et al. (2018) use a structural framework to analyze

market and uses it to measure the overall gains in consumer surplus from risk-based pricing.

the drivers of the recent growth of shadow bank and fintech lenders in the U.S. mortgage market.
Corbae and D'Erasmo (2019) build a structural model of bank entry and exit to study the impact of
capital and liquidity regulations, focusing on bank size and market structure. Allen, Clark, and Houde
(2019) structurally estimate the role of search and brand loyalty in the Canadian mortgage market.
Benetton (2019), the closest paper to ours, uses a structural framework to analyze the impact of bank
capital regulation on the U.K. residential mortgage market. Similar to this papers, our demand model
follows models like Berry et al. (1995) and Nevo (2000) and applies these modeling techniques to
answer regulatory and policy questions in finance. We depart from discrete-choice demand models
in several ways. Our model, as well as Benetton (2019), extends the discrete-choice model to include
continuous choice, although using different modeling techniques. Continuous choice of mortgage size
is critical in a market segmented on size. We also depart from the standard identification of demand
models by introducing the microeconometric bunching estimation into a structural demand model.
The critical modeling departure from the existing literature is on the supply side of financial
intermediation. As in Buchak et al. (2018) we model competition between banks and shadow banks.
Most structural models of financial intermediation assume balance sheet lending. We strongly depart
from this view and allow banks to choose whether to originate on balance sheet or originate to
distribute—i.e., the balance sheet adjustment margin. As we emphasize in the paper, modeling this
feature critically changes insights from important policy counterfactuals.
Our paper is related to studies that have examined the changing nature of mortgage origination in the
United States. The wake of the financial crisis saw increased interest in the functioning of the
originate-to-distribute model and its impact on the recent housing crisis. In particular, papers have
focused on the originate-to-distribute model and its costs and benefits. See, for example, Mian and
Sufi (2009), Keys et al. (2010) and Purnanandam (2011). We contribute to this literature on several
dimensions. We model banks’ choice of OTD origination in a structural model and examine the
equilibrium choice of OTD and balance sheet lending.
Our paper is also related to the literature on GSEs. Many papers, e.g., Acharya et al. (2011), Bhutta
(2012), Hurst et al. (2016), and Elenev et al. (2016), have studied how successful GSEs have been in
effecting these goals, and have found mixed results. We focus particularly on the role of GSE
financing and its interaction with recent regulatory and bank capital changes in explaining the growth
of shadow banks. We study how market segmentation arises out of a GSE-financed market interacting
with bank balance sheet capacity and bank capital regulation, and how it affects overall origination
volume, distribution of credit across borrowers, and relative pricing of products.
Our paper also connects to a large literature that examines the impact of government regulations and
various policy interventions on banking and credit markets adopted during and after the financial
crisis. See, for example, Mayer et al. (2014); Agarwal et al. (2014, 2015, 2017); Auclert et al. (2019);
Lucca et. al. (2014); Piskorski et al. (2015); Egan, Hortaçsu, and Matvos (2017); Granja and Leuz
(2017); Di Maggio et al. (2017, 2019) and Scharfstein and Sunderam (2017). Our paper focuses
instead on the growth of shadow banks and their interplay with traditional banks after the crisis.



                                                  40
Our paper is also connected to recent quantitative equilibrium models of mortgage and housing
markets with heterogonous agents (e.g., Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2017);
Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante (2016); Greenwald, Landvoigt, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2018); Guren,
Krishnamurthy, and McQuade (2018); and Wong (2018)). Such models can provide many valuable
insights, including the quantitative assessment of various effects. Unlike these papers that use
computational tools developed in the quantitative macroeconomics literature, we follow the structural
industrial organization literature. The advantage of macroeconomic models is that they capture
general equilibrium effects, which are absent from our model. On the other hand, we build a credit
market framework with supply and demand functions that can be directly estimated using microdata.
Moreover, we allow for substantially richer heterogeneity across consumers which can be directly
linked to microdata. This rich heterogeneity allows us to speak to the distribution consequences of
different policies. On the supply side our approach allows for rich strategic choices of banks and
shadow banks, as well as their strategic interactions in the market.
Finally, our paper is related to recent work focusing on various forms of bank-like activities taking
place outside the traditional banking system and studying the implications of such shifts (e.g.,
Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny (2013); Adrian and Ashcraft (2016); Moreira and Savov (2017);
Ordonez (2018); and Begenau and Landvoigt (2018)). Among this recent work, Koijen and Yogo
(2016) analyze the implications of the reinsurance market, which allows regulated insurance
companies to move some of their liabilities to shadow reinsurers. Drechsler et al. (2017) and Xiao
(2018) show that when the federal funds rate rises, banks widen the spreads they charge on deposits
and deposits flow out of the banking system towards the uninsured shadow banking sector, thereby
affecting the transmission of monetary policy. Unlike these papers, which focus on the consequences
of deposits flowing between the traditional and shadow banks, we study the consequences of capital
requirements, conforming credit limits, and unconventional monetary policy that operate
independently from the deposit channel. In doing so, we study the impact of equilibrium interaction
of shadow banks with traditional banks on quantity, price, and allocation of mortgage credit, as well
as on bank stability.
VI.B Conclusion
Our findings have a number of implications. First, policy analysis of financial intermediation
critically requires simultaneously analyzing the impact of the policy on both banks and shadow banks,
and accounting for their equilibrium interaction. Any regulation that affects a part of the
intermediation market spills over to other markets through competition, and affects which products
are offered by which firms and which part of the household income distribution is impacted, as well
as equilibrium prices. This observation does not only apply to the residential mortgage market—the
focus our study—but to any credit market with a large presence or possible entry of shadow banks
with off-balance-sheet lending options. Policy analysis has been moving in this direction somewhat
(e.g., the Minneapolis Plan). Unlike these current approaches, we develop one based on a
comprehensive model which accounts for the industrial organization of financial intermediation, as
well as the changing business models of banks. This framework serves as a starting point for even
richer policy analysis.

                                                 41
Second, our paper highlights that the line between traditional and shadow banks from a functional
perspective is not clearly demarcated. Well-capitalized banks indeed behave as traditional models of
banking suggest: they take deposits and use them to make loans, which they hold to maturity. Poorly
capitalized banks, on the other hand, do not have balance sheet capacity and behave like shadow
banks, originating loans and selling them off. The ability to do so allows these banks to originate
loans despite depressed capital, offsetting some of the effects of capital tightening. Thus, without
considering banks’ responses on the balance sheet retention margin—deciding to sell instead of
retaining loans on the balance sheet—traditional policy tools, including capital ratios and other bank
capital regulatory requirements, may have limited effectiveness. On the other hand, disruptions in
secondary loan markets have significant impacts on aggregate lending volume and pricing as they
adversely affect the ability to lend for both shadow banks and poorly capitalized traditional banks.
More broadly, we suggest taking a broad view of government insurance subsidies and regulation in
order to understand their impacts on the financial intermediation system. On one hand, traditional
banks exploit cheap insured deposit financing. On the other hand, shadow banks and poorly
capitalized banks predominantly rely on GSE mortgage guarantees. Our results suggest that as
subsidies for banks in one sector decline, for example because of restrictive capital requirements, they
tilt their activity toward other sources of taxpayer financed subsidies. Understanding the web of
subsidies and regulations that pervade the financial system, their equilibrium interactions, and their
impact on systematic risk and welfare remains a fruitful area for future research.

        Table 2: Financing on Balance Sheet and Originator Type (Bank vs. Shadow Bank) around the Conforming Loan Limit
This table assesses the discontinuity of financing on balance sheet and originator type around the conforming loan limit for all (bank and shadow bank) originations. Panel
A considers balance sheet lending versus outside financing. The left-hand side variable is an indicator for whether the loan is retained on the balance sheet or sold. Panel
B considers bank originators versus shadow bank originators. The left-hand side variable is an indicator for whether the originator is a traditional bank. In both panels,
Jumbo is an indicator for whether the loan size is above the conforming loan limit in the time-county of origination rendering it ineligible for securitization through GSEs.
In both panels, columns (1)-(4) use years 2007-2015 , while (5)-(8) use 2015 originations only. Columns (1)-(4) and (5)-(8) consider discontinuity bandwidths from +/-
1%, 5%, 10%, and 25% around the conforming loan limit. Controls include log loan amount, log applicant income, dummy variables for applicant race, ethnicity, sex,

              Table 3: Financing on Balance Sheet and Capitalization of Traditional Banks around Conforming Loan Limit
This table assesses the discontinuity of financing on balance sheet and capitalization of traditional banks around the conforming loan limit for only traditional bank
originations, with shadow bank originations excluded. Panel A considers balance sheet lending versus outside financing. The left-hand side variable is an indicator for
whether the loan is retained on balance sheet or sold. Panel B considers well versus poorly capitalized banks. The left-hand side variable is an indicator for whether the
originator is well-capitalized. Banks are defined as well capitalized based if they are in the top quartile of capitalization for the given year. In both panels, Jumbo is an
indicator for whether the loan size is above the conforming loan limit in the time-county of origination rending it ineligible for securitization through GSEs. In both panels,
columns (1)-(4) use years 2007-2015; (5)-(8) use 2015 originations only. Columns (1)-(4) and (5)-(8) consider discontinuity widths from +/-1%, 5%, 10%, and 25%
around the conforming loan limit. Controls include log loan amount, log applicant income, dummy variables for applicant race, ethnicity, sex, loan type, loan purpose,
occupancy, and property type, and census tract-year fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the lender-year level.

This table assesses the relationship of bank capitalization and financing of loans on the balance sheet and how it varies with product mix. The regression is at the lender-
year level among traditional banks. For columns (1) and (2), the left-hand side variable is percent of all originated loans not sold within the calendar year. For columns
(3) and (4), the left-hand side variable is the percent of originated loans that are jumbo (non-conforming). For (5) and (6) the left-hand side variable is percent of conforming
originations not sold within the calendar year. Capital ratio is the bank’s statutory capital ratio (in percentage). Log(Originations) is the (log) total number of originations
for the lender in the given year. Log(Unique CTs) is the (log) number of unique census tracts in which the bank originates mortgages, a measure of geographical spread.
Log(Average Loan Income) and Log(Average Loan Size) are the (log) average borrower income and loan size for the loans the banks originates in the year. Log(Bank
Assets) is the (log) total bank assets. Deposits / Total Liabilities is the percentage of the bank’s liabilities that are deposits. All columns have year fixed effects. Columns
(2), (4), (6), and (8) additionally have lender fixed effects. Data are from HMDA and the Federal Reserve call reports and run from 2008 to 2015. Standard errors are in
parentheses.

consumer’s price sensitivity, i.e., how much her utility decreases from a 1% higher interest rate. 𝛽𝛽 is the consumer’s disutility from obtaining a smaller loan. 𝛾𝛾 is the
consumer’s utility from obtaining a conforming loan rather than a jumbo loan, regardless of loan size. A detailed description of the economic meaning of these parameters
and how they are estimated can be found in Sections IV.A and IV.C.1, respectively.

This table studies the response of jumbo market share, conforming loan bunching, and bank market share to changes in conforming loan limits at the year-county level.
Limit Increase is the percentage increase in the conforming loan limit in a county between 2007 and year t, which runs to 2015. Column (1) regresses jumbo share on this
increase. The left-hand side is the county-year level jumbo loan market share in percentage terms. Column (2) regresses the bunched market share of borrowers around
the conforming loan cutoff on this increase within a 5% loan-size bandwidth. The left-hand side variable is the county-year level market share of loans falling within
0.10% of the conforming loan limit in percentage terms. Column (3) is the reduced form of bank market share on the limit increase. Column (4) is the OLS of bank share
on jumbo origination share. The left-hand side variable in columns (3) and (4) is the county-year level bank market share in percentage terms. All columns include year
and county fixed effects. Standard errors are in parentheses.

This table shows the estimated supply parameters. Panels A and B show financing costs and non-financing costs, respectively. Panel C shows the non-linear parameters
that determine the financing cost. Financing costs represent financing costs that any lender must pay, regardless of whether it is financed though GSE financing or on
balance sheet. Non-financing costs represent differences in origination or labor costs not coming from financing. Non-linear financing costs reflect the tradeoff a bank
faces when deciding whether to finance on balance sheet or through GSE financing. A detailed description of the economic meaning of these parameters and how they are
identified can be found in Section IV.B and IV.C.2, respectively

This table shows the estimated bank regulatory burden and fintech quality parameters. The regulatory burden reported here is defined as 1/ζ, where ζ is the scaling factor
on the probability of lending to a specific borrower as discussed in Section IV.B.2. A higher bank regulatory burden parameter captures relatively constrained traditional
banks; a lower burden captures relatively constrained traditional banks. An increase in the fintech quality parameter indicates an increase in the perceived quality of
services offered by shadow bank fintech lenders relative to other lenders. Fintech quality is relative to non-fintech shadow bank originations of the same type (new
origination or refinance).

Panel A shows jumbo origination share (in %) of all conventional (non-FHA/VA/RHS) mortgages by dollars originated. Conforming loans are defined as “conventional”
(non-FHA) in HMDA with loan amounts below the conforming loan limit. Panel B shows aggregate mortgage origination volumes in billions of dollars by conforming
and jumbo mortgages. Panel C shows the conforming-jumbo interest rate spread (based on BlackKnight data). A negative spread means jumbo loans have higher rates.
Panel D shows bank capital ratios over time. The solid line is the (simple) average across all banks; the dashed line is weighted by mortgage originations. Data are from
HMDA, BlackKnight, and call reports.

Panel A shows a binned scatterplot of log numbers of jumbo originations versus bank capitalization above the statutory limit. Panel B shows a binned scatterplot of jumbo
share of own bank originations versus bank capitalization above the statutory limit. Data, from HMDA and call reports, run from 2008 through 2015 and are at the bank-
year level. Observations are grouped into 50 equal sized (in terms of observations) bins, and log jumbo originations (Panel A) or jumbo origination share (Panel B) are
then averaged within bin. The blue line is the result of a linear fit, with gray bands showing 95% confidence intervals.

Panel A shows bank market share (by dollars originated) in the confirming (black) and jumbo (grey) markets. Panel B shows jumbo lending share (by dollars originated)
among banks (solid) and shadow banks (dotted). That is, Panel B shows what percentage of lender originations are jumbo (non-conforming) among banks and shadow
banks. Conforming loans are defined as “conventional” (non-FHA) in HMDA with loan amounts below the conforming loan limit. Data are from HMDA with lender
classifications based on Buchak et al. (2018).

                      Figure 4: Balance Sheet Financing and Bank Lending around the Conforming Loan Limit Cutoffs

Panel A shows the percentage of mortgage originations retained on balance sheet by the loan amount divided by the conforming loan limit in the county-year of origination.
The cutoff is at 100%, shown by a dotted vertical line. Panel B shows the percentage of originations that are done by banks around the conforming loan limit. Panel C
shows the percentage of bank originations done by well-capitalized banks, where a bank is well-capitalized if it is in the top quartile of capitalization for the year of
origination. Loan sizes are binned as a proportion of the conforming loan limit in 0.05 buckets, i.e., 0.91-0.95, 0.96-1.00, 1.01-1.05, and so on. In Panel A, a mortgage is
retained on balance sheet if it is not sold in the calendar year or sold to an affiliate. Each panel uses HMDA data between 2007 and 2015 and call reports to determine
bank capitalization. Panels A and B use all originations; Panel C uses traditional bank originations only.

Figure 5 shows binned scatterplots (25 equal-sized bins based on bank-year observations) of bank percent of loans retained on balance sheet versus bank capital ratios.
All bins are residualized using the controls detailed in Table 4. “Within” panels remove bank fixed effects. Panel A shows the results in levels and corresponds to Column
(1) in Table 4 and Panel B show the results in changes and corresponds to Column (2) of Table 4. The size of each point represent the total number of originations falling
within each bin. Data are from HMDA and bank call reports, for years between 2008 and 2015.

Panel A shows a change in the aggregate mortgage origination volume (in $ billions) across various bank capital ratio requirements (in %) relative to the baseline scenario
(6% requirement). The dotted line shows the changes in the aggregate amount of bank balance sheet lending [Bank (BS)]. The grey line shows the overall change in the
aggregate mortgage origination volume among bank lenders that includes both balance sheet lending and securitized loans [Bank (BS+Sold)]. The solid black line shows
the overall change in the aggregate amount of lending accounting for both bank and shadow bank response [Bank (BS+Sold)+Shadow Bank]. The dashed arrow represents
the balance sheet retention margin, and the solid arrow represents the shadow bank migration margin. Panel B shows the corresponding changes in loan origination volume
across various changes to the GSE financing costs relative to the baseline (in basis points), while Panel C shows the changes in loan origination volume across various
changes in the conforming loan limit relative to the baseline (in %). The baseline aggregate origination volume equals $1,763 billion.

Panel A shows aggregate mortgage origination volume (in $ billions) across various bank capital ratio requirements (in %). Panel B shows the composition of aggregate
lending (in $ billions) split by the shadow bank conforming lending volume (black line), bank conforming lending volume (grey line), jumbos financed with existing
equity (dashed), and jumbos financed with new equity (dotted) versus various bank capital ratio requirements. Panel C shows the percentage of loans that are retained on
banks’ balance sheets across various capital requirements. In all cases, equity can be issued at a 25bp spread over conforming securitization costs.
