                Hidden Stimuli to Capital Formation:
                       Debt and the Incomplete
                   Adjustment of Financial Returns


                                ABSTRACT




There is a common belief that the disappointing economic performance in

the 1970s can be attributed in good part to the interaction of tax rules,

inflation, and capital formation. In this paper, we reassess the

relationships between inflation, the tax code, and investment incentives

because previous results are based on a number of tenuous assumptions

whose impact has not been   fully   appreciated. We also question the

appropriateness of the conventional user cost formulation, and derive an

alternative measure taking explicit account of the role of debt ——

acquisition,   retirement, and net—of—tax interest payments — and    the
equityholders' ownership of the firm. Our     numerical   results show that

previously reported disincentives for acquiring capital goods in general

and against longer—lived capital in particular are attenuated, and in a

number of cases reversed, under various sets of assumptions. Differences

in results stemming from the conventional and modified user costs are

highlighted, and are illustrated by a comparison of the U.S. Treasury's

tax reform proposals under the two formulations.

                    Hidden Stimuli to Capital Formation:
          Debt and the Incomplete Adjustment of Financial Returns


      Did the high inflation of the l9TOs depress incentives for

businesses to invest in plant and equipment? This question has been

investigated in a number of studies utilizing variants of the conventional

neoclassical user cost of capital, and a general conclusion emerging from

this work, shared by policyinakers (White House, 1981), is that the inter-

action of inflation with the existing tax code has reduced firms' incen-

tives to acquire capital (Feldstein, 1982, 1983, Kopcke, 1981). Inflation

affects investment decisions by causing variations in the value of tax

depreciation deductions, the firm's discount rate, and the cost of debt

(as we shall see, the latter two channels are not always identical)..i' In

this paper, we reassess the relationship between inflation and investment

incentives because previous results are based on a number of tenuous

assumptions whose impact has not been fully appreciated. These include

the adjustment of financial returns to inflation, the appropriateness of

the capital structure invariance assumption, and the role of personal

taxes. Calculations with a range of relevant parameters indicate that

previously reported disincentives for acquiring capital goods are

attenuated, and in a number of cases reversed, under various

configurations of these key assumptions. Our simulations highlight that

in an inflationary environment, incentives for acquiring longer—lived

capital are depressed relatively more than those for shorter—lived assets

only under a rather restrictive set of assumptions. Furthermore, we show

that the results are extremely sensitive to the exact values of underlying

parameters, which are unlikely to be known with any accuracy.

         In   conventional definitions of the user cost (Hall and Jorgenson,

1967)., the firm's discount rate is defined by the opportunity cost of

funds, a weighted average of the costs of equity and debt (including tax

considerations) with weights depending on the leverage ratio. Brock and

Turnovsky      (1981) have shown recently   that such a definition is appropriate

when the firm maximizes with respect to the joint interests of bondholders

and equityholders. However, in general, the interests of these agents

with financial clainis on the firm's capital may be in conflict. An alter-

native approach pursued in this paper is to assume that        the   firm   maximizes
with   respect to the interest of equityholders .and to view bondholders as

supplying a factor of production (debt) for which they are compensated

(interest plus principal). Our modified neoclassical model, derived

rigorously in Section II, gives explicit attention to the acquisition and

retirement of debt and to net—of—tax interest payments, and discounts the

firm's   cash flows by the net—of—tax return required by equityholders.
Under some assumptions, the conventional and modified definitions are
identical but, when they diverge, their implications for investment
incentives      can differsharply. This divergence is illustrated in section

IV by an examination of the implications of the U.S. Treasury's tax reform

proposals (U. S. Treasury-, 198)4) under the conventional and modified user

cost expressions. Section V concludes.


II.    The User Cost of Capital
        In    this   section, we derive a modified expression for the user cost
of capital giving explicit attention to the ownership of the firm and to
the role of debt, and contrast our formulation with the conventional
                                                           —3—



specification. The representative firm operates in the sole interest of

its existing shareholders, and is assumed to maximize the present

discounted value of its cash flow over an infinite horizon. The present

discounted cash flow (v(o)) in period 0 of an untaxed and unlevered

firm is

                                            t

                  —   w(t)    L(t) —            q(t)       1(t)) dt,



where p(s , it)       is the equityholders' nominal discount rate, which may be

related to the inflation rate                     (it). -?i The production function

(F(.)) depends on labor (L(t)) and capital (K(t)), and is assumed

strictly concave and twice continuously differentiable. The firm operates

in perfectly competitive markets, and faces exogenous prices for output

(p(t)), labor (w(t)), and new capital (q(t)). To relate current invest-

ment (1(t)) to the existing stock of capital, we assume that capital

depreciates at an exponential rate (a) and hence is governed by the

following differential equation,


(2)       i(t) =      1(t)    —   oK(t).

      The cash flow potentially available to shareholders is affected by

an income tax, a tax credit, and depreciation allowances on investment

expenditures. An income tax is assessed at rate (t) against the

firm's revenues less labor costs, and is reduced by a tax credit (k(t))

extended on the purchases of investment goods. The effective price of
                                                 —J4—




capital goods is further lowered by depreciation allowances granted

against taxes and based on both current and past investments,


                                   t

where    D(t —   s,   s, L) are tax depreciation allowances per dollar of

investment made t — s         periods ago according to the tax code in effect in

period s for an asset with life L. Equation (3) can be rearranged to

isolate those factors that depend on current decisions and those that are

predetermined at time T (Ha3rashi, 1982),


(la)        TD(t) =    z(t,   p(t, it), L) q(t)                   1(t)   + A(t, 0, L),

                                                                                   C

The expression for z(t, p(t, it), L) represents the present discounted

value of current and future tax depreciation allowances flowing from a

dollar of investment in period t,-i and (ltc) is the total value of tax

depreciation allowances claimed at time t on capital assets purchased

before time 0.

        Debt finance is introduced into the rxde1 by augmenting the firm's

cash flow problem with the acquisition and retirement of debt and net—

of—tax interest payments. A firm that finances a proportion (b(t)) of

its investment with debt will have its cash flow incremented by
                                                             —5—




(5)             (1 —           k(t)   —   z(t))      b(t) q(t) 1(t),


where the capital outlay (qt) 1(t)) is lowered by the tax credit

(k(t)) and tax depreciation allowances (z(t)). We assume that debt is

retired at an exponential rate (y). In period t, the cash flow

devoted to retirements is the amount of debt issued at time s,

((1 —    k(s)      —       z(s))   b(s) q(s) I(s)), multiplied by the "survival" factor

    (exp —   y(t               s)) and the retirement rate (y), and summed from time

t     backward is,

                           t
(6)                    f        (1 — k(s) — z(s)) b(s) q(s) I(s) y exp(—y(t — s))                 is.




Interest payments at time t are the product of the amount                                  of   debt

issued at time s surviving at time t and the interest rate (i(s, ))

prevailing at time s, summed from time t backward, and multiplied by

one less the tax rate at time t (reflecting the tax deductability of

nominal interest payments),


                                              t

         Following our treatment of tax depreciation allowances (n), we

isolate those debt—related factors that depend on current decisions and

those that are predetermined at time t. Summing (6) and (7) yields the

net cost of current and past investment:

Equation (8b) is the purchase price of a unit of new capital less tax

credits and deductions and the financial advantage of utilizing b

percent of debt for the marginal investment. The latter effect is

represented by the term in braces ,_±i and vanishes in the case of an all

equity firm (b(t) =              0).    Of the terms in braces, the minus one repre-

sents the benefit of issuing one dollar of debt and is balanced by the

costs per dollar: the net—of—tax interest and retirement payments both

discounted by (p(t,                    ÷ y). This term represents the "gain from

leverage" (c.f., Miller, 1971) accruing to the firm on its marginal

debt. If financial policy eliminates arbitrage profits between the net—

of—tax cost of borrowing and the firm's discount rate, then the term in

braces becomes zero, and the potential advantage to shareholders of

debt—financing, resulting from the tax deductability of the firm's

interest payments, would be eliminated.

         Equation (Sc) represents net—of—tax interest and debt retirement

payments at time t on debt acquired at time s surviving at time t

(X(s, t)). When integrated from zero to infinity and discounted by
                                                    —1—




p(t,   it),   B(t, 0)    is the market value of the firm's debt. This result

holds' for any time       path-s of the variables, but becomes readily apparent
when we assume i(t, it), (t), and p(t,                                are constant over time,

in which case, the market (MV(0)) and face (Fv(o)) values of debt at

time t   are:

(9a)           Mv(o) =   [((1    —         i(n) + y)/(p(it) + y)l        Fv(o),
                          0
(9b)           FV(0) =   f     (1   —   k(s)   —   z(s))   b(s) q(s) I(s) exp(ys) ds.



If interest rates adjust fully to eliminate arbitrage opportunities,

then   the term    in   braces in (9a) becomes unity, and the                face and market

values of debt are           identical.

       We recognize that            distributions          to existing shareholders are taxed
at the personal level, and               the net—of—corporate         tax cash flow for the
firm   described    in the above equations                 must   be multiplied by one less the
rate   of taxation on equity (ve)• Lastly, we assume that                         all prices
grow at a constant and fully anticipated exponential rate,                          it.



Combining these assumptions with (1), (2), (1), and (8), we obtain the

       By contrast, the conventional user cost of capital (Hall and

Jorgenson, 1967; Brock and Turnovsky, 1981) can be written as



(12)       C(it) =                                     + o —          )(i    —   k —      Z(pck)           L)),
                                        —9—



where the discount rate p(i) is a weighted—average of the costs of

debt and eq.uity,.L'



(13)         p(t) = b(1 —   t)   i(it) + (1 —   b) p().


Under any of the following conditions, the dified (ii) and

conventional (12, 13) user cost expressions are equal:


(iii) — no leverage (b =     0),
       —   the
                                                          ) i);

           the costs of debt and equity (p = (1 —
       — an equality between the rate of capital depreciation and the
         effective real retirement rate of debt (a = y +      and an
         equality between the value of depreciation allowances
         (z(p(t)) =    z(p(i))). J
When any of these conditions hold, the impact of inflation on investment

incentives is the same under either user cost expression. In particular,

the elimination of arbitrage opportunities implies that b does not

enter either user cost formula; hence the firm's investment decisions

and rket value are invariant with respect to its capital structure.2J

In the absence of (14), the choice of the user cost forila becomes

important and the responses of investment incentives to inflation can

diverage sharply.

III.   The Response of Investment Incentives to Inflation

       In this section, we examine four inflation—related factors that

can impact investment incentives. First, since depreciation allowances

are based on historical costs, increases in inflation lead to a decline

in the present value of these deductions (z). Second, the costs of

debt and equity may not adjust completely to inflation, thus reducing

financing costs to the firm. These two effects will exist independently

of the assumption concerning financial arbitrage and, in sub—section A,

will be analyzed under the assumption of capital structure invariance.

If   capital structure invariance does not hold, then a third effect
arises due to debt finance, and will need to   be evaluated under both

user costs. Fourth, defining the equityholders' discount rate (p) net

of personal taxes can affect the impact of inflation on investment

incentives. The latter effects are assessed in sub—section B, given

responses of nominal debt and equity returns to inflation that are

roughly consistent with the data. The sensitivity of our calculations

to variations in underlying parameters is examined in sub—section C.


       A. Capital Structure Invariance

       With   the elimination of arbitrage opportunities between the costs
of debt and equity, we have the following equality,

(15)          (1 — 'r
                    C
                        )   i()   =


To perform the calculations, we need to specify the response of either

nominal interest or shareholders' discount rates to inflation. We

choose to focus on the former because it is relatively easy to measure
                                        —11.-




and has been studied extensively. If the real cost of debt to the firm

is t remain constant, the i(n) must rise by (1/(1 —             , the
modified Fisher effect highlighted by Darby (1975) and Feldstein (1976)

and implied by the model of Miller (i977)..!P_' The impact on investment

incentives is reported in the upper panel of table I, and these figures

represent the percentage changes in investment incentives at inflation

rates of 3, 6, and 9 percent compared to the no—inflation case.i2J Were

the production function to have a constant elasticity of substitution of

unity, these numbers would correspond exactly to the percentage change

in the optimal capital stock. Hence a positive entry would correspond

to an optimal capital stock larger than that at zero inflation. For a

production function with less than unit elasticity, the change in the

optimal   capital stock would   be   smaller than the   numbers in the table but

of   the sax   sign. Un&er capital structure invariance, the results are

independent of leverage, and are presented for asset lives of 5, 10, 20,

and 30 years..W It is apparent that investment incentives are reduced

for all asset lives by inflation's effect on the value of depreciation

allowances with the greatest effects felt by longer—lived assets.

       It would, however, be misleading to consider only- the effects of

inflation on tax depreciation allowances (cf., Kopcke, 1981) when it is

well—established that net—of—tax debt costs have also fallen with

inflation. Kane, Rosenthal, and Ljung (1983), Peek and Wilcox (1983),

Sununers (1983), and Tanzi (1980), among others, have estimated that

nominal interest   rates have risen at most     one—for—one   with inflation.
To investigate the ramifications of this incomplete adjustment, the
                                           —12—




bottom panel of Table I repeats the analysis under capital structure

invariance but with di(ii)/dit =      1.     It remains   the   case that the "gain

from leverage" term in (ii) equals zero and p(it) =                       so the

calculations are independent of the leverage ratio (b), and of the debt

retirement rate (y), and hence are identical between either user cost

expression. In marked contract to the above results, investment

incentives rise at all inflation rates, and the increases are greatest

for the assets with longer lives. Taken together, the results in table

I indicate that the deleterious effect on investment incentives due                to
historical cost depreciation are swamped by the stimulus arising from

the incomplete adjustment of financial returns.


         B. Debt and Personal Tax Rates

         The arbitrage restriction employed in sub—section A carries with

it the unfortunate implication that if di(it)/dit =             1,   then the change

in equityholders' nominal     discount      rate with respect to inflation is

(1   —       or   around .I8. Such a sluggish response is contradicted by

the empirical results of Fama       (1981) and Hendershot and Hu (1980). In
this sub—section, the capital structure invariance assumption is

replaced with the empirically—based relation that both p(it) and iC-it)

move one—for—one with inf1ation.-.J Capital structure invariance may not

hold in equilibrium     because   of large fixed transactions costs, a lack of

a    complete set of markets (Taggart,       1980), or restrictions on the type

of   debt securities that may be issued (DeAngelo and Masulis, 1980). The
results with dp(ic)/dJt =    1 =   di(it)/dic are presented in Table II, and
are calculated      for leverage ratios of .25 and .75 and for both
                                  —13—



definitions of user costs.-! In both cases it is apparent that more

highly levered investments suffer less disincentives from inflation than

lower levered ones (as a consequence of the declining real after—tax

cost of debt). Short lived assets are also seen to be less affected by

inflation than long lived ones, except in the case of the conventional

model at a high leverage rate. For a highly levered firm, investment

incentives actually increase with inflation in the conventional model,

reflecting the decrease in the post—tax discount rate (ii). The

apparent extreme sensitivity of investment incentives to inflation and

leverage in the conventional framework has been noted previously by Hall

(1981) but, as the results in the top panel of table II suggest, may be

greatly overstated.!i

      Table III assesses the fourth and final effect by defining the

shareholders' discount rate net of personal taxes as implied by our

derivation of the user cost in Section II. While recognizing that

estimating the appropriate tax rate is a difficult matter, we assume

that e equals .20, thus dp(t)/dt =        —     =   0.8   (alternative

values of te are examined in table Iv). Again it is apparent that

this conventional user cost measure greatly exagerates the effects of

inflation and leverage on investment incentives, compared to the

modified version. In both versions, however, taking account of taxes on

equityholders does mitigate the negative effect of inflation on

investment incentives by amplifying the incomplete adjustment of

financial returns.

      C.   Sensitivity Analysis

      Any numerical simulations are, by their very nature, only valid

for the parameters chosen. So in table IV we examine the sensitivity of

our results to two factors which appear most crucial and whose

magnitudes are uncertain.

      The first panel presents results comparable to those in the top

right panel of Table Ilib, but with alternative equityholders' tax rates

of 10 and 30 percent. These tax rates make a considerable qualitative

difference to the results, since they change the effective discount rate

of firms. When e is 0.10, all entries in table IV.A are negative; but

these changes in investment incentives become nearly zero, or positive,

when 'e equals 0.30. Since the "true" tax rate is unlikely to be known

with any precision, these results cast doubt on the often proclaimed

harmful effects of inflation and non—neutral tax rules on investment.

     The final panel of Table IV investigates the sensitivity of the

results to alternative assumptions about the adjustment of equity

returns to inflation. It examines the impacts of 80% and 120%

adjustment. Again it is seen that, even for our modified user cost,

which is less sensitive than the conventional expression, the effects of

inflation on investment incentives depends strongly on the exact

assumptions made about the inflation adjustment of financial returns.

IV.    The Treasury's Tax Reform Proposal

        The above results highlight that calculations of investment

incentives are sensitive both to a number of underlying parameters and

to the user cost formulation. To illustrate this sensitivity, we next

examine the tax reform plan presented by the U.S. Treasury (November

1984). The Treasury Proposal is designed to eliminate distortions among

business assets and inflation rates by removing the investment tax

credit, indexing and decelerating depreciation allowances, lowering the

corporate tax rate, and allowing only the real part of interest payments

to   be deductible from pre—tax income.-i The models develped above can
assess the extent to which the Proposal is consistent with the Reagan
kdministration's   twin goals of enhancing investment incentives and

adopting a tax code that is neutral between asset livesJi'

       The incentive effects of the Treasury Proposal are shown in Table

V, which contains the percentage changes in investment incentives

resulting from the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA)

adopted in 1982 and from the Treasury Proposal, both relative to the tax

code prevailing in 1979. Inflation and financing rates are based on

observations for the latter part of 1984. Under either user cost

formulation, the provisions of TEFRA substantially enhanced investment

incentives. For both long—lived and, especially, short—lived assets,

the Treasury proposal clearly imparts less stimulus than was forthcoming

under TEFRA.
                                      —16—




      The calculations are based on the partial eq.uilibriurn assumption

that the adoption of the Treasury Proposal would     not,   on its own, reduce

financing rates. It is possible that the proposals might result in

lower interest rates, as a consequence of the reduction of individual

tax rates, restrictions on the tax—deductibility of personal borrowing,

and the partial deductibility of dividend payments. If the proposal

were to be accompanied by a two point reduction in financing rates, and

no change in inflation, then the investment incentives would be as

generous as under the Carter tax policy, for all lowly leverered

assets. However, since the value of the debt deductions would be

reduced by the exclusion of the nominal part of interest payments and by

the lower corporate tax rate, highly levered assets would continue to be

treated less favorably under the Treasury Proposal.

      To assess the neutrality of the proposed changes in the tax code

(as they directly affect business fixed investment), we calculate the

"tax wedge" between the net marginal product of capital, (a — 6) and the

opportunity cost of funds (p).Jffi-J The value in the table indicates the

absolute amount   that   the net marginal product of capital must be raised

(if positive) to acconiodate tax effects: if no tax parameters were

present, the wedge would be zero. As can be seen in Table VI, the wedge

under the Carter tax policy (but with current financing rates) differs

greatly between different assets. Under TEFRA, tax wedges are uniformly

lower, especially for equipment, but substantial variation still

remains. Eliminating this variation was one of the goals of the

Treasury Proposal, but neutrality holds under only a limited set of
                                  —17—



circumstances. The conventional specification generates tax wedges that

are stable across asset lives and, for a given life, among inflation

rates (cf. columns (7) and (8)). However, neutrality does not hold

under our modified user cost formulation. Variations among assets are

particularly evident for the ndified user cost and a high leverage

ratio. With 5 percent inflation and a leverage ratio of .75, a 30 year

asset must earn a return that is 3.6 percentage points higher than an

asset purchased under the same conditions but having a 5 year life.

Were the marginal leverage ratio .25, the tax wedge would be only 2.1

percentage points.



V. Summary

      In recent years, much attention has been given to the supposed

deleterious effects of inflation and existing tax rules on investment

incentives. To analyze these relationships, we have developed a

modified definition of the user cost of capital that takes explicit

account of the ownership of the firm and of debt acq.uisition,

retirement, and net—of—tax interest payments. Using this formula as

well as the conventional expression, we have simulated the response of

investment under a wide variety of assumptions and have found that,


      investment incentives are depressed when the sole effect of

      inflation is to lower the value of tax depreciation allowances

      (Table I.A);
                                   —18—




—    however, the inconiplete adjustment of interest rates, coupled with
     a capital structure invariance assumption, imparts a major

      stimulus to capital formation (table I.B);



—    when capital structure invariance is replaced by the empirically—

     based assumption that the nominal rates on debt and equity move

      one—for—one with inflation, investment incentives fall with

      inflation in the modified model, whereas for highly levered

     assets, the conventional model implies they rise with inflation

      (table II); in both models, investment incentives are enhanced

      somewhat, ceteris paribus, by debt financing;



—     defining   the shareholder's discount rate net of personal taxes, as

      implied by the user cost derivation, attenuates any negative

      effects of inflation on investment incentives (table III);



—     lastly,   the interaction of the tax code and inflation do not

      necessarily discriminate against longer—lived assets except under

      capital structure invariance and when nominal interest rates

      adjust completely to inflation (table I.A).


Hence, contrary to the claims of some authors, our results cast

considerable doubt on the central role of inflation in reducing capital

formation in the 1970s and in discriminating against longer lived

assets. The paper ends by drawing attention to the high sensitivity of

all measures of investment incentives to assumed parameters that are
                                 —19—




unlikely to be known in the aggregate with any accuracy. This, in
itself, suggests caution in undertaking policy analysis on the basis of
existing economic itde1s.

      Inflation my also create artificial inventory profits, but proper
      analysis of the relationship between this channel and investment
      incentives requires a different framework (Chirinko, 1983) than that
      presented in this paper.

      Aivazian and Callen (1979) have shown that the ecjuityholders'
      discount rate will be the appropriate criterion to guide investment
      if the firm is in a perfectly competitive industry or in steady—
      state equilibrium.

      It should be noted that z(-) depends on the path of current and
      future values of p and that (1k) can be derived only when (3) is
      embedded in a discounted cash flow expression (e.g., (10)).

      To derive (8b), we assume that   (t), i(t,     and p(t, t) are
      constant from t onward. These .ssuinptions could be abandoned, and
      the debt term at time t would become

                          5
             5 { exp(—5       (p(t +   u,   t)    + y))du   (i —

             0        0


      Note   the similarities between this expression and (Itb).

      In an elaboration of Auerbach's (1979) result concerning wealth
      maximizing shareholders, Edwards and Keen (l98) have shown that
      "policies that maximize shareholder wealth can always be
      characterized as policies that maximize equity value" (p. 212).

      The user cost of capital is strictly relevant only in the steady
      state, and we need to assume that the rates of personal and
      corporate taxation, the investment tax credit, interest, and
      discount rates are constant from time 0 onward.

.L1   Rather then representing a marginal value, the parameter b in
      (13) is the average leverage ratio. Since our simulations relate
      to the steady—state, this difference is immaterial to the
      interpretation of the results.

      The latter equality would exist under a tax system that allowed
      immediate expensing of capital expenditures z(p(it)) =
      such as currently prevails in the United Kingdom.
                                                                    =

-9-!   This result would not hold if b were determined endogenously, a
       modification that could be straightforwardly implemented.
       Following Feldstein, Green, and Sheshinski (1979), we could assume
       that the interest rate increases with the firm's debt—equity ratio
       and, with the appropriate transition equation relating the stock
       and flow of debt, could derive an optimal path for b from an
       optimal control framework. We have chosen not to pursue this
       extension because, doing so would have necessitated examining the
       sensitivity of our results to a number of arbitrary specifications
       of the relationship between the interest rate and the debt—equity
       ratio. Our assumption of a constant debt—equity ratio, while only
       an approximation, is not at odds with ratios observed since the
       middle of the 1970s (Gordon and Malkiel, 1981, Table I).

       In Miller's Figure 1, replace r by (r0 +

       A number of other parameters are needed for the calculations. The
       investment tax credit rate (k) is taken as 6.1%, 10%, and 5% for
       assets with 5, 10, and 20—30 year lives, respectively. (Thus we
       recognize that approximately one—half of structures, as defined in
       the National Income and Product Accounts, enjoy the benefit of the
       investment credit (Corcoran, 1919).) The exponential rate of debt
       retirement (y) is chosen at 0.2, implying that 95% of debt will
       be retired after 15 years. The corporate income tax rate (
       is set constant at 52%: a I8% marginal Federal rate plus 14%, hich
       is the average amount of income taxes paid to State and Local
       governments from 1970—1979 (Feldsteia, Dicks—Mireaux, and Poterba,
       1983, Table 3). The equity tax rate ( ) was estimated as the
       average of marginal tax rates facing diferent classes of dividend
       receipients. The results of this paper are based on values of .20
       and .30 reflecting, respectively, whether transactions or market
       value weights were used in constructing the averages (Chirinko,
       1982). We assume throughout that, at zero inflation, the rate of
       interest is 3 percent. This number is not atypical of the ex—post
       real return obtained in the 1970s. The reported results are quite
       insensitive to the actual magnitudes.

       The rate of economic depreciation (6) and the assumed asset
       lifetime (L) are clearly not independent, and we choose 5 such
       that at the end of L years 90 percent of the asset has been
       depreciated. Hence 6 = 1 — exp(ln(0.1)/L). The z(.) (tax
       depreciation) function uses the sum—of—years—digits method for
       asset lives 5 and 10 years, and 150 percent—declining balance
       method with a switch to straight line after one third of the
       asset's life has passed for 20 and 30 year assets. Asset lives
       used in calculating z have been reduced by 20 percent to accord
       with practices under the Treasury Department's asset depreciation
       range system.

      The quarterly (Q6) and annual (A6) regressions of Fama (1981)
      imply that dp(a)/dit = 1, while the calculations of Hendershott
      and I-lu (1980, PP. 336—339) imply a value of 0.87.

      Feldstein and Summers (1979) have argued that the tax subsidy to
      debt finance resulting from the deductability of nominal interest
      payments is largely offset by the taxation of nominal interest
      receipts accruing to bondholders. Such general equilibrium
      considerations imply that the nominal interest rate should move
      significantly more than the observed point—for—point with changes
      in the inflation rate and, in assessing investment incentives in
      the 1970s, we believe it is more useful to utilize observed,
      though still unexplained, relationships in a partial equilibriwn
      model.

      In their careful study of effective tax rates, King and Fullerton
      (l98I) find a significant amount of dispersion with respect to
      inflation (Figure 7.1). These calculations are based on the
      conventional user cost formula (altered to reflect taxes on wealth
      and inventories), and the dispersion may be attenuated in the
      modified user cost, especially since the proportion of investment
      projects financed by debt varies greatly (Appendix A). Since, in
      their study, the costs of debt and equity finance differ, our
      modified user cost would seem to be the appropriate formula.

      The Indexing feature of the Proposal calls for the undepreciated
      asset value to be adjusted upwards by the rate of inflation.
      However, when the rate of inflation exceeds the depreciation rate,
      which is most likely the case for longer—lived assets, the
      inflation adjusted value can explode. In our simulations, we
      avoid this problem by requiring that the inflation—adjusted,
      undepreciated asset value not exceed the purchase price of the
      asset, and that depreciation occurs over a maximum period of 65
      years.
ill   We are not assessing the effects of all aspects of the Treasury
      Program (for example, we ignore the changes in the tax treatment
      of inventories) but merely those of paramount importance to
      business fixed investment.

      Some studies compute effective tax rates by dividing this tax
      wedge by either (C — 6), or p. As noted by Bradford and Fullerton
      (1981), effective tax rates may flucuate wildly, since either of
      these denominators may approach zero. We therefore report the tax
      wedge which is not susceptible to this behavior.

Note:     All entries are calculated as the ratio of the user cost of capital
          under the 1979 tax code to the user cost for the indicated tax
          program, less one, multiplied by 100. Panel A is based on (ii),
          and Panel B on (12). Our characterizations of the 1979 and TEFRA
          tax programs follow Gravelle (1983), and the Treasury's plans (u.s.
          Treasury, 1984).

Note:    All entries    are calculated as the user cost of capital less the
         exponential    rate of depreciation less the real discount rate, taken as
         5.0 percent     Further details of the user costs from which these are
         derived can    be found in the note to Table V.
