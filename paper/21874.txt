This paper builds a new internationally comparable database of hours worked to measure how
hours vary with income across and within countries. We document that average hours worked per
adult are substantially higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The pattern
of decreasing hours with income holds for both men and women, for adults of all ages and
education levels, and along both the extensive and intensive margin. Within countries, hours
worked per employed are also decreasing in the individual wage for most countries, though in the
richest countries, hours worked are flat or increasing in the wage. Our findings imply that
aggregate productivity and welfare differences across countries are larger than currently thought.

1. Introduction
One of the most basic facts in macroeconomics is that aggregate income per capita
varies greatly across countries (Klenow and Rodrı́guez-Clare, 1997; Hall and Jones,
1999; Caselli, 2005). Much less is known about how aggregate hours worked vary across
countries. Consider the basic question: are average hours worked higher for adults in
high-income countries or for adults in low-income countries? Due to data limitations,
the economics literature does not have an answer to this question. This is unfortunate,
because if hours enter directly into preferences, then measures of average hours worked
at the country level are a key input to understanding welfare differences across countries
(Jones and Klenow, 2016).

In this paper, we create a new database of average hours worked using recent house-
hold survey data from 80 countries of all income levels. Unlike several other existing
databases on hours worked, our data are internationally comparable and allow for rich
disaggregate comparisons across and within countries. The surveys we employ are na-
tionally representative and cover workers in all sectors, including the self-employed,
which represent the majority of the workforce in low-income countries. We focus most
of our analysis on a set of 48 core countries, for which international comparability of
hours data is as high as possible. In particular, we require that the data from these core
countries satisfy three basic criteria. First, the surveys cover the entire calendar year
(rather than, say, one month of the year). This is necessary to prevent any bias induced
by seasonality in labor demand. Second, hours worked are measured in a consistent
way: actual (rather than usual) hours in all jobs (not just the primary job), and in the
week prior to the interview. Finally, hours worked cover the production of goods or
services counted in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Thus, our hours
measures cover unpaid work in agricultural or non-agricultural businesses, as well as
wage employment, but do not cover home-produced services, such as child care.1

Our main finding is that average hours worked per adult are substantially higher in
low-income countries (the bottom third of the world income distribution) than in high-
income countries (the top third). In low-income countries, adults work 28.5 hours per
   1 For a smaller set of countries, we document that hours spent on home production of services in

low- and high-income countries follow the same pattern as hours spent on producing goods and services
counted in NIPA; we present these findings in Section 4.4.

week on average, compared to 18.9 hours per week in high-income countries. This dif-
ference is both statistically and economically significant, with cross-country differences
in average hours per adult (9.6 hours per week) being twice as large as the decline in
hours per adult in the United States over the twentieth century (4.7 hours per week)
(Ramey and Francis, 2009). In percentage terms, adults in low-income countries work
about fifty percent more hours per week than adults in high-income countries. As one
simple summary statistic, the slope coefficient from a regression of log hours per adult
on log GDP per hour is -0.15. We also decompose average hours per adult into an
extensive margin (employment rate) and intensive margin (average hours per worker).
We find that cross-country differences in hours per adult are shaped by both margins.
Employment rates are higher in the poorest third than in the middle third, and similar
between the middle and top third of the world income distribution. Average hours per
worker increase between the poorest and the middle third, and then decrease substan-
tially for the richest third. Overall, employment rates account for about three quarters
of the decline in hours per adult between low- and high-income countries, while hours
per worker account for about one quarter.

After having documented the facts on the aggregate level, we compute average hours by
sex, age group, and educational attainment. We find that the pattern of higher hours in
low-income countries is quite broad-based, being present in each of the disaggregated
categories. We also decompose average hours per worker into three broad sectoral ag-
gregates: agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Hours per worker in agriculture are
similar across the world income distribution, while manufacturing and services workers
work 8.5 and 13.7 more hours per week in the low- than in the high-income countries.
The results from the sectoral breakdowns are reassuring if one has the prior that hours
worked are measured more accurately in manufacturing and services. We show that the
differences in aggregate hours across countries are not driven by different compositions
in age, education, or sectors across countries.

We next ask how hours vary with income within countries, and to what extent the within-
country patterns help account for the aggregate patterns we document thus far. Our
main measure of individual income is the hourly wage from paid employment, which
we compute for all workers who are employed as wage workers.2 We find that when
   2 We also look at wages plus self employment earnings for a broader set of workers,
                                                                                   but with the caveat
that self-employment earnings are less well measured than earnings from paid employment.


                                                   2
pooling individuals across all core countries, hours per worker fall with wages, just as
they do in the aggregate: the slope of log hours on log wages is -0.09, compared to
a slope of log hours on log GDP per hour of -0.12. When regressing log hours on
both log wages and log country GDP per hour together, the slope on log wages falls
only modestly, while the coefficient on GDP per hour becomes substantially smaller
in absolute terms and insignificant. Even with country fixed effects, the coefficient on
log wages remains similar in magnitude. This suggests that residents of poor countries
work more hours on average mainly because of their low wages, rather than because of
aggregate factors prevalent in poor countries. We find that this effect is stronger for men
than for women, for whom both country effects and individual wages play important
roles.

Finally, we explore how the elasticity of hours to wages varies country by country. We
find that individual slopes are negative for the majority of countries in our database.
Interestingly, these slopes are systematically lower in countries with lower GDP per
capita than in richer countries like the United States, where hours are increasing in
individual wages. This is consistent with historical evidence showing that hours-wage
slopes for employed workers used to be decreasing or flat but are nowadays increasing
in the United States (Aguiar and Hurst, 2007; Costa, 2000) and in other OECD countries
(Huberman and Minns, 2007). The results for the extensive margin are in line with the
intensive margin evidence. Using education as a proxy for the permanent income of
non-working individuals we find that employment rates are flat by education in poor
countries, but increasing by education in richer countries. Our findings suggest that the
change from a decreasing hours-income slope to a positive one within countries may be
a fundamental feature of the development process.

We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for cross-country differences
in aggregate labor productivity and welfare. In the absence of data on hours worked,
development accounting typically relies on GDP per worker as a measure of labor pro-
ductivity, which implicitly treats hours per worker as identical across countries (see
e.g. Hall and Jones, 1999; Caselli, 2005; Hsieh and Klenow, 2010). Across our core
countries, GDP per worker is a factor 19.9 times larger in the richest third than in the
poorest third of countries, while GDP per hour is 23.5 times as large. Thus, after taking
hours into consideration, cross-country TFP differences are even larger than previously


                                            3
thought. Our findings also have implications for welfare differences across countries.
Building on the work of Jones and Klenow (2016), we construct a flow measure of utility
from consumption and disutility of work. Using our hours data, plus standard measures
of consumption per capita, we calculate that welfare differs by a factor of 19 between
high-income and low-income countries, compared to a factor of 12 when we ignore dif-
ferences in hours worked. To put it succinctly, residents of low-income countries are not
just consumption poor, but also leisure poor.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 highlights the paper’s contribu-
tion relative to the literature. Section 3 describes our underlying data sources, and our
efforts to construct internationally comparable data on hours worked. Section 4 docu-
ments that aggregate hours worked per adult are decreasing in the country income level,
compares the data to U.S. time-series, and provides some evidence that hours on home
services are also decreasing in income. Section 5 presents hours worked differences
across countries by gender, education, age, and sector, and shows that differences in
aggregate hours are not driven by differences in the demographic composition across
countries. Section 6 then analyzes how hours vary with income at the individual level
within our sample countries. Section 7 quantifies implications of the aggregate results
for the measurement of labor productivity and welfare differences across poor and rich
countries. Section 8 concludes.


2. Related Literature
Our study is the first to measure how hours worked vary with income across and within
countries of all income levels. Prior studies of aggregate hours worked across coun-
tries have almost exclusively focused on rich countries, and in particular on the United
States and European countries (e.g., Bick et al., 2016). Explanations of the U.S.-Europe
gap in average hours have focused largely on differences in taxation (e.g., Prescott,
2004; Rogerson, 2006; McDaniel, 2011; Bick and Fuchs-Schündeln, 2017), institutions
(Alesina et al., 2005) and social security systems (Erosa et al., 2012; Wallenius, 2013;
Alonso-Ortiz, 2014). Other studies have focused on understanding changes in hours
worked over time, though these have also concentrated on rich countries. For exam-
ple, McGrattan and Rogerson (2004) and Ohanian et al. (2008) measure changes in
hours among OECD countries over time, while Ramey and Francis (2009), and Francis


                                            4
and Ramey (2009) focus on the long-run decline in hours worked in the United States.
Aguiar and Hurst (2007) and Costa (2000) study how hours vary with income within the
United States historically, and Huberman and Minns (2007) focus on these patterns for
a number of OECD countries.

The existing evidence on hours worked from developing countries is quite limited.
The study by Lee et al. (2007) presents some evidence on hours from largely non-
representative establishment surveys covering wage earners in manufacturing. Their
data thus excludes the self-employed and those working in agriculture, which together
form the vast majority of all workers in the developing world. Caselli (2005) con-
siders hours worked data for 28 countries from the International Labor Organization
(ILO), though just two of these countries are in the bottom half of the world income
distribution. Gollin et al. (2014) compare average hours worked among workers in
the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors of a large set of countries using nationally
representative surveys. Their data are comparable across sectors within each country,
though not necessarily comparable across countries. Bridgman et al. (2017) provide ev-
idence on household and market production hours from time use surveys covering 43
countries of all income levels, including richer data than in our study on hours of home
production. Jones and Klenow (2016) consider hours worked in their study of welfare
differences across countries. Their micro data cover however only 3 middle- and 3 low-
income countries, and of these 6 only 2 qualify as core countries in our study. For their
extended analysis, they rely on hours data from the Penn World Tables (PWT). None of
these studies analyzes how hours worked vary with wages on the individual level.

The Total Economy Database, run by the Conference Board, recently released data on
annual hours worked per worker, in addition to employment rates, for an unbalanced
panel of countries, with the earliest data coming from 1950. These data are also included
now in the PWT. Many of these data points are however interpolated or extrapolated,
especially for the low- and middle-income countries. Of the data points that have an
actual source available, the quality is highly questionable in terms of consistency of
hours measurement, activity coverage, and potential biases from seasonality. We detail
some of these data quality issues in Online Appendix Section A.4.3
   3 To give some concrete examples, from the 304 country-year observations that come from country-

years in which the country’s GDP would place it into the lowest tercile of the world income distribution
today, 89, i.e. almost one third, are inter- or extrapolated. Of the remaining data points, the vast majority,

3. Data
In this section, we describe the survey data underlying our analysis. We then introduce
the criteria that we use to define the set of core countries, which are those that have the
most scope for international comparability. Next, we describe how we measure hours
per adult, employment rates, and hours per worker.

3.1. Data Sources

Our analysis draws on nationally representative household surveys. The key advantage
of using household surveys, as opposed to firm surveys or administrative records, is
that our measures of labor supply are not restricted to activities for which individuals
receive a wage, but also include self-employed and unpaid family work. As is well
known, the self-employed form an important fraction of the workforce in all countries,
and particularly so in developing countries, see e.g. Gollin (2008).

All of the surveys we employ are publicly available for researchers, mostly via an ap-
plication through national statistical agencies or similar institutions. We were able to
collect nationally representative data for 80 countries with a population of at least one
million. For 33 of our countries we can draw from harmonized data sets, for which ef-
forts have already been made to standardize questions across countries. These comprise
the European Labor Force Survey (ELFS; 26 countries) and the International Public-Use
Microdata Project (IPUMS; 7 countries). For the remaining 47 countries, we draw on
country-specific censuses, household or labor force surveys, including 20 surveys con-
ducted as part of the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Studies (LSMS).4

When multiple years of appropriate data are available, we choose the year closest to
2005. Most of our data are within a few years of 2005; exact years, data sources, and
namely 196, come from data provided by the Asian Productivity Organization (APO). For 83 of the 196
APO data points, there is no information available regarding the original data source, and for a further 71
the original data source does not contain any information on hours per worker. Hence, only for 42 data
points from 4 countries is there any information on hours per worker in the original data, but the quality is
still unclear. Some of the other low-income data points in the Total Economy Database come from either
Hofman (1998) or Maddison (2001), which in turn often extrapolate data or impute average hours per
employed using only the number of statutory public holidays and vacation days.
     4 Note that this does not imply that these standardized surveys are all in our sample of core countries.

All ELFS countries are core countries, while none of the IPUMS countries and only 9 of the LSMS
countries are core countries.



                                                     6
sample sizes for all countries are given in Online Appendix Table C.1. Our sample sizes
range from 5,000 to over 700,000 individuals. We focus on all individuals of at least age
15, whom we refer to as “adults”.5

3.2. Core Countries

The key measurement challenge we face is that not all of our surveys are conducted
in the same way, and more specifically, not all surveys collect hours information in the
same way. To ensure that international comparability is as high as possible, we focus
our main analysis on a set of core countries which we define to be those that satisfy the
following three criteria.

1. Activity Definition: We restrict attention to hours worked in the production of output
that is counted in NIPA. These include hours worked in wage employment as well as
hours in own-account agricultural or non-agricultural work, whether or not that output
is sold or used for own consumption (see e.g. Gollin et al., 2014). This is important
if we want to maintain a nationally representative sample of workers, particularly in
the poorest countries, where agricultural work and self-employment are widespread.
Not included in our definition of hours worked are hours spent on non-market services,
such as cleaning or home-provided child care; we return to the issue of home-produced
services in Section 4.4.

2. Hours Worked Information: We focus on actual hours worked, rather than usual
hours worked, since individuals may work more or less than usual in a given week, due
to e.g. over-time or sickness. We also focus on all jobs, rather than just the primary job,
since many individuals have multiple jobs. Finally, we focus only on surveys that ask
respondents about hours worked in the last week or in a recent reference week, since
longer time periods may lead to recall bias.

3. Time Coverage: We restrict attention to surveys that cover the entire calendar year.
While all of our surveys are nationally representative in terms of the covered popula-
tion, some are conducted over the entire year, and others are conducted over only a few
months or weeks. Using these partial-year surveys creates potentially biased estimates
of hours worked unless the survey period happens to be representative of the entire year.
This bias may be more pronounced in developing countries, which are largely agricul-
  5 The   United States is an exception here as the youngest available age is 16.

                                                     7
tural and hence seasonal. Online Appendix A.1 provides a detailed explanation of how
we determine the time coverage of each survey and which surveys qualify as covering
the entire year according to our definition.

Out of the 80 countries in our sample, 48 qualify as core countries. All the non-core
countries satisfy the first criterion on the activity definition but have either non-standard
hours worked information or cover less than the full calendar year (or both).

3.3. Measuring Employment and Hours Worked

Our measures of employment rates and hours worked rest on two key variables: the
self-reported employment status and actual hours worked in all jobs in the last week. We
measure the employment rate as the fraction of all adults that report being employed or
have positive hours worked. We measure hours per worker as the average hours worked
in all jobs in the reference week among all those who are employed. Both measures
are calculated with the individual survey weights. We measure hours per adult as the
product of the employment rate and average hours per worker. We provide more details
on our calculations in Online Appendix Section A.2. Since the surveys of the core
countries cover the entire year, vacations, sick leave, or other reasons for seasonality
should in principle be covered, and multiplying the reported numbers by 52 gives an
estimate of annual hours worked per adult (see our discussion of potential biases in
Online Appendix Section A.5).

Our definition of whether a country in our sample is a low- (bottom third of the world in-
come distribution), middle- or high-income (top third of the world income distribution)
country is based on GDP per capita in the year 2005 for all countries in the Penn World
Tables version 9.0 (see Feenstra et al. (2015) for a detailed description of the PWT).
Specifically, we use expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs in 2011 US $ (rgd pe).
We find similar levels of average GDP per capita when comparing each of these terciles
in our core and full set of countries to all countries in the PWT; see Online Appendix
Table C.2. When plotting aggregate hours worked against GDP per capita, we use GDP
per capita for each country from the same year for which we have the hours data.

4. Aggregate Hours by Income Across Countries
In this section, we document that average hours worked per adult are substantially
higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries, and that the same holds
true for both the extensive and the intensive margins of labor supply. Last, we pro-
vide suggestive evidence that also hours spent on the production of home services are
decreasing by development.

4.1. Average Hours Worked Per Adult

Figure 1 plots average weekly hours per adult against log GDP per capita for our core
countries. Vertical lines separate the three terciles of the world income distribution; 11
countries fall in the bottom tercile, 15 in the middle tercile, and 22 in the top tercile. The
figure shows that average hours per adult are downward sloping in income per capita.
The poorest countries in the world range from a low of around 24 hours per week in
Malawi, Rwanda, and Uganda to a high of almost 40 hours per week in Cambodia. The
richest countries average between a low of around 16 hours in Italy, Spain, Belgium,
and France and a high of 24.4 hours in the United States. Iraq has the lowest hours per
adult in our sample, which is driven entirely by women, as discussed in Section 5.1.

Panel A of Table 1 reports in the first row the average hours per adult by income tercile
in our core countries. In these countries, average hours per adult are 28.5 hours per
week in low-income countries, compared to 22.2 hours in middle- and 18.9 hours in
high-income countries. In terms of economic significance, the 9.6 higher weekly hours
in the low-income group correspond to 50 percent higher hours than in the high-income
group.6 Regressing the logarithm of hours on the logarithm of GDP per hour worked
yields a slope coefficient of -0.15.7

Given that the number of core countries is relatively small, particularly in the lower end
of the income distribution, we conduct statistical tests of the hypothesis that average
   6 In the main analysis, we take unweighted averages across countries. When weighting by population,
hours differences between the bottom and top thirds of the world income distribution are similar: averages
in the low-, middle- and high-income groups are 28, 23.6, and 20.7 hours per week.
    7 We regress on the logarithm of GDP per hour worked rather than GDP per capita, because GDP per

hour worked is an aggregate productivity measure analogous to the individual wage, which we use as a
regressor in a similar regression in Section 6. Figure C.2 in the Online Appendix shows the corresponding
scatter plot of the logarithm of average hours worked per adult and the logarithm of GDP per hour worked.



                                                    9
hours worked in all countries are drawn from the same distribution. We do so using
permutation tests, which have more favorable small-sample properties than other com-
monly used tests, such as t-tests (Lehmann and Romano, 2005). Panel B of Table 1
reports the results of these permutation tests. For the core countries, shown in the first
row, the observed difference in mean hours between the low- and high-income groups
is 9.6 hours per week, between the low- and middle-income group 6.3 hours per week,
and between the middle- and high-income group 3.3 hours per week. All p-values are
well under one percent. We conclude that the decreasing average hours over the income
terciles are unlikely to be a coincidence.

Rows 2 and 3 of Table 1, Panel A, report average hours per adult by income tercile
in two broader sets of countries: (i) the core plus those countries having a survey that
covers only part of the year, and (ii) all countries in our data set, regardless of how hours
are measured. Covering more countries comes however at the cost of lower international
data comparability. Across the 73 core plus partial-year survey countries, average hours
worked are 26.7 in the low-, 22.4 in the middle-, and 19.4 in the high-income countries.
Thus, within the low-income countries average hours worked are slightly lower in this
group than in the core, while hours worked in the middle- and high-income groups are
similar to the core. Going to the full set of 80 countries, average hours per adult rise
by 0.2 weekly hours in all income groups (see also Figure C.1 in the Online Appendix.)
As Panel B of Table 1 shows, all differences across the income groups are significant
at the one percent level in the broader set of countries. We conclude that our finding of
higher hours per adult in poor countries than in rich countries holds in a broader set of
countries as well as in our core countries. From here on we focus on the core countries
due to their higher degree of international comparability.8

4.2. Comparison to Time-Series Data from the United States

Our research is motivated by the question of how hours worked vary with income in
the cross-section of countries. Complementary evidence on the relationship between
income and hours worked comes from time-series data. With time series data, one can
ask how hours looked like in the currently rich countries back when they were poor.
   8 We conclude that potential biases from seasonality, measurement of vacation days and public holi-
days, and child labor would all likely increase measured hours worked differences between rich and poor
countries; see Online Appendix Section A.5.


                                                  10
Comprehensive and reliable historical data on hours worked are unfortunately hard to
obtain, and the discussion on the complications of constructing reliable hours worked
data in Section 3 makes clear why this is the case. However, for the United States, data
spanning over 100 years are available from Ramey and Francis (2009). Yet, even 100
years ago, the United States was as rich as current middle-income countries, so these
time series data do not span as large an income range as our data does.

Figure 2 plots Ramey and Francis (2009)’s U.S. time series of average hours worked per
adult (individuals aged 14+) from 1900 to 2005 (gray line), and average hours per adult
from our data (black dots). Average adult hours per week in the United States decreased
from 27.7 hours per week in 1900 to 23.0 hours in 2005, corresponding to a decline of
4.7 hours per week. Interestingly, the patterns for hours in the cross-section of countries
is quantitatively similar over the range of GDP per capita spanned by the United States
in the last century, only with slightly higher overall hours in the United States.

4.3. Extensive and Intensive Margins

Differences in hours worked per adult stem from differences in employment rates, which
represent the extensive margin, and average hours per worker, which represent the inten-
sive margin. Figure 3 plots employment rates (top panel) and average hours per worker
(bottom panel) for our core countries. The figure shows that employment rates are de-
creasing for much of the income distribution, with a modest increase for the richest
countries, while hours per worker follow more of a hump-shaped pattern.

Table 2 reports the average employment rates and hours per worker in each country
income group. In the low-income countries, the average employment rate is 75.3 per-
cent. In middle- and high-income countries, employment rates are 53.7 and 54.9 per-
cent, respectively. Along the intensive margin, workers in low-income countries average
38.4 hours per week, compared to 41.2 hours and 34.5 hours in the middle- and high-
income countries; thus, on average there is a mild hump-shape in hours per worker
among the three income groups. For employment rates, the large difference between the
low- and middle-income countries (21.6 percentage points) is statistically significant at
the one-percent level, while the (negative) difference between the middle- and high-
income countries is not significant. For hours per worker, the opposite is true. The small
low-middle difference is statistically insignificant, while the large middle-high differ-


                                            11
ence (6.7 hours per week) is significant at the one-percent level. Thus, average hours
per adult are shaped by the two margins differently, with employment rates account-
ing for the decline in hours per adult between low- and middle-income countries, and
hours per worker accounting for the decline between middle- and high-income coun-
tries. Overall, we calculate that employment rates account for around three quarters
of the cross-country differences in hours per adult, while hours per worker account for
around one quarter; see Online Appendix A.3 for details.

4.4. Time Spent on Production of Home Services

Until now, we have focused attention entirely on hours worked in the production of
output counted in NIPA. A large literature has emphasized broader notions of work,
however, including hours spent on home production of services (Parente et al., 2000;
Aguiar and Hurst, 2007; Ngai and Pissarides, 2008; Ramey, 2009; Ngai and Pissarides,
2011; Aguiar et al., 2012, 2013; Rendall, 2015; Duernecker and Herrendorf, 2016). In
this section, we consider hours of home production using a smaller set of countries for
which we have data.

Hours spent producing home services are notoriously hard to measure. The two most
important reasons are the difficult differentiation between leisure and home production
of services in some categories, and the possibility of multi-tasking. Both difficulties
apply especially when it comes to child care, but can also arise in other categories like
cooking (see Aguiar and Hurst (2007) and Ramey (2009) for excellent discussions of
the difficulties of measuring leisure and home production hours in general). Questions
covering time spent on home production of services are therefore not usually included
in labor force surveys or censuses. However, a few of the surveys we use do in fact ask
about time spent on some categories of home production of services. We complement
these surveys with data from the Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS).9

We provide evidence on average weekly hours spent in five aggregated service cate-
gories, namely cooking (including preparing food and washing dishes), cleaning, child
care, shopping, and collecting water and firewood. These data should be considered
   9 For each country, we use the year closest to 2005. Online Appendix Table C.3 provides an overview
of the countries with data on time use by income terciles. All data from the bottom and middle terciles,
except South Africa, and data from Russia come from our main data source for the respective country.
All other data come from the MTUS.


                                                  12
suggestive evidence: we do not apply the same standards to ensure comparability across
countries that we apply when calculating hours worked in the market or in the produc-
tion of home produced goods. The MTUS covers all five categories except collecting
water and firewood. The other individual country surveys often cover only a subset
of the categories. For each category and each income tercile, we have data from at
least four countries, with the exception of hours spent on collecting water and firewood,
which has minimal data outside the bottom tercile.

Table 3 presents the average hours spent on each of the time use categories by income
group, with the number of countries for each category and group in parentheses. Av-
erage hours are lowest for the high-income countries in every single category except
shopping. The totals amount to 25.3 weekly hours in the bottom tercile, 25.8 hours in
the middle tercile, and 18.2 hours in the top tercile. We conclude that our main find-
ing of higher hours worked in low-income than in high-income countries is still present
once we consider time spent on broader categories of work, at least using these data.
Our findings here are consistent with those of Bridgman et al. (2017). Using richer data
on broader time use categories from 43 countries, they find that home production hours
decrease in GDP per capita.


5. Hours Worked by Income for Different Demographic Groups
So far, we document that aggregate hours worked are decreasing in GDP per capita.
We now turn our attention to potential heterogeneity related to this fact. We document
hours worked per adult by sex, education, and over the life cycle, and hours worked per
worker by sector across our core countries. We show that the finding that average hours
worked per adult are substantially higher in low-income countries than in high-income
countries is quite broad-based. The positive hours difference between low- and high-
income countries is statistically significant for both sexes, all education groups, and all
sectors except agriculture. Moreover, the decline of aggregate hours by income is not
driven by different compositions of the population across countries.

5.1. Average Hours per Adult by Sex

We start by analyzing average hours worked for both sexes across our set of core coun-
tries. As Table 4 shows, for both men and women hours per adult are decreasing by

                                            13
development. For the low-income countries, men average 32.7 hours per week, while in
the middle- and high-income countries they average 28.4 and 23.5 hours per week, for a
difference of 9.2 hours per week between low and high. Women work fewer hours than
men in all income groups, but show the same pattern of higher hours in poorer countries,
with a very similar difference of 9.8 hours between low- and high-income countries.10

5.2. Average Hours by Education Group

Patterns of hours worked have been shown to differ systematically by education group
within the United States, see e.g. Aguiar and Hurst (2007). Do similar patterns arise in
countries in other parts of the world income distribution? Our data allow us to consis-
tently define three broad education groups: those with (1) less than secondary school,
(2) secondary school completed (but not more), and (3) more than secondary school.
We restrict attention in this exercise to adults aged 25 and above, so as to focus on those
who have most likely completed schooling.

Table 5 reports average hours per adult by education group; see Figure C.4 of the Online
Appendix for the plots. All three education groups feature higher hours in the poorer
countries. Among individuals with less than secondary school, average hours are 31.8
in the low-income countries compared to 19.8 in the middle- and just 12.2 in the high-
income countries. Thus, for the lowest education group the difference between hours
in low- and high-income countries amounts to 19.6 hours.11 Individuals in low-income
countries with secondary school completed work 13.9 more hours per week on average
than their counterparts in high-income countries, and for individuals with more than
secondary education the difference between low- and high-income countries falls to
12.6 hours. Within each country group, average hours are higher for more educated
individuals than for the less educated, though less so for the low-income countries. We
return to this evidence in Section 6.4 below.
  10 Online  Appendix Figure C.3 plots average hours per adult for men (top panel) and women (bottom
panel) for each country. A notable feature of the graphs by sex is that female hours are substantially lower
for countries with large Muslim populations, such as Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey.
   11 This dramatic difference is partly caused by an age-composition effect, because individuals with

less than secondary education are most prevalent among the old in high-income countries. Focusing on
individuals aged 25 to 54 (instead of all individuals aged over 25) reduces the hours difference between
high- and low-income countries of the lowest education group from 19.6 hours to 12.0 hours.




                                                    14
5.3. Hours Worked over the Life Cycle

In this subsection, we document hours worked over the life cycle for the three country
income groups. Figure 4 plots average hours for five year age groups, starting at age
15-19 and ending at age 85-89. Since we do not have panel data, we cannot distinguish
between cohort and age effects. We interpret the data as age effects, but one should
keep in mind the caveat that we could be capturing cohort effects at least to some extent.
The well-known hump-shape of hours over the life cycle is present for all three country
income groups. Most importantly, the pattern of decreasing hours by country income
is present at each single age group. The largest differences arise for older individuals.
Starting at the age group 55-59, the differences in hours worked between low- and high-
income countries are increasing up to age 65-69, at which point they start decreasing
again. This points to the absence or existence of social security programs as an important
driver of hours worked differences around the retirement age. On average, individuals
aged 55+ work 21.8 hours per week in the low-income countries, compared to 12.3 and
7.6 hours in the middle- and high-income countries. Among individuals younger than
55, the average hours difference between low- and middle-income countries amounts to
4.5 hours, and between middle- and high-income countries to 0.8 hours.12

5.4. Hours Per Worker by Sector

Which sectors contribute most to the patterns of hours per worker that we document?
To answer this question, we compute average hours per worker by three broad sectoral
aggregates, which we can define consistently across countries. These are agriculture
(including forestry and fisheries), manufacturing (including mining and utilities), and
services. We assign each worker to one of these sectors based on their primary sector of
employment (though their hours cover all jobs). We focus on hours per worker (rather
than hours per adult), since industry is only well defined for those currently working.

Table 6 presents the average hours per worker by industry. Among agricultural work-
ers, differences in average hours are statistically insignificant across the three country
groups, with the low-, middle- and high-income countries working 36.0, 37.7 and 39.9
hours per week, respectively. Manufacturing workers work longer hours in the low-
income countries, at 44.9 hours per week, compared to 42.7 in the middle-income and
  12 De   Magalhães et al. (2017) find similar patterns for several African countries.


                                                      15
36.4 in the high-income countries. The differences are even more substantial for ser-
vices, where workers in the low-income countries average 47.7 hours, compared to 41.6
and 34.0 hours per week in the middle- and high-income countries. It is reassuring that
the hours differences are so pronounced in manufacturing and services, if one has the
prior that hours worked in these two sectors are measured more accurately since the
prevalence of paid employment is higher. In contrast to age and education, the coun-
try income groups do not share a common pattern of hours worked differences across
sectors.

5.5. Compositional Effects on Aggregate Hours

Given that we document substantial differences in hours worked by age, education, and
sector in all three country income groups, the question arises whether the differences in
aggregate hours by income arise due to substantial different compositions of the popu-
lation by development. To gauge how important the composition of the population by
country is for determining the aggregate hours differences, we conduct several counter-
factual exercises. Starting with the age composition, we first compute in each country
average hours per person for 5 year age groups. We then calculate hypothetical aver-
age weekly hours per adult in each country by multiplying U.S.-population weights for
the age groups with average hours of the corresponding age group in each country, and
then summing up over all age groups. We do a similar counterfactual exercise for the
educational composition relying on the three education groups, and another one com-
bining the age-education composition. Last, we conduct the same exercise for hours per
worker, imposing the U.S. sectoral composition.

The results are shown in Table 7. The first two rows relate to the age structure. Av-
erage weekly hours per adult essentially do not change when the U.S. age structure is
imposed. Imposing the U.S. age structure on poor countries shifts weight from the older
population to the younger one; since both work similarly fewer hours than prime-aged
individuals, the shift has on net a minimal effect. Rows 3 and 4 focus on the educa-
tional composition (and thus on the population 25+). The hypothetical hours difference
between low- and high-income countries imposing the U.S. education composition is
somewhat larger than the actual hours difference. By imposing the U.S. education com-
position, the share of higher educated individuals in the low-income countries rises,


                                           16
increasing the hypothetical hours there. However, since the hours gradient in educa-
tion is smallest in the low-income countries, the difference in hypothetical hours is still
relatively close to the difference in actual hours. Row 5 then combines the age and ed-
ucation structure, and finds a very similar difference in hypothetical hours as in actual
hours between high- and low-income countries. The hypothetical values for hours per
worker if the U.S. sectoral composition is imposed in all countries are presented in the
last row of Table 7. What we find, not surprisingly, is that the hypothetical hours per
worker would be even higher in low-income countries if those countries had the U.S.
industry composition, given the small share of agriculture in the United States and the
low average hours in the agricultural sector in low-income countries.

Summarizing, we unequivocally find that differences in the population composition
across countries are not the main driver of the aggregate hours worked differences by
development.


6. Individual Hours Worked and Wages
So far, we have provided evidence that hours are decreasing in income at the country
level. In this section, we look at how hours vary with income within countries. We
first pool all our individual data for our core countries and compute an hours-wage
elasticity using individual-level wage data, and ask whether the aggregate hours-income
relationship we document thus far is accounted for mostly by the individual elasticity, or
whether there are aggregate features particular to poor countries that lead to higher hours
there, such as a lack of social security programs. Finally, we compute the hours-wage
slopes country by country, and ask how these slopes vary across countries.

6.1. Constructing Individual Wages

There are two major challenges in constructing wages on the individual level. First, we
observe individual earnings only for individuals who are currently working. Thus, we
focus on the intensive margin of labor supply, i.e. hours per worker. Second, while con-
structing hourly wages is relatively straightforward for individuals in paid employment,
it is a challenging task for self-employed individuals, who make up the majority of the
work force in developing countries. We thus construct two wage rates: the first is an indi-
vidual hourly wage from paid employment, which we only construct for workers in paid

                                            17
employment; the second is an hourly wage including earnings from self-employment,
which we construct for all individuals working positive hours. We exclude Namibia and
Laos because of missing earnings data. We briefly summarize the construction of the
two measures here, and more details as well as a validity check can be found in Online
Appendix Section A.6.


Wage from Paid Employment For individuals in paid employment, we construct an
hourly wage (expressed in 2011 PPP-adjusted US $) by dividing monthly earnings from
paid employment by actual weekly hours worked from paid employment in the refer-
ence week multiplied by 4.33. We only include individuals who are paid employees in
the main job. If they also report being paid employees in any additional jobs, we sum up
earnings and hours over all relevant jobs, if available. The European Labor Force Sur-
vey, which is our main data source for European countries, does not include individual
earnings, and thus in this analysis we use the European Union Statistics on Income and
Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for the European countries. Moreover, we have to recur
to usual rather than actual hours for the European countries and the United States. The
main caveat concerning evidence from the group of wage earners in paid employment is
that they are a selected set of all employed, particularly in lower income countries (see
Table A.1 in the Online Appendix).

Figure 5 presents a simple way of summarizing our individual-level data across all sam-
ple countries for which we can construct an individual wage. We sort individuals into
wage deciles within each country, and calculate for each decile the average wage and
average hours worked. We then plot these against each other for all 46 core countries,
and connect all deciles within a given country with a line. Notably, there is substantial
overlap of individual wages between countries of different income levels. While there
appear to be significant country fixed effects, especially among the low-income coun-
tries, the decrease of hours by wages seems to hold both within and across countries.


Wage from Paid Employment Plus Self-Employment We also construct an alter-
native hourly wage which includes earnings from self-employment for a broader set of
individuals, encompassing all those who are working and have non-missing earnings
data. In most of our surveys, self-employment income is reported at the individual level,


                                           18
and so we construct an individual wage by summing all wage and self-employed earn-
ings and dividing by total hours worked at all jobs. An important caveat is that although
self-employment income is reported at the individual level, it is still possible that other
family members supply hours of work in order to help earn the reported income. Fur-
thermore, self-employed income is reported in different ways across countries, and there
are limits to how well we can standardize self-employment income. Fortunately, as we
show below, our overall findings are similar with and without self-employment earnings.

Online Appendix Figure C.6 plots average hours against average wages for the deciles
of the wage distribution in each country. As in Figure 5, there is substantial overlap in
wages across countries. The overall pattern is still a negative relationship between hours
and wages, though substantially flatter than the pattern for wage earners, particularly in
the poorer countries.

6.2. Individual vs. Country Income

Our findings thus far of a negative relationship of hours and GDP per capita at the
country level raise a natural question: do individuals in poor countries work more hours
because they themselves have low income, or because they live in a poor country? If it is
the former, this points to a strong role for preferences in which income effects outweigh
substitution effects (see e.g. Boppart and Krusell, 2016). If country effects dominate,
this points to institutional features of poor countries that raise labor supply relative to
rich countries.

To answer this question, we build a world data set containing all individual observations
from all 46 core countries, and regress hours worked of individual i living in country c
on the individual wage (w) and country GDP per hour worked (GDPph), including as
controls age and age squared, and clustering standard errors at the country level:

    log (hic ) = α + βw log (wic ) + βGDP log (GDPphc ) + δ1 ageic + δ2 ageic 2 + εic .   (1)


The results are shown in Table 8. Each column is a different regression specification.
Panel A shows our findings for both sexes. In the first two columns, we show results
if either only GDP per hour or only the individual wage are included as regressors. In
this case, both turn out to have negative and highly significant coefficients of -0.12 and


                                             19
-0.09, respectively. When both regressors are included at the same time (third column),
the coefficient on the individual wage drops slightly to -0.08, but the coefficient on
country GDP per hour drops more substantially to -0.03, and becomes insignificant. In
the last column, we replace GDP per hour with country fixed effects, and the coefficient
on the individual wage remains again largely unchanged at -0.10. We thus conclude that
a low individual wage correlates significantly with high hours worked per worker across
the entire world income distribution. On top of this effect, individuals living in poorer
countries tend to work more hours, though that effect is more modest.

The next two panels of Table 8 show the estimation results separately for men and
women. The main difference between both is that, once both GDP per hour or country
fixed effects and individual wages are included, the coefficient on the individual wage is
more negative for men than for women, while the coefficient on GDP per hour worked
even turns slightly positive for men, but remains negative for women. The positive
coefficient on country productivity for men is driven by variation within the group of
low-income countries (see Figure C.7 in the Online Appendix).

We find similar regression results for the sample including earnings from self-employment
(see Table C.5 in the Online Appendix). The only substantive difference is that the neg-
ative coefficient on GDP per hour is smaller in an absolute sense in the specification
without individual wages as regressors, and turns positive for both men and women once
individual wages are added. Thus, even more so than in the sample of wage workers,
high hours seem to be driven by low individual wages rather than low country income.

6.3. Individual Hours-Wage Elasticities by Country

How does the hours-income elasticity vary from country to country? To answer this
question, we follow Costa (2000) and regress within each country the logarithm of indi-
vidual hours worked on the log wage and age and age squared, separately for men and
women:
                   log (hi ) = α + βw log (wi ) + δ1 agei + δ2 agei 2 + εi .        (2)

Figure 6 plots the country-specific coefficients βw against log GDP per capita, for men
in Panel (a) and for women in Panel (b). It shows a negative coefficient for low- and
middle-income countries, which increases towards zero starting with the richer end of


                                           20
the middle-income countries, and turns positive for the richest countries. Thus, in the
majority of countries hours are decreasing with the individual wage, while only in the
richest countries this relationship is reversed. This cross-country evidence is in line
with the historical evidence by Huberman and Minns (2007) for a subset of OECD
countries, and the time-series evidence for the United States. Costa (2000) runs the same
regression on U.S. data from different time periods, and finds a negative coefficient in
the 1890s, which increases over time and turns positive in the female sample by 1973
and in the male sample by 1991. Her estimates are included in Figure 6 and are in line
with the values we find in the respective stages of development in the cross-section.13

Thus, in line with the cross-country evidence of a decline in hours worked per worker
with income, in the majority of countries hours per worker are also declining in the
individual wage. Only for the richest countries does the relationship between hours and
individual wages turn positive. The same holds true in the sample including earnings
from self-employment; see Figure C.8 in the Online Appendix.14

6.4. Variation of Employment Rates by Education

For non-working individuals, wage information is not present, so we use education as
a proxy for permanent income. Table 9 shows employment rates by education for the
age group 25 to 54 in the upper panel, and for the age group 55+ in the lower panel,
and separately for men and women. Employment rates are essentially flat by education
in the low-income countries for all four age-gender groups. By contrast, in the middle-
income countries, and even more so in the high-income countries, employment rates are
strongly increasing in education for all age-gender groups.

Of course, this evidence is only suggestive, as education is only a rough proxy for
permanent income. However, the pattern of a positive relationship between employment
rates and education in rich countries, and a flat relationship in poor countries, is in line
with the patterns we find above between hours worked per worker and wages. This
relationship is also positive in rich countries, but negative in poor countries.
  13 Costa restricts the sample to individuals aged 25 to 64. If we do the same, our coefficient for the
United States falls from 0.09 to 0.07 for men, and from 0.12 to 0.10 for women.
  14 Note that measurement error in hours induces a negative bias in the coefficient β , because wages are
                                                                                      w
constructed as earnings divided by hours. We provide some evidence on the scope of this division bias in
Online Appendix Section A.6.5, which leads us to conclude that the division bias might be present, but is
unlikely to substantially alter our findings.

                                                   21
One potential explanation for the diverging evidence from rich and poor countries could
be the size of the welfare state: more generous welfare states in rich countries might
create disincentives for low-productivity workers to participate in the labor market or
work long hours. Another common pattern that we find is that both the gradient of
employment rates in education, and the gradient of hours worked per worker in wages
are more positive in high-income countries for women than for men. This points to
within-household specialization and insurance in richer countries. In the low-income
countries, by contrast, both gradients are similar for men and women.


7. Implications
Summarizing our findings thus far, we establish a robust negative relationship between
hours worked and income on the aggregate level, for different demographic subgroups,
and also on the individual level for the majority of countries. In this section we discuss
two aggregate implications of these findings. The first is about development accounting,
which tries to account for cross-country income differences using observable factors of
production like physical and human capital. Our aggregate findings for average hours
imply that labor productivity differences, and hence total factor productivity (TFP) dif-
ferences, are even larger across countries than previously thought. The second implica-
tion is about welfare differences across countries. Our finding of higher hours worked
for poorer countries, and poor individuals more generally, imply that welfare differences
across countries are even larger than previously thought.

7.1. Development Accounting

What are the implications of the fact that hours per adult are higher in low-income
countries than in high-income countries for the measurement of labor productivity dif-
ferences? The literature on development accounting attempts to explain cross-country
differences in output per worker using aggregate stocks of human and physical capital
per worker. One basic piece of information missing from this literature has been hours
worked per worker, which has limited the ability of researchers to accurately measure
labor productivity (Klenow and Rodrı́guez-Clare, 1997; Hall and Jones, 1999; Caselli,
2005; Hsieh and Klenow, 2010). In the absence of data on hours worked, virtually all
previous studies in this literature have measured labor productivity as GDP per worker.


                                           22
Our data suggest that GDP per worker underestimates the true labor productivity differ-
ences across countries. To investigate this quantitatively, Table 10 shows two different
measures of labor productivity: GDP per worker and GDP per hour. The first three
columns report the respective values for our three core country income groups, normal-
izing the value of the high-income countries for each measure to 100, and the last column
presents the ratio of the respective variable for high- to low-income countries. Focus-
ing on this ratio, GDP per worker is 19.9 times larger in high-income countries than in
low-income countries. We can improve on this by adding our data on hours worked.
Since workers in low-income countries work on average 3.9 hours per week more, the
ratio of GDP per hour in high- over low-income countries is even higher than the ratio
of GDP per worker, specifically amounting to 23.5 instead of 19.9. This corresponds to
18 percent larger labor productivity differences across countries than implied by GDP
per worker. Middle-income countries are also less productive relative to high-income
countries based on hours worked compared to based on employment alone.15

Our findings imply that development accounting rests even more on the residual TFP
term once cross-country differences in hours are taken into consideration. This casts
doubt on theories of development that operate through lower labor input in poorer coun-
tries. Landes (1999), for example, points to hot weather in the tropics as a cost of
working there. In his theory, TFP differences across countries are in part explained by
differences in labor effort, with high effort in economies with higher TFP.

7.2. Welfare Differences Across Countries

How do measured welfare differences between rich and poor countries change if differ-
ences in hours worked are taken into account in addition to consumption differences?
To answer this question, we broadly follow the approach by Jones and Klenow (2016),
who study welfare differences across countries taking into account a wide range of out-
come variables. We focus on hours worked, since our data set has a broader coverage of
hours in low- and middle-income countries than the data in Jones and Klenow (2016).
We rely on the standard neoclassical growth model, as used in the literature analyzing
U.S.-Europe hours differences, see e.g. Prescott (2004). The key modification is a non-
homotheticity in preferences in the form of a subsistence consumption requirement c̄,
  15 Feenstraet al. (2015) recommend using rgd po rather than rgd pe for productivity comparisons across
countries. Online Appendix Table C.6 shows that using rgd po does not alter our conclusions.


                                                  23
as in Ohanian et al. (2008) and Restuccia and Vandenbroucke (2014). This subsistence
consumption requirement implies that the income effect dominates the substitution ef-
fect. As consumption rises, this dominance becomes weaker, and in the limit the two
effects cancel out.

Each country has a representative, infinitely lived household which maximizes life-time
utility:                                                           !
                                  ∞                              1
                                                         1    1+
                      max∞ ∑ β t log (ct − c̄) − α           h φ ,
                                                           1 t
                                                                                     (3)
                    {ct ,ht }t=0 t=0                   1 + φ

where ct is consumption, ht are hours worked, utility is separable in consumption and
leisure, α determines the relative disutility weight of work, and φ is the Frisch elastic-
ity, which allows for a more flexible labor supply elasticity than does Prescott (2004).
The household faces a standard inter-temporal budget constraint, and there is a repre-
sentative firm with an aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function. Combining the
intra-temporal first-order condition of the household and the first-order condition of the
firm gives the following solution for optimal hours:

                                                      φ
                                                       1+φ
                                              1−θ 
                                ht =                      .                        (4)
                                           ct   c̄
                                           yt − yt α


Taking aggregate consumption (csh c in PWT 9.0) and aggregate output (rgd pe in PWT
9.0) from the data, we use this equation to calibrate the preference parameters. We set
the Frisch elasticity equal to φ = 1 (Keane and Rogerson, 2015), and the capital share
equal to θ = 0.3224 (Prescott, 2004). We then calibrate α to match average hours
worked per adult in high income countries, and the subsistence consumption term c̄ to
match hours worked per adult in low income countries. The resulting annual subsis-
tence consumption amounts to $896 in 2011 US $, which is close to the value of $842,
corresponding to 5 percent of the U.S. GDP per capita in 1956, chosen by Ohanian
et al. (2008). Online Appendix Section B includes more details on the model setup,
calibration, and fit.

We use the calibrated utility function to compute a simple welfare metric, building on
the work of Jones and Klenow (2016). Conceptually, the welfare metric imagines giving
the representative household of some country i a choice between two options: first,

                                            24
to work the average hours of individuals in high-income countries and to consume a
fraction λ of the average consumption in these high-income countries. The second
option is to stay in country i, and to work i’s average actual hours and enjoy i’s average
consumption. Formally, the welfare metric in country i is the λi that solves

                                      u(ci , hi ) = u(λi · cHI , hHI )                                  (5)

where cHI and hHI are the average consumption and hours of individuals in our sample
of high-income countries.

Table 11 presents our average λi s by income tercile, normalizing them to have an aver-
age of 100 for the group of high-income countries. In row one, we consider only cross-
country differences in consumption, and ignore differences in hours worked. Countries
in the bottom third of the world income distribution have 8.3 percent of the welfare level
of the richest third. The middle third features 35.4 percent of the welfare of the richest
third. The final column shows that the ratio of the top to bottom third is 12.1, meaning,
as expected, very sizable differences in welfare coming through consumption alone.

The second row adds differences in hours worked to the differences in consumption.
Average welfare in the low-income countries falls to 5.2 percent of welfare in the high-
income countries, leading to a welfare ratio of 19.2 between top and bottom. Thus,
considering differences in hours worked between low- and high-income countries in ad-
dition to differences in consumption increases measured welfare differences by almost
60 percent. Measured welfare differences between middle- and high-income countries
increase by a smaller degree, but still by a sizable 30 percent. Measuring welfare dif-
ferences across countries is not an exact science, and our calculations leave out a lot of
elements of reality that certainly matter for welfare, such as life expectancy and inequal-
ity, as emphasized by Jones and Klenow (2016). Our calculations make however clear
that, all else equal, including cross-country differences in hours worked leads to sub-
stantially larger welfare differences across poor and rich countries than when ignoring
differences in hours.16

  16 Almas  (2012) also argues that welfare of the poorest countries are overstated relative to the richest,
though for a different reason, which is a bias in the PPP methodology used in the PWT.

8. Conclusion
In this paper, we document how hours vary with income across and within countries of
all income levels. To do so, we compile and harmonize international survey data from
countries of all income levels, focusing on a set of countries with the most scope for in-
ternational comparisons. We document that, on average, adults in the developing world
work about fifty percent more hours per week than adults in rich countries. Average
hours worked are higher in developing countries both for men and for women, for all
age and education groups, and along both the extensive and intensive margins. Within
countries, hours are decreasing with income on average and particularly so in the poor-
est countries. In the richest countries, hours worked are flat or increasing in income.
One implication of our findings is that aggregate labor productivity and TFP differences
across countries are larger than previously thought. Moreover, ignoring hours worked
also leads to misleading conclusions about the extent of welfare differences across coun-
tries. Put simply, residents of the poorest countries are not only consumption poor, but
leisure poor as well.

Future work is needed to reconcile the patterns we document in a model that takes
within-country heterogeneity seriously. The decrease in hours with income suggests
preferences in which income effects dominate substitution effects. The flattening of
the negative hours-income relationship within countries with GDP per capita points to
subsistence preferences as a potential driving force. Replicating the fact that the hours-
income relationship actually turns positive for the richest countries suggests additionally
a role for a tax-transfer system that varies systematically with development.

A. Data Appendix
A.1. Survey Time Coverage
Our core countries have the restriction that their surveys cover the entire calendar year. Because surveys
are structured differently across countries, this classification is however not as straightforward as one may
think. We categorize the surveys as follows, based on how much we know about the timing of household
interviews:

(a) For any individual interview the week is known.
(b) For any individual interview the month is known, but not the week.
(c) Any individual interview falls within a period longer than a month and shorter than a quarter, but
    neither the week nor the month is known.
(d) Any individual interview falls within a quarter, but neither the week nor the month is known.
(e) Any individual interview falls within a period longer than a quarter, but neither the week nor the
    month is known.

Going from (a) to (e), the information about the individual interview date becomes less precise. In order
to qualify as a core country, a country has to either

  i. fall in category (a) or (b) and cover each month of the year
 ii. fall in category (d) and cover each quarter
iii. fall in category (c) or (e) and cover the entire year.

To give a concrete example, the CPS in the US is conducted in each month but only covers one week
(specifically, the reference week contains the 12th of a month). Hence, the US falls into category (a) and
in our set of core countries. Brazil also falls in category (a) since we know the exact reference week.
However, the Brazilian survey was conducted only in one week of the year, such that Brazil is not a core
country. Except for case i, it may very well be that not each month is covered since we do not know for
sure whether for countries in categories (c) to (e) interviews took place in each month. Of the 43 core
countries four low-income and five middle-income countries fall in categories (c) to (e), though. Figures
A.1 and A.2 split the countries by core and non-core countries, respectively, and show for each country
the relevant category (a) to (e) and the covered weeks. Angola is not a core country despite covering the
entire year since it misses information on actual hours worked.

A.2. Measuring Employment and Hours Worked
Our population of interest contains i = 1, ..., N individuals and may be only a subset of all individuals in
our survey data (e.g., only men). For all our calculations, we use individual survey weights, but refrain
from displaying them in the following paragraphs for the ease of notation. To measure employment, we
use the self-reported employment status ei of each individual i. ei takes the value of 1 for anyone reporting
to be employed, which includes self-employed and unpaid family workers, and 0 otherwise. We replace
a missing employment status (including answers like “Don’t know” and “Refuse to Answer”) with 1 if
positive actual hours worked are reported, and leave it missing otherwise. In general, missing employment
status information is not very common in our data, with 38 of the 43 core countries having less than one
percent of observations with missing employment status.
Letting the indicator 1ei =nm (where nm stands for non-missing) take the value of 1 if the employment
status is known and 0 otherwise, the employment rate (ER) is given by

                                                  ∑Ni=1 ei 1ei =nm
                                           ER =                    .                                   (A.1)
                                                  ∑Ni=1 1ei =nm

Our measure of hours per worker (H e ) is based on the actual number of hours worked in all jobs hi in the
reference period. This variable is directly available in some surveys, while in other surveys we add up
actual hours in the main job and in all additional jobs. We assign zero hours to non-employed individuals.
Employed individuals may have zero hours if they have been absent from work for the entire reference
period, e.g. because of annual leave or sickness.
We impose a common cap of 112 weekly hours (7 days x 16 hours per day), though slightly lower
country-specific caps may in fact be binding, since the maximum possible hours reported vary by survey.
For example, for the United States, the reported number of actual hours worked in all jobs cannot exceed
99, while in the ELFS the reported actual hours in the main job are capped at 80 and in all additional jobs
at 80 as well. In our data, the number of observations that are top-coded is small and exceeds 0.1 percent
in only seven core countries, with the maximum being 0.87 percent in Tanzania. Bick et al. (2016) show
that capping of hours in all jobs at 80 hours makes little difference for the United States and a subset of
European countries from the ELFS.
Letting 1hi =nm take the value of 1 if actual hours worked in all jobs are available, hours worked employed
are given by
                                                  ∑N ei hi 1hi =nm
                                           H e = i=1                .                                 (A.2)
                                                   ∑Ni=1 ei 1hi =nm

Our measure of hours per adult (H a ) is then obtained by multiplying the extensive (ER) with the intensive
(H e ) margin of labor supply:

                                              ∑Ni=1 ei 1ei =nm ∑Ni=1 ei hi 1hi =nm
                           H a = ER × H e =                   × N                  ,                   (A.3)
                                              ∑Ni=1 1ei =nm     ∑i=1 ei 1hi =nm

which is how Ramey and Francis (2009) measure hours per adult as well. For each country in our data
we use (A.1), (A.2) and (A.3) to compute H a , H e and ER in the aggregate, and by sex, age and education
groups, as well as H e by sector. Note that an alternative approach is to drop all individuals with any
missing data, and to compute H a as the sum of hours over the sum of adults. We prefer our current
approach since it drops fewer observations, though in practice the two approaches provide similar results,
since missing observations are a small fraction of the total in our data.



                                                     4
A.3. Decomposing Hours per Adult
There are several ways to calculate the contribution of differences in the employment rate (ER) and hours
per worker (H e ) to the differences in hours per adult (H a ) across country income groups. One possibility
is as follows:
                       a          a                          e                          e
                                                                                            
                 ln(Hlow ) − ln(Hhigh ) = [ln(ERlow ) + ln(Hlow )] − ln(ERhigh ) + ln(Hhigh )
                       a          a                                          e           e
                                                                                           
                 ln(Hlow ) − ln(Hhigh ) = ln(ERlow ) − ln(ERhigh ) + ln(Hlow    ) − ln(Hhigh )
                                                                      e          e
                                        ln(ERlow ) − ln(ERhigh ) ln(Hlow ) − ln(Hhigh )               (A.4)
                                    1=        a ) − ln(H a )    +     a ) − ln(H a )
                                          ln(Hlow        high     ln(Hlow        high
                                        |          {z          } |         {z         }
                                              ER Contribution          H e Contribution

Using the averages for each country-income group yields a contribution of the log employment rate dif-
ferences of 76.7% and of 25.5% of the log hours per worker differences. Note that the two numbers do
not add up to 100% as suggested by Equation (A.4). This is because average hours per adult in country
income group i are not equal to the product of the average employment rate in country group i and the
average hours per worker in country group i:

                      1 Ni a Ni               1 Ni    1 Ni
              Hia =     ∑  Hc = ∑ ERc × Hce 6= ∑ ERc × ∑ Hce ∀ i = low, med, high.
                      Ni c      c             Ni c    Ni c

If we would do this composition between two countries rather than country groups, the two contributions
would add up to 100%. Obviously, this is not the only possible decomposition. An alternative to the log
hours decomposition via the levels works as follows:
                       a      a                e                 e

Using this specification, the contribution of the employment rate differences to the hours per adult differ-
ence is 73.2% and of the contribution of hours per worker is 29.2%. For the same reason as explained
above the two fractions do not add up to 100%. Moreover, this decomposition is not unique. We weight
the hours per employed difference by ERlow and the employment rate difference by Hhigh      e . Using as
                       e
weights ERhigh and Hlow yields a contribution of the employment rate differences to the hours per adult
difference of 81.3% and of hours per worker of 21.8%. Based on these three possible decompositions,
we conclude that employment rates account for around three quarters of the cross-country differences in
hours per adult, while hours per employed account for around one quarter.

A.4. Hours Data from Penn World Tables and Total Economy Database
Recently, the Penn World Tables (PWT, version 8.1 onwards) and the Total Economy Database (TED),
run by the Conference Board, also released data on annual hours worked per worker, in addition to em-
ployment rates, for an unbalanced panel of countries, with the earliest data coming from the year 1950.
The following comparison is based on PWT 8.1 and TED May 2015 Release. Data on hours worked
per worker are missing much more often than data on employment rates. In the recent cross-section of


                                                        5
countries, the hours data from both data sources cover less countries from the bottom third of the world
income distribution than we do: compared to our 9 core countries and 20 total countries, the TED covers
only 4 countries (Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam), and the PWT none. Moreover, the four
countries in the TED have an average GDP per capita that is one third higher than the average GDP per
capita in our bottom tercile countries. As such, both data sets are ill suited to answer the question of how
hours worked in poor countries compare to the ones in rich countries nowadays.
Yet, going back in time, both data sources cover more countries that would qualify as low-income coun-
tries today. Several notable concerns arose from reading the documentation and the sources cited to
construct these databases, however. The PWT report that hours worked are taken from the TED. Yet, the
PWT apparently decided to include less observations and in many cases, the year-country observations
between both data sets do not coincide, pointing to data revisions. TED itself reports the sources for each
country-year observation. Many of these observations are either interpolated between two years (often
spread a decade apart), or even extrapolated based on average growth rates from countries with available
data in the same continent. Once we exclude these inter- or extrapolated observations, we are left with
215 observations from 14 countries (down from originally 304 observations from 17 countries) that would
qualify as low-income countries today.
Looking further into the sources of these data, we still find extrapolated or interpolated values. For
example, the value for Peru in 1950 is taken from Maddison (1995), who in turn reports that it is set
to the average value of six other available Latin American countries. Most of the 215 observations,
namely 196 observations from 8 countries, come from the Asian Productivity Organization (APO). The
APO, while being generally very careful in constructing total hours worked, itself uses interpolations
and extrapolations to get complete time series of hours for the Asian countries. From conversations
with the APO,1 we got some information on the sources of their data for five out of the eight countries
(China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam). Only for 42 out of the 113 respective country-
year observations do the original sources include any data on hours. Even for these, the sources might
not necessarily use the same concept of hours across countries, and the hours measurement might not
necessarily cover the entire year, but we have no further information on this. As an example for a richer
country, namely Singapore, Nomura and Amano (2012) report for the APO construction of hours that,
while in theory they would like to use actual hours, they have to rely on “mid-year estimates of usual
weekly hours worked multiplied by 48 weeks per year as a crude assumption”.
Thus, we want to stress that the comparability over time and across countries of data from the TED is
much more questionable than the comparability of our data. Moreover, there are much less independent
observations in the country-year database than a first look suggests.

A.5. Potential Biases Resulting from Survey Methodology
No matter how carefully one tries to ensure comparability of different surveys across countries, there
is still the potential for bias arising from limitations in the survey methodology. One such potential
bias may arise from surveyors avoiding specific regions during periods of peak regional labor demand,
such as harvest times, to maximize participation in the surveys. If anything, we argue that it would bias
downward our measured average hours in low-income countries, which have higher shares of employment
in agriculture. Thus, the actual difference between hours in low- and high-income countries would be even
larger than the one we report above for our core countries. An indication for our prior is that hours in low-
income countries fall if we add countries with partial-year surveys to the set of core countries, as shown in
Table 1. This is much less pronounced in middle- and high-income countries, in which seasonality likely
plays less of a role.
   1 We   are extremely grateful to Koji Nomura for providing this information.


                                                     6
A second potential bias may arise from vacation periods, such as annual leave and public holidays. As
Bick et al. (2016) show, hours lost due to vacation days and public holidays are likely underreported even
in surveys that cover each week of the year. While data on vacation days across countries are not readily
available, we suspect that vacation days are increasing in GDP per capita, which would imply that hours
worked are likely overstated to a larger degree in high-income countries than in low-income ones.
A third possible bias comes from child labor, i.e. hours worked by individuals under our lower age bound
of fifteen. Since child labor is more prevalent in low-income countries (Basu, 1999), this would mean
that actual hours worked may be even higher in low-income countries compared to rich countries than
our current calculations suggest. Thus, all these three potential biases indicate that our reported hours
difference between low- and high-income countries is likely a lower bound of the true difference.
A fourth potential concern is that innumeracy among survey respondents in poor countries could lead to
potential over- or underestimates of hours worked there. In this regard, it is reassuring that hours worked
per adult are substantially higher in poor countries even for highly educated individuals.

A.6. Constructing Hourly Wages from the Micro Data

A.6.1. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions
We use the year 2005 for all countries from the EU-SILC, except for Hungary (2006), Romania and Latvia
(2007), Bulgaria and the UK (2008), Ireland (2009), and Switzerland (2010). For UK and Ireland, these
are the first years in which their ELFS surveys cover the entire year, so we use the same years here as in
the main analysis. For the other countries, these are the first years in which the needed earnings measures
are available in the EU-SILC. There are two earnings measures available in the EU-SILC, though not
both for all countries. The first is a measure of annual earnings from the previous year, distinguishing
between earnings from paid employment and from self-employment; the second is a measure of current
monthly earnings in the main job from paid employment. The EU-SILC only contain a measure of usual
weekly hours worked, not a measure of actual hours worked. Therefore, we use usual hours rather than
actual hours as the variable to construct the wage rate. When we rely on monthly earnings from the main
job, we divide by usual hours from the main job; when we rely on total earnings from all jobs, we divide
by usual hours from all jobs. The question of usual hours refers to the current time period. Therefore, if
available, we use the measure of current monthly earnings in the main job (this is the case for Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK);
only if this variable is not available we recur to annual earnings. To correct for the use of usual hours
rather than actual hours, we multiply individual hours with the country-specific ratio of average actual
hours worked (from the ELFS) to average usual hours worked (from the EU-SILC). Thereby, we make
sure that the average hours measure in each country is the same as in our aggregate analysis. Note that
this correction has no effect on the estimation of individual hours on wages within each country, i.e. the
estimation of equation 2.

A.6.2. Wage from Paid Employment
We exclude Namibia and Laos because of missing earnings data. For Namibia, the data set provides a
measure of total household per capita income, which however amounts on average to almost twice GDP
per worker and thus seems implausible.
Earnings refer to gross earnings whenever available, but in some countries to net earnings, and in many
countries it is not clear whether reported earnings are gross or net. If earnings are provided at another
frequency than monthly, we convert them to monthly earnings by multiplying with an appropriate factor


                                                    7
(i.e. 4.33 for weekly earnings, 0.33 for quarterly earnings, etc.). For daily earnings, we multiply with
days worked per week times 4.33 or days worked per month; if none of these are reported, we drop the
observation from the sample, since we do not want to make an assumption how many days an individual
works per month.
Calculating a wage is not always straightforward if an individual has multiple jobs. Our main priority is
to calculate a wage by dividing earnings and hours referring to the same job(s). Both earnings and hours
can in principle be available for (i) main job, (ii) all paid employment jobs, and/or (iii) all jobs, but the
actual availability differs across countries. We proceed in five steps to calculate the best available wage
rate for each individual (referring here always to individuals whose main job is from paid employment):

    1. If an individual has only one job, we divide total earnings by total hours.
    2. If an individual has multiple jobs, but all of them are from paid employment, we proceed the same
       way.
    3. If an individual has multiple jobs, but not all of them from paid employment, we divide earn-
       ings from all paid employment jobs by hours from all paid employment jobs, i.e. excluding both
       earnings and hours from self-employment.
    4. If an individual has multiple jobs, but either earnings or hours from a second (or further) job in
       paid employment are not available, we divide earnings from the main job by hours from the main
       job. Since for the US we know earnings only from the main job, the US falls in this category.
    5. Last, for all other individuals, to whom we could not yet assign a wage rate because of missing
       information, we divide total earnings from paid employment jobs, or if not available earnings from
       main job, by total hours.

In the US we only have earnings in the main job (i.e. the fourth case above), but no actual hours worked
in the main job (only in all jobs). Thus we construct a wage rate dividing earnings in the main job by
usual hours worked in the main job as recommended by NBER in the documentation of the dataset. As
for the European countries, we correct for the use of usual hours rather than actual hours by multiplying
individual hours with the ratio of average actual hours worked to average usual hours worked.
Within each country, we omit the top and bottom one percent of the constructed wage observations.
Table A.1 shows the share of workers in paid employment, as well as average hours of workers in paid
employment, for the three country income groups. Workers in paid employment are clearly a positively
selected sample in the low-income countries.
In the baseline regressions of hours on wages, we always use the same hours variable on the left hand
side that we use to construct the wage rate on the right hand side. Table A.2 shows that our results from
Table 8 are robust to including only individuals with exactly one job, and excluding the top and bottom
decile of wages within each country.

A.6.3. Wage from Paid Employment Plus Self-Employment
For the majority of countries, we have a measure of self-employment earnings on the individual level.
In this case, we calculate the hourly wage as the sum of total earnings from paid and self-employment
divided by total hours in paid and self employment. We now go through the exceptions. In Cambodia,
Iraq, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Timor L’Este, Uganda, and Vietnam, self-employment earnings are only
available at the household level. In Tanzania, agricultural self-employment earnings are available at the
household level, but non-agricultural self-employment earnings (only from the main job) are available at
the individual level, and we sum all self-employment earnings up at the household level. In these nine


                                                     8
countries, we calculate total household earnings by adding all individual earnings from paid employment
to the household earnings from self-employment. Total household earnings are then divided by the sum
of the hours worked of all household members to get a household wage rate. Similarly, the sum of
hours worked of all household members is divided by the number of employed household members to get
average household hours conditional on working. Thus, in the end each household is represented with the
same household wage rate and average household hours observation assigned to each working member.
For Indonesia and Mauritius, self-employment earnings only refer to the main job, not all jobs. The
surveys from Pakistan, Turkey, and the US do not include any self-employment earnings, and for these
three countries total earnings are thus equal to earnings from paid employment. For self-employment
from farming activities, we typically calculate earnings as revenues minus costs, which are often reported
for individual crops, animals, etc., and then added up. The value of own consumption of self-produced
goods is mostly explicitly asked for and then added to revenues. Self-employment earnings in the EU-
SILC are sometimes gross and sometimes net earnings; if both are available in a country, we always take
gross earnings. Since self-employment earnings in the EU-SILC are only available as annual earnings
from the previous year, we also use annual earnings from paid employment from the previous year in this
analysis, even if monthly earnings from paid employment in the current period are available. The only
exception is if someone does not have any additional earnings apart from earnings from paid employment
in the main job; in this case, we continue to work with monthly earnings, if available.
Within each country, we again omit the top and bottom one percent of the constructed wage observations.
Table A.3 shows the share of workers from paid and self employment with missing wages, and the hours
per worker conditional on observing a wage. The cross-country pattern in these hours resembles the one
of hours per worker for the full sample.

A.6.4. Validity Check of Wage Measures
Given that clearly the earnings measures face shortcomings and the underlying data are sometimes of
unclear quality, we conduct a validity check to gauge their general reliability. To do that, we construct a
measure of average earnings per worker in each country, summing up all earnings from paid employment
and dividing by workers in paid employment for the first earnings measure, and summing up all earnings
(including self-employment earnings) and dividing by all individuals working positive hours for the sec-
ond earnings measure. We then compare the respective average earnings per worker to GDP per worker
reported in the Penn World Tables. Figure A.3 shows these two ratios. Focusing first on the earnings
measure from paid employment, the ratio amounts on average to 0.57 in the low-income countries, 0.29
in the middle-income countries, and 0.34 in the high-income countries. This confirms positive selection
into paid employment jobs in low-income countries. For total earnings, the ratios amount on average to
0.47, 0.27, and 0.38, respectively, for the low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Given that the labor
share of GDP is roughly two thirds, but that the labor share also includes some components not measured
in earnings (e.g. employer contributions to social security), these ratios are somewhat on the low side, but
overall not too far off. While for some individual countries they raise some concerns about the measure-
ment of earnings (e.g. in Kenia the ratio is over 1.2 for earnings from paid employment, but in Malawi
just over 0.1), this validity check shows that our earnings measures are overall reasonable.

A.6.5. Some Evidence on Division Bias
Since individual hours worked are the dependent variable in our regressions, but also feature as a denom-
inator on the right hand side of the regression equation in individual wages, any classical measurement
error in hours leads to a spurious negative correlation between hours and wages, see e.g. Borjas (1980).
To gain some insights into the potential size of this division bias, we conduct a number of robustness



                                                     9
checks on a limited sample of countries for which we have an alternative hours variable available. The
main strategy is to run regressions in which the measure of hours on the left hand side is replaced with an
alternative measure (e.g. usual hours worked rather than actual hours worked, which are used to construct
wages). Table A.4 shows results for the US, Turkey, Peru, Mongolia, and Uganda. In all six robustness
checks (2 for Uganda), replacing hours with an alternative measure increases the coefficient βw . Thus,
there is robust evidence for the presence of a division bias. However, the coefficient change is generally
relatively small: with the exception of Peru, the coefficient increases by on average one third, or 0.05 in
absolute terms, and never changes sign. In the Peruvian sample, however, replacing actual hours worked
with usual hours in all jobs increases the coefficient from -0.15 to 0.06.

a wage among all wage workers.

Note: This table reports the coefficient βw from an estimation of the log of individual hours
worked on the log of the individual wage in data from the US, Turkey, Peru, Mongolia,
and Uganda, including age and age squared as explanatory variables. The first row for
each country shows baseline results, in which the dependent hours variable corresponds
to the one used to construct hourly wages. The second row for each country repeats the
baseline estimation on a restricted sample of individuals for whom an alternative hours
measure to the one used in the baseline estimation is available. The third row then shows
results if the alternative hours measure is used as the dependent variable. For Turkey, Peru,
Mongolia, and Uganda, the baseline hours measure is a measure of actual hours worked,
while the alternative one is a measure of usual hours worked (either in the main job or in
all jobs). For the US, it is the other way round. For Uganda, there are two alternative hours
measures. *** means a p-value less than 0.01, ** means a p-value less than 0.05, and *
means a p-value less than 0.10.

B. Model Appendix
In the following paragraphs, we first provide more details on the model setup. We then describe the
calibration and model fit.
The household budget constraint amounts to ct + kt+1 = wt ht + (1 + rt )kt , where wt and rt are the re-
turn to working and capital kt . There is a representative firm with a Cobb-Douglas production function
yt = At ktθ ht1−θ , where yt denotes output, At the efficiency of production, and θ the capital share. As is
standard, household optimality implies that the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and con-
sumption equals the price ratio. Profit maximization of the representative firm implies that the marginal
product of labor equals the wage. Combining these two conditions yields the following Equation (4),
which we restate here:

                                                                  φ
                                                                   1+φ
                                                        1−θ 
                                        ht =                          .
                                                   ct
                                                   yt   − yc̄t α

Rather than solving the full-dynamic model, Prescott (2004) interprets Equation (4) as the equilibrium
value of hours worked given parameters and values for the consumption-output ratio. Our specification
adds values for the subsistence consumption-output ratio as in Ohanian et al. (2008). The consumption-
output ratio, directly taken from the data, captures the dynamic component of the neo-classical growth
model. The difference between the consumption-output ratio and the subsistence consumption-output
ratio in turn determines the size of the income effect. In the context of our data, the higher is output, y,
the lower is the role of subsistence consumption for determining hours, holding everything else equal.
This naturally generates a decreasing relationship between hours worked and output. Figure B.1 shows
the model inputs for each country, evaluated at the calibrated value of c̄, and Figure B.2 plots the data
and model hours against GDP per capita. One key observation is that for Malawi the calibrated subsis-
tence consumption exceeds actual consumption. As a consequence, Equation (4) does not predict hours
for Malawi. This is however not a problem for our welfare analysis, in which the calibrated value of
subsistence consumption cancels out as it is the same across countries. While we match on average hours
per adult perfectly in low- and high-income countries, the model explains about half of the difference
between middle- and high-income countries. Finally, Figure B.3 plots the ratio of welfare to consumption
in each country.
As a last remark, it is worthwhile to mention that Prescott (2004) and Ohanian et al. (2008) use the above
framework to quantify in how far cross-country differences in consumption taxes, labor income taxes, and
government consumption can account for the differences in hours per adult across countries and over time
in OECD countries. To keep the analysis focused, we abstract from these public policies. In a robustness
exercise for a subset of countries for which we have information on these policies, we find that introducing
them does not substantively change our main conclusions; results are available on request.

 Note: The number of countries in each group is in parentheses. The last version of the PWT that
 includes Timor L’Este is version 7.1. We impute GDP per capita for Timor L’Este as follows. We
 use the ratio of GDP per capita (based on rgd pch) in Timor L’Este to GDP per capita in Indonesia
 for the year 2007 from PWT 7.1 and then multiply that ratio with GDP per capita (based on rgd pe)
 from Indonesia from PWT 9.0 for 2007.

Note: This table reports the coefficients from an estimation of a variant of equation 2 on a data set con-
taining individual observations from 46 countries. The dependent variable is the logarithm of individual
hours worked per worker. The explanatory variables are the ones listed in each column, plus age and age
squared. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. *** means a p-value less than 0.01, ** means
a p-value less than 0.05, and * means a p-value less than 0.10.

Table C.6: Labor Productivity Differences Across Countries Using rgd po Instead of
rgd pe

  Note: Labor productivity is computed as the average labor productivity within each country income
  group relative to the average labor productivity of the high-income group, which is normalized to
  100. Only core countries are included in the analysis. In our baseline exercise, we use rgd pe to
  calculate GDP per hour and find 18 percent larger labor productivity differences across countries
  than implied by GDP per worker. Feenstra et al. (2015) recommend using rgd po rather than rgd pe
  for productivity comparisons across countries. This implies 16 percent larger labor productivity
  differences across countries when relying on GDP per hour worked than implied by GDP per worker.

Note: The figure shows the country-specific elasticities of hours to wages, represented by the coefficient βw from
a regression of individual hours worked on individual wages, controlling for age and age squared. Wages include
earnings from self-employment. The upper panel shows results for a sample of men only, and the lower panel
of women only. The red (gray if printed in black and white) data points are corresponding coefficients from US
samples of different years (1890s, 1973, and 1991) reported in Costa (2000).
