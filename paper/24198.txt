Dinner Table Human Capital and Entrepreneurship

                                           ABSTRACT

We document three new facts about entrepreneurship. First, a majority of male entrepreneurs start
a firm in the same or a closely related industry as their fathers’ industry of employment. Second,
this tendency is correlated with intelligence: higher-IQ entrepreneurs are less likely to follow
their fathers. Third, an entrepreneur that starts a firm in the same industry as where his father was
employed tends to outperform entrepreneurs in the same industry whose fathers did not work in
that industry. We consider various explanations for these facts and propose that “dinner table
human capital”, where children obtain industry knowledge through their parents, is an important
factor behind them.

1        Introduction
A considerable literature studies who becomes entrepreneurs, but comparatively less is know
about who becomes successful entrepreneurs; the gap between self-employed and VC-backed
entrepreneurs is so great that they almost seem like distinct experiences. Here we relate en-
trepreneurial choices and outcomes to “dinner table human capital”: knowledge about an indus-
try transmitted via parents that work in that industry. We hypothesize that being exposed to an
industry via parents during upbringing provides valuable information (skills, connections, etc.)
which leads them to become better entrepreneurs in that industry, which in turn can explain
cross-sectional patterns of selection and performance for entrepreneurs.
        To see why learning about an industry via the home environment could be important, con-
sider the case of Larry Page, the co-founder of Google. Larry Page’s father, Carl Page, was
a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence, and his mother taught computer pro-
gramming. Because of his parents’ professions, his childhood home was full of computers and
science magazines, which developed his fascination for technology at an early age.1
        We build a Roy (1951)-type model that links dinner table human capital and aptitude (IQ)
to entrepreneurial entry, sector choice, and startup performance. The underlying intuition of
the model is simple: starting a business in the same industry as one’s parents gives a head start
through the acquired knowledge, but for high-IQ entrepreneurs the value of the opportunity
may be greater in a sector that has higher returns to intelligence. The model has two main
predictions: entrepreneurs have a tendency to start up a business in the same industry as where
their parents were employed, and this tendency will be declining in IQ.
        To study the role of industry knowledge transmitted from parents, we leverage several
datasets from Norway. First, we employ a database that contains longitudinal accounting and
employment information on the universe of incorporated firms established in Norway between
1999 and 2011. The data contain initial ownership shares; we define an entrepreneur as an indi-
vidual with a substantial ownership share in the firm when it is established. Moreover, register
data provides detailed information about all Norwegian workers, while also linking specific in-
dividuals to specific firms and industries, which provides us information about father’s industry.
    1
     In his own words, “I was really lucky to have an environment when I was growing up. My dad was a professor...
of computer science and we had computers ... lying around the house from a really early age. I had kind of a unique
environment.” See https://www.achievement.org/achiever/larry-page/#interview.


                                                        1
The register data also provided information on year of death, if applicable, for parents. We limit
the analysis to men who were 22-to-45 years old in 1996 and for whom we have information
about their fathers’ industries. Finally, in order to learn more about mechanisms, we design and
analyze responses from a large survey directed at entrepreneurs.
   Our first key empirical result is that a man is much more likely to start a business in his fa-
ther’s industry of employment than in other industries. Using the distributions of entrepreneur
and father industries if fathers and entrepreneurs were randomly mixed, we would find that 0.5%
of entrepreneurs choose the same narrowly-defined industry as their fathers. In reality, over 4%
of entrepreneurs start businesses in the same narrow industry. More broadly, eleven percent of
entrepreneurs start firms in the same 2-digit industry as the father’s employment and a substan-
tial majority start up a firm in an industry that is in the top decile of our measure of industry
closeness. Thus, dinner table capital appears potentially important for most entrepreneurs.
   Our second empirical result is that the tendency to follow one’s father declines with IQ.
For example, an entrepreneur with relatively low IQ is about twice as likely to become an
entrepreneur in his father’s industry as an entrepreneur at the top of the IQ scale. Following
one’s father is much more likely than random at the top of the IQ scale, but even more so at the
bottom of the IQ scale.
   Our third empirical result is the most important for understanding new venture success.
We show that ventures founded by people who follow their fathers are more successful than
other ventures. This need not be true as sons following their fathers could be due to greater
awareness of that industry, parental pressure or expectations to enter it, or because of similarities
in tastes. However, none of these alternative explanations would imply that such entrepreneurs
create greater value. We show that ventures founded by those who follow their fathers are
noticeably different from other ventures both at founding and after four years of operation:
They invest substantially more initial capital, are much more likely to survive four years, have
more employees, and are more profitable. They are also much more likely to be positive outliers
in the sense of having a large number of employees or high assets. Ventures started by people
whose father worked in the industries where they start ventures are 100% more likely to become
a top 5% or top 1% startup in terms of size than other new companies.
   By analyzing the population of Norwegian startups, we are less subject to selection biases
commonly encountered in the literature that uses tip-of-the-iceberg datasets. Of course, most

                                                 2
startups in the dataset are small. When we focus on larger ventures – those with at least five (or
ten) employees during the first two years – our results are, if anything, stronger. Dinner table
human capital appears relevant throughout the distribution of startups, including those at the
top.
       We highlight the role of dinner table human capital to explain why sons follow their fathers,
and successfully so. An alternative explanation is that fathers actively help out, for example by
providing cheap labor or by utilizing their network. To address this possibility, we analyze the
subsample of entrepreneurs where the father had died before the founding date. Our estimates
on selection into the same industry and on startup performance are just as strong on this sub-
sample. This suggests that the effects of fathers helping out is less important than the skills and
network from dinner table human capital provided during upbringing.
       By the same argument as in Bell, Chetty, Jaravel, Petkova and Reenen (2019), under the
assumption that differences in genetic ability do not generate differences in propensities to
start up a firm across narrow industry categorizations, our results on entrepreneurial activity
imply that exposure to an industry during upbringing has a causal effect on entrepreneurship.
Intuitively, as long as genetics do not govern one’s ability to start up a firm in, for example,
the metals industry or in the construction industry, the close alignment between the industries
where children start up a firm and the industry they were exposed to must be driven by causal
exposure effects.2
       We conducted an ex-post survey of entrepreneurs in order to learn more about entrepreneurs’
views regarding the possible effects of parents on their venture formation. About 3,800 en-
trepreneurs responded to the survey. With the usual caveat for surveys given limited response
rates, a large majority (84 percent) of same-industry entrepreneurs report that they acquired
industry knowledge from their parents. Conversations at home and observing parents at work
were the most frequent mechanisms for human capital transfer cited by survey respondents.
Obtaining help from parents, through cheap labor or through access to networks, appears less
common. The survey results reinforce the message from the register data analysis: dinner table
human capital appears to be valuable for entrepreneurs.
       In order to assess the possible broader importance of dinner table human capital, we analyze
whether non-entrepreneurs (i.e,. wage workers) also tend to follow their parents. The patterns
   2
       This argument is spelled out in Bell et al. (2019), Section IV.A.


                                                            3
are similar. For example, the fraction being employed in the same 2-digit industry as their
father is much higher than random allocation would suggest, and being employed in the same
5-digit industry as one’s father (but not at the same plant) yields about 4% higher wages, after
controlling for industry fixed effects.
       While it is well-known that entrepreneurship runs in families, partly due to genetics and
partly due to social exposure effects (see e.g., Lindquist, Sol and van Praag (2015)), less is
known about the nature of the exposure effects.3 Our results suggest that knowledge transmis-
sion is a major force in determining what type of firm an entrepreneur starts up, and how well
it performs. In a closely related study, Bell et al. (2019) show that children whose parents hold
patents in a technology class are more likely to patent in exactly that patent class themselves.
Similarly, we find a strong link between father’s industry of work and the industry where a son
starts a firm, even for narrowly defined industry categories. The evidence from the dead father
subsample and from the survey suggest that the main driver is human capital transmission, and
parents helping out less so. Combined, the findings of Bell et al. (2019) and our paper pro-
vide a compelling story of human capital transmission within the family being important for
innovative activity later in life.
       In emphasizing learning based on social interaction, our paper links to literature on peer
effects in entrepreneurship (Giannetti and Simonov (2009), Nanda and Sorensen (2010)). While
these papers focus on the entrepreneurial entry decision, consistent with imitation effects, we
highlight the productivity-augmenting effects of learning from parents. Lerner and Malmendier
(2013) show that learning from other entrepreneurs is important for MBAs. We complement
their findings by demonstrating a different and broader source of entrepreneurial learning: from
parents.4
       Our paper also identifies a more positive side of family business skills than the work on
family firms, which generally shows that passing control to heirs lowers performance (Benned-
   3
      Numerous studies document a tight link between parents and children along broad socio-economic dimen-
sions, including income (e.g., Becker and Tomes (1979) and Chetty, Friedman, Saez, Turner and Yagan (2016)),
education (e.g., Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2005)), wealth (e.g., Charles and Hurst (2003) and Black et al.
(2005)), and health (e.g., Bhalotra and Rawlings (2013)). Less is known in this literature about the underlying
mechanisms. We demonstrate strong learning, or “nurture”, effects in the entrepreneurship setting.
    4
      We also provide insight into the heterogeneity of startups noted by Hurst and Pugsley (2011), Levine and
Rubinstein (2016), Sedlacek and Sterk (2017), and others, by identifying a key source of variation in the type of
business started up by entrepreneurs: father’s industry. We find that a majority of entrepreneurs start out companies
in an industry closely related to where their father worked, and, for narrowly defined industries, they perform better.


                                                          4
sen, Nielsen, Perez-Gonzalez and Wolfenzon (2007) and Perez-Gonzalez (2006)). While that
line of work suggests an heir may not be the best option for running an existing venture, our
results suggest that, on average, an heir who self-selects to stay in his fathers’ industry is more
productive than a typical entrepreneur in that industry.
        The paper proceeds as follows. The next section outlines a simple model of entrepreneurial
entry and performance. Section 3 presents the data and Section 4 contains the core empirical
results. In Section 5 we interpret the results and discuss the likely mechanisms behind them.
Section 6 concludes.



2        Model of entrepreneurial entry and content
To guide the empirical analysis, we construct a stylized model of entrepreneurial choice in the
spirit of Evans and Jovanovic (1989).5 The model considers two decisions; whether to become
an entrepreneur or stay on as a wage worker and, if becoming an entrepreneur, in which sector
to start a firm. We first outline the individual’s decision problem, and then discuss the empirical
implementation of the model.
        The individual maximizes expected payoff. The payoff from being an employee is known
and determined by,
                                                 w = a + h0 ∗ IQ                                 (1)

where w is log wages and a > 0 is an individual-specific term that captures match quality,
random factors, and education level. We will refer to a as “job match”. a captures factors that
drive differences in productivity and happiness in the labor market relative to entrepreneurship,
including risk aversion (as in the model in van Praag and Cramer (2001)). We abstract from
other variables that affect wages such as age and gender.
        The payoff from being an entrepreneur depends on the industry. If the firm is started in the
same sector as a parent worked, which we denote sector 1, the payoff is


                                             e1 = K + h1 ∗ IQ + 1                               (2)


where 1 is an iid random term unknown to the individual at the point of entry. K > 0 captures
    5
        Unlike Evans and Jovanovic (1989), we do not focus on credit constraints.


                                                          5
“dinner table human capital”. It is the value to an entrepreneur of the institutional industry
knowledge transferred from parents.6
       If the firm is started in an industry different from where the entrepreneur’s parents worked,
the payoff depends only on IQ. Denote by Sector 2 the industry in which the returns to IQ is
highest. The payoff in Sector 2 equals,


                                                e2 = h2 ∗ IQ + 2                                    (3)


where 2 is an iid random term unknown to the individual at the point of entry.
       If h1 > h2 then the individual will always prefer sector 1, so the interesting case is h1 < h2 .
There are at least a couple of natural reasons why we might expect h1 to be less than h2 . First,
if the payoff from IQ is linear in each industry 2, 3, 4, .., n, then the upper envelope of payoff
will be convex in IQ. Second, we might expect that high intelligence people have a lower cost
of general education and that general education has a higher return in Sector 2. We return to
this issue below.
       One simplification of the model is that we do not accommodate wage work in the parents’
sector, in which case it is reasonable that there will also be some institutional knowledge that
can enhance productivity (see Laband and Lentz (1983)). This can be accommodated in the
empirical analysis.
       As IQ is observable in our data, we are interested in the role played by IQ in the model.
Due to the linearity of the model, the values of IQ where a particular career option (wage
work, Sector 1 entrepreneurship, or Sector 2 entrepreneurship) is optimal will be a convex set.
We denote by W the convex set where wage work is optimal, by S1 the convex set where
entrepreneurship in Sector 1 (following parents) is optimal, and by S2 the convex set where
entrepreneurship in Sector 2 is optimal. Let us denote by full separation a state where each of
the career options are optimal for an interval of IQ, i.e., each of the three sets are non-empty.
We then have the following.

Remark 1 Selection.
       (i) Full separation implies that the ordering, from lowest IQ to highest IQ, is either {W ,S1 ,S2 }
or {S1 , W ,S2 }. In any full separation, h0 < h2 .
   6
       It is very possible that K depends on IQ. We assume that this relationship is weak.

                                                          6
    (ii) If a ≥ K and h0 < h1 and there is full separation, then the ordering is {W ,S1 ,S2 }.
    (iii) If a < K and h0 ≥ h1 and there is full separation, then the ordering is {S1 ,W ,S2 }.

    Proof. First note that if h0 ≥ h2 then W will dominate S2 because a ≥ 0. Likewise, if
h1 ≥ h2 then S1 dominates S2 because K ≥ 0. Thus h2 ≥ h1 , h0 in order for full separation to
occur. There are two subcases, (a)h0 < h1 < h2 and (b)h1 < h0 < h2 . In case (a), the payoff
from Sector 1 must cross the payoff from wage work from below in order to have full separation.
This implies that a ≥ K and h0 < h1 . The ordering in this case becomes {W ,S1 ,S2 }. In case
(b), the payoff from wage work must cross the payoff from Sector 1 from below in order to
have full separation. This implies that a < K and h0 ≥ h1 . The ordering in this case becomes
{S1 , W ,S2 }.
    The model allows for two types of equilibria with entrepreneurship; the first where the
distribution of IQ for entrepreneurs is bimodal; low IQ individuals follow their parents and
become sector 1 entrepreneurs and high IQ entrepreneurs become Sector 2 entrepreneurs. The
other type of equilibrium is one where Sector 1 and Sector 2 entrepreneurs are both selected on
IQ, but Sector 1 entrepreneurs less so. Independently of whether the ordering is {W ,S1 ,S2 } or
{S1 ,W ,S2 }, we have the following comparative result with respect to IQ.

Remark 2 Increased IQ leads to,
    (i)Entry: Higher propensity to become Sector 2 entrepreneur.
    (ii)Startup type: Higher fraction Sector 2 entrepreneur relative to Sector 1 entrepreneur
    (iii)Entrepreneur performance: Increased venture performance

    Proof. Follows directly from Remark 1.
    The model explains both whether a person becomes an entrepreneur and what type of firm
that person sets up. IQ is the key underlying variable. Conditional on entry, low IQ people
will follow their parents (taking advantage of the human capital gift they received). High IQ
people will also be inclined to follow parents but less so. Figure 1 illustrates the separation of
type {W ,S1 ,S2 }. Individuals who match the wage sector particularly well (high job match or a)
do not choose entrepreneurship. For a lower job match, individuals with a low IQ will choose
Sector 1 entrepreneurship and individuals with a high IQ will choose Sector 2 entrepreneurship.
Note that an increase in K will shift the solid line above ”Sector 1” upwards and hence shift

will rotate both solid lines clockwise.
   We can extend the model by investigating the choice of education. In the appendix, we
show that a version of the model that includes an educational choice preserves the qualitative
properties of Remark 1.
   While the model concerns an individual’s decision, it is straightforward to generate testable
implications for the cross-section as long as hi is determined primarily by market opportunities
and unrelated to individual characteristics. Specifically, the model implies that

   1. Entrepreneurs are more likely to pick their parents’ sector than random chance would
      imply.



                                                          8
    2. Higher-IQ entrepreneurs are less likely to follow their parents than lower-IQ entrepreneurs.

    3. All else equal, entrepreneurs in their parents’ sector will have better performance than
          entrepreneurs outside their parents’ sector.



3        Data

3.1        Norway
We start with a brief description of the Norwegian economy, the tax code, and the basis for the
data collection.7 Norway is an industrialized nation with a population of about 4.7 million. The
GDP per capita in 2008 was about $58,717, well above the EU average. Norway is characterized
by a large middle class and an unusually equal distribution of disposable income.
        The maximum marginal tax rate (for incomes above $75,000) is about 50%, while capital
gains are taxed at a flat 28% rate. There are tax benefits to setting up an incorporated com-
pany, including more beneficial write-offs for expenses such as home office, company car, and
computer equipment, so incorporation is typically preferable beyond very small scale ventures.
Norway also imposes a wealth tax every year. While wealth is only taxed at death in the U.S.
and most other countries, Norwegians pay a 1% annual tax on any net wealth above $120,000.
The government’s statistical agency, Statistics Norway (also known by its Norwegian acronym
SSB) collects yearly data on wealth and income at the individual level from the Norwegian Tax
Agency, and we obtain our data from SSB. Earnings and wealth figures for individuals are pub-
lic information in Norway. This transparency is generally believed to make tax evasion more
difficult and hence data more reliable.
        A considerable fraction of entrepreneurs have parents that are also entrepreneurs, so we need
to consider the possibility that new firms are simply continuations or inheritance of parents’
businesses. To our knowledge there are no tax advantages in starting up a new firm based on the
parents’ firm rather than just continue operations of the parents’ firm. On the other hand, there
are costs associated with transfer of assets from a parents’ firm to a new firm, such as time spent
on additional reporting to the tax authorities, cost of audits, lesser brand recognition, and losing
    7
     The material is taken from the OECD Statistical Profile for Norway: 2010, available at OECD.org, and from
Statistics Norway webpages.


                                                      9
the possibility to write off prior losses. So there appears to be only economic disadvantages
of starting up a new firm based on the parents’ firm rather than continue the parents’ firm. Our
survey, which we discuss in more detail in 5, confirms this impression; none of the respondents
mentioned that their startup was inherited or in other ways a continuation of their parents’ firm.


3.2       Data sources
The analysis draws on several Norwegian register databases. We consider all Norwegian men
who were between the ages of 22 and 45 in 1996 and for whom we have a measure of intelli-
gence from their armed forces entry test. We do not include women in our analysis because we
do not have an IQ measure as women do not take the armed forces test.
       For entrepreneurs, we use a database that consists of the universe of newly incorporated,
limited liability firms in Norway between 1999 and 2007.8 We only consider the first venture
a person starts between 1999 and 2011 and we drop individuals where we cannot identify the
industry of employment for his father. Covering the population of new firms means that the
majority of firms in the database are small. The advantage of this approach is that it will not be
subject to selection biases commonly encountered in the literature that uses ”tip-of-the-iceberg”
datasets (e.g., Hall and Woodward (2010)).9 While many of these firms are small, a substantial
fraction are not, even in the first year: the 75th percentile for book value of assets and number
of employees in the first year of operations is about $400,000 and four, respectively.
       We use two different register datasets, both of which are drawn from the same source. The
larger one, which we use for most of the analysis, includes all ventures started between 1999
and 2011 However, this dataset cannot be matched to the IQ data from the armed services test.
So, for our analysis of the relationship between IQ and entrepreneurial entry, we use the other
source of the same data. This includes all ventures started between 1999 and 2007. All analyses
show consistent results between the two datasets and the exclusion of IQ from some analysis
does not affect the impact of other factors, as we show below.
       The data are compiled from four different registers:
   8
      For 1999, the data contain only a sample of the firms started. Diagnostic tests do not suggest any selection

      Relative to datasets covering the self-employed, as in Hamilton (2000), the advantage is that we can measure
firm performance at a much more detailed level.

   1. Accounting information from Dun & Bradstreet’s database of accounting figures based
      on the annual financial statements submitted to the tax authorities. This data include vari-
      ables such as 5-digit industry code, sales, assets, number of employees, and profits for the
      years 1999-2011. Note that the D&B data contain yearly information on all Norwegian
      incorporated limited liability companies, and not a sample as in the U.S. equivalent. In-
      corporated companies are required to have an external auditor certifying the accounting
      statements in the annual reports.

   2. Data on individuals from 1993 to 2009 compiled by Statistics Norway, covers the Nor-
      wegian adult population and consists of yearly records of workplace ID in addition to
      education level, gender, income, wealth, marital status, and many other variables. The
      data also identifies family relationships.

   3. The IQ data are from the Norwegian military records between 1984 and 2005. In the
      data period, military service was compulsory for every able young man. Before entering
      the service, his psychological suitability is assessed; this occurs for the great majority
      between their 18th and 20th birthday. The IQ measure is an unweighted mean of three
      subtests—arithmetic, word similarities, and figures. The arithmetic test is similar to the
      arithmetic test in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the word test similar to
      the vocabulary test in the WAIS, and the figures test similar to the Raven Progressive
      Matrix test (Black, Devereux and Salvanes (2010)). The IQ score in the data is reported
      in Standard Nine (stanine) units, a method of standardizing raw scores into a nine point
      standard scale with a normal distribution, a mean of five, and a standard deviation of two.

   4. Founding documents submitted by new firms to the government agency ’Brønnøysund-
      registeret’. This register data include the start-up year, total capitalization, and the per-
      sonal identification number and ownership share of all initial owners with at least 10
      percent ownership stake.

   For each new firm identified in 1), we create a list of owners identified through 4) and
compile their associated socio-demographic information from 2) and IQ from 3). We define an
entrepreneur as a person with more than 33% percent ownership of the total shares in a newly
established limited liability firm. We interchangeably refer to this person as “the entrepreneur”

                                                   11
or “the founder”. For a small fraction of firms, the first year of financial reporting, defined
through 1), is different than the year of incorporation defined by 4). For these firms, we define
the first year as the first year of reporting. To avoid counting wealth management vehicles as
start-ups, we omit finance and real estate firms (NACE 65-70).


3.3       Summary statistics
Table 1 displays summary statistics for our sample. Of the roughly 670,000 men who meet our
criteria, 4.1% are entrepreneurs (that is, they start businesses of which they own more than 33%
between 1999 and 2011).10 Entrepreneurs are slightly more educated than the rest of the sample
(an education level of four corresponds to a high school diploma).
       For both groups, we looked at earnings (in thousands of Norwegian Kroner) in their highest
earning year between 1996 and 1998 (that is, while the entrepreneurs are still working in the
labor market). Earnings for the entrepreneurs were almost 70% higher than non-entrepreneurs,
which reflects their slightly higher education and IQ. They also have higher asset levels, sug-
gesting entrepreneurs come from wealthier backgrounds. Wages in Norway respond in expected
ways to education and job market experience. We ran wage regressions (details are in Appendix
Table A.1) on our combined entrepreneur/non-entrepreneur sample where the dependent vari-
able is the log of pay in the person’s highest earning year between 1996 and 1998. Both for
those who become entrepreneurs and those who do not, wages in Norway are related to age,
education, and IQ in a predictable and typical manner.
       Entrepreneurs are relatively likely to have entrepreneur parents, as is well established (see
(Lindquist et al. 2015)). Note that we use a broader proxy for entrepreneurship of parents (self-
employed) than we use for sons/founders (incorporated businesses) because we do not have
incorporation data from when fathers would have founded their businesses.
       We ran regressions (details in Appendix Table A.2) where the dependent variable is an
indicator variable that equals one if the person starts a business between 1999 and 2007 (that
is, the person is in the first column of Panel A of Table 1). These regressions confirm that the
background characteristics in the table all contribute to the decision to become an entrepreneur
as they are each statistically and economically significant predictors of entrepreneurial entry.
  10
    This share is somewhat of an underestimate of the population given we limit the entrepreneur sample to those
people for whom we know what industry employed their fathers.


                                                      12
Higher IQ and being younger predict entrepreneurial entry. Holding these variables fixed, lower
education predicts entrepreneurial entry. Education leads to higher pay before starting a venture
and higher pay in the non-entrepreneurial sector predicts a higher propensity to leave that sector
and become an entrepreneur. Overall, greater earning power leads to higher entrepreneurship
propensity, possibly because those who earn more have more resources to put towards a new
venture and because they have a higher market value that they want to capture rather than split
with an employer.
    Our main proxies for “dinner table human capital” are indicator variables that take the value
of one if the son’s entrepreneurial venture is in the same industry (defined at various levels
of specificity) as the industry where his father worked. Over four percent of entrepreneurs
start up a firm in the same 5-digit industry as their father and over 11% in the same 2-digit
industry. Five-digit industry codes are very narrow including such industries as “Manufacture of
other electronic and electric wires and cables”, “Freight ocean transport”, and “Tax consultancy
activity”.
    The entrepreneurs own, on average, 68% of the companies they start. A male is much more
likely to start a business in an industry in which his father worked and in which he worked before
starting the business than in other industries. For example, about ten percent of entrepreneurs
start up a firm in the same 5-digit industry where they worked before starting the firm.
    Panel B shows the basic features and performance metrics for the ventures founded by the
entrepreneur sample. There are 27,311 such ventures started, though the sample is smaller after
four years due to businesses failing or becoming part of another company. The average new
venture in our sample starts with 163,000 Norwegian Kroner (approximately $18,000 at the
current exchange rate) in invested equity. However, there is a great deal of variation in the
size of these ventures, as evidenced by the standard deviation in the table. The median equity
at founding is 97,000 Kroner and the 90th percentile is about 254,000 Kroner. 8.6% of new
companies are technology-related.
    Four years after founding, 61% of ventures are still operating. Size and profitability are
highly variable at this stage. For example, while the average firm has 2.5 employees, a large
share have none beyond the founders while 6% of firms have at least ten employees. Figure 2
graphs the distribution of initial employment (not counting the founder) by decile. The bottom
five deciles are together in the graph because about half the firms are sole proprietors. Total

employment at the firms in our sample is about 67,000 people, which represents between two
and three percent of the Norwegian labor force.

4        Results

4.1      Following Fathers
As we noted when discussing Table 1, over 4% of entrepreneurs start ventures in the narrowly
defined industry in which their fathers worked. Using the distributions of entrepreneur and fa-
ther industries if fathers and entrepreneurs were randomly mixed, we would find that 0.5% of
entrepreneurs choose the same industry as their fathers.11 Some industries are concentrated ge-
ographically, so we might expect that following one’s father would be common simply because,
for example, both fathers and sons in coastal areas are likely to work in fishing. However, when
we randomly mix entrepreneur and father industries within cities, we find the probability of
    11
    The 0.5% estimate is based on simulations where we randomly assigned the same overall distribution of
industries to fathers as we see in the data and then see how many sons, using their actual industry codes, match
these random father industries.

                                                      14
randomly working in one’s father’s industry increases only slightly to 0.58%. Following one’s
father happens much more often (about nine times as often, to be precise) as we would expect
if it occurred strictly by chance.
       Many entrepreneurs go into industries that are not the same as where their fathers worked but
that are still more closely related than a random industry. For example, the son of a fisherman
might learn about the fish industry from his father but choose a less taxing way to use that
knowledge such as fish wholesaling. To get at such related, but not identical, father/son industry
pairs, we created a “relatedness” index of industries. Specifically, for each two-digit industry,
we divide the other industries into ten deciles of increasing “relatedness” based on the frequency
of job changes into that other industry (details in Appendix A.4). 60% of entrepreneurs do not
start a firm in the same two-digit industry as their fathers, but start a firm in an industry that is in
the tenth (highest) relatedness decile. Thus, about 72% of male entrepreneurs start firms in the
same or closely related industry as their fathers and, as a result, potentially have some dinner
table human capital that we can observe.
       This is our first finding – sons open new ventures in the same industry (or closely related
industry) as their fathers worked at very high rates relative to what we would expect if fathers
did not influence their son’s skills. While other explanations can account for this fact, it is
consistent with the first empirical prediction of our model.


4.2       What Predicts Following One’s Father?
In Table 2, we analyze the role of dinner table human capital in entrepreneurial entry. The table
shows results of linear probability models (results are insensitive to the choice of specification)
where the sample is entrepreneurs who start a business between 1999 and 2007 and the depen-
dent variable equals one if the entrepreneur’s father worked in the same industry.12 Note that,
in this table, we are using the smaller dataset (18,028 entrepreneurs instead of the 27,311 in
the larger sample) so that we can analyze the relationship between entrepreneurial choices and
  12
     All our results are qualitatively similar if we define dinner table human capital as following the industry of
either parent. We focus on fathers given our entrepreneur data is limited to men and that, when our sample was
growing up, fathers were more likely to be attached to the labor force and to be the primary breadwinner in a
household.




                                                       15
IQ.13
       Columns 1 and 2 show regressions that do not control for industry fixed effects and we find
evidence very much in line with what we would expect from our model. The IQ coefficient
suggests that each additional IQ point (or each additional eight IQ points using a standard IQ
scale) lowers the probability of following one’s father by about one fifth (0.008 compared to
0.04 unconditional probability) with no controls (column 1). With controls added in column 2,
the IQ coefficient remains highly significant and indicates more than a 10% increase for each
IQ point.
       This relationship between following one’s father and IQ can be seen graphically in Figure 3.
We drop IQ levels of 1 and 2 as they contain very few people. The steady downward relationship
shows that the most intelligent entrepreneurs (while still much more likely to follow their fathers
than random chance would suggest, as in the Larry Page anecdote), are about half as likely as
the least intelligent entrepreneurs to follow their fathers.




                Figure 3: Entrepreneurial Entry into Father’s 2-Digit Industry by IQ
  13
    Throughout the analysis, we use linear specifications for education, age, IQ, and other explanatory variables.
This makes interpretation of the results quite simple. If we used more flexible formats, the interpretation of all our
key results is unchanged.




                                                         16
   The table and graph confirm the second prediction of our model: specifically, that dinner
table human capital is more important in determining sector for entrepreneurs with less natural
intelligence. These results are consistent with the idea that the gifts people get, in terms of
industry knowledge from their fathers’ labor market experience, are relatively more valuable
for those who have less natural intellectual skill.
   Returning to Table 2, the education result is similar to IQ – those with more general hu-
man capital gained from the education system are less likely to follow their fathers. A one
unit increase in our education measure (for example, changing from a high school graduate to
someone with a bachelor’s degree) decreases the likelihood of an entrepreneur’s venture being
in his father’s industry by a bit less than half of one percentage point (about 10%).
   Overall, we interpret the results in columns 1-2 as a reflection of the match between the
entrepreneur’s ability and the sector his father worked in. If the budding entrepreneur got a
human capital gift from his father in an industry where his stellar intelligence would not be
rewarded, it is in his best interests to forsake the gift and seek his fortune in an industry where
his talents will be better compensated. But if the industry is relatively simple, so that his dinner
table human capital makes him likely to succeed and his natural talents are not great, then he
follows his father.
   This “difference-in-industry” idea is supported by the fact that, when we include industry
fixed effects in column 3 of Table 2, the IQ effect is much smaller (though still statistically
significant). That is, different industries have different likelihoods of attracting entrepreneurs
with dinner table human capital but, within an industry, aptitude as measured by IQ has a smaller
effect on the decision of whether or not to employ dinner table human capital in a new business.
   Column 4 of the table shows that the greater tendency of less intelligent entrepreneurs to
follow their fathers holds within families. That is, even limiting ourselves to the variation
that comes from pairs of sons of the same father who both become entrepreneurs and who
have different IQ scores, we find a strong and significant relationship between intelligence and
choosing an industry where an entrepreneur can use his dinner table human capital.
   Table 2 also shows that entrepreneurs with more assets before they start their venture are
more likely to start businesses in industries where their parents worked. One possible expla-
nation for this is that those whose parents were more successful (and, as a result, gave their
sons more money directly or more opportunities to earn money in their fields) also gave their

                                                17
sons larger dinner table human capital gifts. The table also shows that sons of entrepreneurs
are more likely to follow their parents than sons of non-entrepreneurs. Combining our results
with the fact that children of entrepreneurs are more likely to be entrepreneurs themselves (e.g.,
Lindquist et al. (2015)), it appears parents pass along general entrepreneurial skill and industry-
specific entrepreneurial skill.
       From our model, we expect to find that entrepreneurs with higher aptitude will attract (or
make) larger investments in those firms. This is true in terms of number of employees as we find
that the tendency to follow ones father increases in deciles of initial employment. For example,
in the highest decile in terms of initial employment, almost 15% of entrepreneurs follow their
fathers. Below median-sized firms are founded by entrepreneurs who follow their fathers in 9%
of ventures.
       Table 3 examines the scale of initial investment and returns to the larger dataset as our focus
is now on how following one’s father explains features and success of new ventures.14 The
dependent variable is the log of the amount invested at founding.
       The coefficient on the “Same” variable shows a very strong relationship between the founder
following his father in terms of industry and the initial equity investment. An entrepreneur
son who enters an industry where a father preceded him invests about 12% more equity than
an entrepreneur who does not follow a father in that same industry. An interpretation of this
that follows from the model is that dinner table human capital makes expected returns greater
because they have contacts within the industry or, due to their backgrounds, they are expected
to be more successful. Similarly, their industry knowledge could reduce the risk to investors
who are therefore willing to put up more money.
       In addition, we find (not surprisingly) that entrepreneurs with more assets start larger ven-
tures and that entrepreneurial children of entrepreneurs start larger ventures.


4.3       Startup performance
We look at longer-term performance in Table 4. Column 1 of both panels shows linear prob-
ability models where the dependent variable equals one if the business is still operating four
years after founding. Consistent with our model’s prediction that dinner table human capital
  14
    Examining the smaller dataset that included IQ, we find that higher IQ leads to larger initial investments,
though the relationship is not economically large.


                                                      18
enhances firm productivity, survival is noticeably higher for those with dinner table human cap-
ital. Survival is six percentage points, or about 10%, higher for those who follow their parents.
Also, entrepreneurs with more assets before they start their venture and those who invest more
in their ventures initially are more likely to survive.15
       The next three columns of the table shows results for continuous measures of scale – Log
of sales, number of employees, and log of assets. Some of these regressions are on smaller
samples because we cannot include businesses that are no longer operating or that have zero or
negative assets. We set employees to zero if the venture is no longer operating four years after
founding.
       The relationship between these performance measures and having a parent who worked in
the founder’s industry again has a strong and consistently positive association with performance.
Dinner table human capital increases log sales and log assets by a third or more. The relation-
ship between following one’s father and number of employees is statistically more consistent
and quite large economically. When a venture is four years old, it is likely to have one-to-two
more employees if the business is in the same industry as that in which the founder’s father
worked. This is a very large effect given the average surviving four-year-old firm has 2.5 em-
ployees.
       The final column focuses on EBITDA (operating profits) and leads to similar conclusions.
We use the actual level of operating profit because many values are negative. The “Same”
coefficient indicates that sons who follow their fathers make 200-250 thousand kroners more
per year which is almost equal to the mean of operating profits.
       In Table 5, we look at extreme outcomes rather than means. The dependent variables in the
regressions in this table equal one if the firm is in the top five percent of all firms in the firm’s
two-digit industry in the relevant category. Firms that do not survive are included, so there is no
depletion of the sample (and, naturally, the dependent variable can only equal one for surviving
firms).
       The regressions (which are linear probability models) support the conclusion that dinner
table human capital is valuable. Founding a business in the same industry as a father predicts
  15
    In order to use the larger dataset, we do not control for IQ in any of our performance analysis. This does not
present bias, however. In the more limited dataset, we found that entrepreneur IQ is positively related to startup
performance but the relationship is not economically large. More importantly, the relationship between “same” (or
other explanatory variables) and performance is not affected by whether or not IQ is included in the regression.


                                                       19
50 to 100% higher probability of being a positive outlier for total assets, sales, employees,
and operating profit. We found very similar results when looking at the relationship between
”Same” and a startup being in the top 1% or 2% in its industry on these same dimensions.
   The effects of the other explanatory variables are not as consistent but education predicts a
slightly greater probability of being a positive outlier. As we might expect, entrepreneurs who
have more assets before starting their venture or who invest more equity at the start of their
ventures are more likely to be positive outliers. For example, a 10% increase in the amount
of equity invested initially is associated with 0.9% and 1.2% higher probability of being in
the top five percent of ventures (within a given industry) as measured by employees or assets,
respectively.
   We have shown that firms started up in the same industry as where the entrepreneurs father
worked have a higher chance of ending up in the top 5% (and top 1%) of startups in terms of
sales or job creation. We also saw that initially larger firms are more likely to be founded by
followers of their fathers. We now analyze whether the relationship between starting up in the
same business as ones father is stronger or weaker across the initial size distribution. Figure 4
plots the following one’s father “excess performance” in terms of log of sales relative to other
startups in an industry, across different firm sizes.
   The strongest performance results are for the largest startups. For example, in the largest
decile, the coefficient on excess log sales is about 0.3 (as opposed to a little below 0.2 for the
broader sample). This indicates that, for the firms that are the largest initially, the scale in terms
of sales at year four are about 30% higher for firms where the founder followed his father. So
following one’s father is closely related to higher initial scale and, even controlling for initial
scale, greater scale after four years.
   In Table 6 we repeat the survival and employee analyses from Tables 4 and 5 but we add two
other measures of starting a business in the entrepreneur’s father’s industry. “Same – 2-digit” is
an indicator variable for the start-up being in the same two-digit industry as the father worked
and “Related” is an indicator for the startup being in an industry in the top decile of industries
in terms of turnover from the father’s industry to the industry of the startup (see discussion
above and details in Appendix A.4). These definitions expand the number of entrepreneurs in
industries related to their fathers substantially. While four percent of entrepreneurs are classified
as “Same”, over eleven percent are “Same2” and 72% are in related industries (11.4% are in the

                                                 20
                       Figure 4: Effect of Following Father by Initial Size


same 2-digit industry and the rest are in a related industry).
   As the table shows, the performance relationship of starting a business in one’s father’s five-
digit industry is much stronger than two-digit and related industries. While sons have a high
propensity to start businesses in the same two-digit industries as their fathers worked and in
related industries, these startups outperform other startups marginally. This is consistent with
dinner table human capital making future entrepreneurs aware of a range of businesses related
to their fathers’ industry but conveying skills that are particularly valuable in their fathers’ area
of expertise defined quite narrowly.
   The conclusion from Tables 4 and 5 is clear – businesses started by sons that are in the
same industry that employs (or employed) their fathers are more successful, on average, than
those that do not. This relationship is much stronger and more consistent than the relationship
between performance and other features of the founder including age, education, and financial
background.
   While dinner table human capital appears to be important to individual entrepreneurs, we
now consider the aggregate implications for the economy. Our data is unique in that we follow
all startups (for men between the ages of 22 and 45) from 1999 to 2011 and allow us to perform

                                                 21
some simple calculations that address this issue.
         About 4% of startups are in the same five-digit industry as the father was employed. For
these startups, Table 4 Panel B, column 3, suggests that the year four employment effect is
about 40%. This suggests that startups, as a whole, create approximately 1.6% more jobs than
they would in the absence of dinner table human capital. These calculations suggest that human
capital obtained at the dinner table have effects on aggregate job creation.



5         Mechanisms and Discussion
About four percent of entrepreneurs start a firm in the same very narrowly defined industry as
their fathers worked and over half start a venture in a closely related industry. Entrepreneurs
may follow their parents because they obtained dinner table human capital through their up-
bringing. But they may also follow their parents because the parents can provide direct assis-
tance in starting the company through working for the company or providing contacts.
         In this section, we look for the mechanisms behind the results we have presented so far and
for evidence consistent with a more causal connection between dinner table capital and both
entrepreneurial decisions and outcomes. We examine mechanisms for our earlier results in two
ways. First, we can look at a subsample of entrepreneurs whose fathers died before they started
their companies. Second, by analyzing the findings of our survey, we can better understand how
dinner table human capital is obtained.


5.1         Dead Father Subsample
We now consider the subsample of entrepreneurs whose fathers died before they started their
companies.16 The propensity to follow one’s father is still very strong even for entrepreneurs
whose fathers died before the son’s venture was launched. The share of entrepreneurs who start
companies in the same 2-digit industry as their fathers is 10.0% for sons whose fathers are dead
when they start the company versus 11.7% for those whose fathers are still alive. For 5-digit
    16
     If the entrepreneur’s father died before 1986, then we do not know what industry the father worked in and, as
a result, the entrepreneur was dropped from all our analysis.




                                                       22
industries, the shares are 3.4% and 4.3%, respectively.17
       These numbers indicate that the propensity to open a business in an entrepreneur’s father’s
industry is almost as high for those whose fathers are dead when the venture is started, strongly
suggesting that these entrepreneurs are not choosing to open a business where their fathers can
directly help them. The high rate at which sons follow their fathers even if the father has died
indicates that dinner table human capital, rather than direct help, likely drives the high rate at
which entrepreneurs follow their fathers when they start ventures.18
       Though our focus in this section is on the larger dataset, we did look at the relationship
between following one’s father and IQ using the smaller dataset for which we have the en-
trepreneur’s IQ. Appendix Figure 5 shows that the relationship between intelligence and fol-
lowing one’s father in an entrepreneurial venture holds when the father dies before the business
was started.
       Panel A of Table 7 extends the dead father analysis to the performance regressions in Panel
B of Table 4. We add two new explanatory variables. First, ”Father died” is a dummy variable
that equals one if the entrepreneur’s father died between 1986 and when the new business was
started. These fathers were not available to help with the business. The second new explanatory
variable is an interaction between the father’s death and the entrepreneur’s business being in the
same industry as his father. If the reason entrepreneurs who follow their fathers are successful
is because their fathers directly contribute to the success of the new business, then we should
find that the value of following one’s father is limited to entrepreneurs whose fathers are alive
when they start the business.
       The number of dead fathers is small so that the interaction term is noisy in some of these
specifications. But the estimates are precise enough to suggest that there is no reason to think
the relationship between following one’s father and entrepreneurial performance is limited to
sons whose fathers are available to help with the new venture. In fact, the point estimates indi-
cate that, if anything, the performance effects are higher for those whose fathers die before they
start their ventures. In Panel B, we run the performance regressions limiting the sample to en-
  17
      Both the 2-digit and 5-digit differences across the two groups are significant and all groups are significantly
higher than the level that would be produced by random sorting of industries.
   18
      (Kalil, Mogstad, Rege and Votruba 2016) show that the presence of Norwegian fathers is also important in
determining children’s educational attainment. They also use death of fathers to separate children who live with
their fathers from those who do not.



                                                        23
trepreneurs whose fathers died before they started their companies. The coefficient on following
one’s father are similar in magnitude to the broader sample and statistically significant.
       We also ran regressions where we ensure that the value of following one’s father is not
simply a matter of passing down entrepreneurial skills (as would be suggested by Lindquist et
al. (2015)) by looking at the relationship of following one’s father for entrepreneurs who did
not have a parent who was an entrepreneur. That is, we limited the sample to entrepreneurs
who, as far as we can tell, had parents that worked in the labor market and never started their
own business. The results for the performance of these entrepreneurs is very similar to that for
the sample as a whole shown in Panel B of Table 4. It appears that our measure of following a
father by industry is not simply a proxy for following a parent into entrepreneurship.


5.2      Entrepreneur Survey
To help inform how dinner table human capital is transferred from parents to children, we
deployed a survey of Norwegian entrepreneurs. Appendix A.3 details the survey questions and
methodology and Appendix Table A.4 provides summary statistics of the responses. The survey
was sent to all Norwegian companies with an initial accounting year between 2008 and 2014 that
we were able to collect contact information from, about 50% of the total number of startups, and,
to be consistent with our empirical register data sample, where one person owned at least one-
third of the company and the venture was not an investment vehicle.19 We obtained a response
rate of approximately 15% (3,800 firms). The respondents are not necessarily representative, so
we do not want to make strong claims based on the survey results. But the responses are quite
suggestive of the value of dinner table human capital for entrepreneurs.
       Of the survey respondents, about 15% said yes (for one or both parents) when asked, “Did
your parents have work experience from the same or a closely related industry before your
started up the firm?” Of this same-industry group, 84 percent report that they acquired at least
some industry knowledge from their parents and almost half report that they have obtained
”much” industry knowledge. Direct exposure to parents, through observing them at work (75%)
and conversations at home (58%) are the most common ways of obtaining knowledge. More
  19
    We focused our empirical analysis above on men because we do not have IQ data for women. However, we
did not limit our survey to male entrepreneurs and we asked about mothers’ influence as well as fathers’. The
conclusions of our survey responses are similar if we focus on men.


                                                     24
indirect ways such as providing access to parents’ network in the industry (30%) or to industry
literature (21%) were cited less often.
       Among those with parental work experience from the same or a closely related industry, a
majority (60%) have not received any help from parents. Among the minority that do receive
direct parental support, obtaining advice (51%) and parents working for the firm (37%) are
the most common channels of assistance. Parents providing financial help (26%), helping out
with obtaining access to customers (22%), with suppliers (15%), or sitting on the board (19%)
are also important. Among those with parents without industry experience, the responses are
markedly different. Here, a large majority, about 85%, received no help from parents, and the
remaining 15% received mainly financial help (54% in this group) and advice (42% in this
group). More direct operational help such as providing access to customers or to suppliers was
very uncommon (4% and 1% in this group). About 51% of the entrepreneurs with parental
work experience from the industry report that the parents indirectly or directly had affected
startup performance in a positive way, while for those without such parental work experience
the fraction is considerably smaller (about 18%). Consistent with the findings from the register
data (Table 3), a much higher fraction of same-industry entrepreneurs had parents that also were
entrepreneurs (48% vs 23%).
       The answers to the survey question “Please comment on what role your parents played
in providing industry knowledge prior to starting up the firm” provide anecdotal evidence of
intergenerational transfer of knowledge and the value of dinner table human capital:20

    • “My parents worked in medicine and pharmacy, as well as having an extra job with phar-
         macy at home. The part of the work that was done at home was fascinating. Other than
         that, it was summer jobs in pharmacies and the Norwegian Medicine Depot.”

    • “My father and his parents have always run a clothing shop. My mother was a decorator.
         I now create my own clothing brand that I sell through my own store and online. From
         the age of 13, I worked in the shop and learned a lot from both parents. This background
         made it easy for me to start my own, and I have always received a lot of moral support
         from home. Financial support has come when special needs via private loans.”
  20
    This open-ended question was asked at the end of the survey after the respondent had already answered more
objective multiple choice questions about parental involvement. Translations below are from Norwegian using
Google Translate, with some minor edits for syntax by the authors.

                                                     25
    • “Through conversations, visiting relationships, working with father in adolescence.”

    • “Through my parents’ networks, I gained work experience from the industry through
         summer jobs before I graduated.”

    • “I went up on a passenger ship where my father was a machine driver and thus gained
         maritime experience. This led to the choice of career direction which again revealed
         innovation needs in the market segment.”

    • “My father was CFO in an engineering company, so I got some exposure to a similar
         industry through him. But he died before I started up the company.”

    • “My father worked from home for a while when I was young. He also worked in the
         industry when I started up. I got some jobs directly from his employer. Certainly never
         straight from him, but there was probably some help from his side.”

    • “Via customer contacts and metrics.”

    • “Started working in my father’s business at the age of 16. I picked out what he did well
         and implemented this in my own business. I also learned from his mistakes and so did
         not make the same mistakes myself.”

       With the obvious caveat of limited response and sample selection issues, the responses to our
survey support our dinner table human capital hypothesis. A large majority of same-industry
entrepreneurs have obtained industry knowledge from their parents, typically through conver-
sations at home or observing parents working. Parental help appears to play a role, but less so
than the transmission of dinner table human capital.


5.3       Comparison to Wage Workers
Our model and our analysis to this point limit the value of dinner table human capital to en-
trepreneurs. However, children that do not become entrepreneurs (i.e., wage workers) also
often work in jobs similar to those of their parents.21
  21
    Laband and Lentz (1983) show that U.S. sons are much more likely to follow their fathers in terms of oc-
cupation than random chance would suggest. Using much more recent data, Li (2017) shows the same for U.S.


                                                    26
    Using a sample similar to our analysis of entrepreneurship, we analyzed the value of dinner
table human capital for Norwegian wage workers. We found that dinner table human capital
is important for this broader sample, though marginally less important than for entrepreneurs.
Because wage workers are not our focus, the details of these analyses are in the Appendix. Our
findings are:

    • Wage workers follow their fathers into industries in a manner similar to entrepreneurs,
       though the relationship is somewhat weaker.

    • Following one’s father is associated with lower IQ though the relationship between IQ and
       following one’s father is smaller economically for wage workers than for entrepreneurs.

    • Wage workers who follow their fathers earn 4% higher wages which, while non-trivial,
       is smaller than the performance relationship of entrepreneurs following their fathers in
       terms of size and survival of new ventures.

    Overall, our analysis of wage workers reinforces the idea that dinner table human capital
is important for both workers and entrepreneurs but that the value to entrepreneurs is generally
higher than to wage workers.



6     Conclusion
A majority of entrepreneurs start a firm in the same or a closely related industry as their fathers’
industry of employment. This tendency is correlated with intelligence: higher-IQ entrepreneurs
are less likely to follow their fathers. We also showed that businesses started by people who
follow the industry in which their fathers worked are noticeably more successful after four
years of operation by several different measures. We interpret this as suggesting that dinner
table human capital is quite valuable and that many parents give their children a gift of industry
knowledge. This conclusion is supported by analysis of the subset of entrepreneurs where the
father is dead upon starting up the firm, by our survey evidence, and by the analysis of data for
all workers in Norway.
workers and their parents, regardless of gender. Kramarz and Skans (2014) show that Swedish children join the
establishment where a parent works (and, as a result, work in the same industry as the parent) at a high rate. Unlike
these papers, we focus on following parents in terms of industry rather than occupation because occupation is less
relevant for entrepreneurs.

                                                        27
   Our findings shed some light on what happens in the entrepreneurial process and identifies
a source of heterogeneity in entrepreneurship. At a broader level, our work suggests that inter-
action within the family is an important mechanism for the transmission of human capital that
is valuable to innovative activity.

are missing (due to operation closing), missing, or negative (Log Sales and Log Assets), or
when assets are zero or missing (ROA). Standard errors in parentheses.

Notes: Linear probability models where dependent variable = 1 if company is in top 5%, within
its 2-digit industry, of the relevant category in Year 4 after founding. All specifications include
Year Dummies. Sample is reduced because companies in 2-digit industries with fewer than 20
companies are dropped.

 Note: These regressions are identical to the regressions in Table 5, Panel B, except these re-
 gressions include two additional measures of entrepreneurs following their fathers. “Same –
 2-digit” equals one if the entrepreneur’s business is in the same 2-digit industry as where his
 father worked and “Related” equals one if the entrepreneur’s business is in an industry closely
 related to the one in which his father worked.

Figure 5: Entrepreneurial Entry into Father’s Industry by IQ, if Father Dead When Business
Started




A.2    Education
We can extend the model by investigating the choice of education. We think of education as
something that gives general human capital, so that productivity as wage worker becomes


                                   w = a + k0 s + h0 ∗ IQ                                 (4)


where s is years of education. The productivity as Sector 1 entrepreneur becomes,


                               e1 = K + k1 s + h1 ∗ IQ + 1                               (5)


and as Sector 2 entrepreneur becomes,


                                  e2 = k2 s + h2 ∗ IQ + 2 .                              (6)



                                             42
Moreover, in line with much of the education literature we assume that education is cheaper to
acquire for high-IQ individuals. We assume that the cost of education is convex and decreasing
in IQ,
                                                   s2
                                          c(s) =                                             (7)
                                                   IQ
The convexity in educational cost ensures interior solutions.
   From these assumptions we see immediately that higher-IQ individuals will obtain higher
schooling levels and be more productive both as workers and as entrepreneurs. Schooling acts
as a shifter of productivity but does not alter the qualitative properties of Remark 1 and 2. As
we have made no assumptions on the relative magnitudes of k0 , k1 and k2 , the model does not
provide predictions on in which industry education is more valuable. Finally note that we can
also imagine versions of the model where schooling interacts with IQ. If, for example, education
leads to a large shift upwards in h0 then the sorting properties of Remark 1 can be altered. We
summarize,

A.3       Entrepreneur survey
We conducted an ex-post survey of entrepreneurs, with two purposes. First, we wished to ex-
plore how industry knowledge is transferred from parents to children. Second, parents provide
input not only through human capital transmission but also by helping out in their child’s en-
trepreneurial activity, and we wished to explore the importance of this complementary channel.


A.3.1      Survey outline

The web-based survey was conducted in August 2017. The fifteen survey questions are repro-
duced below. Through register data we identified all new incorporated companies that had (a)
their first accounting year between 2008 and 2014, (b) at least one personal owner with more
than 1/3 ownership initially, and (c) were not financial or holding companies. (a) was chosen
because in recently started firms it would be easier to track down the entrepreneur, and (b) and
(c) ensured a similar sampling to the main analysis. This constituted 56,161 firms. We next ob-
tained email address or cell phone number (or both) from the Brønnøysund register for 26,760
firms (about 48 percent).22 Below we discuss the main findings.


A.3.2      Survey results

Parental background from industry
       About 15 percent of entrepreneurs have parents with work experience from the same or a
closely related industry. This is higher than our matching based on exact (2-sector) industry
codes in the register data, which had about 10 percent of males starting up a firm in the same
industry as their father worked in. Almost 80 percent of the entrepreneurs in the survey are
male, and the fraction of male entrepreneurs that follow their parents is substantially higher
than for female entrepreneurs (16 versus 11 percent).
       Transmission of industry knowledge
  22
      Reporting email address or cell phone number to Brønnøysund is voluntary for firms, which in addition to
attrition explains the limited coverage. Diagnostic tests suggest that the sample of firms with contact details are
not very different from the ones without. The response rate of the survey was about 15 percent. Startups of
respondents and non-respondents, the latter group including those without contact information and those with
contact information but non-response to survey, appear fairly balanced on observables. These and other details of
the survey are available from the authors.




                                                       44
    Among those with parental work experience from the same industry, a large majority (84%)
state that they have obtained at least some industry knowledge from parents (Q7). About 40%
of these report that they have obtained “much” such knowledge. Direct exposure to parents,
through observing them at work (75%) and conversations at home (58%) are the most common
ways of obtaining knowledge (Q8). More indirect ways such as providing access to parents’
network in the industry or to industry literature, are less common. About two thirds (65%) of
subjects who had parents with work experience from the same industry report that they were
more likely to start up a firm in that industry (rather than to start up a firm in a different industry)
because of their parents work experience. The answers to the qualitative question (Q12) provide
stories of intergenerational transfer of knowledge. Many respondents say that they obtained
industry knowledge through ”shop talk” at home, or through following their parents to work,
quite frequently through summer jobs.
    Parental help
    Among those with parental work experience from the same or a closely related industry, a
majority (60%) has not received any help from parents. Of those that received help, about a
quarter received much help. Obtaining advice (51%) and parents working for the firm (37%)
are the most common channels of assistance. Parents providing financial help (26%), helping
out with obtaining access to customers (22%), with suppliers (15%), or sitting on the board
(19%) are less common. Among those with parents without industry experience, the responses
are markedly different. Here, a large majority, about 85%, received no help from parents, and
the remaining 15% received mainly financial help (54% in this group) and advice (42% in this
group). More direct operational help such as providing access to customers or to suppliers was
very uncommon (4% and 1% in this group).
    Parents affecting performance
    Q11 asks whether parents directly or indirectly have affected the performance (growth, prof-
itability, survival) of the startup. About 51% of the entrepreneurs with parental work experience
from the industry report that the parents had affected startup performance in a positive way,
while for those without such parental work experience the fraction is considerably smaller,
(about 18%).
    Other findings
    A much higher fraction of same-industry entrepreneurs had parents that also were en-

                                                  45
trepreneurs (48% vs 23%), and more than half of the 48% were entrepreneurs in the same
industry. It is well-known that entrepreneurship runs in families, but not previously known that
this appears to be especially so for same-industry entrepreneurs. One concern is that the new
firms are continuations of their parents firm. However, the written comments from entrepreneurs
(Q14 and Q15) does not suggest a continuation/inheritance channel – none of the stories told
by entrepreneurs indicate that their firm is a direct continuation of their parents’ firm.
   Summary
   With the obvious caveat of limited response and sample selection issues, it appears that
a large majority of same-industry entrepreneurs have obtained industry knowledge from their
parents. The learning typically occurred through conversations at home or observing parents
working. Parental help appears to play a not unimportant, but lesser, role.

A.4     Relatedness
More than 4 percent of entrepreneurs start a firm in the same 5-digit industry as their fathers’
work experience, and more than 11 percent in the same 2-digit industry. Of the remaining 89
percent of entrepreneurs, about 52 percent start a firm in a closely related industry. Here we
outline the methodology behind this finding.


A.4.1   Definitions

We base our measures of industry relatedness on the frequency of labor market transitions be-
tween pairs of industries. First define,

                                                 (1)
                                            fAB = nAB /nA                                         (8)


where nAB is the total number of workers that move from industry A to industry B in a given
                                                                     (1)
year, and nA is the number of workers leaving industry A. fAB is the fraction of workers
leaving industry A that move to industry B, and measures the extent to which labor transitions
                                                                      (1)
from industry A tends to flow in the direction of industry B. fAB is intended to capture the
extent to which industry-specific human capital is ”portable” from industry A to industry B. It
is conceivable that labor flows between two industries are predominantly one-directional; we
                          (1)    (1)        P      (1)             P
therefore do not require fAB = fBA . Clearly ∀B fAB = 1 because ∀B nAB = nA . The first
                                           (1)
measure of relatedness, r1 , is simply fAB converted to deciles based on rank. For given A, the
                                        (1)
10% B industries with the smallest fAB obtains r1 = 1, the 10% B industries with the largest
 (1)
fAB obtains r1 = 10, and so on.
   The measure r1 has the inconvenience that large industries B will tend to have a high nAB ,
so that r1 tends to be high for any large industry B. To account for size, we construct two
alternative relatedness measures. The first subtracts the size of industry B in the first step, i.e.,

                                           (2)         (1)
                                       fAB = fAB − NB /N                                          (9)


where NB is the number of workers employed in industry B in a given year, and N is the
                                                                                    (2)
number of workers in the economy. The second relatedness measure, r2 , is fAB converted to
                                                                             (2)
deciles based on rank, so that the 10% B industries with the smallest fAB obtains r1 = 1, the

                                                       52
                                         (2)
10% B industries with the largest fAB obtains r1 = 10, and so on. Industry B being large does
not necessarily translate into a large labor flow into B (think about downsizing industries). Our
third (and main) measure of relatedness, r3 , uses the size of the flow into B, rather than the size
of B as in r2 ,
                                            (3)     (1)
                                          fAB = fAB − MB /M                                               (10)

where MB is the total number of workers that move to industry B in a given year, and M is the
total number of workers that switch industries. As MB /M is the probability that a randomly
                                                                  (3)
chosen worker moves to industry B, we can interpret fAB as the excess probability, over and
                                                                                                   (3)
above a random switch, of a worker from sector A choosing sector B. Note that fAB can be
negative, if the switch from A to B is less likely to occur than for a random worker. The third
                                  (3)
relatedness measure, r3 , is fAB converted to decile format based on rank, so that the 10% B
                                   (3)                                                                     (3)
industries with the smallest fAB obtains r1 = 1, the 10% B industries with the largest fAB
obtains r1 = 10, and so on.


A.4.2      Estimated relatedness
                  (i)
We estimate fAB using yearly transitions in industry code for Norwegian workers in the period
1996-2006. We first sample the population of workers that are full-time employed in all years
1996-2006. This balanced sample constitutes about 490.000 individuals. For each year and
industry, we calculate the number of workers that change industry, and which industry they
move to. On average, about 23.000 individuals (5%) change 2-digit industry from one year to
the next. Such changes are typically due to a worker moving to a different firm, but can also
be the firm changing industry code. We include both type of changes as both are presumably
informative about the relatedness of two industries. Our results are robust to including only
changes of the first kind.
       There are 59 industries at the 2-digit level. We drop two industries where only a handful
                                                                               (i)
of workers were employed,23 so that we calculate 3192 (57*56) fAB for each year. We then
                          (i)
compute an average fAB across years before converting to deciles and obtain ri . Tables of
summary statistics and top industry pairs are available from the authors. Figure 6 plots the
  23
     These two industries were ”Activities of households as employers of domestic staff” (nace2 95) and ”Extra-
territorial organizations and bodies” (nace2 99).

mean fAB within the ten deciles of relatedness:




                    Figure 6: Distribution of Primary Relatedness Measure

   For deciles 1-7, we see that the excess probability is negative, meaning that transition to
these industries are less likely than for a randomly chosen worker. If industry B is in Decile
                                                      (3)
ten in terms of relatedness from industry A, then fAB (i.e., excess probability of moving into
B from A) is about eight percent. For Decile nine, the excess probability is much lower, about
two percent.


A.4.3   Entrepreneurs relatedness to father’s industry

We now investigate how close the industry relation is between father’s industry of work and the
startup industry, for entrepreneurs that do not start in the same 2-digit industry as their father’s
                                  (3)
work experience. We focus on fAB and r3 . If entrepreneurs started firms in random industries,
              (3)
the mean fAB and r3 would be 0 and 5.5, respectively. The mean ri for entrepreneurs is almost
eight, i.e., in the eighth relatedness decile. About 55 percent of entrepreneurs start up a firm
                                                                   (3)
in Decile ten. This is an extremely large number. The mean fAB is more modest, about five
percent. Denoting the father’s industry by A and the son’s startup industry as B, this means


                                                54
that the excess probability of labor mobility from industry A to industry B is about five percent.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of r3 .




           Figure 7: Distribution of Entrepreneurs’ Relatedness to Father’s Industry



A.4.4   Wage workers relatedness to father’s industry

We now investigate how close the industry relation is between father’s industry of work and
the industry choice for wage workers, for wage workers that do not work in the exact same
                                                                    (3)
industry as their father’s work experience. Again we focus on fAB and r3 . If wage workers
                                                     (3)
were employed in industries at random, the mean fAB and r3 would be 0 and 5.5, respectively.
The mean ri for wage workers is about 6.7, i.e., close to the seventh relatedness decile. About
                                                                                    (3)
34 percent of wage workers are employed in an industry in Decile ten. The mean fAB is about 3
percent. Denoting the father’s industry by A and the son’s startup industry as B, this means that
the excess probability of labor mobility from industry A to industry B is about three percent.
Figure 8 shows the distribution of r3 for wage workers.
