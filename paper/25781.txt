Macroeconomic Uncertainty Prices when Beliefs are Tenuous

                                          ABSTRACT

A representative investor does not know which member of a set of well-defined parametric
"structured models'' is best. The investor also suspects that all of the structured models are
misspecified. These uncertainties about probability distributions of risks give rise to components
of equilibrium prices that differ from the risk prices widely used in asset pricing theory. A
quantitative example highlights a representative investor's uncertainties about the size and
persistence of macroeconomic growth rates. Our model of preferences under ambiguity puts
nonlinearities into marginal valuations that induce time variations in market prices of uncertainty.
These arise because the representative investor especially fears high persistence of low growth
rate states and low persistence of high growth rate states.

1       Introduction
This paper describes prices of macroeconomic uncertainty that emerge from how investors
evaluate consequences of alternative specifications of state dynamics. Movements in these
uncertainty prices induce variations in asset values. We construct a quantitative example in
which uncertainty about macroeconomic growth rates plays a central role. Adverse conse-
quences for discounted expected utilities make a representative investor fear macroeconomic
growth rate persistence in times of weak growth and absence of growth rate persistence in
times of strong growth.
    To construct uncertainty prices, we posit a stand-in investor who has a family of struc-
tured models with either fixed or time-varying parameters that we represent with a recursive
structure suggested by Chen and Epstein (2002) for continuous time models with Brownian
motion information flows. Because the investor distrusts all of his structured models, he
adds unstructured nonparametric models that reside within statistical neighborhoods of
them.1 To represent the investor’s concerns about such unstructured statistical models, we
use preferences proposed by Hansen and Sargent (2019), a continuous-time version of the
dynamic variational preferences of Maccheroni et al. (2006a).2
    The representative investor in our quantitative example impersonates “the market” and
is uncertain about prospective macroeconomic growth rates. Shadow prices that isolate as-
pects of model specifications that most concern a representative investor equal uncertainty
prices that clear competitive security markets. Multiplying an endogenously determined
vector of worst-case drift distortions by minus one gives a vector of local prices that are
increments to expected returns associated with exposures to alternative shocks over an
instant of time that compensate the representative investor for bearing model uncertainty.3
The representative investor’s concerns about the persistence of macroeconomic growth rates
make uncertainty prices depend on the state of the economy and therefore vary over time.
These findings extend earlier quantitative results that had indicated that investors’ re-
sponses to modest amounts of model ambiguity can substitute for the implausibly large
risk aversions during economic downturns that are required to explain observed market
    1
     By “structured” we mean more or less tightly parameterized statistical models. Thus, “structured
models” aren’t what econometricians working in the tradition either of the Cowles commission or of rational
expectations econometrics would call “structural” models.
   2
     Hansen and Sargent (2019) extends models of Hansen and Sargent (2001) and Hansen et al. (2006)
that surround a single structured baseline probability model with an infinite dimensional family of difficult-
to-discriminate unstructured models.

     This object also played a central role in the analysis of Hansen and Sargent (2010).

prices of risk.
    Section 2 specifies an investor’s baseline probability model and perturbations to it, both
cast in continuous time for analytical convenience. To create a set of structured models,
the representative investor uses a set of positive, mean one martingales as alterations to a
baseline model. She uses other positive, mean one martingales as perturbations to those
structured models to express her suspicion that all of her structured models are misspecified.
Section 3 describes discounted relative entropy, a statistical measure of discrepancy between
martingales, and uses it to construct a convex set of probability measures that interest the
investor. A martingale representation proves to be a tractable way for us to formulate a
robust decision problem in section 4.
    Section 5 describes and compares relative entropy and Chernoff entropy, each of which
measures statistical divergence from a set of martingales. We show how to use these
measures 1) to assess plausibility of worst-case models as recommended by Good (1952),
and 2) to calibrate a penalty parameter that we use to represent the investor’s preferences.
By extending the approach of Hansen et al. (2008), section 6 calculates key objects in a
quantitative version of a baseline model together with worst-case probabilities associated
with a convex set of alternative models that concern both a robust investor and a robust
planner. Section 7 constructs a recursive representation of a competitive equilibrium of
an economy with a representative robust investor. Then it links worst-case probabilities
that emerge from a robust planning problem to equilibrium uncertainty compensations that
the representative investor receives in competitive equilibrium. Section 8 offers concluding
remarks.


2    Martingales and probabilities
Martingales play an important role in a large literature on pricing derivative claims. They
play a different role in this paper. This section describes convenient mathematical repre-
sentations of nonnegative martingales that alter a baseline probability model. Following
Hansen and Sargent (2019), section 3 constructs a set of martingales that determine a set
of structured models that interest a decision maker. We describe additional martingales
that generate statistically nearby unstructured models that concern a decision maker who
fears that all of the structured models are misspecified.
                                                                                      .
    For concreteness, we use the following baseline model of a stochastic process Z “ tZt :

where W is a multivariate standard Brownian motion.5 We will also have cause to introduce
endogenous state dynamics that can be altered by the actions of a fictitious planner. With
this in mind, a plan is a tCt : t ě 0u that is a progressively measurable process with respect
to the filtration F “ tFt : t ě 0u associated with the Brownian motion W augmented by
information available at date zero. The date t component Ct is measurable with respect to
Ft .
     A decision maker who does not fully trust baseline model (1) explores utility con-
sequences of plans under alternative probability models that she obtains by multiplying
probabilities associated with (1) by likelihood ratios depicted as positive martingales with
unit expectations. Following an extensive literature in probability theory, we represent a
likelihood ratio by a positive martingale M U with respect to the baseline Brownian motion
specification

   Although applications typically use a Markov formulation, this restriction is not essential. Our for-

As specified so far, MtU is a local martingale, but not necessarily a martingale.6

Definition 2.1. M denotes the set of all martingales M U constructed as stochastic expo-
nentials via representation (5) with a U that satisfies (4) and is progressively measurable
with respect to F “ tFt : t ě 0u.

    Associated with U are probabilities defined by the conditional mathematical expecta-
tions

for any t ě 0 and any bounded Ft -measurable random variable Bt , so the positive random
variable MtU acts as a Radon-Nikodym derivative for the date t conditional expectation
operator E U r ¨ |X0 s.
    Under baseline model (1), W is a standard Brownian motion, but under the alternative
U model, it has increments
                                   dWt “ Ut dt ` dWtU ,                               (6)

where W U is now a standard Brownian motion. Furthermore, under the M U probability
         şt
measure, 0 |Uτ |2 dτ is finite with probability one for each t. In light of (6), we can write
model (1) as:
                          dZt “ µppZt qdt ` σpZt q ¨ Ut dt ` σpZt qdWtU .

While (3) expresses the evolution of log M U in terms of increment dW , the evolution in
terms of dW U is

3       Measuring statistical discrepancies
We use a log-likelihood ratio to construct entropy relative to a probability specification
affiliated with a martingale M S generated by a drift distortion process S. Rather than using
a log likelihood ratio log MtU with respect to the baseline model, we use a log likelihood
ratio log MtU ´ log MtS with respect to the structured MtS model to arrive at:
                                                                             ˆż t                       ˇ ˙

                                                                                              ´ Sτ | dτ ˇF0 .
                                                                                                        ˇ

     It is inconvenient here to impose sufficient conditions for the stochastic exponential to be a martingale
like Kazamaki’s or Novikov’s. Instead, we will verify that an extremum of a pertinent optimization problem
does indeed result in a martingale.

                                                                       4

The second line is a limit of exponentially weighted averages (Abel averages), where scaling
by the positive discount rate δ makes the weights δ expp´δτ q integrate to one. To assess
model misspecification, instead of undiscounted relative entropy, we shall use Abel averages
with a discount rate equal to the subjective rate that the decision maker uses to discount
future expected utility flows. We define a discrepancy between two martingales M U and
M S as:
                                ˘ δ 8
                                     ż              ´                ˇ ¯

                                   2 0

    We start from a convex set of structured models that we represent as martingales
M P Mo with respect to a single structured baseline model. In subsection 3.1, we use
  S

undiscounted entropy relative to the baseline model to constrain the set Mo . Structured
models in Mo are well articulated alternatives to the baseline model that are of particular
interest to a decision maker. The decision maker is also interested in poorly articulated
unstructured models that are statistically similar to these structured models. For a real
number θ ą 0, define a scaled discrepancy of martingale M U from a set of martingales Mo
as
                                                  `            ˘

                                          M S PMo

Scaled discrepancy ΘpM U |F0 q equals zero for M U in Mo and is positive for M U not in
Mo . We use discrepancy ΘpM U |F0 q to define a set of unstructured models that are near
the set Mo ; our decision maker wants to know utility consequences of these nearby models
too. The scaling parameter θ measures how an expected utility maximizing decision maker
penalizes an expected utility minimizing agent for distorting probabilities relative to models
in Mo .

3.1     A family Mo of structured models
We construct a family of structured probabilities by forming a set of martingales M S with
respect to a baseline probability associated with model (1). Formally,
                                                                    (
                        Mo “ M S P M such that St P Ξt for all t ě 0                                   (9)

where Ξ is a process of convex sets adapted to the filtration F. Chen and Epstein (2002)
also used an instant-by-instant constraint on St like (9) to construct a set of probability
models.7 A consequence of forming a set of structured models according to formula (9) is
that the associated set of probabilities is rectangular in the sense of Epstein and Schneider
(2003) so that a dynamic version of a Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) max-min decision
maker using this as the set of probabilities would have preferences over plans that are
dynamically consistent.
    As we show below, in continuous time we can achieve a rectangular specification by
restricting the time derivative of the conditional expectation of relative entropy. The key
idea is to note that restricting a derivative of a function at every instant can be far more
constraining than restricting the magnitude of the function obtained by integrating the
derivative. For us, the pertinent function is conditional relative entropy. We find an
instant-by-instant restriction on the derivative of conditional relative entropy to be an at-
tractive way of constructing a set (9) of what we call structured models. But it is too
constraining when we also want to consider potential misspecifications of those structured
models. It is relative entropy itself (and not a local counterpart) that provides a statistical
discrepancy measure suitable for exploring misspecifications of the structured models. But
using relative entropy to restrict it causes us in the end to work with a set of unstructured
models that is not rectangular. The reason is that, as Hansen and Sargent (2019) show
formally, embedding relative entropy neighborhoods into a larger rectangular set of proba-
bilities essentially compels a decision maker to entertain any alternative probability that is
represented as a positive martingale with unit expectation. To avoid this extreme outcome,
we move beyond max-min preference specifications of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) and
Epstein and Schneider (2003). Instead we use a version of the more general dynamic vari-
ational preferences of Maccheroni et al. (2006b) that accommodate a recursive procedure
that penalizes relative entropies of unstructured models.
   7
    Anderson et al. (1998) also explored consequences of a constraint like (9) but without the state depen-
dence in Ξ. Allowing for state dependence is important in the applications featured in this paper.

   We form a set of structured models by restricting the drift or local mean of relative
entropy via a Feynman-Kac relation. The (undiscounted) entropy for a stochastic process
M S relative to the baseline model is:

distortion process S “ ηpZq, where Z is an ergodic Markov process with transition prob-
abilities that converge to a unique well-defined stationary distribution Q under the M S
probability. In this case, we can use Q to evaluate relative entropy by computing:

    We represent the instantaneous counterpart to the one-period transition distribution
for a Markov process in terms of an infinitesimal generator. A generator tells how con-
ditional expectations of the Markov state evolve locally and can be derived informally by
differentiating the family of conditional expectation operators with respect to the gap of
elapsed time. For a diffusion, the infinitesimal generator Aη of transitions under the M S
probability is the second-order differential operator:

    Having described how we compute relative entropy q2 and our refined measure of relative
entropy ρpzq for a Markov process that governs z, we move on to tell how we restrict a family
of potential structured models in terms of their relative entropies εpM S q. In addition to
             2
specifying q2 , we now also specify ρ a priori. For reasons discussed in Hansen and Sargent
(2019), restricting q alone is insufficient to allow us to get a set of martingales expressible
in the form (9). Therefore, we require that the S process belong to the sequence of sets
that does bring us to a representation of the form (9):
                            "                                           *

for a given choice of pq, ρq. The boundary of a set Ξt defined in this way includes models
                                                  2
having the same long-horizon relative entropy q2 as well as the same refinement ρpzq´ ρdQ
                                                                                          ş

of relative entropy. However, for a given sequence of sets Ξt defined by (11), there exist
many S processes that have relative entropy εpM S q less than or equal to q but that violate
the inequality on the right side of definition (11). This is the sense in which, by using the
sequence of sets Ξ defined by equation (11) to form the set of probabilities defined in (9),
we are imposing a refinement of the relative entropy constraint: many processes satisfy
the relative entropy constraint but violate the rectangularity constraint incorporated in
definition (11).
    When we solve a robust planner’s problem in section 4.2.2, it will turn out to be conve-
nient that it is easy to characterize the set Ξt because it is a constructed by constraining a
quadratic function of s given Zt . The set of possible s’s is a disc with state dependent center

        and radius q2 ´ A0 ρ. As mentioned above, if our decision maker were interested only
in the set of models defined by (9) and (11), we could stop here and use a dynamic version
of the min-max preferences of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). That way of proceeding could

indeed lead to interesting applications and is worth pursuing. But the decision maker to
be studied in this paper wants to investigate the utility consequences of models not in the
set defined by (9).


3.2     Misspecification of structured models
Our decision maker wants to evaluate consequences of the structured models in Mo and
also of unstructured models that statistically are difficult to distinguish from them. For
that purpose, he employs the scaled statistical discrepancy measure ΘpM U |F0 q defined
in (8) and uses relative entropy multiplied by parameter θ ă 8 to calibrate a set of
nearby unstructured models.9 The decision maker solves a minimization problem in which
θ serves as a penalty parameter that deters considering unstructured probabilities that
are statistically too far from the structured models. The minimization problem induces a
preference ordering over consumption plans that belongs to a class of dynamic variational
preferences that Maccheroni et al. (2006a) showed are dynamically consistent.
    To understand how our formulation relates to dynamic variational preferences, notice
how structured models represented in terms of their drift distortion processes St appear
separately from unstructured models represented in terms of drift distortion Ut on the right
side of the statistical discrepancy measure

4      Recursive Representations of Preferences and De-
       cisions
This section prepares the way for the section 6 quantitative application by describing a
set of structured models and a continuation value process over consumption plans. A
scalar continuation value stochastic process ranks alternative consumption plans. Date t
continuation values tell a decision maker’s date t ranking. Continuation value processes
have a recursive structure that makes preferences be dynamically consistent. For Markovian
decision problems, a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation describes the evolution of
continuation values.

                                 dM U
to the local covariance between M Ut and dVt . It is an adjustment to the drift νt of dVt
                                   t
that is induced by using martingale M U to change the probability measure. Preferences
ranked by continuation value processes Vt are continuous-time counterparts to the dynamic
variational preferences of Maccheroni et al. (2006a).


4.2     Markovian decision problem
By ranking consumption processes with continuation value processes satisfying (15), a
decision maker evaluates utility consequences of a set of models that includes unstructured
models that our relative entropy measure asserts are difficult to distinguish from members
of the set of structured models Mo . In particular, to construct a set of models, the decision
maker:

1) Begins with a Markovian baseline model.

2) Creates from the baseline model a set Mo of structured models by naming a sequence
   of closed convex sets tΞt u that satisfy (11) and associated drift distortion processes tSt u
   that satisfy structured model constraint (9).

3) Augments Mo with additional unstructured models that violate (9) but according to
   discrepancy measure (8) are statistically close to models that do satisfy it.

    We now describe how to implement some of these steps for the section 6 quantitative
model. We begin by describing the baseline model used by a key decision maker in our
application, a robust planner. For step 1, the planner uses a particular instance of the
diffusion (1) as a Markovian baseline model. Step 2 adds other Markovian models. Step 3
includes statistically similar models that are not necessarily Markovian.

4.2.1   Step 1

For the decision maker’s baseline model, we use a single capital version of an Eberly and
Wang (2011) model with a long-term risk state z. The decision maker is a robust planner

                                              11
who faces an AK model subject to adjustment costs with capital evolution:
                            ˆ„                         ˆ        ˙               ˙

where φ is convex with φp0q “ 0, Kt is the capital stock, It is investment, and W is a 2 ˆ 1
Brownian motion. It is convenient to use log K as the endogenous state variable process.
By Ito’s formula it follows that

A planner forms the following collection of structured parametric models:

                                              12
where parameters pαk , βk , αz , βz q distinguish structured models (17) from the baseline
model, pσk , σz q are parameters common to model (16) and all models (17), W S is a 2 ˆ 1
Brownian motion, and the Brownian motions W and W S are related by

                                         dWt “ St dt ` dWtS ,                                (18)

where St is the drift distortion implied by parameter values pαk , βk , αz , βz q. Collection (17)
nests baseline model (16).
    We represent members of a parametric class defined by (17) in terms of our section 2
structure with drift distortions S of the form

then use (1), (17), and (18) to deduce the following restrictions on η1 :

                                     2
   To compute relative entropy q2 and the function ρpzq, we apply the method of unde-
termined coefficients to solve the following instance of differential equation (10):

              dρ                                 |σz |2 d2 ρ       q2 |ηpzq|2
                 pzqr´βz pz ´ z̄q ` σz ¨ ηpzqs `
                      p                                      pzq ´   `        “ 0.           (19)
              dz                                   2 dz 2          2     2

Under parametric alternatives (17), ρ is quadratic in z ´ z̄:

                                                   1
                               ρpzq “ ρ1 pz ´ z̄q ` ρ2 pz ´ z̄q2 .
                                                   2

We first compute ρ1 and ρ2 by matching coefficients on the terms pz ´ z̄q and pz ´ z̄q2 ,
                                                      2
respectively. Matching constant terms then implies q2 .
   We assume that the robust planner’s instantaneous utility function is logarithmic. Then
guess that the value function takes the additively separable form Ψpxq “ log k ` Ψpzq,    p
where pk, zq are potential realizations of the state vector pKt , Zt q. If misspecifications of


                                                  13
the structured models were not of concern, we would be led to solve the following Hamilton-

where i is a potential choice of the investment-capital ratio and s is a potential choice of
the structured drift distortion and where s satisfies restriction (11), which we rewrite as:

    By fixing pρ1 , ρ2 , qq, we can trace out a one-dimensional family of parametric models
having the same relative entropy. For example, given pρ1 , ρ2 , qq, we can first solve equation
(19) for η0 and η1 . By matching a constant, a linear term, and a quadratic term in z ´ z̄,
we obtain three equations in four unknowns that imply a one dimensional curve for η0 and
η1 that imply nonlinear St ’s as functions of z. In this way, nonlinear structured models are
included in the set of structured models near the baseline model as measured by relative
                                                                    2

resulting nonlinear model as a time-varying coefficient model by solving

                                  rrpzq “ σ rη0 ` η1 pz ´ z̄qs

for η0 and η1 , z by z, along the one-dimensional curve in η0 and η1 . We provide the following
example upon which we shall base calculations to be discussed at length later in this paper.

In this case, ρ1 “ 0 and inequality (21) becomes

when z “ z̄. Also given |σz |2 , the value of ρ2 is determined by q. More generally, q and ρ
cannot be specified independently.
     To connect to a time-varying parameter specification, first construct the convex set of
η1 ’s that satisfy                    ˆ 2 ˙´

   For a given Ψp and state realization z, the component of the objective for the HJB
equation (20) that depends on s is the inner product

It is pedagogically convenient to set r “ σs. The two distinct entries of r “ σs alter
evolution equations for the state variables k and z, both of which appear in the objective
function on the right side of equation HJB (20). Evidently, from HJB equation (20), the
first entry, r1 , shifts the log capital evolution equation and the second entry, r2 , shifts the
evolution equation for the exogenous state z. The criterion appearing in HJB equation (20)
remains linear in r with a translation; linearity pushes the minimizing r to an ellipsoid that
is the boundary of the convex constraint set for each z. Under calibrated parameters for
the baseline model that we present in section 6, figure 1 shows ellipsoids associated with
two alternative values of z.
Notations for q’s: The caption of figure 1 indicates values for two versions of q, a quantity
qs,0 that indicates entropy of a structured model to the baseline model that we denote model


                                                   15
0; and a quantity qu,s that denotes entropy of an unstructured model relative to a structured
model. Subsection 5.1 describes how we define and compute qu,s . Later we also use qu,0 to
denote entropy of an unstructured model to the baseline model.
    For every feasible choice of r2 , two choices of r1 satisfy the implied quadratic equation
for the ellipse mentioned above. Provided that ddzΨ pzq ą 0, which is true in our calculations,
                                                    p


we take the lower of the two solutions for r1 because the objective has positive weights on
the two entries of r. The minimizing solution occurs at a point on the lower left of the
ellipse where dr  1
                    “ ´ ddzΨ pzq and depends on z, as Figure 1 indicates.

We now alter the HJB equation in a way that acknowledges the decision maker’s fear that
all of his structured models are misspecified. He does this by adding unstructured models
via a penalized entropy term. This results in the modified version of HJB equation (20):

    Notice that in the HJB equation in Problem 4.2, the objective is additively separable
in i and s. This implies that the order of extremization is inconsequential, confirming a
Bellman-Isaacs condition. Moreover, for this particular economic environment, the maxi-
mizing solution i˚ for i is state independent, since the first-order conditions are:

                                                       δ

cerns about robustness operate mostly on asset prices, not on allocations.10


5      Alternative entropy measures
Preference orderings described in section 4 use the penalty parameter θ in conjunction with
relative entropy to restrict a set of unstructured models that express the decision maker’s
fear that all of the structured models are misspecified. Good (1952) recommended that users
of a max-min expected utility approach should verify that a worst-case model is plausible.11
We implement Good’s suggestion here by characterizing both a worst-case structured model
and a worst-case unstructured model and also exploring how the planner’s θ in Problem 4.2
affects the implied relative entropy of the worst-case unstructured model. In calibrating
θ in actual decision problems, we find it enlightening also to measure the magnitude of a
worst-case adjustment for misspecifications of the structured models. Finally, although we
use relative entropy in formulating the decision problems, we find it helpful also to consult
another measure of statistical discrepancy called Chernoff entropy.
    Let logarithms of two martingales M S and M U evolve according to appropriate versions
of (7), namely,

                                              1
                                 d log MtS “ ´ |St |2 dt ` St ¨ dWt
                                              2
                                              1
                                 d log MtU “ ´ |Ut |2 dt ` Ut ¨ dWt .

to uncertainty. For a multiple capital stock example with a different specification of model ambiguity, see

Think of a pairwise model selection problem that statistically compares a structured model
generated by a martingale M S with an unstructured model generated by a martingale
M U . For a given value of θ in HJB equation (23), we compute worst-case structured and
unstructured models in terms of the drift distortions

5.1       Relative entropy
A gauge of divergence between two probability distributions is the following expected log
likelihood ratio called relative entropy:

                                      1 “  `                 ˘   ‰
                  ΛpM U , M S q “ lim E MtU log MtU ´ log MtS |F0 .
                                  tÑ8 t


Since the worst-case structured and unstructured probability models are both Markovian,
we can compute ΛpM U , M S q using the same procedures that we applied in section 3.1 to
compute entropy relative to the baseline model. In particular, instead of solving equation
(19), we now solve

                 dρ    ´                 ¯ 1      d2 ρ |ηu ´ ηs |2   q2

      2
for q2 and for ρ, up to a constant of translation. We denote the solution for q as qu,s
to emphasize that it is relative entropy of an unstructured model relative to a structured
model. In the application below, we report
                                          a

as a convenient measure of the magnitude of the drift distortion of a worst-case model u
relative to a worst-case model s.
    Appendix A.2 describes our computational approach. Entropy concept ΛpM U , M S q is
typically independent of date zero conditioning information when the Markov process is


                                               19
asymptotically stationary.


5.2     Chernoff entropy
A dynamic version of an idea of Chernoff (1952) provides an alternative concept of dis-
crepancies between probability measures. Chernoff entropy emerges from studying how, by
disguising distortions of a baseline probability model, Brownian motions make it challeng-
ing to distinguish models statistically. Although Chernoff entropy’s explicit connection to
a statistical decision problem makes it attractive, it is less tractable than relative entropy.
To address this intractability, Anderson et al. (2003) used Chernoff entropy measured as a
local rate to make direct connections between magnitudes of market prices of uncertainty,
on the one hand, and statistical discrimination between two models, on the other hand.
That local rate is state-dependent and for diffusion models is proportional to the local drift
in relative entropy. We follow Newman and Stuck (1979) and proceed to characterize a
long-run version of Chernoff entropy and show how to compute it. There are important
quantitative differences when we measure Chernoff entropy globally instead of locally as in
the approach of Anderson et al. (2003).12
    Think of a pairwise model selection problem that statistically compares a structured
model generated by a martingale M S with an unstructured model generated by a martingale
M U . Consider a statistical model selection rule based on a data history of length t that
checks whether log MtU ´ log MtS ě h. This selection rule sometimes incorrectly chooses
the unstructured model when the structured model governs the data. We can bound the
probability of this incorrect selection outcome by using an argument from large deviations
theory based on the inequalities

for 0 ď γ ď 1. Under the structured model, the mathematical expectation of the term on
the left side multiplied by MtS equals the probability of mistakenly selecting the alternative
model when data are a sample of size t generated under the structured model. We can

    The local measure is more closely aligned with local uncertainty prices, a connection that Anderson
et al. (2003) feature.

for alternative choices of γ. We apply these calculations for given specifications of U and
S, checking that the limits are well defined. The threshold h does not affect the limit.
Furthermore, the limit is often independent of the initial conditioning information. To get
the best bound, we compute

which is typically negative because mistake probabilities decay with sample size. Chernoff
entropy is then

   Setting ΓpM U , M S q “ 0 would include only those alternative models M U that can-
not be distinguished from M S on the basis of histories of infinite length.13 Because we
want to include more possible alternative models than that, we entertain positive values of
ΓpM U , M S q.
   To interpret ΓpM U , M S q, note that if the decay rate of mistake probabilities were con-
stant, say d, then mistake probabilities for two sample sizes Ti , i “ 1, 2, would be

                                                           1

                                                           2

for du,s “ ΓpM U , M S q. We define a half-life as an increase in sample size T2 ´ T1 ą 0 that
multiplies a mistake probability by a factor of one half:

                             1   mistake probability2   exp p´T2 dq
                               “                      “             ,
                             2   mistake probability1   exp p´T1 dq
  13
     That is what is done in extensions of the rational expectations equilibrium concept to self-confirming
equilibria that allow probability models to be wrong, but only off equilibrium paths, i.e., for events that
in equilibrium do not occur infinitely often. See Fudenberg and Levine (1993, 2009) and Sargent (1999).
Our decision theory differs from that used in most of the literature on self-confirming equilibria because
our decision maker acknowledges model uncertainty and wants to adjust decisions accordingly. But see
Battigalli et al. (2015).


                                                    21
so the half-life is approximately
                                                  log 2
                                           T2 ´ T1 “    .
                                                    d
The bound on the decay rate should be interpreted cautiously because the actual decay
rate is not constant. Furthermore, the pairwise comparison understates the challenge truly
confronting the decision maker, which is statistically to discriminate among multiple models.
   A symmetrical calculation reverses the roles of the two models and instead conditions
on the perturbed model implied by martingale M U . The limiting rate remains the same.
Thus, when we select a model by comparing a log likelihood ratio to a constant threshold,
the two types of mistakes share the same asymptotic decay rate.
   To implement Chernoff entropy, we follow an approach suggested by Newman and Stuck
(1979). Because our worst-case models are Markovian, in appendix A.1 we can use Perron-
Frobenius theory to characterize

limit does not depend on the initial state x and is characterized as a dominant eigenvalue
associated with an eigenfunction that is strictly positive.14


6      Quantitative example
Our example builds on the physical technology and continuation value process described in
section 4 and features a representative investor who wants to explore utility consequences of
alternative models portrayed by sets of tMtU u and tMtS u processes. Some models included in
these sets have troublesome but difficult to detect predictable components of consumption
growth.15
  14
     Appendix A describes how we evaluate both Chernoff entropy and relative entropy numerically for the
nonlinear Markov specifications that we use in subsequent sections.
  15
     While we appreciate the value of a more comprehensive empirical investigation with multiple macroe-
conomic time series, here our aim is to illustrate a mechanism within the context of relatively simple time
series models of predictable consumption growth.

6.1       Baseline model
We think of capital broadly and base our quantitative application on an empirical cali-
bration of the consumption dynamics. Our example blends elements of Bansal and Yaron
(2004) and Hansen et al. (2008). Because we want to focus exclusively on fluctuations in
uncertainty prices that are induced by a representative investor’s specification concerns, we
assume no stochastic volatility, in contrast to Bansal and Yaron (2004). We use a vector
autoregression (VAR) to construct a quantitative version of a baseline model like (16) that
approximates responses of consumption to permanent shocks. Our VAR follows Hansen
et al. (2008) in using several macroeconomic time series to infer information about long-term
consumption growth. We deduce a calibration of our baseline model (16) from a trivariate
VAR for the first difference of log consumption, the difference between logs of business
income and consumption, and the difference between logs of personal dividend income
and consumption. This specification makes levels of logarithms of consumption, business
income, and personal dividend income be cointegrated additive functionals that share a
single common martingale component that can be extracted using a method described by
Hansen (2012). In Appendix B we describe our data and our method for estimating the
discrete-time VAR that we use to deduce the following parameters for the baseline model
(16):16

6.2       Structured models and a robust plan
We solve HJB equation (20) for two different configurations of structured models. We

      We remind the reader that we set .01βpc “ βpk , and .01σc “ σk .

6.2.1   Uncertain growth rate responses

We compute a solution by first focusing on an Illustration 4.1 specification in which ρ1 “ 0
and ρ2 satisfies:
                                              q2
                                        ρ2 “
                                             |σz |2
where here we use q as a synonym for qs,0 . When η is restricted to be η1 pz ´ z̄q, a given
value of q imposes a restriction on η1 and implicitly on pβc , βk q. Figure 2 plots iso-entropy
contours for pβc , βz q associated with qs,0 “ .1 and qs,0 “ .05, respectively.




Figure 2: Parameter contours for pβc , βk q holding relative entropy qs,0 fixed. The outer
curve depicts qs,0 “ .1 and the inner curve qs,0 “ .05. The small diamond depicts the
baseline model.




                                              24
    While Figure 2 displays contours of time-invariant parameters with the same relative
entropy, the robust planner actually chooses a two-dimensional vector of drift distortions
r “ σs for a structured model in a more flexible way. As happens when there is uncertainty
about pβc , βz q, sets of possible r’s differ depending on the state z. As we remarked earlier
in subsection 4.2 when we discussed illustration 4.1, when z “ 0 the only feasible r is
r “ 0. Figure 1 also reported iso-entropy contours when z is at the .1 and .9 quantile of
the stationary distribution under the baseline model. The larger value of z results in a
downward shift of the contour relative to the smaller value of z. The points of tangency
in Figure 1 are the worst-case structured models. A tangency point occurs at a lower drift
distortion for the .9 quantile than for the .1 quantile.
    Consider next the adjustment for model misspecification. Since
                                                         «        ff

and entries of σσ 1 are positive, the adjustment for model misspecification is smaller in
magnitude for larger values of the state z. Taken together, the vector of drift distortions
is:
                                  σu˚ “ σpu˚ ´ s˚ q ` r˚ .

The first term on the right is smaller in magnitude for a larger z and conversely, the second
term is larger in magnitude for smaller z.
                                                                       2
   Under the restrictions on structured models that ρ1 “ 0, ρ2 “ |σqz |2 , and ηpzq “ η1 pz ´ z̄q,
the first derivative of the value function is not differentiable at z “ z̄. We can compute the
value function and the worst-case models by solving two coupled HJB equations, one for
z ă z̄ and another for z ą z̄. We obtain two second-order differential equations in value
functions and their derivatives; these value functions coincide at z “ 0, as do their first
derivatives.

Figure 3: Worst-case structured model growth rate drifts. Left panel: larger structured
entropy (qs,0 “ .1). Right panel: smaller structured entropy (qs,0 “ .05). The penalty
parameter θ was reset to hit two different targeted values of qu,s . Black: baseline model;
red: worst-case structured model; blue: qu,s “ .1; and green: qu,s “ .2.


    Figure 3 shows adjustments of the drifts due to aversion to not knowing which structured
model is best and to concerns about misspecifications of the structured models. Setting
θ “ 8 silences concerns about misspecification of the structured models, all of which
are expressed through minimization over s. When we set θ “ 8, the implied worst-case
structured model has state dynamics that take the form of a threshold autoregression with
a kink at zero. The distorted drifts in z again show less persistence than does the baseline
model for negative values of z and more persistence for larger values of z. We activate a
concern for misspecification of the structured models by setting θ to attain targeted values
of qu,s computed using the structured and unstructured worst-case models. This adjustment
shifts the implied worst-case drift as a function of the state downwards, more for negative
values of z than for positive ones. The impact of the drift for log k or equivalently log c is
much more modest.

entropy. The subscripts denote the probability models used in performing the computa-
tions.



    Table 1 reports Chernoff and relative entropies implied by structured and unstructured
worst-case models. The first two columns tell relative entropy magnitudes that we imposed
by adjusting the value of θ. The remaining columns report other measures of entropy as
implied by these settings. Recall that the q’s measure magnitudes of the drift distortions
under associated distorted measures. Thus, qu,0 measures how large the drift distortion is
relative to the baseline model. As expected, increasing the targeted values of qs,0 and qu,s
increases the implied values qu,0 . There is one peculiar finding. From Table 1, we see that

                                        qu,s ` qs,0 ă qu,0 ,

which does not satisfy a Triangle Inequality. This happens because qu,s and qu,0 are com-
puted under the stationary probability measure implied by the worst-case unstructured
model induced by U , while qs,0 is computed under the measure implied by worst-case
structured model.
    Table 1 also reports Chernoff entropies and their implied half lives. These numbers
indicate that statistical discrimination is challenging for all four pqs,0 , qu,s q configurations.
The half lives associated with the qu,s ’s that quantify potential model misspecification
exceed 140 quarters. Even the smallest half-life associated with the qu,0 that expresses
the overall discrepancy from the benchmark model exceeds 60 quarters. Discrimination
is especially challenging when we limit the extent of model misspecification by setting
qu,s “ .1.
    How are the entropy measures are related? We know no formula that transforms relative
entropy into long-run Chernoff entropy, but a formula from Anderson et al. (2003) is valid

evidently a good approximation for computed qu,s and du,s , but not for qu,0 and du,0 . As
we have seen, the composite drift distortions show substantial state dependence via the
worst-case structured model.

    Figure 4 portrays impacts of the drift distortion on distributions of future consumption

justed for not knowing the best structured model and for distrusting all of the structured

6.2.2   Altering the scope of uncertainty

Until now, we have imposed that the alternative structured models have no drift distortions
for Z at Zt “ z̄ by setting
                                               q

                                             |σz |2
We now alter this restriction by cutting the value of ρ2 in half. Consequences of this change
are depicted in the right panel of Figure 5. For sake of comparison, this figure includes the
previous specification in the left panel. The worst-case structured drifts no longer coincide
with the baseline drift at z “ z̄ and now vary smoothly in the vicinity of z “ z̄.

    Adding the restriction that ρ2 “ 0 makes the robust planner’s value function become
linear and makes the minimizing s and u become constant and therefore independent of z.

The constant of proportionality for s˚ is determined by the constraint |s˚ | “ q. So setting
ρ1 and ρ2 to zero results in parallel downward shifts of worst-case drifts for both Y and Z.
This amounts to changing the coefficients αy and αz in ways that are time invariant and
that leave βy “ βpy and βz “ βpz .


7      Uncertainty prices
In this section, we construct equilibrium prices that a representative investor receives for
bearing ill-understood risks. These equal shadow prices for the robust planning problem of
section 4. We decompose equilibrium risk prices into distinct compensations for bearing risk
and for bearing model uncertainty. Appendix D describes in detail how we use competitive
markets to decentralize implementation of the allocation chosen by a robust planner.17


7.1     Local uncertainty prices
The equilibrium stochastic discount factor process Sdf for our robust representative investor
economy is
                               ´            ¯                              1

Components of the vector ω ˚ pZt q “ p.01qσc ´ η ˚ pZt q equal minus the local exposures to
the Brownian shocks.18 While these are usually interpreted as local “risk prices,” the
decomposition

motivates us to think of .01σc as risk prices induced by the curvature of log utility and ´Ut˚
as “uncertainty prices” induced by a representative investor’s doubts about the baseline
  17
     We evaluate risk and uncertainty prices relative to the baseline model (1), which we regard as ap-
proximating the data well. The planner’s and the representative investor’s doubts about that model are
reflected in the computed compensations.

conomic growth states. Prices of uncertainty at longer horizons display more complicated
responses to shocks to the macro growth state.


7.2    Uncertainty prices over alternative investment horizons
In the previous subsection, we interpreted ´Ut˚ as a local price of uncertainty. In this
subsection, we provide a corresponding family of conditional expectations:
   `   ˚            ˘     `  ˚           ˘   “   ˚                     ˘

                         ambiguity price      misspecification price

We interpret the first term on the right side as coming from not knowing the best structured
model and the second term as coming from concerns that all of the structured models might
be misspecified. We motivate these measures by constructing “shock price elasticities” for
being exposed to future shocks.
    We construct shock elasticities that fit within a framework proposed by Borovička et al.
(2011). These are related to but distinct from objects computed by Borovička et al. (2014).
Borovička et al. (2014) use a typical impulse response timing convention by reporting
elasticities that tell how changing exposures to a shock next period affects the expected
return today of an asset that pays off τ periods in the future. In contrast, here we shift the
date of an asset’s exposure to a shock τ time periods in the future, the same time that the
asset pays off. We then study how the expected return as of today varies as we alter τ ą 0.
We express responses of expected rates of return as elasticities by normalizing a change
in an exposure to a shock to be a unit standard deviation and by studying responses of
logs of expected returns. Shock-price elasticities constructed in this way can enlighten us
about how state dependence in exposures to future shocks affects expected returns today
of payoffs that materialize across different τ ’s. Here we regard different τ ’s as different
investment horizons. We shall show that in addition to being intrinsically interesting,
elasticities defined in this way link uncertainty prices to relative entropy.
    We let consumption be the hypothetical payoff of interest. The logarithm of the ex-
pected return from a consumption payoff at date t is the sum of two terms:
                            ˜      ˇ      ¸       «     ˆ ˙ ˇˇ       ff

Sdft CC0t “ MtU that the second term features the martingale MtU contributed by the
representative investor’s concern that he does not know which member of his set of struc-
tured models is correct and also his concern that all of the structured models are misspec-
ified.
    A shock-price elasticity tells the change in an expected return that results from a local
change in the exposure of consumption to the underlying Brownian motion. Malliavin
derivatives are important inputs into calculating a shock-price elasticity. These derivatives
measure how a shock at a given date affects consumption and stochastic discount factor
processes. The Sdft and Ct processes both depend on the same Brownian motion between
dates zero and t. We are particularly interested in the consequences at time 0 of being
exposed to shock at date t. Computing the derivative of the logarithm of the expected
return given in (26) results in

where Dt Ct and Dt MtU denote two-dimensional vectors of Malliavin derivatives with re-

   A formula familiar from other forms of differentiation implies

                                   Dt Ct “ Ct pDt log Ct q .

The Malliavin derivative of log Ct “ Yt is the vector .01σy , which is the exposure vector of

Therefore, the term structure of prices that interests us is

The first term is the risk price familiar from consumption-based asset pricing. It is a (small)
state independent-term that is independent of the horizon. In contrast, the equilibrium
drift distortion in the second term contains a state-dependent component, namely, the
conditional expectation of the worst-case drift distortion under the distorted probability
measure.

Proposition 7.1. Including contributions from both worst-case structured and unstructured
models, horizon-dependent uncertainty prices are:
                                        ´             ¯

which depend on the horizon t and the initial state x. The limiting uncertainty price vector
as t Ñ `8 is the unconditional expectation of the composite drift distortion under the

the case in which qu,s “ .1. Notice that although the price elasticity is initially smaller for
the median specification of z than for the .9 quantile, this inequality is eventually reversed
as the horizon increases. Figure 7 reveals a similar pattern for the instantaneous uncer-
tainty prices: especially for the second shock, instantaneous uncertainty prices are high
for the .1 and .9 quantiles of the z distribution relative to the median growth state. Over
longer investment horizons, elasticities diminish for the .9 quantiles to magnitudes that are
eventually lower than the median elasticities for the same investment horizons. (The blue
and black curves cross.) Notice that the misspecification components plotted in Figure 7
are ordered according to quantile, with the lowest quantile have the highest contribution.
In contrast, the contribution from ambiguity about the structured models is substantially
higher for the .9 quantile than for the other two, with median contributions starting at
zero. The misspecification contributions are thus important for understanding both the
magnitudes and initial orderings as well as the subsequent reversals of the uncertainty
price elasticities. The structured uncertainty components of the elasticities and hence the
elasticities themselves diminish with horizon because the probability measure implied by
                       ˚
the martingale MtU has reduced persistence for positive growth states. Under the MtU
probability, the growth rate state variable is expected to spend less time in the positive
region. This is reflected in smaller ambiguity components of price elasticities at the .9
quantile than at the median over longer investment horizons. For longer investment hori-
zons, but not necessarily for very short ones, an endogenous nonlinearity makes uncertainty
prices larger for negative values than for positive values of z. Horizon dependence of shock
price elasticities is an important avenue through which concerns about misspecification and
ambiguity aversion influence valuations of assets.
    There is an intriguing connection between long-horizon prices and relative entropy.
While the uncertainty price trajectories do not converge over the time span reported in
Figure 6, well defined limiting uncertainty prices do emerge over longer time horizons.19

term by the proportionate exposure of the martingale component of consumption. Both adjustments are

worst-case stationary probability measures. Indeed, these mean contributions account for
most of the relative entropy measures. This is evident by comparing the square of the
number in the third column of Table 2 to the sum of the squares in the fourth and fifth
columns. Thus, the square root of twice relative entropy provides a good approximation to
the magnitude of long-run uncertainty prices.

    We have designed our quantitative example to activate a particular mechanism that
causes statistically plausible amounts of uncertainty to generate fluctuations in uncertainty
prices. We inferred parameters of the baseline model for these examples solely from time
series of macroeconomic quantities, thus completely ignoring asset prices during calibration.
We intentionally did not impose the cross-equation and cross-frequency restrictions on the
consumption process that our asset pricing theory implies. We proceeded in this way in
order to respect concerns that Hansen (2007) and Chen et al. (2015) expressed about using
asset market data to calibrate macro-finance models that assign a special role to investors’
beliefs about future asset prices.20


8      Concluding remarks
This paper formulates and applies a tractable model of the effects of macroeconomic uncer-
tainties on equilibrium prices. We quantify investors’ concerns about model misspecification
in terms of the consequences of alternative statistically plausible models for discounted ex-
pected utilities. We characterize the effects of concerns about misspecification of a baseline
  20
     Hansen (2007) and Chen et al. (2015) describe situations in which it is the behavior of expected rates
of return on assets that, through the cross-equation restrictions, lead an econometrician to make inferences
about the behavior of macroeconomic quantities like consumption that are much more confident than can
be made from the quantity data alone. How could investors put those cross-equation restrictions from

stochastic process for individual consumption as shadow prices for a planner’s problem that
supports competitive equilibrium prices.
    To illustrate our approach, we have focused on the growth rate uncertainty featured
in the “long-run risk” literature initiated by Bansal and Yaron (2004). Further applica-
tions seem natural. For example, the tools developed here could shed light on a recent
public debate between two groups of macroeconomists and economic historians, one proph-
esying secular stagnation because of technology growth slowdowns, the other discounting
those pessimistic forecasts.21 The tools that we describe can be used, first, to quantify
how challenging it is to infer persistent changes in growth rates, and, second, to guide
macroeconomic policy in light of evidence.
    Specifically, we have produced a model of a log stochastic discount factor whose uncer-
tainty prices reflect a robust planner’s worst-case drift distortions U ˚ and have shown that
these drift distortions can be interpreted as prices of model uncertainty. The dependence
of uncertainty prices U ˚ on the growth state z is shaped partly by how our robust investor
responds to the presence of alternative parametric models among a huge set of unspecified
alternative models that also concern him.
    It is worthwhile comparing this paper’s way of inducing time-varying prices of risk with
three other macro/finance models that also get them. Campbell and Cochrane (1999)
proceed in the rational expectations tradition with its assumption of a single-known-
probability-model and so exclude fears of model misspecification from the mind of their
representative investor. Campbell and Cochrane construct a utility function in which the
history of consumption expresses an externality. This history dependence makes the in-
vestor’s local risk aversion respond in a countercyclical way to the economy’s growth state.
Ang and Piazzesi (2003) use an exponential-quadratic stochastic discount factor in a no-
arbitrage statistical model as a vehicle for exploring links between the term structure of
interest rates and other macroeconomic variables. Their approach allows movements in
risk prices to be consistent with historical evidence without specifying all components of
a general equilibrium model. A third approach introduces stochastic volatility into the
macroeconomy by positing that the volatilities of shocks driving consumption growth are
themselves stochastic processes. A stochastic volatility model induces time variation in
risk prices via exogenous movements in the conditional volatilities of shocks that impinge
on macroeconomic variables. A related approach is implemented by Ulrich (2013) and Ilut
and Schneider (2014), who use exogenous stochastic fluctuations in ambiguity concerns to

induce additional macroeconomic fluctuations.
    In Hansen and Sargent (2010), we used a representative investor’s robust model averag-
ing to drive countercyclical uncertainty prices. The investor carries along two difficult-to-
distinguish models of consumption growth, one with substantial growth rate persistence,
the other with little such persistence. The investor uses observations on consumption
growth to update a Bayesian posterior over these models and expresses his specification
distrust by pessimistically exponentially twisting a posterior over alternative models. That
leads the investor to act as if good news is temporary and bad news is persistent, an out-
come that is qualitatively similar to what we have found here. Learning occurs in Hansen
and Sargent’s analysis because the parameterized structured models are time invariant and
hence learnable.
    In this paper, we propose a different way to make uncertainty prices vary in a way
that turns out to be qualitatively similar. We exclude learning by including alternative
models with parameters whose prospective variations cannot be inferred from historical
data. These time-varying parameter models differ from the decision maker’s baseline model,
a fixed parameter model whose parameters can be well estimated from historical data. The
alternative models include ones that allow parameters persistently to deviate from those
of the baseline model in statistically subtle and time-varying ways. In addition to this
parametric class of alternative models, a robust planner and a representative investor both
worry about many other specifications. A robust planner’s worst-case model responds to
these forms of model uncertainty partly by having more persistence in bad states and less
persistence in good states.
    Adverse shifts in a worst-case shock distribution that increase the absolute magnitudes
of uncertainty prices were also present in some of our earlier work (for example, see Hansen
et al. (1999) and Anderson et al. (2003)). But in this paper, we induce state dependence
in uncertainty prices in a new way, namely, by specifying a set of alternative models in
a way that captures concerns about the baseline model’s specification of persistence in
consumption growth.
    Our continuous-time formulation (15) exploits mathematically convenient properties of
a Brownian information structure. There also exists a discrete-time version of our formu-
lation that starts from a baseline model cast in terms of a nonlinear stochastic difference
equation; counterparts to structured and unstructured models play the same roles here.
Furthermore, preference orderings defined in terms of continuation values are dynamically
consistent.


                                             39
     While our example used entropy measures to restrict the decision maker’s set of struc-
tured models, two other approaches could be explored instead. One would use a more
direct implementation of a robust Bayesian approach; the other would refrain from impos-
ing absolute continuity when constructing a family of structured models. We conclude by
discussing these in turn.
     We could start with a set of structured models with time-invariant parameters and a
convex set of priors over those parameters. A model-by-model Bayesian approach might
be tractable if the implied set of posteriors could be characterized and computed date-by-
date, through the use of conjugate priors. However, after augmenting a set of probabilities
to make the larger set rectangular as recommended by Epstein and Schneider (2003), the
worst-case structured model coming from the rectangular set would typically not come
from applying Bayes’ rule to a single prior. That would prevent applying Good’s way of
assessing the plausibility of max-min choice theory. On the other hand, stopping at the
first step and not surrounding an initial rectangular set of models could conceivably may
place models on the table that are substantively interesting in their own right, including
possibly the worst-case structured model. By incorporating a concern for misspecification
of an initial prior as it does, this approach provides an alternative to the robust learning
in Hansen and Sargent (2007).
     Finally, we mention an approach that would abandon the absolute continuity that we
have built in when we assumed that the structured model probabilities can be represented
as martingales with respect to a baseline model. Peng (2004) uses a theory of stochastic
differential equations under a broad notion of model ambiguity that is rich enough to allow
uncertainty about the conditional volatility of Brownian increments. Alternative probabil-
ity specifications here fail to be absolutely continuous and standard likelihood ratio analysis
ceases to apply. If we could construct bounds on uncertainty under a non-degenerate rect-
angular embedding, we could extend the construction of worst-case structured models and
still restrain relative entropy as a way to limit a decision maker’s set of unstructured mod-
els.22

The Markov structure of both models allows us to compute Chernoff entropy by using an
eigenvalue approach of Donsker and Varadhan (1976) and Newman and Stuck (1979). We

where we compute λpγq numerically using a finite-difference approach. For a pre-specified γ,
we evaluate rGpγqsg at each of n grid points and replace derivatives by two-sided symmetric
differences except at the edges, where we use corresponding one-sided differences. This
procedure yields a linear transformation of g evaluated at the n grid points. The outcome
of this calculation is an n by n matrix applied to a vector containing the entries of g

that the left-hand side of (28) is linear in ρ, q2 . We evaluate equation (28) at the n grid

    method described by Zha (1999). Following Zha, we exploit the lower triangularity of
    JB by first transforming the equation system to make the implied population residuals
    be uncorrelated. We impose conjugate priors on the transformed system and initialize
    them at a “non-informative” prior. This method conditions on X0 . We use Monte
    Carlo simulation to produce a sequence tθj :“ 1, 2, ...., N u where N is the sample size
    of the simulated data. We use this simulation to form a synthetic empirical distribution
    that assigns probability N1 to each θj , rejecting all draws that do not imply a stationary
    VAR.

    stationary distribution implied by θj . This weighting scheme adjusts the empirical
    distribution for the contribution to the likelihood function from the random initial
    state X0 . We construct medians and deciles from this discrete distribution.

C     Solving the ODE’s
For large |z|, the value function and minimizing worst-case r are approximately linear in
the state variable. The linear approximations differ depending on whether z is greater or

                                              45

in an approximation that restricts z to be in a compact interval that includes z “ z̄.
    Recall the constraint:

Since the quadratic terms in z dominate the constraint, impose the following restriction on

where ψ is the approximate slope of value function. The first equation in equation (30) is
the derivative of the value function for constant coefficients, putting minimization aside.
The second block in (30) consists of two equations derived as the large z approximation to
the first-order conditions implied by (23). After taking ratios of these two latter equations
we can cancel the constant of proportionality (the multiplier on the constraint) leaving
us with one equation that emerges from the second block. Thus we are left solving three
equations in the three unkowns d and ψ.
    Depending on which boundary we target, minimization will result in different choices
of d. We let d´ be the approximate solution for the left boundary with a corresponding
value function derivative ψ ´ . We define d` and ψ ` analogously. Combining equation (29)
and the two equations that emerge from (30), we are left with three equations that deter-
mine pd´      ´    ´        ` `       `          ´     `
         1 , d2 , ψ q and pd1 , d2 , ψ q, where ψ and ψ are the two approximate boundary
conditions for the derivative of the value function. We used bvp4c in Matlab to solve the
ode’s over the two intervals r´2.5, 0s and r0, 2.5s, where z “ 0.

D.1     Robust investor portfolio problem
A representative investor solves a continuous-time Merton portfolio problem in which indi-
vidual wealth A evolves as

                 dAt “ ´Ct dt ` At ιpZt qdt ` At Ft ¨ dWt ` At ωpZt q ¨ Dt dt,          (31)

where Ft “ f is a vector of chosen risk exposures, ιpzq is an instantaneous risk-free rate,
and ωpzq is a vector of risk prices evaluated at state Zt “ z. Initial wealth is A0 . The
investor discounts the logarithm of consumption and distrusts his probability model.
    Key inputs to a representative investor’s robust portfolio problem are the baseline model
(1), the wealth evolution equation (31), the vector of risk prices ωpzq, and the quadratic
                                  2
function ρ and relative entropy q2 that define alternative structured models.
    Under a guess that the value function takes the form Ψpzq  r    ` log a ` log δ, the HJB
equation for the robust portfolio allocation problem is

subject to (33). Taken together, these determine pf ˚ , u˚ , s˚ q. We can appeal to arguments
like those of Hansen and Sargent (2008, ch. 7) to justify stacking first-order conditions as
a way to collect equilibrium conditions for the two-person zero-sum game that the robust
portfolio problem solves.23


D.2      Competitive equilibrium prices
We show that the drift distortion η ˚ that emerges from a robust planner’s problem de-
termines prices that a competitive equilibrium awards for bearing model uncertainty. In
particular, we compute a vector ωpxq of competitive equilibrium risk prices by finding a ro-
bust planner’s marginal valuations of exposures to the W shocks. We decompose that price
vector into separate compensations for bearing risk and for accepting model uncertainty.
We verify that the plan for log C that emerges from the robust planner’s problem coincides
with the plan for consumption that solves the portfolio problem of a robust investor who
takes those prices as given.
    Noting from the robust planning problem that the shock exposure vectors for log A and
log C must coincide implies
                                       f ˚ “ p.01qσc x.

From (34b) and the solution for s˚
                                             u˚ “ η ˚ pzq,

where η ˚ can be shown to be the worst-case drift from the robust planning problem if we
  23
    An alternative timing protocol that allows the maximizing player to take account of the impact of its
decisions on the minimizing agent implies the same equilibrium decision rules described in the text. See
Hansen and Sargent (2008, ch. 5).


                                                   48
can show that Ψr “ Ψ,
                    p where Ψ   p is the value function for the robust planning problem.
Thus, from (34a), ω “ ω ˚ , where

    Similarly, in the problem faced by a representative investor within a competitive equi-
librium, the drifts for log A and log C coincide:

                                                      .0001

                                                        2

so that ι “ ι˚ , where

                                                                   .0001

By setting Ψ
           r “ Ψ,
               p we use these formulas for equilibrium prices to construct a solution to
the HJB equation of a representative investor in a competitive equilibrium.
