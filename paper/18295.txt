Convergence and Modernization Revisited

                                              ABSTRACT

In an 80-country panel since the 1960s, the convergence rate for per capita GDP is around 1.7% per
year. This “beta convergence” is conditional on an array of explanatory variables that hold constant
countries’ long-run characteristics. The introduction of country fixed effects generates a much higher–and,
I argue, misleading–convergence rate. In a much longer time frame–34 countries with GDP data starting
between 1870 and 1896–estimation with country fixed effects is more appropriate, and the estimated
convergence rate is around 2.4% per year. Combining the point estimates from the post-1960s and
post-1870 panels suggests that the conditional convergence rate is between 1.7% and 2.4% per year,
an interval that contains the “iron-law” rate of 2%. In the post-1960s panel, estimation without country
fixed effects supports the modernization hypothesis, in the form of positive effects of per capita GDP
and schooling on democracy and maintenance of law and order. The long-term panel with country
fixed effects also supports modernization, in the sense of positive effects of per capita GDP and schooling
on the Polity indicator for democracy. A measure of dispersion–the standard deviation of the log of
per capita GDP across 25 countries–is reasonably stable since 1870. This lack of “sigma convergence”
is consistent with the presence of beta convergence. For 34 countries–including China and India–observed
since 1896, the dispersion of per capita GDP declines since the late 1970s, especially when the country
data are weighted by population. This sigma convergence reflects particularly the incorporation of
China and India into the world market economy. For 29 countries since 1919, the levels and trends
in cross-country dispersion are similar for consumption and GDP.

        According to the “iron law of convergence,” countries eliminate gaps in levels of real per

capita GDP at a rate around 2% per year.1 Convergence at a 2% rate implies that it takes 35

years for half of an initial gap to vanish and 115 years for 90% to disappear. Convergence-rate

parameters are important to pin down because they provide guidance on how fast countries like

China and India are likely to catch up to richer countries. The convergence rate may also reveal

how fast a poor African country could develop or how rapidly North Korea could catch up to the

South, and so on.

        Empirically, the iron law takes the form of unconditional or absolute convergence in

some samples of economies; those that are reasonably homogeneous in terms of long-run or

steady-state characteristics. For example, a roughly 2% convergence rate emerged for per capita

personal income in a long-term panel of U.S. states in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992).2 This

convergence was absolute in the sense of not having to be conditioned on a set of variables that

capture differences in long-run positions. The results implied—in accordance with the data—

that the U.S. South would not get close in per capita income to the rest of the country for about a

century. Applying these results to East versus West Germany suggested that a short time frame

for convergence was not a realistic expectation.3 And, looking forward to the potential

  I first heard this term applied to my empirical findings on economic growth by Rudi Dornbusch. However, Larry
Summers said that Rudi got the term from him. In any event, the term is reminiscent of the “iron law of wages.”
According to Wikipedia, this phrase came from Lassalle, but Marx and Engels argued that Lassalle got the idea from
Malthus’s theory of population and the terminology from Goethe.
2
  Baumol (1986, Figure 2) reported unconditional convergence from 1870 to 1979 for 16 countries (all subsequently
OECD members), using data from Maddison (1982). However, De Long (1988) showed that Baumol’s results
depended on a sample-selection issue, whereby only countries that were rich toward the end of the sample (1979)
were considered. Unconditional convergence did not hold for an expanded sample of 22 countries that were
selected based on per capita income in 1870 (De Long [1988, Figure 2]). This sample-selection criticism of
Baumol’s (1986) findings was presented earlier by Romer (1986, pp. 1012-1013). Rodrik (2012) finds
unconditional convergence in labor productivity across manufacturing industries for recent decades in 118 countries.
3
  Barro (2002) found that the predicted slow convergence between East and West Germany accorded with regional
data on GDP per worker through the late 1990s. However, wage rates converged faster because of the German
government’s transfer and subsidy policies.
reunification of North and South Korea, the iron law presents a pessimistic outlook on how

rapidly the large gap in per capita product could be eliminated.

         The 2% convergence rate holds in contexts of conditional convergence for heterogeneous

collections of economies that differ substantially in terms of long-run properties. This

convergence is conditional in the sense of holding only with an allowance for differences in

constant or slowly varying cross-economy characteristics, such as saving rates or fertility rates or

quantity of human capital or institutional quality or colonial history or geographical features.

For example, a convergence rate around 2% appeared in a cross section of 98 countries in Barro

and Sala-i-Martin (1992, Table 3), after conditioning on an array of variables that differed by

country.4 Because of the conditioning variables, these results were more pessimistic than the

iron-law convergence rate would suggest. Poor places—for example, many sub-Saharan African

countries or North Korea or Burma or Bolivia or Venezuela—might not converge at all if key

underlying variables, such as the quality of human capital and institutions, were not improved.

         The present study uses updated cross-country panels to reexamine the iron law of

convergence. One data set comprises a large number of countries with observations for many

variables since the 1960s. Another data set exploits recent advances in long-term national-

accounts information. These data cover over a century but apply to fewer countries and

variables. In both contexts, the distinction between absolute and conditional convergence is

important. And, within the context of conditional convergence, a key technical issue is whether

the cross-country regressions include country fixed effects.




4
 In earlier work, Barro (1991) reported conditional convergence for the cross section of 98 countries but did not
express the results in terms of a convergence rate.

         Many analyses of economic growth stress effects from the quality of institutions, gauged

particularly by maintenance of the rule of law and democracy.5 A prominent feature of this

analysis is two-way causation between economic development and institutional quality.

Specifically, according to the “modernization hypothesis,” economic development spurs the

introduction and maintenance of higher quality institutions, including well-functioning

representative democracy.6 The validity of the modernization thesis is important for its own

sake—particularly for understanding how democracy evolves—as well as for assessing

institutional determinants of economic growth.

         I use the two updated panel data sets to reassess the empirical status of the modernization

hypothesis. From an econometric standpoint, the analysis of modernization turns out to have

significant parallels with the study of convergence. Both types of results are sensitive to the

treatment of country fixed effects.


I. Thoughts on Country Fixed Effects

         Cross-country empirical findings concerning convergence and modernization are

sensitive to the seemingly mundane issue of whether the panel regressions include country fixed

effects. The incorporation of these fixed effects into cross-country panel regressions has become

almost routine.7 However, the merits of including these fixed effects are not straightforward, as




5
  Knack and Keefer (1995) and Mauro (1995) studied growth effects from rule of law and corruption. Przeworski
and Limongi (1993) and Barro (1997, Ch. 2) assessed growth effects from democracy. King and Levine (1993)
examined effects of financial institutions on economic growth. Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer
(2004) argued that institutions should be measured by basic legal constraints on the government, rather than political
outcomes, which include official corruption and risk of expropriation.
6
  Contributions to the modernization literature include Aristotle (1932), Lipset (1959), Dahl (1991), and Huntington
(1991). Marx (1913) extended the modernization idea to a predicted collapse of organized religion under capitalism.
7
  This approach applied to economic growth seems to have begun with Knight, Loayza, and Villanueva (1993); Islam
(1995); and Caselli, Esquivel, and Lefort (1996). Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2005, 2008) advocate
the use of country fixed effects in studies of the modernization hypothesis.

                                                          3
they involve a tradeoff between two forces, highlighted by Nerlove (2000). The appendix brings

out details, using Monte Carlo methods.

         To fix ideas, consider cross-country panel regressions for the growth rate of per capita

GDP. Country fixed effects are attractive as a way to allow for unobserved, persistent country

characteristics that influence long-run per capita GDP and are also correlated with observed per

capita GDP. That is, rich countries tend to have prospered because they possess persistently

favorable characteristics that lead to high steady-state per capita GDP. From this omitted-

variables perspective, the exclusion of country fixed effects tends to bias upward the estimated

effect of lagged GDP on current GDP and, thereby, bias downward the estimated convergence

rate. One example of this effect is the tendency to estimate an absolute convergence rate near

zero in a panel of heterogeneous countries. However, this bias may be small if the framework

without country fixed effects includes a sufficiently rich set of explanatory variables so that little

remains of omitted variables that are conditionally correlated with per capita GDP.

         The second force involves the Hurwicz (1950)-type bias in the estimated coefficient of a

lagged dependent variable. In samples that are small in the time dimension, Nickell (1981),

Arellano and Bond (1991), Kiviet (1995), and Nerlove (2000), among others, show that this

force biases downward the fixed-effects estimator (based on least squares with dummy variables)

for the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable.8 Although this bias vanishes as the sample

becomes large in the time dimension, in the usual panel context with moderate time frames, the

Hurwicz bias tends to be substantial. (As I discuss later, the effective time dimension cannot be

expanded by observing the data more frequently; for example, annually, rather than every five or

ten years.) On this ground, the estimated convergence rate tends to be overestimated (because

8
 The Hurwicz bias arises because the realized error terms appear in the sample mean of the lagged dependent
variable. Moreover, this effect co-varies negatively with the terms involving departures of the dependent variable
from its sample mean.

                                                         4
the persistence in the level of the dependent variable is underestimated), thereby offsetting the

omitted-variables bias.9

        When country fixed effects are included and the time dimension of the sample is

moderate—say 20 or 40 years—the panel effectively comprises multiple cases of moderate

length. Since the regression for each country features a similar Hurwicz bias, this bias tends to

apply also to the overall sample. In contrast, if country fixed effects are excluded, the

observations are effectively stacked in the time and country dimensions. That is, with 80

countries and 10 time periods (as in the subsequent analysis of data since the 1960s), the 800

observations amount to a large sample in the relevant time dimension, and one would anticipate

that the Hurwicz bias would be small. In other words, this bias may arise mostly because of the

inclusion of country fixed effects. These conjectures are confirmed by Monte Carlo studies

described in the appendix.

        Inclusion of country fixed effects also affects the estimated coefficients of explanatory

variables—X variables—other than lagged dependent variables. Coefficients on country

variables that are constant (such as geographical features and colonial history) cannot be

estimated at all, and variables that have little within-country time variation cannot be estimated

with precision. In effect, the inclusion of country fixed effects throws out much of the

information in isolating the effects of X variables on growth rates.

        Problems in estimating coefficients of X variables in a fixed-effects context apply to the

recent debate about the modernization hypothesis in Glaeser, la Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and

Shleifer (2004); Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Shleifer (2007); and Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and

Yared (2005, 2008). The failure in the Acemoglu, et al. studies to find statistically significant


9
 Hauk and Wacziarg (2009) assess problems with fixed-effects regressions, focusing on effects from omitted
variables and temporary measurement error. They do not consider the Hurwicz bias.

                                                        5
effects on democracy from per capita GDP and education depends, in their main analysis, on the

inclusion of country fixed effects. This result is not surprising because, with country fixed

effects, it is challenging to estimate statistically significant coefficients on X variables that do not

have a lot of independent variation over time within countries. In contrast, without country fixed

effects, as in the Glaeser, et al. studies and Barro (1999), the typically substantial cross-sectional

variation in the X variables makes it easier to isolate statistically significant effects.

        The perspective changes in the context of panel data observed for over a century. In this

setting, the econometric problems posed by the inclusion of country fixed effects should be much

less serious. In particular, the Hurwicz bias is smaller in this context, as confirmed by the Monte

Carlo studies discussed in the appendix.


II. The Framework of Conditional Convergence

        This section summarizes well-known implications of the neoclassical growth model and

its extensions for empirical analyses of conditional convergence. The model features a

production function,


        (1)                               =    ∙        ,   ,


where F(·) satisfies the usual neoclassical properties, including constant returns to scale in

capital, K, and labor, L. Output per worker, y≡Y/L, depends on capital per worker, k≡K/L:


        (2)                             y = f(k).


The economy is closed, so that saving and investment coincide. In the baseline model, there is

no government sector, but extensions allow for government purchases and taxes.

        The labor force, measured as work-hours per year, is related in a fixed way to population,

which grows at rate n. The labor force is fully employed and, therefore, corresponds to labor

                                                    6
input, L, in equation (1).   Given these assumptions, the quantities y and k, measured per worker

in equation (2), can be interpreted as quantities per capita. In the baseline model, n is constant

over time within an economy but may differ across economies.

       In the baseline model, the gross saving rate (which equals the ratio of gross investment to

GDP) is a constant, s (as in Solow [1956] and Swan [1956]), which may differ across economies.

The first major extension of the Solow-Swan framework was to endogenize the saving rate. In a

setting based on Ramsey (1928), Cass (1965), and Koopmans (1965), the representative

household determines the optimal saving rate at each point in time in the context of an iso-

elastic, time-additive utility function. The equilibrium value of s then varies over time within

economies along a transition path to the steady state. Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, Ch. 2)

show that, if F(·) is Cobb-Douglas, the transitional behavior of the saving rate is monotonic—

always rising toward its steady-state value, always falling toward its steady-state value, or

always constant at its steady-state value. (This result shows that the Solow-Swan setting is a

special case of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model.) With rising (falling) s, the convergence rate

is slower (faster) than in the model with fixed s. With alternative utility functions, the transition

may not be monotonic; for example, the transition path for s may be hump-shaped. Across

economies, differences in preference and other parameters can shift the path of s when

considered in relation to GDP per capita, y. An economy with higher s at a given y tends to

grow faster.

       Just as the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans analysis endogenized the fixed and exogenous

saving rate of Solow-Swan, the model can be extended along the lines of Malthus (1798) to




                                                  7
endogenize the population growth rate, n.10 Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, section 9.2) allow

for choices over time of the fertility rate for a given mortality rate. In the case where child-

rearing costs rise linearly with k (because, as in Becker [1991], child-rearing is intensive in

parental time, which is valued in accordance with the wage rate), n falls montonically during the

transition to the steady state. This pattern reduces the convergence rate compared to the setting

in which n is fixed.11 However, the allowance for goods costs of child rearing can generate a

non-monotonic pattern in which fertility first rises and later falls as per capita GDP, y, increases.

Across economies, differences in preference and other parameters (including costs related to the

rearing of children) can shift the path of n when considered in relation to y. An economy with

lower n at a given y tends to grow faster.

         In the baseline model, the productivity factor, A, can differ across economies. This factor

may rise over time due to exogenous technical progress. The usual steady-state properties

depend on technical progress taking the labor-augmenting form. In this setting, effective labor

input, , replaces L in equation (1),            is the multiple ext of L, and x≥0 is the rate of technological

progress. In this context, the results for the growth-rate transition go through in terms of

quantities per effective labor; that is, as          ≡ Y/ and        ≡ K/ . In the Cobb-Douglas case, labor-

augmenting technical progress is equivalent to exogenous growth in A in equation (1). In

extensions, differences in A (or in the path of A) within or across economies can reflect the

quality of institutions, including maintenance of property rights and the efficiency of the tax




10
   Malthus had a model of endogenous population growth, but he tended to get the signs wrong. Specifically, he
predicted a positive effect of real per capita GDP on fertility, whereas, in the modern data, the relation tends to go in
the opposite direction. See Manuelli and Seshadri (2009).
11
   In this model, a rise in the mortality rate would raise the fertility rate one-to-one, except that this response implies
a larger flow of child-rearing costs. Because these higher costs work in the same way as higher depreciation on
capital, a higher mortality rate tends to lower the growth rate of GDP at a given capital intensity.

                                                             8
system. That is, the economy’s response to weak property rights or high marginal income-tax

rates is essentially equivalent to its response to a reduction in productivity, A.

        The research on endogenous growth due to endogenous technical change began with

Romer (1987, 1990), Aghion and Howitt (1992), and Grossman and Helpman (1991, Chs. 3

and 4).12 In these models, technological advances derive from purposeful and successful R&D

activity. In “varieties” models (Romer [1987, 1990] and Grossman and Helpman [1991, Ch. 3]),

discoveries of new types of intermediate inputs raise productivity by (metaphorically) expanding

the number of inputs employed in production. In “quality-ladders” models (Aghion and Howitt

[1992] and Grossman and Helpman [1991, Ch. 4]), innovations raise the quality of intermediate

inputs within sectors (or, equivalently, improve the efficiency of production processes). From

the perspective of the Solow-Swan model, the theories of technological progress effectively

endogenize the growth rate of the productivity factor, A. Endogenous growth theory can be

viewed, accordingly, as another extension of the Solow-Swan model to endogenize a key

parameter; in this case, A (that is, the time path of A), rather than s or n.

        Endogenous growth theory has not played a major role in empirical studies of the

determinants of economic growth across countries. The main empirical applications of the

theory have involved effects of R&D outlays. This research builds on the (pre-endogenous-

growth) approach described by Griliches (1973), which starts by computing TFP growth rates as

Solow residuals in a growth-accounting framework.13 The TFP growth rates can then be related


12
   Other research on endogenous growth—exemplified by Romer (1986), Lucas (1988), and Rebelo (1991)—built on
earlier work by Arrow (1962) and Uzawa (1965) and did not provide a theory of technical change. In these models,
growth may go on indefinitely because the returns to investment in a broad class of capital goods, which include
human capital, may not diminish as economies develop. (This idea goes back to Knight [1944]). Spillovers of
knowledge across producers and external benefits from human capital may be parts of the process because they help
to avoid the tendency for diminishing returns to capital. Models of this type are sometimes described as “AK
models,” because the growth dynamics looks like that in a simple framework with constant returns to capital.
13
   This idea began with Solow (1957) and was extended to allow for changing quality of an array of inputs by
Jorgenson and Griliches (1967). See also Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, section 10.4).

                                                       9
econometrically to measures of R&D expenditures. This methodology was applied to U.S. firms

and industries by Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984) and Griliches (1988). Coe and Helpman

(1995) applied this framework to aggregate data for OECD countries and reported large positive

effects of R&D outlays on economic growth.14 However, a problem with this approach is that—

in the absence of good instruments—a positive relation between R&D spending and economic

growth can reflect reverse causation from growth opportunities to R&D, rather than effects of

R&D and technological progress on growth.

        One reason that endogenous growth theory has not played a major role in cross-country

growth analysis is that the theory may apply mostly to the worldwide average growth rate. This

perspective would apply if international trade, foreign investment, and the flow of ideas lead to

rapid diffusion of technology across countries. The speed of diffusion of technology was

assessed theoretically in Nelson and Phelps (1966), who stressed the role of human capital, and

in subsequent models summarized in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, Ch. 8). Caselli and

Coleman (2001) found empirically for developing countries that imports of computers and other

high-tech equipment—viewed as a proxy for technology absorption—were spurred by increased

imports from technologically advanced countries. Technological diffusion was also higher

when the home country had higher levels of school attainment at secondary and higher levels and

better institutional quality.

        A further extension of the neoclassical growth model, introduced by Mankiw, Romer,

and Weil (1992), distinguishes human from physical capital. One way that this extension affects

the dynamics of economic growth involves the greater difficulty in adjusting human capital, H,

compared to physical capital, K. In this case, the growth rate of y tends to be a higher at a given

14
  More recently, Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Griffith, and Howitt (2005) have used a model related to endogenous-
growth theory as the framework for an empirical study of the relation between competition and innovation across
firms.

                                                       10
y if the ratio H/K is higher. For an economy below its steady-state position, a higher H/K

(perhaps generated from a war that destroyed much more physical than human capital) means

that subsequent growth focuses on K, which is easier than H to expand rapidly.15

          Suppose that L is the number of workers and h is human capital per worker, so that

quality-adjusted labor input is H=hL. The input H then replaces L in equation (1). Assume,

further, that h relates to years of schooling along Mincerian lines, so that


                                            h = eλS,


where S is (average) years of schooling and λ is the rate of return on schooling (if the cost of

schooling is the income foregone by not employing human capital in production). If the

production function in equation (1) is Cobb-Douglas with exponents a on K and b on H, we can

derive:


          (3)             log(H/K) = (1/a)·log(A) – (1/a)·log(y) + λ·(1 + b/a)·S.


Therefore, for given A, a higher S signals a higher H/K at a given y, which predicts higher

economic growth. However, for a given H/K, a higher S would signal a lower A at a given y,

which predicts lower economic growth. In the empirical analysis, I assume that, although S and

y are observable, A (corresponding to total factor productivity) cannot be measured (because K

cannot be measured accurately). In this case, the overall effect of S on economic growth, for

given y, is ambiguous. In the empirical analysis, the estimated effect on growth from the level of

S turns out to be small and typically statistically insignificantly different from zero.




15
  Analogously, for an economy above its steady-state position, a higher H/K means that the reduction in H takes
place slowly, thereby making the growth rate of y higher (perhaps less negative) than it would be otherwise.

III. Cross-Country Growth Regressions

       The preceding section implies that the growth rate of real per capita GDP, Dyit, for

country i at date t can be written as

       (4)                              =Φ(yit, sit, nit, Ait, …),
                                          (-) (+) (-) (+)

where the negative sign under yit reflects convergence, conditional on the other variables. These

other influences include variables related to the saving rate, sit, the population growth rate, nit,

and the level of productivity, Ait. In the main analysis, I estimate equation (4) using per capita

growth rates of GDP averaged over 5- or 10-year periods. Sometimes the analysis includes

constant terms that are specific to countries (country fixed effects). The estimation always

includes constants for each time period (time effects)—therefore, the analysis does not attempt to

explain variations over time of world average growth rates.

       One well-known problem with cross-country growth regressions is endogeneity of some

of the X variables. For example, it is unclear whether good institutions cause economic growth

or are a reaction to rising living standards—or, perhaps, that GDP and institutional quality are

responses to common influences. Previous studies have proposed instruments to deal with this

problem. Examples are gravity variables including country size and trade restrictions that

influence international trade (Lee [1993]); ethnolinguistic fractionalization (Mauro [1995]);

population density and settler mortality at the time of colonial settlement (Engerman and

Sokoloff [1997], Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson [2001, 2002]); the form of legal origins (La

Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny [1998]); absolute degrees latitude and primary

language (Hall and Jones [1999]); the presence of state religion (Barro and McCleary [2003]);

and physical characteristics of islands (Feyrer and Sacerdote [2009]). One problem is that the

proposed instruments typically do not vary over time in the sample within countries and,

                                                      12
therefore, do not help when country fixed effects are included. A more basic issue, if one allows

for the plausibly multi-dimensional set of X variables that matters for economic growth, is that

there are never enough convincing instruments to allow for full identification.

         The present empirical analysis uses lagged values of the X variables as instruments. For

example, in considering the growth rate from 2000 to 2005, the average of the investment ratio

from 2000 to 2005 enters into the regression equation but the investment ratio for 2000 is on the

instrument list. This use of lagged X values as instruments helps to deal with endogeneity in

some contexts (and also to alleviate problems of temporary measurement error). However, this

approach is not fully satisfactory because of the strong serial correlation in some X variables.

         In the main, the estimated effects on growth rates in the form of equation (4) reflect

influences that are predictable with a 5- or 10-year lag—corresponding to the use of 5- or 10-

year lagged values of the X variables as instruments for the right-hand-side variables.

Contemporaneous growth-rate influences can also arise, corresponding, for example, to shifts in

the productivity factor, Ait, over the 5- or 10-year periods over which growth rates are measured.

In practice, the only variable used of this type is the contemporaneous growth rate of country i’s

terms of trade, which is taken as an exogenous influence on country i.16

         Another well-known issue is the robustness of the results with respect to which X

variables are included and in what functional form. Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhoffer, and Miller

(2004) deal with this problem using a Bayesian model-averaging approach. This technique

effectively weights each possible specification (among millions of possibilities) by the fits to the

dependent variable (in their case, the growth rate of per capita GDP from 1960 to 1996). Sala-i-

Martin, et al. apply this method to 67 X variables that have been proposed in the empirical


16
  The growth rate of the terms of trade is interacted with the openness ratio, measured as exports plus imports
relative to GDP.

                                                         13
growth literature, using data for 88 countries (see Barro and Sala-i-Martin [2004, Table 12.6]).

The conclusion is that only 5 of the variables have posterior inclusion probabilities above 0.5 and

18 have probabilities above 0.1. However, with 67 variables considered, many are conceptually

similar, so that low inclusion probabilities are not surprising.

       My view is that one has to accept the idea that pinpointing precisely which X variables

matter for growth is impossible. However, what is feasible is interpreting the results in terms of

broad influences that matter for growth; for example, quality of institutions, openness to markets,

and so on. In addition, one can interpret results on conditional convergence—gauged

empirically by the estimated coefficient on the lag value of log(y)—holding fixed an array of X

variables. These results on conditional convergence tend not to be highly sensitive to exactly

which X variables are included.


IV. Empirical Results

       Table 1 contains empirical results for the cross-country panel of 80 countries. Table 2

lists the countries in the sample. The dependent variable in the main specification is each

country’s growth rate of per capita GDP over 10 5-year intervals from 1960-65 to 2005-09. (The

last period is shortened because of data availability.) Note that the growth rates are expressed

per year, not per five-year period.

       Column 1 of Table 1 includes as right-hand-side variables only time effects and the

5-year lag of the log of per capita GDP. The estimated coefficient on the lag is positive

(indicating divergence rather than convergence) but statistically insignificantly different from

zero. This result reproduces the typical pattern whereby absolute convergence of per capita GDP

does not apply to a heterogeneous collection of countries. From the standpoint of equation (4),

the interpretation is that the 5-year lag of the log of per capita GDP is positively correlated with


                                                 14
determinants of the steady-state position that raise the long-run level of per capita GDP. This

omitted-variables effect offsets the convergence force and leads, thereby, to an estimated

coefficient on the lagged log of per capita GDP that is close to zero. The Monte Carlo analysis

in the appendix (Table A1, line 11) reproduces this kind of result.

         Column 2 adds country fixed effects, which are jointly highly statistically significant.

The estimated coefficient of the lagged log of per capita GDP is now significantly negative,

-0.0326 (s.e.=0.0048).17 This result suggests conditional convergence (conditional on individual

constants for each country) at a rate of 3.3% per year. A possible interpretation is that each

country’s fixed effect proxies for the influences of the various determinants of long-run per

capita GDP that appear in equation (4)—at least to the extent that these determinants do not vary

greatly over time within countries. Therefore, the estimated coefficient on the lagged log of per

capita GDP now picks up the predicted convergence force indicated by the negative sign in

equation (4). However, as noted before, there is also a tendency to overestimate convergence in

the presence of country fixed effects because of the Hurwicz bias in the estimated coefficient of a

lagged dependent variable. The Monte Carlo analysis (Table A1, lines 1 and 2) shows how these

overestimates can be substantial.

         Column 3 includes, instead of country fixed effects, an array of time-varying X variables

for each country.18 These variables are intended to proxy for the various growth determinants,

aside from lagged per capita GDP, that enter into equation (4). Unlike in column 1, the

estimated coefficient of the lagged log of per capita GDP is significantly negative, -0.0171


17
   In this and the subsequent regressions, one can think equivalently of the dependent variable as the log of the level
of per capita GDP (observed for 1965, 1970, ..., 2009), with the five-year lag of this variable (for 1960, 1965, …,
2005) included on the right-hand side. In this version of the regression from Table 1, column 2, the coefficient on
the lagged dependent variable is 0.837 (which equals 1 minus 5 times the estimated convergence coefficient of
0.0326 per year).
18
   I considered some variables that were constant over time within countries—the absolute value of degrees latitude,
land-locked status, and aspects of colonial history and legal origins—but these turned out to be unimportant.

                                                          15
(s.e.=0.0022), and indicates convergence near the iron-law rate of 2 percent per year. This

convergence is conditional in the sense of holding for given values of the X variables.

         The estimated coefficients of the X variables in column 3 can be viewed mostly as effects

on long-run or steady-state positions for each country. For example, with respect to institutional

quality, the results imply that a country’s long-run economic position is enhanced by better

maintenance of law and order (and the rule of law).19 Greater democracy (gauged by the level

and square of the Freedom House indicator for political rights20) tends initially to stimulate

growth but later retards growth. The break point between marginal effects being positive or

negative occurs roughly at the half-way mark between full dictatorship (value zero) and full

representative democracy (value one). Analogous effects of democracy on economic growth

were reported and interpreted in Barro (1997, Ch. 2).

         Other findings are that countries’ long-run positions are enhanced by a lower mortality

rate (gauged by the reciprocal of life expectancy at birth), a lower fertility rate, greater openness

to international trade, and higher female relative to male school attainment. The schooling effect

does not relate to the overall level of human capital in the sense of total years of attainment. In

fact, the estimated effect from a general increase in attainment—where average years of female

and male schooling change by equal amounts—differs insignificantly from zero, a result that is

consistent with the conceptual analysis of human capital presented earlier. A reasonable

interpretation is that an expansion in female relative to male attainment—typically implying a

19
   The law-and-order variable (previously called rule-of-law) comes from International Country Risk Guide, which is
produced by Political Risk Services. These data were first used in academic research by Knack and Keefer (1995).
The law-and-order indicator starts in 1982 or later. The panel regressions in Table 1, column 3, use each country’s
first value available for this variable for the periods that start in 1980-85 or earlier. If the sample covers only the
five periods that begin with 1985-90, the results are similar to those in column 3. For example, the coefficient on
the lagged log of per capita GDP is -0.0209 (s.e.=0.0031) and that on the law-and-order variable is 0.0179
(s.e.=0.0088). An alternative to the ICRG data is the information on perceived quality of governance assembled by
the World Bank (available at www.govindicators.org). However, these data have the serious shortcoming of being
available only since the late 1990s.
20
   Analogous data from Bollen (1980) were used for 1960 and 1965.

                                                          16
decline in the gap between male and female average years of schooling—signals an

improvement more generally in political and social arrangements that support economic growth.

       Several explanatory variables have estimated coefficients that differ insignificantly from

zero: the investment ratio (which would correspond to the saving rate in a closed economy), the

government-consumption ratio, and the inflation rate. I discuss more findings below related to

the investment ratio and the inflation rate. Finally, the results reveal a significantly positive

contemporaneous impact on growth from improvements in a country’s terms of trade.

       As discussed before, the Hurwicz bias in the estimated coefficient of a lagged dependent

variable is likely to be small in the context of column 3, where country fixed effects are absent.

The estimated coefficient of the lagged log of per capita GDP would tend to be underestimated in

magnitude if there are still important omitted determinants of long-run per capita GDP that are

conditionally correlated with per capita GDP. However, given the substantial list of growth

determinants included, this omitted-variables bias may be small (unlike in column 1). Therefore,

it is possible that OLS without country fixed effects can deliver accurate estimates of the

convergence rate, as confirmed in the appendix by Monte Carlo analysis (Table A2, lines 9-12).

       Column 4 allows for country fixed effects along with the X variables. The fixed effects

are still jointly highly statistically significant. The estimated coefficient of the lagged log of per

capita GDP, -0.0445 (s.e.=0.0051), is negative, statistically significant, and larger in magnitude

than in columns 2 or 3. Taken at face value, the indicated conditional convergence rate is 4.5%

per year. However, as discussed before, the convergence rate tends to be seriously overestimated

because of the Hurwicz bias (as confirmed by the Monte Carlo studies considered in the

appendix; see Table A2, lines 1 and 3).




                                                  17
         Many of the X variables that were statistically significant in column 2 are no longer

statistically significant in column 4—because only within-country variation is now used to

identify these coefficients. As an example, although the indicator for the maintenance of law and

order was a significantly positive determinant of growth in column 3, this variable no longer has

significant explanatory power in column 4. The likely explanation is not that institutional quality

is unimportant for growth but, rather, that there is insufficient within-country variation in this

quality (as measured) to isolate a statistically significant effect. This explanation is particularly

plausible when one considers the many X variables included in the panel regression and the

likely measurement error in the indicator of institutional quality.

         Table 3 contains additional panel regressions for growth rates. Column 1 parallels Table

1, column 3, but uses OLS,21 rather than instrumental variables (with lagged values of the X

variables used as instruments). The results are similar in most respects, except that, under OLS,

the estimated coefficient of the investment ratio is significantly positive, whereas that on the

inflation rate is significantly negative. These last results likely reflect the joint short-run

determination of GDP with investment and inflation, whereby the typical pattern is for the

investment ratio to be procyclical and the inflation rate to be countercyclical. Hence, the OLS

results on these estimated coefficients cannot be reliably interpreted as isolating causation from

the investment ratio or the inflation rate to GDP growth.

         Table 3, column 2, uses 10-year averages for growth rates, with corresponding

adjustments in the definitions of the X variables. The results are similar to those for the 5-year

case in Table 1, column 3, except that the standard errors for the estimated coefficients are higher


21
  Table 3, column 1 includes all the X variables on the instrument list but departs from OLS by allowing for
correlation of the error term over time within countries. With full OLS, the estimated coefficients are the same but
the standard errors of the estimated coefficients are somewhat smaller except for the one on the terms-of-trade
variable.

                                                         18
in the 10-year specification; that is, some information is lost by averaging over 10 years, rather

than 5. The estimated convergence rates per year are similar: -0.0163 (s.e.=0.0023) for the 10-

year case, versus -0.0171 (s.e.=0.0022) for the 5-year. When country fixed effects are included,

the results for 10-year periods (not shown) are also similar to those with 5-year periods (Table 1,

column 4). The same general conclusions hold with annual observations on GDP growth rates.

For the convergence rate, in a system without country fixed effects, the estimated convergence

coefficient is -0.0176 (s.e.=0.0024), similar to those in Table 1, column 3, and Table 3,

column 2.22

         Overall, the results show that changing the time dimension of the sample by observing

the data more or less frequently—shifting, say, from 10-year to 5-year to 1-year periods—has

minor implications, particularly for the convergence rate. This result in the context of country

fixed effects accords with the formula for the Hurwicz bias derived for a simple case in Nickell

(1981, p. 1422).23


22
   The annual system is problematic because some of the data (school attainment, changes in the terms of trade, and
the inflation rate) were constructed only over 5-year intervals. Moreover, other data—on life expectancy and the
fertility rate—are provided at an annual frequency but are not really annual variables. In any event, the annual
results (using interpolated values of the variables available at 5-year intervals) show much poorer fits than the
systems at 5-year and 10-year intervals. The R-squared value for the annual case is 0.137, and the standard error of
the regression is 0.049. (This system for 80 countries has 3478 total observations.)
23
   Nickell (1981, p. 1422) provides a formula for the bias in the least-squares-with-dummy-variables estimate for the
coefficient of a lagged dependent variable when there are cross-sectional fixed effects, no X variables, the number of
cross sections is large, and the initial values of the dependent variable are treated as given. It can be shown that
what matters for the bias in his formula is the overall length of the sample, not the number of periods over which the
data are observed. Suppose that β is the convergence rate per year. The coefficient of the lagged dependent
variable, ρ in Nickell’s formula, is given by ρ=e-βτ, where τ is the period length in years. Let T be the sample length
in years (differing from Nickell’s notation). Nickell’s formula implies that the proportionate bias in the estimated β
depends (as an approximation based on βτ being much less than one) only on the product βT. The formula is, if
β>0:
                                                         ∙        !"#$
                                         −    / ]≈                         > 0.
                                                     #%$ %    ∙     !"#$
Therefore, a change in the period length, τ, with T held fixed, does not affect the calculated bias, and the empirical
findings (and Monte Carlo analysis) on convergence with fixed effects included are consistent with this result.
Quantitatively, if β=0.02 per year, Nickell’s formula generates an upward bias of 0.070 when T=40 years and 0.018
when T=139 years (corresponding to the long-term sample used later). Hence, although the bias approaches zero as
T approaches infinity, the bias can be large in samples of realistic length. However, these results are only
suggestive, because the Nickell formula depends on a number of unrealistic assumptions, particularly about the X
variables. Detailed Monte Carlo results are in the appendix.

                                                             19
        Table 3, column 3, goes further in the exploration of the implications of country fixed

effects by allowing for two separate sets of country dummy variables—one applying to the first

five periods (1960-65, …, 1980-85) and the other to the second five (1985-90, …, 2005-09).

The break in the set of country fixed effects from the first half to the second half of the sample is

jointly highly statistically significant, as are the fixed effects overall. Not surprisingly, the

standard errors of the estimated coefficients of all the X variables are higher than those in

Table 1, column 4. That is, the richer structure of country fixed effects makes it even more

problematic to use the within-country variation to estimate the effects of X variables. For

present purposes, the most interesting result is that the estimated coefficient on the lagged log of

per capita GDP, -0.0783 (s.e.=0.0094), becomes even larger in magnitude (compared to Table 1,

column 4), now indicating convergence at 8% per year. A reasonable interpretation is that the

extra set of country fixed effects effectively cuts the time dimension of the sample by half (from

40 plus years to 20 plus years) and, thereby, intensifies the Hurwicz bias (see n. 23 and the

appendix on Monte Carlo results). Hence, these findings provide a further warning that country

fixed effects can cause serious upward bias in estimated convergence rates.

        Finally, Table 3, column 4, replaces the Freedom House measure of political rights by the

Polity measure of democracy/autocracy. The results are similar to those based on the Freedom

House indicator (Table 1, column 3), although the estimated coefficients on the Polity variable

and its square are not individually statistically significant. These variables are jointly statistically

significant (p-value=0.045), as was also true for the Freedom House variables (p-value=0.004).

        My inference from the cross-country data starting in the 1960s—covering 40-plus years

for most countries—is that the most reliable estimates of convergence rates come from systems

that exclude country fixed effects but include an array of X variables to mitigate the



                                                  20
consequences of omitted variables. That is, I would emphasize the results in Table 1, column 3.

However, as I discuss later, the fixed-effects results seem more convincing in systems for the

more limited set of countries with data over a century or more.


V. Modernization

        The modernization thesis applied to democracy is that economic development—gauged

particularly by per capita GDP and education—promotes democratic institutions. This idea was

emphasized by Lipset (1959), who credits the concept to Aristotle (1932).24 Glaeser, Ponzetto,

and Shleifer (2007) provide a theoretical rationale for the effect of education on democracy

through the channel of higher education motivating greater participation in political and other

social activities. The Aristotle-Lipset hypothesis can be extended beyond democracy to apply to

measures of institutional quality, including the indicator for maintenance of law and order (and

the rule of law).

        Barro (1999) provided empirical confirmation of the Aristotle-Lipset hypothesis in a

cross-country panel, with stress on the Freedom House measure of political rights. Additional

supporting analysis along these lines appears in Glaeser, la Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer

(2004) and Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Shleifer (2007). However, these results have been challenged

by Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2005, 2008), who argue that education and per

capita GDP do not have statistically significant causal influences on democracy. As in

estimating convergence rates for economic growth, the essence of much of this recent empirical

debate about modernization turns on whether one includes country fixed effects in the empirical

analysis of data on democracy and other measures of institutional quality.

24
  According to Lipset (1959, p. 75): “From Aristotle down to the present, men have argued that only in a wealthy
society in which relatively few citizens lived in real poverty could a situation exist in which the mass of the
population could intelligently participate in politics and could develop the self-restraint necessary to avoid
succumbing to the appeals of irresponsible demagogues.”

                                                        21
        Table 4 contains panel regressions in which the dependent variables are indicators of

institutional quality. Columns 1 and 2 use the law-and-order measure from International

Country Risk Guide (previous described by ICRG as maintenance of the rule of law). This

dependent variable is observed for 1990, 1995, …, 2009 for 124 countries. Columns 3 and 4 use

the Freedom House measure of political rights, observed in 1975, 1980, …, 2009 for 141

countries. Columns 5 and 6 use the Polity measure of democracy/autocracy, observed in

1965, …, 2009 for 133 countries.

        In Table 4, the X variables are limited to those stressed in the recent literature on

modernization—per capita GDP and measures of years of school attainment.25 The analysis

distinguishes average years of schooling by females and males and, in some cases, by primary

versus upper (secondary and higher). The regressions also include five-year lagged values of the

dependent variable. These forms are analogous to those used before for economic growth

(which included lagged levels of the log of per capita GDP on the right-hand side). The method

of estimation, using lags of the X variables as instruments, is analogous to that in Table 1.

        Table 4, column 1, applies to the law-and-order indicator. The projected persistence over

five years is given by the estimated coefficient of the lagged dependent variable, 0.708

(s.e.=0.026). This estimated coefficient differs significantly from one (which would indicate no

adjustment over five years toward a target value) or zero (which would correspond to full

adjustment over five years). The estimated coefficient implies that it takes 10 years to eliminate

half an initial gap between the law-and-order indicator and its long-run target and 32 years to

eliminate 90% of an initial gap.



25
 The schooling data come from the recent update of the Barro-Lee data set, as described in Barro and Lee (2012).
For the data, see “Educational Attainment Data” at www.rbarro.com/data-sets.


                                                       22
            With respect to X variables, the estimated coefficient on the log of per capita GDP is

significantly positive, 0.0248 (s.e.=0.0066). The effect from overall years of schooling is also

significantly positive (p-value=0.016),26 but the results show a positive and statistically

significant coefficient for male schooling (0.0164, s.e.=0.0068) and a negative but statistically

insignificant coefficient for female schooling (-0.0093, s.e.=0.0062). The three indicators of

economic development—the log of per capita GDP and average years of female and male

schooling—are jointly highly statistically significant (p-value=0.000). Hence, the system that

excludes country fixed effects provides strong evidence of modernization with regard to effects

from GDP and schooling on institutions that maintain law and order (and the rule of law).

            Table 4, column 2, shows the impact from allowing for country fixed effects, which are

jointly highly statistically significant. The results change compared with column 1 in ways

familiar from the analysis of economic growth: the estimated coefficient of the lagged

dependent variable falls substantially (to 0.332, s.e.=0.045), and the standard errors of the

estimated coefficients of the X variables rise sharply. The latter effect is strong enough so that

none of the three X variables are now individually statistically significant. Moreover, these three

variables become jointly insignificant (p-value=0.62). Hence, with country fixed effects, there is

no longer empirical support for the modernization hypothesis with respect to effects of GDP and

schooling on maintenance of law and order. It is worth stressing that, in this fixed-effects

context, there is also no statistically significant effect of the law-and-order variable on economic

growth (Table 1, column 4). In other words, with country fixed effects, the law-and-order

variable seems uninteresting overall.

            Results with the Freedom House indicator of political rights (a measure of democracy) as

the dependent variable are in Table 4, columns 3 and 4. In the system without country fixed
26
     This result corresponds to the sum of the coefficients on female and male school attainment.

                                                            23
effects in column 3, the persistence over five years is given by the estimated coefficient of the

lagged dependent variable, 0.796 (s.e.=0.018). Hence, the estimated persistence again differs

significantly from zero or one. In this case, it takes 15 years to eliminate 50% of an initial gap

between the democracy indicator and its long-run target and 51 years to eliminate 90% of the

gap.

            The X variables again include per capita GDP and now also distinguish female and male

schooling by average years at the primary and upper levels. The five X variables are jointly

highly statistically significant in Table 4, column 3 (p-value=0.000). The effect from the log of

per capita GDP, 0.0112 (s.e.=0.0067), is positive but not quite statistically significant at the 5%

level. School years overall are significantly positive (p-value=0.034).27 Particularly important

positive predictors of political rights are average years of female primary schooling (0.0439,

s.e.=0.0138) and average years of male upper schooling (0.0344, s.e.=0.0142). Overall, this

system without country fixed effects provides strong evidence for modernization with respect to

effects of GDP and schooling on political rights; that is, for democracy.

            In column 4, the incorporation of country fixed effects again reduces the estimated

persistence—the estimated coefficient of the lagged dependent variable becomes 0.456

(s.e.=0.034). Also as before, the standard errors of the estimated coefficients on the X variables

blow up, thereby leading to joint statistical insignificance for the five variables considered

(p-value=0.59). Therefore, with country fixed effects, there is no longer empirical support for

the modernization hypothesis with regard to effects of GDP and schooling on political rights. It

is also true with fixed effects that political rights do not have a statistically significant effect on

economic growth (Table 1, column 4). Thus, as with the law-and-order indicator, the inclusion

of country fixed effects makes the political-rights variable look uninteresting.
27
     This result corresponds to the sum of all of the coefficients related to school attainment.

                                                              24
         Results for the Polity democracy/autocracy indicator are mostly similar to those for the

Freedom House political-rights variable. Without country fixed effects in Table 4, column 5, the

coefficient of the lagged dependent variable is about the same as that in column 3. Total school

years and the overall set of X variables are highly statistically significant in column 5. With

country fixed effects included in column 6, the one difference from before (column 4) is that the

X variables are jointly statistically significant. However, much of this significance stems from

the negative impact estimated for male average years of upper schooling. Thus, we would

conclude with the Polity variable that the modernization hypothesis is strongly confirmed in the

system without fixed effects (column 5) but not in the system with fixed effects (column 6).

         Acemoglu, et al., rely mainly on results with country fixed effects to argue that the

modernization hypothesis is empirically not supported in cross-country panel data. They do not

mention that, in the same context, the quality of institutions lacks explanatory power for

economic growth. In any event, my inference is that the results signal the dangers from the

inclusion of country fixed effects: this procedure seriously reduces the information contained in

the panel data (reflected in the blowing up of coefficient standard errors for the X variables) and

biases downward the estimated persistence effects, as revealed by the coefficients of lagged

dependent variables.28 I show in a later section that the results with country fixed effects look

different—and supportive of the modernization hypothesis—in systems estimated over time

frames of over a century.



28
  Acemoglu, et al. (2008, p. 820) argue that this bias in the fixed-effects estimated coefficient of a lagged dependent
variable can be mitigated by observing the data at a higher frequency, such as annually: “Column 6 [of Table 3]
estimates … with OLS using annual observations. This is useful since the fixed effect OLS estimator becomes
consistent as the number of observations becomes large. With annual observations, we have a reasonably large time
dimension.” The results in n. 23 imply that this argument is incorrect. The proportionate bias in the estimated
coefficient of a lagged dependent variable depends in Nickell’s (1981) analysis on the overall length of the sample
in years (or, actually, on the product βT, where β is the convergence rate per year and T is the sample length in
years), not on the frequency of observation of the data.

                                                          25
        For systems estimated with data spanning intervals of roughly 25 to 45 years—starting

between 1965 and 1985 and ending in 2009—the most reliable (though imperfect) information

on the determinants of institutional quality likely comes from systems that exclude country fixed

effects but include measures of GDP and schooling. Thus, in Table 4, I would emphasize the

findings in columns 1, 3, and 5. These results strongly support the modernization hypothesis

with regard to effects of GDP and schooling on the determination of the quality of institutions,

gauged by law and order and democracy. As with economic growth, the fixed-effects estimation

seems more appropriate in systems for the limited group of countries with data over a century or

more. These results are discussed in the next section.


VI. Long-Term Panels

        Until recently, the best long-term macroeconomic panel data were the per-capita GDP

series assembled by Maddison (2003). These series constitute a monumental contribution that

has been widely used. However, the data have serious shortcomings, discussed and largely

rectified in a new data set on per capita GDP and consumer expenditure assembled by Ursúa and

me and described in Ursúa (2011).29 The construction of these data was challenging, described

by Ursúa as macroeconomic archeology, and various methods were implemented to include

periods and countries originally missing or inadequately treated in standard sources. The new

data set covers 42 countries and goes back at least to 1913 and in many cases to 1870 or earlier.

        For the present long-term analysis, I use a sample of 34 countries with annual data on per

capita GDP starting between 1870 and 1896. The list of countries is in the notes to Table 5.


29
  The data are available as “Barro-Ursúa Macroeconomic Data” at www.rbarro.com/data-sets. Full annual time
series back to 1913 are provided for 40 countries for real per capita GDP (with a missing observation for Greece in
1944) and 28 countries for real per capita personal consumer expenditure. The data on the website are expressed as
indexes for each country, with the value in 2006 normalized to 100. For the present study, the values were
converted to levels comparable across countries based on data on 2005 PPP-adjusted real per capita GDP from the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators.

                                                        26
There is a limited supply of X variables available over this long time frame. The Polity indicator

of democracy is available since at least 1901 (with some gaps) for 28 of the 34 countries in the

GDP sample. Data on total years of schooling for the population aged 15 and over are available

since 1870 for 26 of the countries in the GDP sample. These schooling data, available at 10-year

intervals up to 1950, were constructed by Morrisson and Murtin (2008), using underlying

information on school-enrollment rates and population structure from Mitchell (2003a, 2003b,

2003c). I linked these data to the previously noted Barro-Lee data, which are available since

1950.


        A. Growth rates of per capita GDP

        Columns 1-2 of Table 5 use as the dependent variable the growth rate of real per capita

GDP over 5-year periods from 1870-75 to 2005-09. These systems include no X variables and,

therefore, parallel the results in Table 1, columns 1 and 2. Column 1 excludes country fixed

effects and includes as a regressor only the log of the five-year lag of per capita GDP (along with

time effects). Unlike in Table 1, column 1, the estimated coefficient on the lagged log of per

capita GDP is significantly negative at the 5% level, -0.0024 (s.e.=0.0010). However, the

indicated convergence rate is only around 0.2% per year.

        Table 5, column 2, adds country fixed effects. The estimated coefficient of the log of

lagged per capita GDP, -0.0241 (s.e.=0.0035), shows convergence at 2.4% per year. This value

is lower in magnitude than that found in Table 1, column 2.30

        I redid the analysis from Table 5, columns 1 and 2, by adding as X variables the Polity

indicator and its square (as in Table 3, column 4) and the measure of years of schooling (as in


30
  A reasonable concern is that the comparison between the long-term and short-term results depends on sample
selection with respect to which countries have long-term data. However, the post-1960s results in Table 1 do not
differ greatly if the sample comprises only the 34 countries included in the long-term sample in Table 5.

                                                        27
Table 1, column 1, but using the long-term data). With these X variables included, the sample

size falls to 26 countries. In the systems with country fixed effects, the estimated convergence

rates change little with the addition of these X variables, but there are some effects from the

diminished sample size. For example, in the 26-country sample with fixed effects and the X

variables, the estimated convergence rate is 2.9% per year, rather than the 2.4% found in Table 5,

column 2. However, in this sample, the estimated convergence rate is 3.1% when the X

variables are excluded. The key force here is the deletion from the 34-country sample of several

poor countries that did not grow rapidly for much of the sample—China, Egypt, India, Indonesia,

Russia, and Sri Lanka.

       In the long samples, the lack of information on the rich array of X variables considered in

Table 1, columns 3 and 4, suggests that the omitted-variables bias would be substantial in

systems that omit country fixed effects. Thus, the estimated convergence rate of less than 1%

per year in Table 5, column 1, is likely to be a serious underestimate of the true convergence

rate. On the other hand, because of the long time series, the Hurwicz bias on the coefficient of

the log of lagged per capita GDP—in column 2—is likely to be much less serious than that in

Table 1, columns 2 and 4. (See n. 23 for a quantitative analysis of this bias in Nickell’s [1981]

model and the appendix for Monte Carlo analyses.) Therefore, the estimated convergence rate of

around 2.4% per year in Table 5, column 2, may be only a small overestimate of the true

conditional convergence rate.

       We can put the long-term results from Table 5 together with the shorter-term results from

Table 1. From Table 1, the best estimate of the convergence rate probably comes in column 3

from the system without country fixed effects but with an array of X variables. The estimated

conditional convergence rate here is 1.7% per year, with a two-standard-error band of 1.3% to



                                                 28
2.2%. This result may be a small underestimate of the true convergence rate—to the extent that

the system still omits long-run growth determinants that are conditionally correlated with per

capita GDP. From Table 5, the best estimate likely comes in column 2 from the system with

country fixed effects. The estimated convergence rate here is 2.4% per year, with a two-

standard-error band of 1.7% to 3.1%. This result may be a small overestimate of the true

convergence rate—to the extent that the Hurwicz bias still operates in this long-term sample.

         Combined results from the two panel data sets suggest that the true conditional

convergence rate is, in terms of point estimates, bounded between 1.7% and 2.4% per year.

Interestingly, this interval contains the iron-law rate of 2% per year.


         B. Polity indicator

         Columns 3 and 4 of Table 5 return to the modernization hypothesis by considering long-

term panel regressions for the Polity indicator. Column 3 excludes country fixed effects. The

estimated coefficient on the 5-year lag of the dependent variable, 0.760 (s.e.=0.027), is similar to

that in Table 4, column 5. From the standpoint of the modernization hypothesis, the important

results in Table 5, column 3, are the significantly positive coefficients of 0.0321 (s.e.=0.0158) on

the log of per capita GDP and 0.0145 (s.e.=0.0044) on years of schooling for the population aged

15 and over.31 These two variables are jointly statistically significant with a p-value of 0.000.

This finding parallels the result in Table 4, column 5, concerning the joint statistical significance

of the group of variables comprising the log of per capita GDP and four schooling variables.

         Table 5, column 4, adds country fixed effects. This change reduces the estimated

coefficient on the lagged dependent variable to 0.729 (s.e.=0.030). Although this change is in


31
  The regression includes the average of the log of per capita GDP over the 5-year periods; that is, the average of the
first through fifth lag. The instrument list includes the 6-year lag of the log of per capita GDP. The schooling
variable is the average of the contemporaneous and 5-year lag with the 5-year lag used as an instrument.

                                                          29
the same direction as before (Table 4, column 6), the effect is now much smaller in magnitude.

This result is expected because of the much longer time series employed in Table 5. With the

variables observed over 139 years, the Hurwicz bias in the presence of country fixed effects may

be small (see n. 23 and the Monte Carlo results in the appendix).

        The standard errors of the estimated coefficients of the per capita GDP and schooling

variables go up, as before, with the introduction of country fixed effects. However, these effects

are smaller than before, and the estimated coefficient of the log of per capita GDP, 0.0732

(s.e.=0.0283), remains significantly positive in Table 5, column 4. The estimated coefficient on

the schooling variable, 0.0119 (s.e.=0.0097), is still positive but no longer statistically significant

at the 5% level. Most importantly from the perspective of the modernization hypothesis, the

estimated coefficients on the per capita GDP and schooling variables are jointly statistically

significant with a p-value of 0.013. Hence, even with the inclusion of country fixed effects, the

long-term sample supports the modernization hypothesis with regard to the overall effects of per

capita GDP and schooling on the Polity indicator for democracy.32


VII. Natural Experiments

        An attractive way to avoid estimation problems related to the endogeneity of X variables

is to exploit natural experiments in which cross-economy differences are clearly exogenous and

substantial. This approach has been applied particularly to studies of the consequences of

differences in institutional quality. Two frequently mentioned cases of this kind are the post-

WWII separations of Germany into East and West and of Korea between North and South.



32
 Acemoglu, et al. (2008, Table 7) argue that lagged per capita GDP lacks significant explanatory power for the
Polity indicator over long samples for 25 countries starting in 1875. However, their analysis relies on the
questionable Maddison data and—because of limitations in the availability of the Maddison data—considers effects
only with a lag of 25 years. (They also fail to find significant effects at 50-year lags for a larger sample of
countries.)

                                                       30
         One attraction of these “natural experiments’ is that they isolate sharp differences in the

quality of institutions (West Germany being superior to East Germany and South Korea being

better than North Korea), while (as in the labor-economics literature on twins) arguably avoiding

substantial differences in most other X variables. Most importantly, the sources of the better

institutions are plausibly exogenous political events, rather than responses to economic

conditions. It is, therefore, convincing in these cases that the reason for higher GDP growth rates

post-separation in the places with better institutions is the better institutions.

         Although these kinds of natural experiments are useful, a serious drawback is the

selection issue about which cases to consider. There is a tendency to focus on examples that

work; that is, where the underlying differences in institutional quality are clear and due to

exogenous political events and also where these differences are, in fact, accompanied by large

growth-rate differentials in the hypothesized direction.

         Consider as an example the peaceful split of Czechoslovakia into two independent

countries in 1993. It would have been easy to argue at the time (as I recall doing myself) that the

more highly developed Czech Republic retained high-quality institutions, whereas the Slovak

Republic ended up with an institutional void. And, if the relative growth performances after

1993 had strongly favored the Czech Republic, this case would likely have joined Germany and

Korea as a clear demonstration of the importance of institutional differences in promoting

economic growth.33 Yet, in practice, real per capita GDP in the Slovak Republic grew from

1993 to 2009 at 4.7% per year, whereas that in the Czech Republic grew by 3.1% per year—so

that the ratio of Czech to Slovak per capita GDP fell from 1.48 in 1993 to 1.15 in 2009. This


33
  However, unlike North and South Korea, the Czech and Slovak parts of Czechoslovakia had major differences in
ethnic and cultural backgrounds (differences that also applied for East versus West Germany). Although the ethno-
cultural division explained the way that Czechoslovakia was divided up, the timing of the split in 1993 and the fact
of the breakup at all can still be regarded as mainly exogenous.

                                                         31
outcome seems consistent with usual convergence behavior without having to condition on major

differences in institutional quality. However, in the usual analysis of natural experiments, the

Czech/Slovak case is not taken as contrary evidence to the hypothesis that institutional quality is

the key to economic growth. Instead, this case is typically ignored.

       Similar observations apply to many other cases that could have been considered; for

example, effects on institutional quality and economic growth from breakups of the Soviet Union

and Yugoslavia into independent republics. To carry out this kind of analysis in an organized

and global manner, it is necessary to have a comprehensive sample that includes measures of

institutional quality, just as in the cross-country panel regressions of Table 1. Therefore, in the

end, the appeal to natural experiments does not avoid many of the estimation issues associated

with usual regression analyses.


VIII. Cross-Country Dispersion of Per Capita GDP and Consumption

       The concept of convergence discussed thus far pertains to whether countries that are

poorer (in absolute terms or in relation to their own steady-state positions) tend to grow faster

than richer ones. In Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991), this concept is called β-convergence and is

distinguished from another form (σ-convergence) that relates to a tendency for the cross-

sectional dispersion of per capita GDP to decline over time. This dispersion can be measured in

proportionate terms by the cross-sectional standard deviation of the log of per capita GDP.

       If all countries have the same steady-state per capita GDP, then the existence of β

convergence tends to reduce the cross-sectional dispersion over time. However, if individual

country shocks are present, these shocks tend to raise dispersion. With purely idiosyncratic

country shocks, the cross-sectional variance tends to approach a value that depends positively on

the variance of the shocks and negatively on the rate of β convergence. The cross-sectional


                                                 32
variance tends to fall over time if it starts above its steady-state value but tends, otherwise, to rise

over time (even though β convergence is present). If the sample comprises a large number of

countries that have existed with fixed underlying parameters for a long time, the cross-sectional

variance will tend at any point in time to be close to its long-run value.34

         The long-term data on per capita GDP and consumption described in Ursúa (2011) can be

used to study the long-run evolution of cross-country dispersion (see n. 29). Figure 1 applies to

the longest feasible sample, 1870-2009, for which 25 countries (20 of which were subsequently

OECD members) have annual data on real per capita GDP. The countries are listed in the note to

the figure. Dispersion is measured by the standard deviation across countries of the log of real

per capita GDP. The blue line weights countries equally, and the red line weights by population

(thereby corresponding under some conditions to the dispersion of income for persons rather

than countries).

         The blue line (equally weighted) in Figure 1 shows small changes over time, when

considered in relation to subsequent figures. The range is from 0.58 in 2009 to 0.71 in 1946.

The main movement away from the mean of 0.65 associates with WWII—the standard deviation

rose from 0.62 in 1938 to 0.71 in 1946. During this crisis period, shocks had a high spatial

correlation and affected groups of countries differentially, thereby violating the assumption of

purely idiosyncratic country shocks.35 Otherwise, the main finding is that the cross-sectional




34
   The notion that a tendency for the poor to grow faster than the rich implies a negative trend in dispersion or
inequality is a fallacy; in fact, it is Galton’s Fallacy (Galton [1886, 1889], Quah [1993], Hart [1995]), which Galton
applied to the distribution of heights across a population. For generations of an extended family, height has positive
persistence but tends to revert to the population mean, thereby constituting a form of β convergence. Nevertheless,
the dispersion of heights across the overall population typically changes little over time.
35
   Similarly, in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991, Figure 4), the large dispersion in per capita personal income across
the U.S. states in 1880 reflects the differential impact of the Civil War on the South versus the North. However,
across the U.S. states, the long-run standard deviation for the log of per capita personal income was only around 0.2,
much smaller than that across countries.

                                                         33
standard deviation of the log of per capita GDP is remarkably stable since 1870 around its mean

of 0.65.

        The red line (population weighted) tells a similar story, except that this measure of

dispersion is more sensitive to the major crises during the world wars and the 1990s in Russia (a

relatively poor country with a large population). In 2009, the population-weighted standard

deviation of 0.60 is close to the equally-weighted value of 0.58.

        Figure 2 extends to a larger sample by using the 34 countries with GDP data starting at

least by 1896. This sample is less subject than the 25-country group used before to the sample-

selection problem of tending to include countries that were rich toward the end of the sample.

The note to the figure lists the countries. Most importantly, this extension adds the world’s two

largest countries by population, China and India.

        The dispersion measured by the blue line (equally weighted) in Figure 2 is higher than

that in Figure 1 because the expansion of the sample brings in several countries with per capita

GDP well below the mean. Compared to Figure 1, the blue graph in Figure 2 shows more

substantial changes over time, with the standard deviation starting at 0.87 in 1896 and rising

during the Great Depression and WWII to 1.04 in 1946. That is, the years from the early 1930s

through the mid 1940s exhibit a “great divergence,” which persists through the mid 1970s. From

there on, the standard deviation falls from 1.07 in 1974 to 0.79 in 2009. The decline in this last

phase reflects particularly the strong growth in developing countries, including China, India, and

Indonesia.36 We can anticipate that, in the long run, the standard deviation in this 34-country

sample will fall toward the average value of 0.65 found in Figure 1—because the added


36
  Thus, the sample-selection criterion in Figure 1 (25 countries having GDP data back to 1870) actually understates
σ convergence compared to that in Figure 2 (34 countries having GDP data back to 1896). The results in Baumol
(1986, Figure 1) were the reverse—with the restriction of the sample to 16 countries with data from Maddison
(1982) back to 1870 tending to overstate σ convergence.

                                                        34
developing countries seem to be joining the richer group selected in Figure 1 (by the criterion of

having GDP data back to 1870).

       The red line (population weighted) in Figure 2 starts with higher dispersion than the blue

line (equally weighted) because the largest countries by population, China and India, begin far

below the world mean for per capita GDP. The trend in the population-weighted series is similar

to that for the equally-weighted series in exhibiting a great divergence from the early 1930s

through the 1940s and persisting up to the mid 1970s. Thereafter, the dispersion falls sharply,

going from 1.58 in 1974 to 0.85 in 2009. This recent trend, highlighted in terms of the world

distribution of income by Sala-i-Martin (2006), reflects particularly the strong growth in China

since the late 1970s and in India since the mid 1980s.

       To study the dispersion in consumption, the sample has to begin later to include a

substantial number of countries. Figures 3 and 4 cover 29 countries observed for per capita

personal consumer expenditure, C, since 1919. Note that this sample, listed in the note to

Figure 3, includes India but not China (because C data for China start only in 1952).

       Figure 3 shows the equal-weight dispersion in GDP and C for the 29 countries. The

levels and patterns in the two series do not differ greatly, although C dispersion is lower than

GDP dispersion in most years. In 2009, the two values are similar—0.69 for GDP and 0.68

for C. Both series show modest declines since the mid 1970s—GDP dispersion falls from 0.85

in 1973 to 0.69 in 2009, while C dispersion falls from 0.79 in 1973 to 0.68 in 2009.

       Figure 4 has the population-weighted measures. The exclusion of China is important

when comparing with the population-weighted series for GDP in Figure 2. The GDP and C

series in Figure 4 again show similar levels and trends. The C series is lower in most years but




                                                 35
higher since 1994. The two series show declines since 1979 but not as much as in Figure 2

because of the exclusion of China in Figure 4.


IX. Summary Observations

       For a large panel of countries since the 1960s, the estimated conditional convergence rate

for per capita GDP is around 1.7% per year in systems with a rich array of explanatory variables

but no country fixed effects. The results feature statistically significant influences on economic

growth from institutional quality, measured by maintenance of law and order and democracy.

Analogous settings support the modernization hypothesis, in the sense of significantly positive

impacts of per capita GDP and schooling on the indicators for maintenance of law and order and

democracy.

       The inclusion of country fixed effects produces much higher convergence rates,

eliminates statistically significant effects of the institutional measures on economic growth, and

removes the statistical support for modernization. I argue that these problematic findings reflect

econometric issues associated with the inclusion of country fixed effects in panels with moderate

time dimension.

       In a panel for a limited number of countries observed since 1870, the estimated

conditional convergence rate in the presence of country fixed effects is about 2.4% per year.

This setting supports the modernization hypothesis in the sense of statistically significant,

positive effects from per capita GDP on democracy. These “reasonable” results with country

fixed effects likely arise because the econometric problems posed by country fixed effects may

not be serious in samples with long time frames.

       A combination of the results from short and long panels implies that the conditional

convergence rate is in the neighborhood of the “iron-law” rate of 2% per year. The similar


                                                 36
findings from these two very different empirical settings suggest that a conditional convergence

rate of around 2% may be a robust empirical regularity. The two settings considered jointly also

provide strong support for the modernization hypothesis.

                                        Notes to Table 1

        The dependent variable is the annual growth rate of real per capita GDP for the ten
periods: 1960-65, 1965-70, …, 2005-09. The last period ends in 2009 because of data
availability. Lagged per capita GDP is for 1960, 1965, …, 2005. Values for 1959, 1964, …,
2004 are used as instruments. Other regressors are averages over periods, with lagged values
used as instruments. The error terms are allowed to be correlated over time within countries.
Standard errors of coefficient estimates are in parentheses. The sample criterion was to include
countries only if they have data starting by the 1965-70 period. The democracy indicator is the
political-rights variable from Freedom House. Joint p-values for the two democracy variables
are 0.004 in column 3 and 0.26 in column 4. The fixed effects in columns 2 and 4 are dummies
for 79 of the countries shown in Table 2.

       Definitions and sources:

        PPP-adjusted real per capita GDP is from Penn World Tables
(www.pwt.econ.upenn.edu), version 7.0, in units of 2005 international dollars. Also from this
source are the ratios to GDP of investment (private plus public) and government consumption
and the openness ratio (exports plus imports relative to GDP). These ratio variables use current-
price information.

      Life expectancy at birth and total fertility rate are from the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators (WDI).

       The law-and-order indicator (converted from seven categories to a 0-1 scale, with 1
representing highest maintenance of law and order) is from Political Risk Services, International
Country Risk Guide.

       Average years of school attainment for females and males and at various levels of
schooling are from Barro and Lee data set. Source: “Educational Attainment Data,” available at
www.rbarro.com/data-sets.

       The terms-of-trade change (growth rates over five years of export prices relative to
import prices) is from International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics, and WDI.
This variable is interacted with the openness ratio.

       The political-rights variable (converted from seven categories to a 0-1 scale, with 1
representing highest rights) is from Freedom House (www.freedomhouse.org). Data on an
analogous concept for 1960 and 1965 are from Bollen (1980).

       The inflation rate (averaged over 5-year intervals) is calculated from retail-price indexes
from International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics, and WDI.

                                        Notes to Table 3

       See the notes to Table 1.

       Column 1 corresponds to column 3 of Table 1 but all regressors are on the instrument list
(corresponding to OLS, except for allowing the error terms to be correlated over time within
countries). The p-value for the two electoral-rights variables jointly is 0.027. Results from OLS
have the same estimated coefficients, but the standard errors of these coefficients are somewhat
lower (except for the terms-of-trade variable). For example, for the log of lagged GDP, the
standard error declines from 0.0022 to 0.0018.

        The other columns estimate by instrumental variables, as in Table 1. Column 2
corresponds to column 3 of Table 1, except that the dependent variable is the growth rate of per
capita GDP for the five “10-year” periods 1960-70, …, 2000-09. The regressors are defined
analogously for the 10-year periods.

       Column 3 corresponds to column 4 of Table 1 but has one set of fixed effects for the five
5-year growth-rate observations from 1960-65 to 1980-85 and another set for the five
observations from 1985-90 to 2005-09.

       Column 4 is the same as column 3 of Table 1, except that the democracy indicator (the
Freedom House measure of political rights) is replaced by the Polity measure of democracy less
autocracy. The joint p-value for the two Polity variables is 0.045.

       Sources: The Polity indicator is for democracy less autocracy (converted from a -10 to
+10 scale to a 0-1 scale, with 1 representing highest democracy), from Polity IV
(www.systemicpeace.org). Other sources are given in the notes to Table 1.

       See the notes to Tables 1 and 3.

        The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is the indicator for law and order from
International Country Risk Guide, observed at the five dates: 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2009.
In columns 3 and 4, the dependent variable is the Freedom House measure of political rights,
observed at the eight dates: 1975, …, 2009. In columns 5 and 6, the dependent variable is the
Polity measure of democracy less autocracy, observed at the ten dates: 1965, …, 2009. The
lagged dependent variable applies to 1985, …, 2005 in columns 1 and 2; 1970, …, 2005 in
columns 3 and 4; and 1960, …, 2005 in columns 5 and 6. These lagged dependent variables are
on the instrument lists. As in Table 1, the other regressors are averages over periods, with lagged
values used as instruments. The error terms are allowed to be correlated over time within
countries. Standard errors of coefficient estimates are in parentheses. Country fixed effects are
included in columns 2, 4, and 6.

                                        Notes to Table 5

        The sample criterion in the upper part was to include countries only if they have GDP
data starting by 1896. This criterion selected 34 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland,
India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Portugal,
Russia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States,
Uruguay, and Venezuela. For the lower part, countries also had Polity data starting at least by
1901 and schooling data starting by 1870. The 8 countries lost from the GDP sample were
China, Egypt, Finland, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Russia, and Sri Lanka. Standard errors of
coefficient estimates are in parentheses.

        Columns 1-2: The dependent variable is the annual growth rate of real per capita GDP
for the 34 countries for 28 periods: 1870-75, 1875-80, …, 2005-09. Lagged per capita GDP is
for 1870, 1875, …, 2005. Values for 1869, 1874, …, 2004 are used as instruments. The error
terms are allowed to be correlated over time within countries. The fixed effects in column 2 are
dummies for 33 of the countries.

        Columns 3-4: The dependent variable is the Polity measure of democracy less the
measure of autocracy, observed for the 26 countries at 28 dates: 1875, 1880, …, 2009. The
lagged dependent variable applies to 1870, 1875, …, 2005. These lagged dependent variables
are on the instrument lists. The log(per capita GDP) variables are averages over the periods,
with lagged values used as instruments. The schooling variable (included on the instrument list)
is a 5-year lag, with values before 1950 interpolated from 10-year values. The error terms are
allowed to be correlated over time within countries. The fixed effects in column 4 are dummies
for 25 of the countries.


        Sources: GDP and consumption (personal consumer expenditure) are from “Barro-
Ursúa Macroeconomic Data,” available at www.rbarro.com/data-sets. The source of the Polity
indicator is given in the notes to Table 3. Schooling data since 1950 are years of attainment for
the overall population aged 15 and above from the Barro-Lee data described in the notes to
Table 1. Schooling data before 1950 are for the overall population aged 15 and above from
Morrison and Murtin (2008). These data were adjusted in accordance with the proportionate
difference in the two sources for 1950.

        Monte Carlo Analysis of Dynamic Estimation with and without Fixed Effects


        The dynamic model with fixed effects and no time-varying X variable follows Hurwicz

(1950), Nickell (1981), Arellano and Bond (1991), and Nerlove (2000):


        (A1)                     yit = ηi + γ·yi, t-1 + εit,


where i = 1, …, N represents “countries;” t = 1, …, T represents periods; yit is per capita GDP or

some other country-time variable; 0<γ<1; and εit ̴ N(0, &' ) is an i.i.d. shock. I think of the fixed

effect, ηi, as being drawn once for each country at the beginning of time, where ηi ̴ N(0, &( ) is

an i.i.d. disturbance. (The normality assumption should not be important here.) As stressed by

Nerlove (2000), the initial sample value yi0 cannot be viewed as independent of ηi, because yi0

comes from the cumulation of equation (A1) from the indefinite past; hence, yi0 depends on ηi

                                                                       (   +%
and past realizations of the εit. Specifically, we have yi0 ̴ N(! )*, ! ,*). Therefore, a country that

gets a high draw for ηi tends also to have a high yi0.

        The model with the addition of a time-varying, exogenous X variable is:

        (A2)                     yit = ηi + γ·yi, t-1 + α·Xit + εit,


        (A3)                     Xit = ρ·Xi,t-1 + uit,


where ηi, γ, and εit are defined as before, α is a constant, 0<ρ<1 governs the persistence of the X

variable, and uit ̴ N(0, &- ) is an i.i.d. shock. The initial sample value of the X variable is given

                            +%
accordingly by Xi0 ̴ N(0, ! ./). The initial sample value of y reflects its dependence on ηi and

past shocks to εit and uit from equations (A2) and (A3), and this dependence implies a

relationship with Xi0 (which depends on past shocks to uit). Specifically, we can write

                                                         58

and wi0 ̴ N(0, σ1 ), independently of Xi0, where

Equations (A4) and (A5) imply that, if α>0, a country that gets a high draw for Xi0 tends also to

have a high yi0.

        If periods are of length τ (years), the persistence coefficient, γ, relates to the convergence

rate, β>0, from γ = e-βτ. I assume that βτ is much less than 1, so that γ ≈ 1-βτ and, hence,

β ≈ (1-γ)/τ. For annual periods (τ=1 year), the convergence rate per year is β ≈ 1-γ.


        A. Model with Fixed Effects

        Consider first the model in equation (A1) with a country fixed effect and no X variable.

The standard deviation of the time-series shock, σε, can be normalized to 1, so that ση represents

the dispersion of the country (cross-sectional) shock, relative to the time-series shock. In Nickell

(1981), the analysis applied as the number of cross sections, N, tended to infinity. In my Monte

Carlo analysis, N (number of countries) = 20 seems large enough to approximate this asymptotic

setting. I use N=100 below.

        I contrast the results using OLS without country fixed effects with those using country

fixed effects (OLS with dummy variables). As discussed in the text, the estimated coefficients γ

and β from the two methods involve a tradeoff between two types of biases. I begin with a

heuristic description of the results.

                                                          59
         For OLS without country fixed effects, the Hurwicz bias is unimportant—even if the time

dimension, T, is small—but an omitted-variables bias applies. The omitted variables are the

country fixed effects, ηi, which are positively correlated with the yit. This effect biases up the

estimated γ and, therefore, biases down the estimated β. This omitted-variables channel is more

important the larger ση. For small enough ση, the omitted-variables effect is minor, and OLS

without country fixed effects produces nearly unbiased estimates.

         For OLS with country fixed effects, there are no omitted variables,37 but the Hurwicz bias

may be large. This effect biases down the estimated γ and, therefore, biases up the estimated β.

The size of the Hurwicz bias depends on the length of the time series, T. If T is small—even 20

or 50 years—the bias is substantial. However, for large enough T, the bias becomes small, so

that OLS with country fixed effects produces nearly unbiased estimates. However, even a

sample of 140 years (the largest time frame considered in the text) is not sufficient to make the

bias negligible. Unlike the case without country fixed effects, the size of ση is unimportant for

the bias—because the estimation takes account of the variations in the ηi.

         The upper part of Table A1 applies to OLS estimation with country fixed effects. Two

values of the convergence rate, β = 1-γ, are considered, 0.02 and 0.10 per year. The emphasis in

this part of the table is on the effect of the time dimension, T, on the mean of the estimated 7 ,

shown in column 5. The bias is always upward, reflecting the Hurwicz channel. For example, if

β=0.02 per year, the mean of 7 when T=20 (line 1) is 0.151; that is, the upward bias is dramatic.

The mean of 7 falls to 0.070 when T=50 (line 2) and 0.036 when T=140 (line 5). Hence,

although the bias is much reduced compared to that applying to short time series, even T=140

years is insufficient to make the bias negligible. Changing the standard deviation ση of the fixed

37
 If the equation for yit includes X variables—not all of which are included in the empirical specification—there
would still be an omitted-variables problem.

                                                         60
effect does not impact the results (lines 4 and 9 of the table) because the fixed effects are

estimated; that is, there is no omitted-variables problem here.

        The results for E( 7 ) from Nickell’s formula, shown in column 4 of Table A1, are similar

to the Monte Carlo results for the mean of 7 in column 5. Some differences arise because

Nickell’s formula applies as the number of cross sections, N, approaches infinity. More

importantly, Nickell treated the initial sample values, yi0, as given, rather than allowing for a

relation with the fixed effect, ηi. This issue is more important in the estimation without country

fixed effects (not considered by Nickell [1981]).

        The lower part of Table A1 applies to OLS estimation without country fixed effects. The

focus in this part of the table is on the impact of the standard deviation, ση, for the fixed effects.

The bias in the estimate 7 is always downward, reflecting the omitted-variables channel. For

example, when β=0.02, T=100, and ση=1 (line 11), the mean of 7 in column 5 is 0.0003. Hence,

the bias is sharply downward in this case. However, the mean of 7 rises to 0.011 when ση=0.1

(line 12) and 0.020 when ση=0.01 (line 14). Thus, because the Hurwicz bias is unimportant, the

estimate 7 is virtually unbiased for a ση that is small enough to make the omitted-variables bias

unimportant.

        The time dimension, T, has a nonzero but moderate effect on the results without country

fixed effects (lines 13 and 17 of Table A1). For example, reducing T from 100 to 20 (lines 12

and 13) actually lowers the bias: the mean of the estimate 7 goes from 0.0111 to 0.0126 (but the

standard error of the estimate roughly doubles). I lack intuition for the reduced bias, but

analytical results analogous to Nickell’s formula could probably be generated for the setting

without country fixed effects.




                                                  61
       Another approach is to consider estimation other than OLS, with or without country fixed

effects. For example, Arellano and Bond (1991) use a GMM procedure, using lags of the

dependent variable as instruments in a first-differenced setting. However, Blundell and Bond

(1998, pp. 115, 116, 120) note that this procedure suffers from a weak-instruments problem and

has large finite-sample bias. The problems are particularly serious when the coefficient on the

lagged dependent variable is close to unity (as in the typical context for growth convergence) and

when the relative variance of the fixed effect is large.

       It would also be possible to adjust the OLS estimates to correct for bias. For estimation

with country fixed effects, the adjustment would be based on the time-series dimension, T.

However, the adjustments are sensitive to the behavior of X variables when these are included in

the model (below).


       B. Model with Fixed Effects and an X Variable

       Table A2 has the results for the model in equations (A2)-(A6), which adds an exogenous

X variable. The conditions σε=1 (for the time-series shock) and σu=1 (for the shock to the X

variable) are normalizations. The other assumptions are β (convergence rate) = 0.02, ση=0.1 (for

the fixed effect), ρ (persistence coefficient for the X process) = 0.98, and N (number of

countries) =100. Results are shown for α (coefficient of the X variable) equal to 0.05 or 0.25 and

T (time-series length) equal to 100 or 20.

       Results from OLS without country fixed effects, shown in the lower part of Table A2, are

straightforward. If the X variable is included in the regression (lines 9-12), so that omitted-

variables effects are minor, the OLS estimates of the convergence rate, β (and also for α, the

coefficient of the X variable) have small biases. These results follow because the Hurwicz bias

is again unimportant when fixed effects are excluded. Moreover, these findings apply for the


                                                 62
different values considered for α and T. However, if the X variable is excluded from the

regression (lines 13-16), the estimate 7 is seriously biased downward because of the omitted-

variable effect described before. The bottom line is that satisfactory implementation of OLS

without fixed effects depends on the inclusion of the X variable.

       The results for OLS with fixed effects are shown in the upper part of Table A2. The

conclusions with respect to 7 depend on the time-series length, T, and the coefficient α on the X

variable. For example, if T=100, the mean of 7 is 0.032 (line 1) when α=0.05, and the mean is

0.021 (line 2) when α=0.25. Hence, the bias is small with a 100-year sample when a lot of the

variation in the y variable reflects the observed X variable. However, if T=20, the mean of 7 is

0.103 (line 3) when α=0.05, and the mean is 0.029 (line 4) when α=0.25. That is, the Hurwicz

channel can lead to a strong upward bias when T=20.

       When the X variable is excluded, the mean of 7 is 0.023 (line 5) when α=0.05 and

T=100. That is, the bias can be small with a long time series if α is not too large. However, the

mean of 7 is 0.007 (line 6) when α=0.25. That is, the bias is substantially downward because of

the important omitted-variables effect with this higher value of α. When T=20, the bias is

upward for each value of α because of the Hurwicz effect. The mean of 7 is 0.106 (line 7) when

α=0.05 and 0.033 (line 8) when α=0.25.

       The results suggest circumstances when the regressions generate estimates of the

convergence rate, β, without large bias. The first is for OLS with country fixed effects when the

sample is large in the time domain. For example, when β=0.02, the fixed-effects model yields a

mean of 7 of 0.036 when T=140 (Table A1, line 5). For the model that adds an exogenous X

variable, the mean of 7 is 0.021 when T=100 and α=0.25 (Table A2, line 2). Even with the X

variable excluded, the mean of 7 is 0.023 when T=100 and α=0.05 (line 5). The second case is

                                                63
for OLS without country fixed effects in the X-model when the (exogenous) X variable is

included in the regressions. When β=0.02, this framework yields a mean for 7 between 0.016

and 0.020 (Table A2, lines 9-12). OLS without country fixed effects also does well in the fixed-

effects model when the variation in the fixed effects is small (Table A1, row 14).

       The results can be used to get reasonable bounds on the convergence rate, β, as carried

out in the text. The upper bound came from the estimate with country fixed effects without X

variables, based on the long-term data back to 1870. Because T is large, the upper bound may be

reasonably tight (as in Table A1, line 5, or Table A2, line 5). The lower bound came from the

estimate without country fixed effects using the shorter-term data since the 1960s with a rich

array of X variables (as in Table A2, lines 9-12).

Notes: β=1-γ is the convergence rate in equation (A1), T is the length of the time series, and ση
is the standard deviation of the country fixed effect. The Monte Carlo results in column 5 show
the mean and standard deviation of the estimate 7 from 100 iterations of the model in
equation (A1). The upper part refers to OLS estimation with country fixed effects (country
dummies). The lower part refers to OLS estimation without country fixed effects. All results
shown use σε=1 (for the time-series shock), N (number of countries) =100, and an observation
period of τ=1 year. Results with 50 iterations or N=20 are similar. Results with τ=5 are also
similar (see n. 29). For example, with fixed effects, the mean of 7 when β=0.10, T=100, ση=1,
and τ=5 is 0.125 (0.006). Without fixed effects, the mean of 7 for this case is 0.0047 (0.0008).
Column 4 shows the expected value of 7 from the formula in Nickell (1981, p. 1422); see n. 23.
This formula applies to OLS estimation with country fixed effects.

Notes: For the model in equations (A2)-(A6), β=1-γ is the convergence rate, α is the coefficient
on the X variable, ρ is the persistence coefficient for the X variable, and T is the length of the
time series. The Monte Carlo results in columns 5 and 6 show the mean and standard deviation
of the estimates 7 and @ from 100 iterations of the model. The upper part refers to OLS
estimation with country fixed effects (country dummies). The lower part refers to OLS
estimation without country fixed effects. All results normalize to have σε=1 (for the time-series
shock) and σu=1 (for the X shock). Other assumptions are ση=0.1 (for the fixed effect), ρ
(coefficient for the persistence of the X process) = 0.98, N (number of countries) = 100, and an
observation period of τ=1 year. Column 4 indicates whether the regressions include the X
variable.
