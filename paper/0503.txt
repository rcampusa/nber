                              ABSTRACT



     To say that the price of some good is inflexible over time has

little meaning if the "good" is changing over time. In this paper

we concentrate on delivery lags as being the only dimension other than

price that varies. We show how one can predict the relative importance of

price and delivery lag fluctuations as equilibrating mechanisms. The com-

plications of the theory as well as the surprising results underscore the

complexity of predicting price behavior when the characteristics of the

good are endogenous. The empirical results provide strong support for the

theory that delivery lags are an important influence on market behavior

and therefore that an understanding of their influence is crucial in pre-

dicting how markets will respond to supply and demand shocks.

                            I. Introduction


        The idea that prices especially in manufacturing are inflexible and

non—market clearing appears persistently in the economics literature (see

Canton 1979, Section II for a brief survey). Evidence often used to sup-

port the nonmarket clearing hypothesis has been the observation that large

quantity adjustments, either through inventory changes or delivery lag

changes, and not large price adjustments, characterize the response of many

markets to supply and demand changes. This paper builds on the ideas in

Carlton (1979) to develop an equilibrium model that is capable of explaining

how markets will respond to changes in supply and demand.

        The basic idea of the paper is a simple one. Consumers care about

not only price but also quality attributes of a good. In response to supply

and demand shocks, adjustment in quality of the good may be more important

than adjustment in price. To say that price appears inflexible over time

for some good has little meaning if the "good" is changing over time. In

this paper we concentrate on delivery lags as being the only dimension of

the good other than price that varies. This is of course a simplification

but delivery lag is often the easiest (least costly) quality attribute to

adjust and it is an attribute for which aggregate data are available. We

extend the theory developed by Rosen (1974) and Zarnowitz(l962)1to show how

one can predict for a market the relative importance of price and delivery

lag fluctuations as equilibrating mechanisms.

       The complications of the theory as well as the surprising results

emerging from the theory underscore the complexity involved in pre-

dicting price behavior when the characteristics of the "good" may be en—
                                      2

dogenous.    Simple supply equal demand models not only may be too simple,

they might provide the wrong intuition.

         Census data are used to illustrate the theory. Unfortunately, only

aggregate census data are available to test the theory, and we are forced

to make simplifying assumptions in order to empirically test the theory.

The empirical results are consistent with the theory that delivery lags do

indeed affect behavior and therefore that an understanding of their in-

fluence is crucial in predicting how markets will equilibrate. Data

more disaggregate than census data are needed before the specific implica-

tions of the theory can be adequately tested.


                                II. Theory

          Let all firms be alike, and let all consumers be alike. Firms   take
orders for a homogeneous good on day 1 and decide how quickly to produce

and deliver the good to the buyers.             To keep the exposition simple

and In view of the data limitations to be discussed later, we assume that

all buyers who order on day 1 pay the same price p and obtain delivery on

the same day k. (An obvious extension of the theory is to have price depend

on delivery lag and allow different delivery lags for buyers.) Consumers

are assumed not to be able to forecast their demand and order sufficiently

far in advance to avoid any delay between the time they want the good and

 the time they receive the good. Consumers have an indirect utility

 function V(p, k, y) which depends not only on p and k but also on income y

and other prices which for notational simplicity we omit from the list of

 arguments in V. We further assume that the marginal utility of income,

V, is constant and equal to 1. The indirect utility function

determines those (p, k) combinations that leave the consumer

 indifferent. Clearly, as p is raised, k must fall along any indifference

 curve, and utility falls as p or k increases. However, there is no reason
 to   suppose that the amount purchased along an indifference curve in (p, k)
                                   3

space is constant.2 Indeed, one way for a buyer to take advantage of a

lower price and longer delivery time is to purchase more of the "good."

        It is not possible a priori to characterize the shape of the in-

difference curve in (p, k) space, though it is possible to derive the con-

ditions (see Appendix A) under which the indifference curves are concave

and to relate the conditions to whether the quantity demanded rises or

falls along an indifference curve as p rises (k falls). The consumer chooses

that available (p, k) combination that yields highest utility.

        Firms have a production technology whose costs depends upon how

quickly the good is produced as well as how much of the good is produced.

So, for example, it is cheaper to produce 1 unit in 1 week than in 1 minute.

The firm has two margins to concern itself with. First, holding delivery

time constant, how much should be produced? Second, what delivery time

should be chosen? Firms have a restricted profit function n(p, k) from

which (p, k) combinations yielding constant profit can be constructed.

Clearly, profits increase the higher is p, and the larger is k. In general,

along any iso—profit curve the quantity supplied by the firm will vary.3

        An equilibrium (p, k) combination in this market requires a) that the

marginal rate of substitution for consumers between p and k equal the

marginal rate of technological transformation for suppliers, and b) that the

total amount demanded equal the total amount supplied. Condition a) requires

that the equilibrium be a point of tangency between the indifference and iso—

profit curves. This tangency is illustrated as point A in Figure 2 for con-

cave indifference curves and convex iso—profit curves. The condition b)

determines which of the many possible tangencles between indifference and

iso—profit curves is equilibrium. As demand increases relative to supply,

equilibrium moves to a tangency point between a higher iso—profit curve and

an indifference curve of lower utility. We want to investigate the
                                       4

equilibrium   with the number of consumers and firms            fixed.    We then want

 to investigate the equilibrium short run response when the number of

buyers relative to the number of sellers randomly fluctuates. Without

 loss of generality we will assume that the number of competitive firms

 is one, and the number of consumers is N.4

The condition that supply equals demand can be written as

                                   p       p


where we have used Roy's identity that quantity demanded equals —V/V, the

fact that Vy is assumed equal to 1, and Hotelling's Lemma that the quantity

supplied equals it. Equation (1) and (3) are two equations in two unknowns,

p and k. By dividing (3) by (1), it is possible to rewrite the equilibrium

conditions as (3) and


(4)                           N(_Vk) =


        We now want to see how the equilibrium price, p, and delivery lag, k,

will be altered if the number of demanders relative to the number of sellers,

N, suddenly increases. Such a change corresponds to an unpredictable short—

run increase in demand. To determine the percent fluctuations in p and k in

response to percent changes in N, we perform comparative statics on (3) and

(4) to obtain,

Equation (5) completely characterizes the equilibrium fluctuations in p and k

that occur in response to short run shifts in supply and demand. We now wish

to express the quantities in (5) in terms of elasticities of supply and de—
    5
inand. Notice that since all firms are idential and all individuals are

identical elasticities of market demand and supply curves will be the same

s those of individual consumers and firms.

       We adopt the following notation:

       n       price elasticity of demand

           =   delivery   lag elasticity of demand

       n5 =    price   elasticity of supply

       n = delivery
                                                                                            -)
                          lag elasticity of supply

           = demand elasticity of marginal disutility of delivery lag (
                                                                                            ln ir
           = supply elasticity of marginal profit gain of delivery lag. (

          If delivery lag k were set arbitrarily then (3) above would determine

equilibrium and only the second row of (6) would represent the comparative

statics. In that situation, we would obtain the usual result that price

fluctuations are smaller the larger is In , the absolute value of the price
elasticity of demand.                    p

        Equation (12) is the ratio of the percentage fluctuations in price
  those in
to/delivery lag. To see how (12) depends on the relevant underlying elas-

ticities, we need to sign A, B and D.            It is not possible a priori to sign

A, B and D without any further assimiptions. We make the following assump-

tion:


Assumption 1. In response to an increase in demand,N, (decrease in supply)

the equilibrium price, p, and delivery lag, k, both increase.

         In a model where the good has two attributes p and k it is possible

that in response to demand increases, one attribute of the good could in-

crease while the other decrease.         However, in general, price and delivery

delays are positively correlated (Zarnowitz 1973, p. 315) making Assumption 1

quite a reasonable one. Assumption 1 together with (10) and(ll) implies that

A, B, and D are all of the same sign. The following lemma establishes that

the sign of A, B and D is positive.

        If A and B are of the same sign (Assumption 1), then they must

both be positive, which from (10) and (11) and Assumption 1, implies that

D is positive.                                                      Q.E.D.6

        Equation (l0)—(12) relate the equilibrium price and delivery lag

fluctuations to various elasticities of supply and demand. We now investi-

gate how the underlying elasticities influence the equilibrium fluctuations
             7/              7
in price and delivery lag.       First, observe that in the expression



            K                       S                         D > 0.
for D, all quantities except 0k0k are signed. ByLemma2 ,

If D is to be positive for all possible equilibrium values of K'            n,
across all industries, then 0k0k must be positive. If Ok_@ is positive,then from

            > 0. Moreover, it follows from (8) and (9) that            =   0, and
(10)


       < 0, therefore we have shown
Inp

Proposition 1     As the demand curve (or supply curve) becomes more price

elastic and under Assumption 1 and the further implication of Assumption 1

that Ok_O > 0, the equilibrium fluctuations in p and k in response         to
                                            V         dlnp and              dink

        It is interesting to note that for any particular industry,        D could

be positive, yet OkO could be negative. In such a case, the equilibrium

price fluctuations increase as demand becomes more price elastic.

         As the deliveiy lag elasticity of.demand increases, we see that

D unambiguously increases, but both A and B also increase. It is possible

to prove using the assumptions above that
H__                                11
Proposition 2 : As the delivery lag elasticity of demand becomes a larger

negative number, and under the same assumptions as Proposition 1, the

equilibrium price fluctuation falls [i.e.,              <   0] and the equi-

librium delivery lag fl:ctuation        falls [i.e.,
                                                             j"   <   0].

Proof: See Appendix B.

        Propositions 1 and 2 accord well with intuition gained from markets

where quality is exogenous and price alone clears the market. In those

jiarkets too, as demand or supply becomes more price elastic, the equilibrium

fluctuations in price in response to supply and demand shifts diminishes.

Intuition (mine at least) would also suggest that the relative price fluc-

tuations versus relative delivery lag fluctuations would depend negatively

on the absolute value of price elasticity of demand and positively on the

absolute value of the delivery lag elasticity of demand. The reasoning

behind this intuition is straightforward. If the demand curve is very price

elastic, holding delivery time fixed, and very delivery lag inelastic, hold-

ing price fixed, one would expect price not to change much but delivery lag

to change a lot in response to shifts in supply and demand. In fact, this

intuition is incorrect, as shown in Proposition 3 below.

        Before proving Pioposition 3, it will be useful to explain why the

intuition,just discussed, is incorrect. The basic reason is that elasticities

of supply and demand do not determine the trade—offs consumers and firms

are willing to make between price and delivery lag, and these trade—offs play

an important role in determining equilibrium.
                                  12




The    distinguishing        feature of markets with endogenous quality

attributes is that the relative p—k fluctuations are determined not only

by price and delivery lag elasticities of supply and demand, but by the

relative shapes of indifference curves and iso—profit curves in (p, k)

space. The trade—off s that consumers and producers are willing to make

between p and k are not in one to one correspondence with demand and supply

elasticities. For example, let V(p, k) =   k1   —   in   p, then the demand curve

for a good of delivery lag k is + and is independent of k. Knowledge of

a demand curve is not sufficient to determine the shape of indifference

curves which express    the trade off s consumers are willing to make between

p and k. The relative equilibrium variation of p and k to demand and supply

shocks will depend on the shapes of the indifference and iso—profit curves.

Surprisingly, the elasticities interact with the relative shapes of the in-

difference and iso—profit curves in such a way as to contradict one's

     (my) simple intuition about the determinants of the ratio of relative price

     and relative delivery lag changes.


     Proposition 3. The ratio of relative price to relative delivery lag fluc-

     tuation depends positively on the absolute value of price elasticity and nega-

     tively on the absolute value of delivery lag demand elasticities.9

             There is no reason in FigurJ/ y2the curves must have the par-

ticular shapes drawn. All that is required is that consumers are maximizing

utility and producers profits. As demand increases it seems reasonable to

expect that in comparing the new equilibrium to the old one, that the p—k

     trade off is steeper in the new equilibrium. The more that is produced,

     the more valuable is it to delay delivery. One can see immediately then

     (as Zarnowitz 1973 also pointed out earlier) that whether the indifference

     curves are concave or convex will have a lot to do with relative price versus

     delivery lag fluctuations. The diagrams below suggest how price fluctuations

     are likely to be less important relative to delivery lag fluctuations when

     the indifference curve is concave (see Appendix A for a derivation of the

     conditions guaranteeing concave in9ljfference curves).

                               III. Empirical Testing

              The theory just presented illustrated how important it is to take de-

     livery lags into account when delivery lags influence either consumer welfare

     or firm profits. Ideally, one would like to have sufficiently detailed data

     to enable estimation of all the parameters in (6). Such an effort would re-

     quire data at each point in time on the price that would be charged for
                                   16

                                              data are unavailable. All that are
different delivery lags. Unfortunately such

available are census data from which aggregate quantities and average
delivery lags can be calculated. It is this data that we use. (Had the

more refined data been available, the theory would have had to be modified

to allow for different consumers consuming at different delivery lags.) To

establish the point that delivery lags matter in the determination of equi-

librium it suffices to show that either the structural supply or demand

equations have non—zero delivery lag elasticities. I present results be-

low only for structural demand equations.   (I chose to estimate demand and

not supply curves because it is much easier to find good instruments f or the

demand curves.) After presenting the estimates, I briefly discuss whether

any of the implications of the previous section, especially those of Propo-

sitions 1—3, seem to be consistent with the data.


111.1. Data Description

   Data were taken from census and BLS sources. Data are usually available

monthly and non—seasonally adjusted. The price series, kindly provided me by

John Geweke, are quarterly and were constructed by Al-Samarrie, Kraft, and

Roberts (1977), from BLS sources in an effort to regroup BLS data aloiig CensUs

 SIC code definitions. This quarterly price

 monthly series by assuming that prices during each quarter are unchanged.

 The delivery lag variable was constructed as follows. At any given time,

 there is a stock of unfilled orders and new orders. By asking how long would

 it have taken for the first new order to be filled12 (using data on subsequent

 shipment rates) we can calculate a delivery lag, kl. By asking how long it

 would have taken to fill the last new order (using data on subsequent shipment

 rates) we can calculate a delivery lag, k2. We used both kl and k2 in the

 estimation to make sure that the results were not sensitive to the definition

 of delivery lag.
                                          17


           We investigated all those 2 digit SIC code industries (SIC 331, 34,

 35, 36) for which delivery lags seemed important and two industries (SIC 22
                                                                      The time

 period is 1958—1972. Table 1 illustrates the average level of delivery lags,

 prices, and standard deviations in delivery lags and prices for each industry

 studied. The second and fifth columns of Table 1 convert the means of logs

 into unlogged values. If lnp and ink are normally distributed then the un—

 logged values in the second and fifth columns can be interpreted as medians.

           Table 1 shows that the industries vary considerably in the varia-

 bility and level of delivery lag and price. For example, SIC 26 has a

 delivery delay of only .46 months, while SIC 36 typically has a delivery

 delay of 3.9 months. The measure of variability of delivery goes from a

 low of .08 for SIC 26 to a high of .25 for SIC 331 and SIC 35. However,

 for all the industries the fluctuations in delivery lags exceeds the fluctua-

 tions in price.

111.2. Empirical Results

        The demand curve for each industry is estimated by two stage least

squares with a correction for serial correlation (i.e., Fair's method) for

the period 1958—1972. The dependent variable is quantity demanded,

measured as net new orders divided by price. Price and delivery delay are

regarded as endogenous in accordance with the theory just presented. (See

the Steuer, Ball and Eaton (1966) study of machine tools for results that

ignore the simultaneity of price and delivery delay.) We postulate that

the quantity demanded depends negatively on real price13 and delivery lag

and positively on the exogenous demand indicator, the FRB real index of
                            14                                                15
manufacturing production.        We also include a measure of the current stock

of output to capture the fact that a large stock of output will exert a nega-

tive influence on the amount of net new orders since the demand for the good

can be satisfied by existing goods. Instrumental variables included wages,

interest rates, BLS cost indices, and in industry cost indexcompiled by

Al—Samarrie, Kraft and Roberts (1977). All variables except time are in logs.

Table 2 lists the endogenous, exogenous and instrumental variables used. It

is worth pointing out that the estimation procedure will yield consistent

results even if the price and delivery lag variables are measured with error.

presents estimates of structural demand equations for two different

equation specifications. As discussed earlier, each equation was

estimated with two different definitions of delivery lags. Except where

indicated, the main qualitative results are fairly insensitive to choice

of delivery lag definition and so only equations with delivery lag kl are

reported.

            In general, the results of the estimation appear quite good.

The magnitudes and signs of most of the coefficients seem plausible and

most of the coefficients are highly statistically significant.       The

estimated results are least good for those industries with the shortest

delivery lags (SIC 22 and 26) and best for those industries with the

longest delivery lags (SIC 34, 35 and 36). None of the coefficients in

Table 3 with the incorrect signs are statistically significant at the

5% level. The income elasticity ranges between 1 id 2, with the excep-

elasticity is usually above 1, while the delivery lag elasticity is always

below' 1. The delivery lag elasticity is, with one exception (SIC 22),
                                        at the 5% level
always negative and statistically significant/for the expanded equation

specification. The results of Table 3 provide strong support for the view

that delivery lags in addition to price are an important influence on market

behavior.
        Given that delivery lag elasticities are important in influencing

market behavior, can we see if any of the implications of the analysis of

Section II are borne out? With only six industries that differ greatly

amongst each other, it is very hard to think of being able to reliably

test the implications of the Propositions of the previous section.


       One straightforward implication of the previous section is that the fluc-
tuations in p and k will depend on the variability of demand. From the

last two columns in Table 317 we see that SIC 331 has the largest varia-

bility of demand and SIC 26 the lowest. Table 1 confirms that by any

reasonable criteria the combined price and delivery lag movement in SIC 331 is

one o the largest of all the other industries while the combined movement

for SIC 26 is one of the smallest.

        Proposition 3 related R, the ratio of price variability to de-

livery lag variability,              to the price and delivery lag elas-

ticities. Is there any evidence of this pattern as we compare the results

of Tables land 3 across industries? (It is wise to reemphasize the caveat

that with only six industries with widely varying characteristics, such an

across—industry comparison is not the correct way to test Proposition 3 .)

Using disaggregate data to estimate the parameters of (6) would be the correct
                                23

way.)   The answer is that it is hard to tell, but probably no. If one

computes the value of R and compares it to the ratio of price to delivery

lag elasticities, then it appears that there is a negative and not a

positive correlation as predicted by Proposition 3. However, proper tests

of Proposition 3 will have to await the use of more disaggregate data.


                               V. Summary

        This paper has investigated how markets will reach equilibrium when

both price and quality of the good are endogenous. It predicts by how much

delivery lags and price will change in response to short run supply and de—

inand shocks. The complications of the theory as well as some surprising

results flowing from the theory illustrate how some intuitions based on

simple supply equal demand models can be misleading in trying to understand

price behavior. Understanding price fluctuations is a very complicated

task. The empirical testing of the theory strongly supported the view that

delivery lags do play an important role in influencing market demand and

therefore must be taken into account when one tries to understand how markets

will respond to short run supply or demand fluctuations. The data was not

sufficiently rich to allow adequate testing of some specific implications of

the theory, though very crude across—industry comparisons failed to reveal sup-


porting evidence for some of these specific implications. Given the im-

portance of delivery lags in a theory attempting to explain price movements

and given the widespread use of delivery lags in U.S. industry and their im-

portant empirical influence on demand further development and testing of the

theory with better data definitely seem warranted.

indifference and one isoprofit curve, B = 0.         It then follows from (11)

that under Zarnowitz's assumptions to a first approximation, all equilibra-

tion takes place through p.

       7Because it is possible to change V and it so as to change independently

the elasticities, it makes sense to see how the comparative statics of the

system changes as a function of these elasticities. In the discussion below,

we present proofs only for demand elasticities. Proofs for supply elas-

ticities are straightforward adaptations of those proofs.


       8If we drop the assumption that Ok_0 >       0,     then it is still true

                  dink <                                          dlnp <   0.

       9The reader may wonder why the symmetry present in (3) and (4)

doesn't guarantee symmetry in Proposition 4. The reason is that n and

   are not symmetric expressions, n and 0k are.

       '°Again, we note that if we dropped the assumption that Ok_O >           0,
 then it would be possible that the ratio of relative price to relative

 delivery lag variability increases as Ink1 increases.

 (—N V) could be independent of k, yet k could still matter (i.e.,

 and Vk       0) in the determination of equilibrium.



       12Value of shipments, new orders and unfilled orders are converted

into number of units by dividing by price.


       13Note that with constant after tax real rates and constant depre-

ciation, an equation with in p will produce the same elasticity estimates

as one with in (user cost).

      14Attempts to include variables measuring the deviations between

current values and expected values for price and delivery lags were un-

successful.


      '5The capital stock was constructed using the depreciation rate of

.1428, the figure reported in Hall and Jorgenson (1967). The initial

value of the capital stock was calculated by assuming that 1957 was a

year in which the capital stock was in equilibrium. SIC 22 was handled

by a different method because of the obviously more rapid depreciation of

non—durable goods. There we used the amount shipped during the past year

as a measure of the size of the existing capital stock.

      '6The standard errors are conditional on the estimated p.
