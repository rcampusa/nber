                                           ABSTRACT

We develop a theory of rational self-medication. The idea is that forward-looking individuals,
lacking access to better treatment options, attempt to manage the symptoms of mental and
physical pain outside of formal medical care. They use substances that relieve symptoms in the
short run but that may be harmful in the long run. For example, heavy drinking could alleviate
current symptoms of depression but could also exacerbate future depression or lead to
alcoholism. Rational self-medication suggests that, when presented with a safer, more effective
treatment, individuals will substitute towards it. To investigate, we use forty years of longitudinal
data from the Framingham Heart Study and leverage the exogenous introduction of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We demonstrate an economically meaningful reduction in
heavy alcohol consumption for men when SSRIs became available. Additionally, we show that
addiction to alcohol inhibits substitution. Our results suggest a role for rational self-medication in
understanding the origin of substance abuse. Furthermore, our work suggests that punitive
policies targeting substance abuse may backfire, leading to substitution towards even more
harmful substances to self-medicate. In contrast, policies promoting medical innovation that
provide safer treatment options could obviate the need to self-medicate with dangerous or
addictive substances.

1         Introduction
Beginning with Grossman (1972), economists have envisioned health as a form of human capital
that increases survival rates, raises productivity, and improves the quality of life. Accordingly,
behaviors that can improve health, such as exercise, healthy eating, abstaining from risky behavior,
or medication usage, can be viewed as costly investments in human capital. Rational individuals
invest in their health until the long-term benefits of doing so cease to outweigh the upfront costs.
This basic model has been expanded upon to incorporate the realities of many health-related
decisions. Examples include uncertainty and learning about how well a drug will work (Crawford &
Shum, 2005), side effects that discourage use of effective medications (Papageorge, 2016), addiction
that encourages use of harmful substances (Darden, 2017), and the interaction between better
pharmaceuticals and other health behaviors, (Kaestner et al., 2014), among others.
        This framework overlooks the idea that many individuals, lacking access to good medication,
may take matters into their own hands, turning to substances that are potentially harmful in the
long-run (e.g., alcohol or opioids) in an effort to manage short-run symptoms of illnesses, such
as chronic pain or depression.1 Seen this way, many individuals who use harmful or addictive
substances are rationally choosing to self-medicate; that is, they optimally make use of available
technologies to alleviate symptoms, albeit at the risk of future poor health, addiction, and other
negative consequences. Understanding how, and under what circumstances, people self-medicate
is important because self-medication is socially costly, especially if it leads to addiction. However,
treating use of dangerous substances as an error in judgment or an act of desperation — rather
than as a rational but risky attempt to mitigate health problems using prevailing technology —
can lead to the wrong policy conclusions. For example, viewing problem drinking as an error
suggests policies to curb drinking. Viewing it as rational self-medication would suggest that such
policies could backfire if people substitute to substances that are even more harmful. A better
policy response would be to promote treatment innovations that obviate the need to self-medicate
and thus induce rational actors to substitute towards less harmful substances.
        In this paper we test the rational self-medication hypothesis. In particular, we ask whether the
emergence of effective medication obviates the need to self-medicate with riskier substances. We
leverage a technological advancement — the 1988 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) — as an exogenous change in the choice set for
the management of depression. Rational self-medication predicts that following the introduction
of new medications, the use of riskier treatment alternatives should decline. In the case we study,
    1
     (Khantzian, 1985) introduces the concept of self-medication, in which an individual manages her ailment
outside of formal prescription medicine or therapy.

if heavy drinking is in part a form of self-medication, we predict that heavy alcohol consumption
should fall following the introduction of SSRIs.2 If we are unable to detect such substitution
patterns as better medications emerge, heavy drinking is less likely to be a form of self-medication.
       Depression is an ideal context to study self medication for several reasons. First, it is prevalent.
In the United States, Major Depressive Disorder (which we simply refer to as depression unless
the meaning is unclear) affects 8.1% of individuals over the age of 18. Second, prevalence is
heterogeneous across socio-economic groups. Depression is about four times more likely for poor
versus non-poor individuals.3 This is especially concerning in the context of self-medication if
low-income individuals have less access to medical care, safer medications or treatment options,
such as therapy. Moreover, low-income individuals may face other challenges that encourage use
of addictive substances, compounding the risks of self-medication. Third, depression affects many
facets of life, including human capital accumulation, productivity, family structure, risky behaviors,
and employment, along with other physical health outcomes, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease,
and diabetes. Therefore, it is little surprise that individuals would engage in costly attempts to
alleviate their symptoms. Fourth, there is massive stigma surrounding mental health treatment,
which might make self-treatment (e.g., heavy drinking) a more attractive option. Finally, and key
to our empirical work, there are large changes in treatment options over time, in particular the
emergence of SSRIs, which replaced earlier drugs that, while effective, had massively adverse side
effects that precluded widespread use.
       To begin our analysis of self-medication we formalize the concept with a simple two-period
model in which an agent makes health investment decisions, jointly choosing alcohol and an-
tidepressant medications to manage her mental health. Poor mental health generates symptoms
which reduce utility, and investments in mental health management have different contempora-
neous (symptom relief) and inter-temporal (mental health stock) effects. Our framework thus
emphasizes the importance of dynamics in the production of mental health. If antidepressant
consumption causes individuals to substitute away from heavy alcohol, then a potential chan-
nel through which antidepressants improve both overall and mental health may lie in behavioral
changes. The model reveals that SSRIs could lead to a reduction in alcohol consumption purely
by a convex symptom cost specification in the utility function. Furthermore, our model suggests
that different bundles of investment may be appropriate depending on the stock of mental health.4
   2
     In Section 2, we document a strong correlation between depression and alcohol consumption using NHANES
data, and we review the significant literature on alcohol self-medication. For example, Bacolod et al. (2017) study
minimum drinking age laws and show that the largest increase in drinking at age 21 (for those in the military)
comes from the most depressed.
   3
     For those below 100% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), the rate was 15.8% between 2013 and 2016, while the
rate was only 3.5% for those at or above 400% of the FPL (Brody et al., 2018).

     Our model formalizes the argument that the type of substance abuse depends on the type and severity of mental

    To investigate self-medication empirically, we use data from the Framingham Heart Study
Offspring Cohort. The data set includes longitudinal information on alcohol, tobacco, and antide-
pressant consumption, as well as depression measures for roughly 5,000 individuals over a forty-year
period. Exploiting the arrival of SSRIs, we estimate a series of differences-in-differences models to
provide strong prima facie evidence of substitution away from alcohol and towards antidepressants
once they come available. Estimates suggest that taking an antidepressant is associated with a
statistically significant 3.9 percentage point (12.5%) increase in abstinence from alcohol. Effects
are stronger for men and potentially concentrated among individuals with moderate depression.
The latter finding underscores the self-medication hypothesis since it suggests that, until better
options emerge, alcohol is an effective way to combat depression.5
    Simple regression estimates ignore potentially important dynamics, including the stock of addic-
tion, which could affect how costly it is to switch from alcohol to SSRIs. Indeed, the self-medication
hypothesis explicitly envisions possible addiction as a calculated risk. To address the dynamics
inherent to self-medication, we estimate a system of dynamic equations which approximates a
more general structural model. Specifically, we estimate dynamic equations for alcohol, tobacco,
and antidepressants jointly, along with depression, attrition, and mortality equations, to capture
heterogeneity in uptake of antidepressants and to control for selective exit from the study.6
    Incorporating dynamics both corroborates initial estimates and and allows us to examine coun-
terfactual policies. First, following the introduction of SSRI pharmaceuticals, we examine a coun-
terfactual scenario in which we impose antidepressants on the entire sample relative to our baseline
simulation. Heavy drinking declines by 3.4 percentage points, primarily driven by men. Moreover,
while we show that the reduction in heavy drinking is largest in those simulated to be moderately
depressed, we find no change in heavy alcohol consumption, in any period, for those simulated to
be in the highest tercile of depression. The lack of a decrease in heavy alcohol consumption for
health ailment(Khantzian, 1985).
    5
      In interpreting empirical results, we note that substitution away from alcohol resulting from the emergence
of new medications may not reflect use of alcohol as self-medication per se, but could instead reflect doctors’
recommendations that the two not be used together. If so, substitution away from alcohol amounts to giving up an
enjoyable good in order to take medication that relieves symptoms of physical or mental health problems. In the
case of depression, however, this alternative interpretation is less clearly distinct from self-medication. Symptoms
of depression include sadness and so engaging in behaviors that one enjoys, such as alcohol, is a (risky) way to
alleviate sadness. This is another reason why depression is a good context to study self-medication. It is also worth
noting that use of both SSRIs and alcohol is widespread, and, for depressed individuals with a strong preference
for alcohol, SSRIs may have increased alcohol consumption as their interaction is significantly less risky than with
previous generation antidepressants.
    6
      We allow for correlation in the permanent component of the error structure across equations to capture unob-
served heterogeneity in the joint determination of these behaviors and outcomes (Heckman & Singer, 1984; Mroz,
1999). The empirical framework is similar to the dynamic seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model in Darden
et al. (2018), who use FHS data to study the effect of cigarette smoking on expected longevity.

the most depressed individuals could be a result of significant addiction to alcohol.
      To investigate the role of addiction, our second simulation sets lagged alcohol consumption to
zero in the contemporaneous alcohol demand equation, regardless of simulated behavior in the
previous period. Overall, regardless of gender or mental health, heavy alcohol consumption drops
enormously. Antidepressant usage (which is chosen endogenously in this simulation) increases
by 5.5 percentage points by the final exam of FHS, and the magnitude of this substitution is
increasing in depression severity. We interpret these results to suggest that alcohol addiction may
significantly hinder substitution away from alcohol. Finally, we demonstrate that the simulated
reduction in heavy drinking is equivalent to a roughly 20% increase in alcohol prices. Together,
our results exploiting a large medical innovation provide compelling evidence of self-medication.
When introduced to a new and better medical technology, individuals who self-medicate substitute
towards it.
      Our work relates to a large medical literature on self-medication. This literature has generally
reported cross-sectional correlations, for example, between alcohol consumption and depression.
Bolton et al. (2009) recognizes that the direction of causality between alcohol abuse and mental
health problems is unclear. Our model of rational self-medication is designed to incorporate both
directions since alcohol use can be a response to depression to alleviate symptoms, but can also
exacerbate them in the long run and, moreover, can lead to addiction which limits substitution
when better medications emerge. Our findings are also in line with recent work showing substitu-
tion towards marijuana when it is legalized. Both Dinardo (2001) and Crost (2012) use minimum
drinking age regulations to show clear substitution patterns between alcohol and marijuana. More
directly related to us, Powell et al. (2018) show that medical marijuana laws, and in particular
the number of marijuana dispensaries, is associated with fewer opioid overdoses.7 The underly-
ing idea is that rational individuals substitute towards safer options when they emerge or, in the
case of marijuana, become legal. More broadly, our paper also relates to a growing economic
literature on how individuals respond to medical technological advances (Kaestner et al., 2014;
Papageorge, 2016). This work emphasizes the importance of behavior changes, including uptake
and substitution patterns, when evaluating the overall impacts of new medical technologies.
      This paper also contributes to our understanding of addiction. In the seminal paper on rational
addiction, Becker & Murphy (1988) posit that under addiction, a person has a low level of utility
while addicted, but a high marginal utility of usage of addictive substances, which incentivizes
continued use. While the model explains why forward-looking and addicted individuals continue
  7
    As another example, Anton et al. (2006) present results from the randomized-controlled trial COMBINE,
the largest random intervention study of alcoholics, and show that the combination of medical management and
Naltrexone significantly reduced the probability of relapse.

to use an addictive substance, it is silent on why they would ever become addicted in the first
place. Our paper suggests one possible reason. Initial usage of an addictive substance need not
be an error in judgement or due to lack of perfect foresight or a large exogenous shock. An
individual in pain may assess the probability of future addiction and rationally medicate her pain
with available technology, fully aware that doing so can lead to a Becker-style addictive spiral with
some probability.
      Finally, providing evidence of rational self-medication has implications for understanding the
dramatic increase in mortality rates of white non-Hispanic men since 1998, the so-called “deaths of
despair” documented in Case & Deaton (2015). Those authors show a relative increase in deaths
due to drug overdoses, alcohol-related liver disease, and suicide. One common explanation is that
progressive birth cohorts of those with a high school education or less enter labor markets facing
increasingly low returns to their skill. This negatively affects other lifecycle outcomes, such as
health, marriage, and future labor market prospects (Case & Deaton, 2017; Ruhm, 2018). Our
theory of rational self-medication is consistent with this explanation, but goes further by stepping
back to investigate self-medication as a plausible origin of addiction. In the context of depression,
poor labor market conditions at labor market entry may induce alcohol consumption, and the
cumulative exposure to alcohol between the ages of 20 to 45 may leave individuals addicted, that
is, to experience low utility in levels coupled with high marginal utility for alcohol, consistent
with addiction as conceived in Becker & Murphy (1988). However, whereas “despair” technically
suggests a lack of hope, self-medication suggests the opposite: heavy alcohol use or addiction may
reflect an earlier, rational and hopeful attempt to medicate away pain.8 This viewpoint suggests a
new look at policy, especially with respect to how the judicial system considers addiction, but also
with respect to innovation. If our theory accurately characterizes behavior, the appropriate policy
response is to stop punishing people who use risky substances to self-medicate and instead work
to develop treatments for chronic pain, both mental and physical, that are less addictive or more
effective so that people can rationally substitute away from harmful self-medicating behavior.
      This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide background on depression and de-
pression treatment, as well as the literature on self-medication. In Section 3, we discuss a simple,
two-period theoretical model of rational self-medication. In Section 4, we present our main data,
the Framingham Heart Study, and we document empirical evidence of a plausibly causal relation-
ship between antidepressants and alcohol consumption. Section 5 presents our dynamic model, as
well as parameter estimates, model fit, and simulation results. Section 6 discusses our results and

2         Background on Depression, SSRIs and Self-Medication
Depression is a chronic mental health condition. While highly treatable, it is the leading cause of
disability globally9 . Depression produces symptoms that include feelings of sadness, pessimism,
guilt, anxiety, and decreased energy, loss of interest in daily activities, and indecisiveness. Clinical
diagnosis of major depressive disorder includes near daily symptoms plus some functional im-
pairment with respect to family and peer relationships, school/work performance, and stress and
anxiety level (EA et al., 2009).10 In the United States, in any given two-week period between 2013
and 2016, 8.1% of Americans suffered from depression, ranging from 5.5% for men to 10.4% for
women. There exists a strong gradient between depression and income: 19.8% of women earning
less that 100% of the Federal poverty line (FPL) exhibit depressive symptoms compared to only
4.8% of women at or above 400% of the FPL (Brody et al., 2018).
        Unsurprisingly, depression is associated with a wide variety of mental and physical ailments,
including sleep problems, irritability, persistent physical pain, and risk of suicide (U.S. HHS, 2015).
Beck et al. (2011) show that depression is associated with significantly lower fundamental economic
building blocks such as workforce productivity, which they measure with the Work Productivity and
Activity Impairment questionnaire, and Berndt et al. (1998) demonstrate that depressed workers
have lower levels of perceived at-work productivity and performance. Furthermore, Kessler (2012)
shows that MDD is associated with low educational attainment, teen pregnancy, martial disruption,
unemployment, functional status, early mortality, and suicide.
        Antidepressants have existed since the initial Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) devel-
oped in the in 1950s. Most function in some form or another in preventing or slowing the re-uptake
of brain chemicals acting as neurotransmitters (such as Serotonin) without which depression is more
likely. MAOI antidepressants were effective at relieving symptoms of depression, but side effects
of MAOIs include risk of stroke, cardiovascular ailments,and sexual dysfunction, among others.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which were developed in the 1960s, marked an improvement
over the MAOIs. One possible reason is that they more precisely prevented uptake of only certain
chemicals. Side effects associated with TCA antidepressants can still be severe. Reflecting the side
effects, as well as public stigma associated with antidepressants, only 2-3% of Americans used an

    In the middle 20th century, anxiety was the leading mental illness in the United States. Horwitz (2010) describes
how, through a series of reclassifications, as well as the introduction of SSRIs, anxiety has given way to a focus and
prevalence of depression.

anti-depressant through the middle 1980s.11
       Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) were approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration in 1988, and, as the name suggests, effectively inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, making
more serotonin available in the brain without affecting the levels of other neurotransmitters. SS-
RIs significantly altered the perception of antidepressants, reducing stigma, and expanding the set
of individuals for whom an antidepressant is considered safe (i.e., the elderly). Rates of antide-
pressants have increased dramatically since 1988 — up to 12.7% of Americans were prescribed an
antidepressant between 2011 and 2014, and of those taking an antidepressant, 25.3% have been
taking an antidepressant for more than 10 years (Brody et al., 2018). Researchers now use SSRI
prescriptions to gauge rates of depression, mental health, and happiness. For example, Blanch-
flower & Oswald (2016) study the well-known u-shaped well-being curve with respect to age and
show a similar pattern between antidepressants and age. Despite a significant literature that re-
lates SSRIs to teen suicide, Ludwig et al. (2009) shows that SSRIs actually reduces suicides across
25 countries after controlling for the intuitive selection of depressed individuals into antidepressant
use.
       Khantzian (1985) set forth the hypothesis that self-medication leads to addiction. Furthermore,
he introduced the idea that the kind of substance used to self-medicate is not random, but depends
on the type of illness. Depressed individuals have a clear incentive to manage and maintain mental
health, and these endogenous investments into the mental health production function may have
important implications for a variety of outcomes, including labor market productivity and long-
term health. For example, Figures 1a.-1d. present National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) data on the use of antidepressants and heavy alcohol consumption for men
and women by the tertile of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression score between
2007 and 2013. Not surprisingly, for both men and women, more severely depressed individuals
are persistently and significantly more likely to engage in each behavior. The medical and public
health literature document this cross-sectional correlation between each behavior and depression.12
       The voluminous empirical literature on self-medication predominantly documents similar cross-
sectional correlations to those in Figures 1a.-1d. For example, Harris & Edlund (2005) look at
the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and find that heavy alcohol use is associated with
a lack of mental health services in the past year, but that illicit drugs (not marijuana) increased
with unmet need for mental health care. Rather than rely on cross-sectional evidence to infer
  11
    See Hillhouse & Porter (2015) for an excellent overview of the history on antidepressants.
  12
    For example, see Bolton et al. (2009), who use nationally representative survey data from the National Epi-
demiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions to document cross-sectional correlations between alcohol and
drug use and a variety of mental health conditions.

self-medication, Crum et al. (2013) directly asks survey participants if they self-medicate. Those
authors show that mental health illness is a significant rationale for alcohol consumption, and that
self-medication was associated with the development of alcohol use disorders. Finally, Deykin et al.
(1987) were the first to demonstrate that major depressive disorder typically predates alcohol use
disorders in adolescents, providing some evidence on the direction of causality.
       To summarize, major depressive disorder is the most common mood disorder in the United
States, affecting over 16.2 million adults in 2016. SSRIs significantly expanded the choice set with
respect to the management of depression, which is frequently medicated outside of the medical
system with potentially harmful and addictive substances. Finally, while earlier literature has
documented that self-medication likely occurs, studies are cross-sectional and generally do not
address causality or the dynamic implications of endogenous investments via self-medication, such
as addiction. These issues are the topic of our study.


3        Theory
Before proceeding to our empirical analysis, we formalize our notion of rational self-medication.
We present a simple, two-period model of behavior which highlights potential mechanisms for a
reduction in alcohol consumption when antidepressants improve. While our model is similar to
Kaestner et al. (2014), who study disease-specific (cholesterol drugs) and non-disease-specific (diet
and exercise) behaviors after the introduction of Statin pharmaceuticals, we focus on the dis-
crete choice to take antidepressants and the intensive margin of alcohol consumption.13 Because
SSRIs represent an improvement in the side-effects of antidepressants, rather than an improve-
ment in effectiveness with respect to depression, their introduction encourages use by lowering
the marginal cost of antidepressants. In our model, depression causes symptoms which draw from
utility in a consumption sense, and antidepressants and alcohol potentially alleviate contempora-
neous symptoms.14 Whereas antidepressants do not have any inter-temporal effects in our model,
contemporaneous alcohol consumption may worsen future mental health. Our model demonstrates
that a convex cost of symptoms in the utility function is sufficient for SSRIs to induce a reduction
in alcohol consumption.
       Agents solve a two-period problem, where periods are denoted t and t + 1. Where possible,
we drop time subscripts and denote t + 1 variables with a “prime”. An agent enters period t with

mental health. Agents choose whether or not to take an antidepressant, denoted Dt ∈ {0, 1} and
how much alcohol to drink At ∈ R+ . For ease of exposition, we assume that the agent chooses
non-zero alcohol consumption.
   Agents have preferences over alcohol consumption A and antidepressant consumption D, where
the latter includes the price of antidepressants along with side effects, stigma and other non-
pecuniary costs of SSRI use. They do not have preferences over mental health per se, but instead
over symptoms of mental health S. Agents choose A and D to solve:
                                                                  
                                   max u(St , At , Dt ) + βv(S 0 )                              (1)
                                   At ,Dt


where we assume that S and D enter negatively and A enters positively into both u and v.
Period t + 1 is effectively a “terminal” period in which no decisions are made and v(S 0 ) is thus a
continuation payoff affected by period-t choices which thus provides dynamic incentives to improve
mental health.
   Mental health evolves according to the following production function

                                       Mt+1 = fm (Mt , At , Dt )                                 (2)

where the argument Mt captures persistence in mental health stock, At captures how alcohol
usage can have negative impacts on future mental health, perhaps through increases in history of
alcohol terms, and Dt captures how antidepressants can improve long-run mental health. Period-t
symptoms are a function of the same arguments so that:

                                            St = fs (Mt , At , Dt )                             (3)

where symptoms are more likely to occur when Mt is lower. Alcohol can improve symptoms, which
is the “self-medication” effect, and antidepressants can also improve symptoms.
   To characterize self-medicating behavior, we use the model to make the following three points.
First, we show conditions under which D? = 1. Second, we characterize optimal alcohol usage.
Finally, we discuss conditions under which lowering the costs associated with antidepressant usage
— through the approval of SSRIs — would lead to decreases in alcohol usage. The third point is
consistent with a reduction in self-medication through alcohol when medication becomes a more
attractive option.
   To show optimal antidepressant usage, denote optimal alcohol consumption A∗ and A∗∗ , when
using antidepressants and not using antidepressants, respectively. Agents use antidepressants when



                                                      9
                                                                                                     3 THEORY


the benefits of doing so exceed the costs:

                            u(S(D = 1), A∗ , D = 1) + βv(S 0 (M 0 (D = 1))) ≥
                                                                                                                  (4)
                           u(S(D = 0), A∗∗ , D = 0) + βv(S 0 (M 0 (D = 0)))

To fix ideas, suppose we make the simplifying assumption on period-t utility that the costs of
medication usage are additively separable from other utility components, e.g., u(St , At , Dt ) =
ũ(St , At ) − φ(Dt ) where φ(Dt = 1) = φ and φ(Dt = 0) = 0.15 The agent uses antidepressants if
and only if

                       ũ(S(D = 1), A∗ ) + φ + βv(S 0 (M 0 (D = 1))) ≥
                           ũ(S(D = 0), A∗∗ ) + βv(S 0 (M 0 (D = 0))) ⇐⇒                                          (5)
       ũ(S(D = 1), A∗ ) − ũ(S(D = 0), A∗∗ ) + β[v(S 0 (M 0 (D = 1))) − v(S 0 (M 0 (D = 0)))] ≥ φ

The last line implies that the benefits must outweigh the costs in order for antidepressant usage to
occur, where the benefits include current period utility of fewer symptoms along with discounted t+
1 reductions in symptoms due to increased mental health stock. For a given level of antidepressant
effectiveness, antidepressant usage increases if the flow utility costs decline, e.g., through side
effects, stigma or price reductions. Moreover, as long as φ > 0, antidepressant usage only occurs
if there are benefits in the form of improved symptoms, either currently or in the future.
       Next, we characterize optimal alcohol consumption, in which the relevant first order condition
is:

                                        δA δS δA       δS δM 0 δA
The left hand side captures the marginal benefits of alcohol use, including both the enjoyment
of alcohol along with reduction in symptoms from self-medicating. The right hand side captures
marginal costs: higher A reduces M 0 and lower M 0 reduces continuation payoffs captured by v.
Optimal alcohol usage occurs when the marginal benefit of an additional unit of A is equal to the
marginal cost.
       Finally, we use our simple model to derive conditions under which antidepressant usage should
lead to decreases in alcohol usage. It is convenient to define a function for the marginal utility of
  15
    Additive separability implies that the marginal utility of alcohol is unaffected by SSRI usage. While this
assumption is unrealistic, it simplifies the exposition for optimal SSRI usage, and it does not affect our comparative
dynamics analysis presented below.

                                              δS   δS

For example, if α(S) = αS and α > 0, then utility is a concave function with increasingly negative
marginal utility of S. Having done this, the first-order condition above can be rewritten as:

                                                       δS 0 δM 0
                                                                

If alcohol usage decreases with SSRIs, it must be the case that SSRIs lead to a decline in the
left-hand-side of the last equation or an increase in the right-hand-side. We do not allow the
enjoyment of alcohol to be a function of symptoms, so the left hand side does not change. Thus,
for SSRIs to lower alcohol usage, it must be the case that the right hand side rises or that -1 times
the right hand side falls. Thus, to understand reduced self-medication in the form of drinking, we
examine why the following expression should decline when symptoms decline:

                                                   δS 0 δM 0
                                                                
                                             δS
                                        α(S)    +β                                               (10)
                                             δA    δM 0 δA

There are four possibilities:

  1. α(S) is lower when D = 1. Given that utility is a declining function of S, this suggests that
      costs of S rise with S. The implication is that medication leads to a decline in symptoms.
      This reduces the marginal cost of symptoms, which means that the marginal benefit of
      technology that reduces symptoms is lower.

                                      δS
  2. A second possibility is that     δA
                                             is lower when D = 1. This could occur if alcohol is less
      productive at reducing symptoms at lower symptom levels.

                                      δS 0
  3. The third possibility is that    δM 0
                                             is smaller when D = 1. This means that improvements to
      mental health reduce symptoms more so when mental health is better.

               δM 0
  4. Finally    δA
                      is lower when D = 1 which suggests that alcohol reduces future mental health
      more so if mental health is better.

Which of these is true is difficult to pinpoint using the data we have. This means that there are
several possible dynamics that could underlie self-medication. Still, some of our empirical work
provides some guidance on which mechanism is more likely to help explain self-medication. We

return to this point when discussing our estimates. We now turn to our empirical investigation of
self-medication.


4        The Framingham Heart Study
To study self-medication empirically, we turn to the Offspring Cohort of the Framingham Heart
Study (FHS). The Offspring Cohort data are ideal for our purposes as they include longitudinal
information on alcohol, tobacco, antidepressant medication, and mental health over nine detailed
health exams over 40 years. Begun in 1971, the Offspring Cohort includes roughly 5,000 offspring
of the FHS Original Cohort, which began in 1948 in Framingham Massachusetts, and their spouses.
Both cohorts of individuals have received detailed health examinations at 2-4 year intervals into
the 21st century, and both cohorts have made significant contributions to the understanding of
cardiovascular disease.16
       Participants range from 13 to 62 years of age at the first exam, which reflects the wide age
variation in the Original Cohort. The Original Cohort restricted its sampling to white residents
of Framingham Massachusetts, and, while no restriction was placed on the ethnicity or residency
the spouses of the offspring, data are not available on these characteristics. As the FHS was not
meant to be representative of any larger population, we restrict our final estimation sample to
2,497 individuals for whom we have consistent exam participation and information.17 To enter our
sample, an individual must have completed exams one through three and must not have skipped
exams in the subsequent periods. Following the third exam, individuals may leave the sample
through either death or attrition. Because of an eight year gap between exams one and two, and
because of data limitations discussed below, we restrict our analysis to exams two through nine.
All FHS Offspring participants completed exam two between 1979 and 1983.
       Table 1 presents summary statistics of the Offspring Cohort at our initial exam (exam two) by
gender and by whether an individual is ever, over the subsequent seven exams, observed to be on
any type of antidepressant. Of the 1,241 men in our sample, 12.17% are observed at some point to
be taking antidepressants; for women, the percentage ever taking antidepressants is significantly
higher at 24.52%. The FHS asks respondents the number of 12oz beers, 5oz glasses of wine,
and 1.5oz liquor drinks they typically consume per week. We aggregate these to a drinks per week
measure, and we follow the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines for light
and heavy alcohol consumption based on gender: light drinking is defined as up to seven drinks
  16
     See Mahmood et al. (2014) for a detailed history of the Study. See Darden et al. (2018) and Darden (2017) for

per week for women and 14 drinks per week for men; heavy drinking is any number above the
gender-specific thresholds.18 At the second exam, men drink more heavily than women (despite the
higher threshold for heavy drinking), and rates of heavy drinking are higher for those ever-observed
to take an antidepressant (although these differences are not statistically significant). Generally,
there are not statistical differences between ever and never antidepressant users, although a notable
exception is cancer and mortality incidence for women, which are both statistically higher among
the never users, despite the fact that women taking antidepressants are more likely to smoke.
       At exam three, Offspring Cohort participants took the Center for Epidemiological Services -
Depression (CES-D) test for depression, which aggregates 20 clinically verified depression questions
(each on 0 to 3 Likert Scale) into a depression summary score (Radoff, 1977).19 We break the
continuous depression score at exam three into tertiles, and we present the fraction of individuals
in each exam three tertile by gender and whether they are ever observed to take an antidepressant
in the last three rows of Table 1. Not surprisingly, the fraction of both men and women in
higher CES-D tertiles are higher for those who go on to take an antidepressant, but we emphasize
the sizable fraction of those in the lowest tertile of depression in exam three who eventually use
antidepressants as foreshadowing of the heterogeneity results presented below.20 Importantly,
antidepressants are prescribed for a wide variety of conditions other than depression, including
bipolar disorder, bulimia, fibromyalgia, insomnia, PTSD, and social anxiety disorder (CMS, 2013).
       Table 2 shows means and proportions of key variables over the eight exams. Each FHS exam
was administered within a three to four year window, and, while we do not have information on the
date that an individual took an exam, Table 2 displays the year ranges in which all participants
completed each exam. Unfortunately, we do not observe antidepressant medication usage at exam
two, however, the absence of this information likely stems from the observed trends in their use:
at exam three, only 1.0% of men and 2.1% of women used antidepressants. Importantly, exam
three was completed prior to 1988, when the FDA approved SSRIs, after which antidepressant
medication usage grows considerably within our sample over time for both men and women. Light
and heavy alcohol use decline over our sample period and cigarette smoking plummets. Between
exams two and nine, we lose roughly 48% and 38% of men and women, respectively, to sample
attrition or death.
       Figure 2 demonstrates trends in alcohol and smoking behavior over time by whether an indi-
vidual is ever observed to take an antidepressant. Prior to 1988, antidepressants were quite rare in

     The clinically verified threshold for depression is any score at or above 16.
  20
     Wulsin et al. (2005) use FHS Offspring Cohort data to relate the exam three CES-D score to future health
outcomes. They find that, relative the lowest tertile, CES-D score is statistically related to all-cause mortality but
not coronary heart disease.

our data, but, as shown above, following the approval of SSRIs, antidepressant use grew rapidly.
Relative to those never taking an antidepressant, Figure 2 demonstrates relatively parallel trends
in both alcohol and tobacco consumption prior to 1988 and potentially important deviations from
trend after 1988 for alcohol abstinence and light drinking.21
       To test the rational self-medication hypothesis that consumption of risky goods should decline
following an improvement in the choice set of treatment options, we begin by regressing binary
indicators for never, light, and heavy drinking on a binary variable for antidepressant usage at a
given exam. Equation 11 presents our baseline empirical specification,

                                                   0
                                     yit = µi + xit β + δdit + θt + it ,                                 (11)

where yit is risky behavior y for person i in year t, µi represents an individual specific effect, xit
are time-varying individual characteristics characteristics, θt are exam binary variables, and it is
an i.i.d. error component. Our variable of interest is dit , which equals one if person i in exam t is
taking an antidepressant. Table 3 presents results from Equation 11, in which we estimate separate
linear probability models for never, light, and heavy drinking, as well as whether an individual
smokes cigarettes. Because antidepressants are unobserved in exam 2, we estimate Equation 11
on data from exams three through nine. For each alcohol measure, Table 3 presents both an
estimate of δ, as well as interaction terms between dit and gender and exam three CES-D tertile.22
Results presented in Table 3 are conditional on age, education, and other health metrics, including
blood pressure, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and exam fixed effects. Standard errors are
clustered at the individual level.
       Table 3 demonstrates preliminary evidence of substitutability between antidepressants and
alcohol. Panel 1 of Table 3 omits µi , the individual-specific effect, exploiting both within and
between variation in behaviors. For each intensity of alcohol consumption and for tobacco, column
1 presents estimates of δ, the effect of antidepressant medication on behavior. The results in panel
1 suggest a significant increase in alcohol abstinence, driven mainly by a statistically significant
reduction in light drinking. Finally, we find a statistically significant increase in smoking of 4.5
percentage points, suggesting complementarity between antidepressants and cigarettes. Panel 2 of
  21
     Trends in behaviors in Table 2 and Figure 2 reflect both changing behavior and the changing composition of
the sample, which we emphasize below in our dynamic system of equations model.
  22
     Our focus on the exam 3 CES-D score is for two reasons. First, exam three took place between 1983 and
1987, just before the introduction of SSRIs. Thus, we consider the exam three score to be a baseline metric of
depression, prior to the improved technology. Second, unfortunately, FHS only conducted the CES-D test in exams
three, six, seven, and nine. Estimates of our dynamic system of equations model proved to be erratic when we
we attempted to model the time-varying metric of depression while integrating over missing years. The medium
category is associated with a CES-D score between 5 and 10; high category is associated with a score between 11
and 51.

Table 3 adds individual fixed effects (i.e., µi ). When we focus our attention on within-individual
variation, there still exists evidence of substitution: participants are more likely to report no
alcohol consumption (3.9 percentage points or 12.4%) when using an antidepressant. While panel
1 suggests an increase in smoking associated with antidepressants, the inclusion of individual fixed
effects nullifies that result overall in column 1 of panel 2.
    To investigate heterogeneity in our results, column 2 for each respective behavior presents
estimates of δ as well as interactions between antidepressants and binary variables for female and
medium and high tertiles of the exam three CES-D score. Focusing on panel 2, column 2 results
suggest that the overall 3.9 percentage point increase in alcohol abstinence is driven largely by a
reduction in heavy drinking among men (8.6 percentage point decline) and a reduction in light
drinking among those in the highest tertile of the exam three depression score. Panel 2 of Table 3,
shows no significant effect of antidepressants on smoking behavior overall but provides suggestive
evidence that antidepressants may prevent smoking cessation in men.
    Our fixed effects results take a causal interpretation if there is no time-varying unobserved
heterogeneity that affects both the decision to take antidepressants and behavior. While we cannot
test this assumption, we interact our time fixed effects with a binary variable for ever being
observed to take an antidepressant. Conditional on contemporaneous antidepressant usage, time-
varying individual unobserved heterogeneity would likely generate different trends in behavior.
Furthermore, in the presence of time-varying unobserved heterogeneity, controlling for differential
trends would likely significantly change the estimates on antidepressants. Panel 3 of Table 3
presents estimates of δ and the associated interaction coefficients while controlling for medication
specific trends. At the bottom of panel 3, we present the p-values of the F-tests that the interacted
trend variables are all zero. Consistent with Figure 2, none of the alcohol or smoking p-values
suggest statistically significantly different trends, and the point estimates, while slightly attenuated,
are not significantly different from those in panel 2. Results from Table 3 demonstrate some
evidence of self-medication — during a period in which medication for depression became much
better and more common, antidepressants were associated with declines drinking, specifically for
heavy drinking by men.


5     Dynamic Empirical Model
Despite providing suggestive evidence of self-medication, results from Table 3 are problematic in
several important ways. First, a large and growing empirical literature recognizes the inherent
dynamics in addictive goods (Arcidiacono et al., 2007; Darden, 2017), and Equation 11 is static in


                                                   15

the sense that contemporaneous behavior is not allowed to depend on past behavior. The marginal
utility of alcohol likely depends on past consumption, and the failure to model the dynamics of
these behaviors will likely lead to an overestimate on the effect of antidepressants on behavior.
Furthermore, while alcohol consumption may improve contemporaneous mental health, a large
literature suggests that heavy alcohol consumption may harm future mental health. Second, the
composition of our sample is changing over time through mortality and attrition. Especially
because (i) the behaviors being modeled may cause mortality or attrition; and (ii) significant
antidepressant medication usage is not observed until the end of our sample period, selective exits
may significantly bias our results. Finally, estimation of each equation separately does not allow
for correlation in unobserved heterogeneity across equations.
       In the spirit of our two-period model presented above, and to address the limitations of our
static empirical model, we estimate a dynamic system of equations for antidepressants, alcohol and
tobacco consumption, sample attrition, and mortality. The empirical model is an approximation of
a more general structural model of behavior and outcomes in which an individual optimally selects
a bundle of investments in health, and health, both mental health and mortality, is a function of
behavior. In what follows, we briefly outline the timing of our dynamic system of equations.
       The following time line presents a representative period t of an individual’s problem in which
we suppress the individual subscript i for ease of notation:
                                           st
                                  St       at                St+1

                                            dt                        Ot+1
                             t−1                      Period t        Et+1         t+1

Here, St captures the period t state vector, which sufficiently summarizes measures of past be-
havior. Given her state St , an individual begins period t by choosing whether or not to take an
antidepressant, dt . Conditional on dt , an individual chooses whether to smoke st and the intensity
of alcohol consumption at ∈ {N one, Light, Heavy}. Alcohol and cigarette decisions follow the
antidepressant decision to allow the marginal utility of alcohol and cigarettes to depend on an-
tidepressant consumption.23 Following these decisions, at the end of period t, a person may attrit
from the sample, Et+1 or die, Ot+1 , but conditional on remaining in the sample, the state variable
S updates.
       While solution of such a model is beyond the scope of this paper, such a solution would generate
demand equations for antidepressants, alcohol, and cigarettes, as well as outcome equations for
  23
    We model alcohol sequentially with antidepressants because clinical guidelines suggest that patients should not
combine alcohol and any type of antidepressants due to the potential for negative interaction effects. Because an
antidepressant requires a prescription and is therefore a less flexible input, we allow the marginal utility of alcohol
(and tobacco) consumption to depend on contemporaneous antidepressant consumption.

attrition and mortality. Specifically, solution would theoretically yield the following probabilities
for each behavior:
                                       p(dt = d) = d(St , Xt , c3 , µd , dt )                              (12)

                                   p(at = a) = a(St , dt , Xt , Pt , c3 , µa , at )                        (13)

                                   p(st = s) = s(St , dt , Xt , Pt , c3 , µs , st )                        (14)

The demand for antidepressants is a function of past behavior (alcohol, cigarettes, and antide-
pressants), as well as exogenous characteristics Xt . The final two terms, µd and dt , represent a
permanent, individual specific component and an i.i.d. error component, respectively. The demand
for alcohol and cigarettes are chosen simultaneously as a function of the same arguments, includ-
ing a price vector Pt , lagged behavior, exogenous characteristics, and antidepressants, which again
captures the potential for negative interaction effects between these behaviors and antidepres-
sants. Similar to the antidepressant equation, the final two terms, µ. and .t , represent permanent,
individual specific components and i.i.d. error components, respectively.
   The structural framework above suggests that an outcome equation for mental health should
be a function of the state vector St , which includes lagged mental health, and period t behavior.
Unfortunately, we do not consistently observe the CES-D score in the Framingham data.24 . Our
solution is to estimate a time invariant measure of depression based on the exam three CES-D
tertiles presented above. Specifically, we estimate:

                                       p(c3 = c) = c(a2 , s2 , X3 , µc , c3 )                              (15)

where c ∈ {Low, M edium, Heavy}. Importantly, the exam three CES-D is measured prior to the
introduction of SSRIs in 1988; thus, we interpret c3 as a baseline measure of depression which is
predictive of future mental health. Because our baseline measure of mental health may itself be a
function of past alcohol and tobacco consumption, we allow the probability of each depression state
to be a function of lagged alcohol and tobacco consumption, a2 and s2 , respectively. Furthermore,
as discussed in more detail below, estimating Equation 15 jointly with the demand/outcome system
allows us to jointly estimate the distribution of permanent unobserved heterogeneity, µ.
   In addition to Equation 15, we estimate equations for sample attrition and mortality, respec-
tively:
                                p(Et+1 = e) = e(St , at , st , dt , c3 , Xt , µe , et )                    (16)
  24
     While estimation of a dynamic production function for the CES-D score is technically possible, the parameter
estimates were highly unstable when estimating jointly with other behavioral/outcome equations. For example, the
lagged CES-D score parameter is identified off of only variation in the seventh exam CES-D score

                                   p(Ot+1 = o) = a(St , at , st , dt , c3 , Xt , µo , ot ).             (17)

Finally, because we observe individuals between the ages of 17 and 72 at exam two, we observe very
different initial histories of alcohol and cigarette consumption. Thus, we estimate initial conditions
equations for alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking at exam two:

                                              p(a0 = a) = a(X2 , µa0 , a0 )                             (18)

                                              p(s0 = s) = s(X2 , µs0 , s0 ).                            (19)

Under the assumption that each  term takes an extreme value type 1 distribution, equations 12
through 19 become a system of dynamic logit equations.25
       The µ terms represent equation specific permanent unobserved heterogeneity, and we allow
the µ terms to be correlated across equations, yielding the familiar seemingly unrelated regression
framework. We argue that modeling the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity is important be-
cause permanent unobserved characteristics such as genetic endowments may affect both behaviors
and outcomes and because measurement error, which is always a problem with measures of mental
health, may be lessened. Conditional on the distributional assumption that each  term takes an
                                                                                               0   0
i.i.d. extreme value distribution, we treat the joint distribution of (µa , µs , µc , µa , µs , µe , µO ) non-
parametrically. Following Heckman & Singer (1984) and Mroz (1999), we estimate a step-function
for an assumed number of points of support for each term. Jointly with each point of support
subject to the normalization that the first point of support is zero in all equations, we estimate
the probability of each type. While µ takes the form of a random effect (i.e., we are estimating the
distribution of the permanent component of the error structure), µ is not independent of the en-
dogenous right-hand side variables because the latent factor helped to determine past realizations
of the endogenous behaviors and outcomes.
       To estimate the system, we maximize the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameters
that dictate initial conditions, exam three depression, behavior, and outcomes. The latent factor
approach allows individual characteristics that are unobserved by the researcher to impact all
jointly estimated equations (in a non-linear way) and integrates over their distributions when
constructing the likelihood function. That is, the weighted-sum of likelihood contributions for
each individual i at time t is:

where Θ defines the vector of parameters of the model. Here, the vector ρ denotes mass-point
specific probabilities and is the estimated joint probability of the k th permanent mass point. After
taking the log of each individual’s unconditional likelihood contribution, we add the contributions
to form the sample log-likelihood function and we maximize with respect to Θ.
       Identification of the system comes from four sources. First, prices of cigarettes and alcohol,
which we interact with age to generate cross-sectional variation and to allow the price elasticity
of demand for alcohol and cigarettes to vary with age, appear only in the demand equations for
cigarettes and alcohol.26 The assumption is that any effect of prices on our depression and mortality
outcomes works through alcohol and cigarettes. We use the alcohol specific Consumer Price Index
for urban consumers from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s Federal Reserve Economic Data,
which is seasonally adjusted and relative to 1982-1984.27 Second, as discussed above, the FDA’s
approval of SSRIs dramatically lessened the side-effects of taking an antidepressant and opened
antidepressants to new demographic markets (e.g., the elderly). We argue that the full price of
antidepressants shifted exogenously between exams 3 and 4 as a result of this innovation. Third,
following Arellano & Bond (1991), time-varying exogenous variables, including prices and our X
variables, serve as implicit instruments for behavior. Finally, functional form assumptions (i.e.,
logit) help to identify the system (as is common in the structural econometric literature).
       Table 4 provides selected estimates from the multinomial logit equation for per-period alcohol
consumption relative to the omitted category of not drinking.28 For example, for light drinking,

standard errors for both a model without unobserved heterogeneity (i.e., where we set k=1) and
for a model in which we assume four points of support for the joint distribution of µ (subject to
the normalization that the first point of support is zero in all equations). While the coefficients
are difficult to interpret, the Table demonstrates a negative relationship between antidepressants
and both light and heavy drinking.
    Table 5 presents the estimated points of support for the joint distribution of µ and the associated
probabilities of each “type.”29 Our preferred specification includes four points of support for the
distribution of µ, and we normalize the first point in each equation to zero. For example, type four
individuals are significantly more likely to be highly depressed at exam three, they are significantly
more likely to take antidepressants and smoke, but they are significantly less likely to drink, both
lightly and heavily. Because parameters in both Tables 4 and 5 are difficult to interpret on their
own, we now turn to simulation exercises to investigate rational self-medication.


Simulation
To evaluate our model, we simulate both the extent to which our model can recover the time path
of each behavior/outcome and the extent to which it can capture transitions between behaviors.
To proceed, we replicate the baseline sample, complete with their baseline characteristics, 50 times.
For men, this implies a simulated sample of 50*2,497=124,850 simulated observations. Using the
estimated distribution of µ, we endow each simulated individual with a complete set of draws of
the error structure (including all  terms). We begin by using the estimated initial conditions
and exam three CES-D equations to simulate starting points for our simulation.30 Conditional on
these and the assigned draws of the error structure, we simulate behavior and outcomes forward
from exam two, taking care to update the state vector with endogenous variables and associated
interaction terms. For example, when an individual is simulated to drink lightly, his or her next
period lagged light drinking variable is updated accordingly, regardless of if the person actually
drank lightly.
    Figure 3 presents the empirical time path of each behavior/outcome, as well as our simulated
time path.31 In all cases, our model produces the observed patterns quite well. To further demon-
strate that our model does a good job in capturing the data, Table 6 presents simulated transitions
for each behavior along with the analogous transition proportion in the data for both men and

     Simulating the initial conditions equations prevents us from breaking the link between the initial conditions,
the unobserved heterogeneity, and the per-period equations.
  31
     In simulation, we assign the median year in the range of years in which each exam could have occurred.

women. For example, conditional on drinking heavily in period t − 1, 61.7% of individuals are
simulated to be drinking heavily in period t. In the data, that percentage is 58.7%. Capturing
transitions is more difficult than capturing averages, yet our model does a good job of recovering
the transitions in the data. Finally, Figure 4 demonstrates the importance of modeling the unob-
served heterogeneity distribution. For example, Figure 4a shows a significantly higher fraction of
Type 1 individuals using antidepressants while these same individuals are much less likely to be
drinking heavily. Importantly, despite the fact that each µ term shifts the respective logit equation
intercept, the time paths by type are not perfectly parallel. This highlights selection out of the
sample by type.
   To test our theory of rational self-medication, we simulate our estimated dynamic model under
two counterfactual scenarios. As a natural first step, we evaluate a counterfactual in which all
sample participants take an antidepressant as soon as SSRIs become available and there onward
(i.e., exam 4 through 9). Figure 5a presents results for the entire sample. Heavy drinking declines
by approximately five percentage points by the end of the ninth exam. Figures 5b and 5c break the
results from Figure 5a by gender, which demonstrates that men are primarily driving our heavy
drinking result. Figures 5d, 5e, and 5f break the results from Figure 5a by simulated exam three
CES-D tertile. Surprisingly, the reduction in heavy drinking associated with antidepressants is
driven by those in the middle tertile, with no reduction in heavy drinking for those simulated to
be highly depressed.
   One potential explanation for the lack of substitution away from heavy drinking for those
simulated to be highly depressed is that with depression comes addiction. If highly depressed
individuals face significant reinforcement, tolerance, and withdrawal mechanisms, then alcohol
consumption may not change despite improvements in mental health. To investigate, Figure 6
presents results in which we simulate our model assuming that the parameters on all terms reflecting
past alcohol consumption are set to zero. Not surprisingly, relative to the baseline simulation heavy
alcohol consumption plummets while light drinking remains unchanged — a roughly equal fraction
of light drinkers quit as compared to the fraction of heavy drinkers who move to light drinking.
Figure 7 presents the simulated time paths of endogenously chosen antidepressant medication
under this counterfactual relative to the baseline simulation. Overall, Figure 7a demonstrates a
5.5 percentage point increase in antidepressant usage by the end of the sample. Figures 7b-7f
demonstrate that substitution towards antidepressants greater (in percentage terms) for men and
is increasing in simulated depression. Figure 7 provides clear evidence that addiction inhibits
substitution. These results are consistent with rational self-medication.
   Finally, Figure 8b contrasts our main finding in Figure 5a of a roughly five percentage point

decline in heavy drinking when antidepressants are imposed on the entire sample with a similar
simulation in which we both impose antidepressants and decrease alcohol prices by 10%. Figure
8b shows that the 10% completely nullifies the antidepressant effect by exam nine. The simulation
also demonstrates that prices, which serve an important role with respect to identification of our
dynamic system, significantly affect even heavy alcohol consumption.


6        Additional Evidence: Smoking
Until now, we have provided evidence of substitution, which provides empirical evidence in support
of the rational self-medication hypothesis. Individuals substitute a risky substance, alcohol, for
SSRIs. We now turn to smoking.32 There are three reasons. One, smoking is associated with
depression and could therefore be used as a treatment, which would suggest an additional test
of the self-medication hypothesis. Two, the dynamics of smoking, in particular, the impact of
smoking on future depression, are different from alcohol. As we show, using a framework similar
to the theory above, this allows us to draw sharper conclusions about which mechanisms drive self-
medication. Three, smoking is an important behavior in a long panel as it can increase mortality
rates.
       Figure 9 presents simulated time paths of smoking behavior for our first counterfactual in
which we impose antidepressants on the entire sample at exam four onward. Consistent with
our regression estimates in Table 3, Figure 9 shows a positive relationship between taking an
antidepressant and smoking. This effect is driven by men and by those in the lowest simulated
tertile of depression, and it entirely reflects a failure to quit smoking, as opposed to smoking
initiation. The tobacco results are puzzling, but they may help us to say more about the rational
self-medication hypothesis, both with respect to tobacco and alcohol.
       To investigate, we return to our theoretical model in Section 3. Rather than develop comple-
mentarities between alcohol and tobacco with respect to both preferences and the production of
mental health, we simplify the problem by replacing alcohol A with tobacco T .33 Focusing on
tobacco, the model yields a similar equilibrium expression to Equation 7 for optimal consumption,
  32
     Hughes et al. (2014), in a comprehensive review of the epidemiological literature, find no evidence that SSRIs
aid in smoking cessation. Fluharty et al. (2017) review the longitudinal literature on cigarettes and depression and
show that smoking and depression are strongly correlated, but the direction of causation is unclear.
  33
     The model developed in Section 3 focuses on the intensive margin of alcohol consumption. For simplicity, we
continue on that margin with respect to tobacco, recognizing that our empirical finding is that of a failure to quit
smoking.

To simplify the problem further, suppose that smoking has no long-run negative effect on mental
health, which implies that the marginal cost becomes:

                                                                       δS
                                                                α(S)                                               (22)
                                                                       δT

Given our empirical findings that alcohol consumption decreases while tobacco cessation rates
drop, it must be the case that
             δS          0
                        δS δM 0   
  1. α(S)      δA
                    + β δM 0 δA       falls and

          δS
  2. α(S) δT does not change or rises.

To explain why alcohol consumption falls when D = 1, we argued above that α(S) is smaller
                                                                    δS
for lower S. If D = 1 causes α(S) to fall, then                     δT
                                                                            must increase with reduced symptoms if the
                δS
expression α(S) δT is to remain constant or increase. Formally, this means that:

                                                       δS                               δS
                                      α(S, D = 1)                 > α(S, D = 0)                                    (23)
                                                       δT   D=1                         δT   D=0


If α(S, D = 1) < α(S, D = 0), then there exists some value δ such that α(S, D = 1)+δ = α(S, D =
0), and the above expression can be rewritten as:

                                                  δS                                         δS
                              α(S, D = 1)                       > (α(S, D = 1) + δ)                                (24)
                                                  δT   D=1                                   δT   D=0


Which implies that:
                                              δS
                                              δT D=1            (α(S, D = 1) + δ)
                                              δS
                                                            >                                                      (25)
                                              δT D=0
                                                                   α(S, D = 1)
                                                                              δS
Thus, the decline in α(S) means that the increase in                          δT
                                                                                   has a lower bound and must be “large
enough”. In other words, our results can be rationalized within our model if smoking is more
effective for reducing symptoms when symptoms are mild and the change in symptoms is large.
Importantly, the overall change in smoking rates in Figure 9a is entirely explained by the relative
failure to quit smoking of those simulated to be in the lowest tertile of the CES-Depression metric
(Figure 9d).
   To summarize, under the assumption that the marginal cost of symptoms rises with symptoms,

                                                                  23

alcohol should decrease with improved symptoms. If smoking is more useful with respect to
symptoms when symptoms are mild, then an improvement in symptoms may have the perverse
effect of inhibiting smoking cessation. We argue that our empirical results with respect to both
alcohol and tobacco are consistent with the self-medication hypothesis. Moreover, specific empirical
patterns are consistent with three underlying mechanisms:

    1. Individuals are more prone to self-medicate with more severe symptoms due to the marginal
      utility cost of symptoms. This is an assumption rather than a direct implication of the
      model.

    2. Individuals use less alcohol when their symptoms are reduced because alcohol is more effective
      when symptoms are more severe.

    3. Smokers fail to quit smoking when their symptoms are reduced since smoking is more effective
      when symptoms are less severe.


7     Conclusion
We develop a theory of rational self-medication, which suggests a relationship between optimal
investments in health and the degree of negative symptoms generated by a stock of health. We
test our hypothesis by studying alcohol and tobacco consumption when the choice set for the man-
agement of depression expands due to technological advancement (i.e., SSRIs). Using a dynamic
system of equations estimator, we show that heavy alcohol consumption decreases for men and for
those with moderate depression following the introduction of SSRIs. The dynamic model allows us
to simulate antidepressant behavior under the counterfactual that alcohol is less addictive, which
shows that antidepressant consumption increases by five to six percentage points, and this increase
is increasing in the severity of depression. Finally, we show that SSRIs prevented smoking cessation
in those with mild depression, which suggests that different health investments (i.e., alcohol and
tobacco) have different importance across the spectrum of mental health.
    We acknowledge three main limitations of our work. First, even with forty years of longitudi-
nal data on alcohol, tobacco, and antidepressant consumption, FHS lacks a consistently measured
metric of mental health. Ideally, a representative period of our dynamic empirical model would
include a time-varying mental health production function which is a function of period t health
investments. Second, while our theory has important implications for current policy, FHS is not
representative of a larger population, and thus our results may not extend to at risk populations
in other areas of the United States or for underrepresented groups. Finally, our dynamic system

                                                 24

of equations abstracts from an explicit forward-looking decision-making process. In a fully struc-
tural model, an individual’s decision to consume alcohol or tobacco would depend on the present
discounted value of being in different possible future states, about which an individual would form
expectations conditional on contemporaneous behavior. Rational self-medication says that indi-
viduals should consider the possibility of future addiction when considering current management
of pain, and we are unable to address these expectations with our current estimator. We leave this
for future work.
   To the extent that rational self-medication characterizes behavior, our theory has important
implications for addiction and health policy. Given the growing literature on the significant effects
of technological innovation on health behaviors, policy should promote treatment innovations that
obviate the need to self-medicate and thus induce rational actors to substitute towards less harmful
substances.

        Notes: n = 2, 497. With the exception of the CES-D score, statistics are cal-
        culated from exam 2, which took place between 1979 and 1983. The sample is
        constructed such that an individual must be present for exams 2 and 3, after
        which an individual may leave the sample through death or attrition. Rows for
        never and ever antidepressant usage reflect whether the person was ever observed
        to take an antidepressant. Depression is measured by the CES-D scale, which is
        broken into tertiles. Light drinking is defined as seven or fewer drinks per week
        for women and 14 or fewer drinks per week for men. Heavy drinking is defined as
        more than seven drinks per week for women and more than 14 drinks per week
        for men.

Notes: n = 17, 258. Statistics are calculated from eight exams, which took place
between 1979 and 2011. The sample is constructed such that an individual must be
present for exams 2 and 3, after which some individuals are lost to death or attrition.
Light drinking is defined as seven or fewer drinks per week for women and 14 or fewer
drinks per week for men. Heavy drinking is defined as more than seven drinks per
week for women and more than 14 drinks per week for men.

Notes: n =14,687 person/year observations in all regressions. All regressions are estimated on data
from exams 3 through 9 and include controls for age, education, cardiovascular disease, cancer, body
mass index, and exam binary variables. All results are from linear probability models. Interaction
effects are the second and third tertile of exam three CES-D score, relative to the lowest tertile. The
p-value is with respect to the F-test with null hypothesis that interactions between ever taking a
medication and each exam binary variable are jointly zero. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05 *** p < 0.01.

we impose that all individuals take an antidepressant from exam 4 onwards. Figure 5a presents the simulations
for the entire sample. Figures 5b and 5c present results separately for men and women. Figures 5d, 5e, 5f present
results for those simulated at exam 3 to be in the low, medium, or high tertiles of CES-Depression score.

                       a. Overall                                               b. Men




                      c. Women                                            d. Low Depression




               e. Medium Depression                                       f. High Depression
Notes: Each figure presents simulated trends in antidepressant usage under the baseline scenario as well as under
the counterfactual in which we remove the dependence on past alcohol consumption in all behavioral equations.
Figure 7a presents the simulations for the entire sample. Figures 7b and 7c present results separately for men and
women. Figures 7d, 7e, 7f present results for those simulated at exam 3 to be in the low, medium, or high tertiles
of CES-Depression score.

Notes: Figure 8a presents simulated trends in heavy alcohol consumption under the baseline scenario as well as
under the counterfactual in which we impose antidepressants on all participants at exam 4. This figure is identical
to the heavy drinking trend presented in Figure 5. Figure 8b presents the same baseline simulation in heavy
drinking along with imposed antidepressants and a decrease in alcohol prices by 10% of baseline levels in all exams
after the third.

Notes: Each figure presents simulated trends in smoking under both the baseline scenario as well as those behaviors
when we impose that all individuals take an antidepressant from exam 4 onwards. Figure 9a presents the simulations
for the entire sample. Figures 9b and 9c present results separately for men and women. Figures 9d, 9e, 9f present
results for those simulated at exam 3 to be in the low, medium, or high tertiles of CES-Depression score.
