                Cointegration and Tests of Present Value Models




                                     ABSTRACT


       In a model where a variable      is proportional to the present value,

with constant discount rate, of expected future values of a variable

the "spread" St        -     will   be stationary for some 0 whether or not

must be differenced to induce stationarity. Thus,          and       are cointe-
grated. The model implies that St is proportional to the optimal forecast
of          and also to the optimal forecast of 5*, the present value of fu-

ture

       We use vector autoregressive methods, and recent literature on cointe-

grated processes, to test the model. When           is the long-term interest

rate and y the short-term interest rate, we find in postwar U.S. data that

St behaves much like an optimal forecast of 5* even though as earlier re-

search has shown it is negatively correlated with           When       is a real

stock price index and y the corresponding real dividend, using annual U.S.

data for 1871-1986 we obtain less encouraging results for the model, al-

though the results are sensitive to the assumed discount rate.

               COINTEGRATION AND TESTS OF PRESENT VALUE MODELS


       Present value models are among the simplest dynamic stochastic models

of economics. A present value model for two variables,       y and        states

that      is a linear function of the present discounted value of expected

future Y:



(1)       =   0(1-6)   E oEtY+. + c


c, the constant, 0, the coefficient of proportionality, and 6, the discount

factor, are parameters which may be known a priori or may need to be esti-

mated.    Et. here and in what follows, denotes mathematical expectation,

conditional on the full public information set        which includes      and

themselves and in general exceeds the information set         available to the

econometrician. Models of this form include the expectations theory for

interest rates         is the long-term yield and y the one-period rate), the

present value model of stock prices         is the stock price and     the divi-

dend), and with some modification, the permanent income theory of consump-
tion. 1


       Despite the simplicity of their structure, there is a surprising de-

gree of controversy about the validity of present value models for bonds,

stocks and other economic variables.2 The controversy seems to be stimulat-



  The discounted sum in (1) extends to an infinite horizon. Most of the
  methods in this paper can be applied to the finite horizon case, at the
  cost of some additional complexity. Hansen and Sargent [l9Sla] refer to
  the class of linear models in which, conditional on     there is no error
  term, as "exact linear rational expectations models". Present value mod-
  els fall into this category. Throughout this paper we will treat condi-
  tional expectations as equivalent to linear projections on information.

2 For bonds, see Sargent [1979], Shiller [1979, l98la, 1985], Hansen and

ed by three problems which arise in testing (1). First, there are several

test procedures in the literature; these include single-equation regression

tests, tests of cross-equation restrictions on a vector autoregression

(VAR), and variance bounds tests.      It is not clear how these alternative

approaches are related to one another.

         Secondly, a statistical rejection of the model (1) may not have much

economic significance.      It is entirely possible that the model explains

most of the variation in        even if it is rejected at the 5% level. Most

work on present value models concentrates on statistical testing rather

than informal evaluation of the "fit" of the models.

         Finally, the variables y and Y usually require some transformation

before the theory of stationary stochastic processes can be applied.      One

approach is to remove a deterministic linear trend, but this can bias test

procedures against the model (1) if in fact          and    are stationary in

first differences.

         In this paper we develop a test of the present value relation that is

valid when the variables are stationary in first differences.' The test ex-

ploits the recently developed theory of cointegrated processes (Granger and

Engle [1985], Stock [1984]). It is fully efficient, testing all the impli-

cations of the model, and can be interpreted as a single-equation regres-



    Sargent [1981a], Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz [1983], and Campbell
    and Shiller [1984]. For stocks, see Shiller [l981b, 1984], LeRoy and
    Porter [1981], West [1984], Marsh and Merton [1985], Scott [1985], Mank-
    iw, Romer and Shapiro [1985] and Kleidon [1986].

    This point is made for stocks by Marsh and ?Ierton [1985] and Kleidon
    [1986]. Mankiw and Shapiro [1984] present a similar argument for the
    permanent income theory of consumption.
"
    It might be attractive to model the variables y and Y as stationary in
    log first differences, or growth rates. However since the model (1) is
    linear in levels, a log specification is intractable.

sion or as a test of restrictions on a VAR. The VAR system can also be

used to test variance bounds, and to assess the economic significance of

deviations from (1). Thus the methods of the paper alleviate all three of

the problems discussed above. We apply our methods to the present value

models for bonds and stocks, while a companion piece by one of us (Campbell

[1986]) studies the permanent income theory of consumption.

    The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 1 discusses al-

ternative tests of the present value relation when    and     are stationary

in first differences rather than levels. Section 2 presents relevant re-

sults from the literature on cointegration, which are used in our nonsta-

tionary test. Section 3 applies the method to data on bonds and stocks.

Section 4 concludes.

1.      Alternative Tests of the Present Value Relation


        One straightforward way to test the model (1) is to use it to restrict

the behavior of the variable        E     - (l/o)(Yi-O(l_cS)yti).    Substitu-

tion from (1) shows that apart from a constant (which will be suppressed

below for exposition),


(2)        =     -


From equation (2),       is the true innovation at time t in    (that is, •the

innovation with respect to the full market information set       .     is   ob-

servable knowing only       t-l'   "t-l and the parameters of the model. This

is a striking implication of the present value relation. We note that in

general the model does not identify the true innovation in

        Since the right hand side of (2) is orthogonal to all elements of the

information set 'tl' one can test the present value relation by regressing

      on information in this set and testing that the coefficients are jointly

zero. Unpredictability of          is equivalent to unpredictability of one-

period excess returns on bonds and stocks.

       An alternative approach is to use equation (1) to restrict the coeffi-

cients of a vector autoregressive system.5 This requires the choice of

variables which are stationary, have a well-behaved joint time series rep-

resentation,6 and allow all the implications of (1) to be tested.




     See Sargent [1979], Baillie, Lippens and McMahon [1983] or Ito [1985].
     These are all finite-horizon undiscounted applications.

6 In particular, they must have an invertible vector moving average (VMA)
  representation.

      If y and      are themselves stationary in levels, then a bivariate VAR

for y and        can be used. If these variables are stationary in first dif-

ferences, however, the obvious choice of a VAR for Ay and AY turns out to

be inappropriate for two reasons.         First, one cannot impose all the re'

strictions of (1) on a first-differenced VAR.          Secondly, as will be ex-

plained in the next section, under the model (1) no well-behaved VAR repre-

sentation exists for Ay and A

      Instead of first-differencing, one can subtract Oy from both sides of

equation (1). Defining             '-0" and rearranging (1), one obtains



(3) St =    ES*,      where        =
                                               Ayt÷.
                                        i1
and


(4) St =     (ó/(l-o))   EtAYt+l



      If Ay and A' are stationary, it follows from (3) and (4) that St is

stationary.B We will refer to St as the "spread". In the case of the term

structure, it is just the spread between short and long term interest

rates; for stocks, it is the difference between the stock price, and a mul-

tiple of dividends. These two equations show two alternative interpreta-

tions of the spread S: by (3) it is the optimal forecast of 5*, a weight-



 Melino [1983] and Shiller [198lb] criticized Sargent [1979] on essential-
 ly these grounds, although they did not have the benefit of the theory of
 cointegrated processes in constructing their argument. Hansen and Sar-
 gent [1981a] responded by using the long-short spread in a test of the
  expectations theory of the term structure, which is also the solution
  adopted in this paper. Hansen and Sargent used frequency domain methods
  and did not appeal to the theory of cointegration.

 (3) and (4) also show that under the model, if Ay is stationary then AY
 must be stationary.

ed average of future changes in y; by (4), it is proportional to the opti-

mal forecast of the change in Y.

      Equation (4) suggests a second regression test of the present value

relation. If           is regressed on St and other variables, the coefficient

on St should be (1-6)16 and the coefficients on the other variables should

be zero. Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz [1983] tested the expectations

theory of the term structure with a regression of this sort. In this paper

we focus primarily on equation (3) .            The restrictions of (3) can be tested

by estimating a VAR representation for                 and

called the companion matrix of the VAR. For all i,

where        is the VAR's limited information set {zz1           ), a subset of

I. As elsewhere in the paper, we are taking conditional expectations to

be linear projections on information.

        It is simple to prove that if the present value relation holds, St

must linearly Granger cause          (and therefore   must Granger cause

unless St is itself an exact linear function of current and lagged Ay.

For suppose that St does not Granger cause Ay. Then E[Ayt+.IHt] =

                       .]   for all i, and from (3) E[SIHt] =

...].     But because St is itself in the information set lit 5 =
                                                                    E[StIH]
   is an exact linear function of current and lagged Ay. This implies

that the variance-covariance matrix of alt and u2 Q, is singular.

        The intuitive explanation for this result is that S is an optimal

forecast of future values of Ay. conditional on agents' full information

set.         will therefore have incremental explanatory power for future Ay

if agents have information useful for forecasting Ay beyond the history of

that variable.     If agents do not have such information, they form      as an

exact linear function of current and lagged

        Equation (3) can be projected onto the information set      and rewrit-

ten as



         =
                      h'Az

where g' and h' are row vectors with 2p elements, all of which are zero ex-

cept for the p+l'st element of g' and the 1st element of h', which are uni-

ty. If this expression is to hold for general z (that is, for nonsingular

Q), it must be the case that

                         1=0




        The restrictions of equation (7) appear to be highly nonlinear cross-

equation restrictions of the type described by Hansen and Sargent [198lb]

as the "hallmark" of rational expectations models. However it turns out

that (7) can be simplified so that its restrictions are linear and easily

interpreted. Postmultiplying both sides of (7) by [I-oA]                       ,   one obtains



(8) g'[I—ÔA] = Bh'ÔA



        From the structure of the matrix A, the constraints imposed by (8) on

individual coefficients are c. =                            il. .   .p, d1 = 1/6   -          and d. =

-Sb.,    i=2. .   .p.•     By adding BL to S, one can interpret these restrictions.

They state that                =

       and          which is implied by equation (2). In our empirical applica-

tion, we obtain a Wald test statistic for equation (8) which is numerically

identical to the Wald test statistic for a regression of                               on lagged
and




     This interpretation of the VAR restrictions does not hold in the undis-
     counted finite-horizon VAR model of Sargent [1979]. The assumption that
     Ày and ÀY are stationary rules out rational speculative bubbles (West
     [1984], Hamilton and Whiteman [1985]), which would allow  to be unpred-
     ictable even if (1) does not hold.
'°
     However this statistic will not be numerically identical to the Wald
     statistic for a test of equation (7), even though (7) and (8) are alge-
     braically equivalent restrictions.    Nonlinear transformations of re-
     strictions can change the numerical values of Wald statistics, and as
     Gregory and Veall [1985] point out, can dramatically alter their power.
     We report Wald statistics for (8) in the tables which summarize our em-

                                                     -8-
       The major advantage of the VAR framework is that it can be used to

generate alternative measures of the economic importance, not merely the

statistical significance, of deviations from the present value relation.

To see this more clearly, suppose that the present value model is false so

that E4÷.        0 for i   1. Then equations (3) and (4) no longer hold. We

define the theoretical spread as the optimal forecast, given the informa-

tion set H. of the present value of all future changes in y:

                                      —l
(9) S'         E[S*tHt] = h6A[I-OA]        z.

We then have



(10) St - S1t     =



and


(11) St -     (ó/(l-6)) E[Y÷1IH] = (1/(1-6))     E[÷iIHt].

       Equations (10) and (11) measure deviations from the model in two dif-

ferent ways. The metric of equation (11) is the difference between St and

the optimal forecast, given the information set Ht of the one-period

change in Y. Equation (11) shows that this difference is large if excess

returns are predictable one period in advance.

       The metric of equation (10) is the difference between S and the theo-

retical spread, which is large if the present value of all future excess

returns is predictable. By this measure, a large deviation from the model

requires not only that movements in 4 be predictable one period in advance,




      pirical results, and Wald statistics for (7) in footnotes.

                                      -9-
but that they be predictable many periods in advance. Loosely speaking,

predictable excess returns must be persistent as well as variable.''

     We use the VAR framework not only to conduct statistical tests of the

present value relation, but to evaluate its failures using the metric of

equation (10). We display time series plots of the spread St and the theo-

retical spread S't. the unrestricted VAR forecast of the present value of

future changes in y.   If the present value model is true, these variables

should differ only because of sampling error. Large observed differences

in the time series movements of the two variables imply (subject to sam-

pling error) economically important deviations from the model.

     The VAR framework can also be used to test the present value model

against more specific alternatives. Volatility tests, for example, are de-

signed to test against the alternative that        or some transformation of it

"moves too much". We present two different volatility tests. The first is

just a test that the ratio Var(S)/Var(S' )    is   unity. This ratio, together

with its standard error, can be computed from the VAR system.'2 Under the

present value model, the ratio should be one, but would be larger than one

if the spread is too volatile relative to information about future y.

    We obtain a second volatility test as follows. Let us define           as   U

this ratio should be one, while the notion that stock prices are too vola-

ance ratios the "levels variance ratio" and the second the "innovations

which we now discuss.

2.      Properties of Cointegrated Vectors


        In this section we summarize the theory of cointegrated processes, and

show how it applies to present value models.


Definition (Granger and Engle [1985]). A vector x. is said to be cointe-

grated of order (d,b), denoted x CI(d,b), if (i) all components of x are

integrated of order d (stationary in d'th differences), and (ii) there ex-

ists at least one vector a ($0) such that a'x is integrated of order d-b,

b>0.



When y is stationary in first differences, the vector          x =   [ "1' is
CI(1,l) if the present value model holds. The CI(l,l) case is the one that

has been studied almost exclusively in the theoretical literature, and the




procedures, whose asymptotic standard errors will still be correct. This

is extremely useful in carrying out the VAR tests of the previous section.

In the case of stock prices, for example, the present value model con-

strains U =   tS/(l-ó),   so one can estimate the discount factor from a prelim-

inary regression and then treat it as known in testing the model.

       Two types of preliminary regression have been proposed for estimating

the unknown parameter U. The first, called the cointegrating regression by

Granger and Engle [1985], is just a regression of         on      The second is

an error-correction regression of          or AY on lagged changes in and lev-

els of y and Y. In the first case, one estimates U as the coefficient on

       while in the second case one takes the ratio of the coefficient on

lagged      to that on lagged Y.

       One might argue that use of the error-correction regression is prefer-

able because it accounts more fully for the short-run dynamics of            and

       However it has an important disadvantage. For any cointegrated vector

with two elements, there are two possible error-correction regressions, one
       One may want to conduct a formal statistical test of the hypothesis

that     is not cointegrated. This turns out to pose some difficult statis-

tical problems.     If the cointegrating vector    is known, one can use a

Dickey-Fuller test (Dickey and Fuller [1981]), regressing the change in

a'x on a constant and a single lagged level. The t statistics and F sta-

tistic are biased upwards relative to the t and F distributions, but Dickey

and Fuller provide significance levels based on a Monte Carlo study.     If

the statistics are sufficiently high, the hypothesis of no cointegration is

rejected.

       If the cointegrating vector is not known but must be estimated from a

cointegrating regression, the Dickey-Fuller significance levels need to be

further adjusted.     Granger and Engle [1985] analyze a variety of tests

which use the residual from the cointegrating regression, an estimate of

        We report two of their test statistics, one based on the Dickey-

Fuller regression and one which augments that regression with four lagged

dependent variables.    Granger and Engle provide significance levels for

these tests, again based on a Monte Carlo study. The Monte Carlo results

are based on 10,000 replications of 100 observations of independent random

walks, with 4 lagged residual changes included in the test.

3.     Testing the Model in Bond and Stock Markets


       In this section we apply the methods developed above to test present

value models for bonds and stocks. The model for bonds, usually referred

to as the "expectations theory of the term structure", is a special case of

equation (1) in which the parameters 0 and 6 are known a priori (0 equals

one, and 6 is a parameter of linearization), while the constant c is a liq-

uidity premium unrestricted by the model.'

       We test the present value model for bonds on a monthly U.S. Treasury

20-year yield series, available from 1959 to 1983 from Salomon Brothers'

Analytical Record of Yields and Yield Spreads.       The short rate used is a

1-month Treasury bill rate, obtained from the U.S.         Treasury Bulletin.

These data were previously studied in Campbell and Shiller [1984]; Shiller,

Campbell and Schoenholtz [1983] worked with very similar data. We present

empirical results both for the full sample 1959:1-1983:11, and for a short

sample ending in 1978:9 which is more likely to correspond to a single in-

terest rate regime.'5

       The present value model for stocks is a special case of equation (1)

in which B is known to equal 61(1-6). The model restricts the constant c

to be zero.    The discount factor 6 is not known a priori, but can be in-

ferred by estimating the cointegrating vector for stock prices and divi-

dends; a consistent estimate is also provided by the sample mean return on

stocks.




     The linearization required to write the expectations theory in this form
     is explained in Shiller [1979] and Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz
     [1983].
16
     For both samples, the parameter of linearization 6 is set equal to
     l/(1+R), with R at 0.0587/12 (the mean 20-year bond rate in the short
     sample, expressed at a monthly rate).

                                   -   16 -
      One difficulty with this formulation for stocks is that     and y are

not measured contemporaneous1y. " is a beginning-of-period stock price

and      is paid some time within period t. Literal application of the meth-

ods outlined in section 1 would require us to assume that y is known to

the market at the start of period t; but this might lead us to a spurious

rejection of the model if in fact y is only known at the start of period

t+l. Intuitively, it is not hard to "predict" excess returns using ex post

information.    In order to avoid this problem, we modify the procedures of

section 1 by constructing a variable SL E Yt-OYtl. We use this variable

in our tests and alter the cross-equation restrictions appropriately. The

dependent variables in the VAR are now SL and Ay1, both of which are in

the information set at the start of time t but not at the start of time t-l

under our conservative assumption about the market's information.'7 Since

SLt =     + OAy it is of course stationary if St and Ay are.

      We test the model for stocks using time series data for real annual

prices and dividends on a broad stock index from 1871 to 1986. Y is the

Standard and Poor Composite Stock Price Index for January, divided by the

January producer price index scaled so that the 1967 producer price index

equals 100.    (Before 1900 an annual average producer price index is used).

The nominal dividend series is, starting in 1926, dividends per share ad-

justed to index, four quarter total, for the Standard and Poor Composite

Index.    The nominal dividend before 1926 is taken from Cowles [19391, who

extended the Standard and Poor series back in time. ' Finally,        is the

     Engle and Watson [1985] do some similar regressions to ours, using a
     similar data set on stock prices and dividends. They use the variable S
     rather than SL; their results differ from ours in that they find no evi-
     dence of Granger causality from S to Ay, but they do not reject the
     present value model more strongly than we do.

nominal dividend series, divided by the annual average producer price index

scaled so that the 1967 producer price index equals 100.

     We begin in Tables lÀ and 18 by running cointegrating and error-cor-

rection regressions to try to identify the parameter 6 from the data. ' In

the case of the term structure, the expectations theory imposes 6=1, but it

is of interest to see whether the data deliver an estimate close to this

number.

     The estimates of 6 in Table lÀ are not particularly close to those im-

plied by the expectations theory. The cointegrating regression estimates 6

to be 0.735 in the short sample, and 0.854 in the full sample.2' The error-

correction regression gives imprecise estimates of 6 which are larger than

unity.

     Granger and Engle's [1985] tests for cointegration, based on the resi-

dual from the cointegrating regression, yield ambiguous results. Their

statistic is the t statistic on the lagged residual in a regression with




" The dividend data differ slightly from those used in Shiller [1981],
   West [1984], Mankiw, Romer and Shapiro [1985] and others. It has re-
   cently come to our attention that the second, 1939 edition of Cowles'
   book contains some corrections to the dividend series presented in the
  original 1938 edition, and these corrections are incorporated here.

' Standard errors in these and all subsequent tables are White's [1984]
   heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. However the statistics
  used to test for cointegration do not correct for heteroskedasticity, as
  the Monte Carlo studies which generated their significance levels did
  not do so. Variance ratios are also unconditional variances which ig-
  nore heteroskedasticity. There is generally little difference between
  White's standard errors and the ordinary ones in our regressions.

20 The standard errors reported for these coefficients are very small; the
  short sample estimate is 10 standard errors from one, while the full
  sample estimate is 6 standard errors from one. However these standard
  errors are not corrected for serial correlation in the cointegrating re-
  gression residual, and thus are likely to be far too small. Also the
  coefficients and standard errors in the cointegrating regression suffer
  from finite-sample bias as Stock [1984] points out.

the change in the residual as the dependent variable and a constant and the

lagged residual as independent variables. Their 4.      statistic   is the t sta-

tistic on the lagged residual in a regression which adds four lagged chang-

es in the residual to the previous regression as independent variables.

Both statistics fail to reject the null of no cointegration at the 10% lev-

el in the short sample, and only the 2 statistic rejects at this level in

the full sample.

      These weak results may be due to loss of power when the cointegrating

vector is estimated rather than imposed. Dickey and Fuller's [1981] I1

statistic is the F statistic for joint significance of the coefficients in

a regression of the change in a series on a constant and the lagged level

of the series. When we set B =    1   and use the 11 statistic to test for sta-

tionarity of the spread, we find that we can reject the null that the

spread follows a random walk at the 5% level in both sample periods. This

evidence encourages us to proceed, imposing U equal to one.

       In Table lB we estimate the cointegrating vector for the data on stock

prices and dividends. The cointegrating regression estimates U at 31.092;

the corresponding real discount rate (the reciprocal of B) is 3.2%, which

is lower than the average dividend-price ratio and considerably lower than

the sample mean return of 8.2%.21 The error-correction regression delivers

a fairly similar estimate of 0, 37.021 with an implied real discount rate

of 2.7%.    Granger and Engle's tests for no cointegration give mixed re-


21
     The 0 estimate which corresponds to the sample mean return is 12.195.
     The higher estimate in the cointegrating regression is associated with a
     negative constant term; under the present value model, the constant
     should be proportional to the unconditional mean change in dividends, so
     it should be positive rather than negative. An estimated discount rate
     lower than the mean dividend-price ratio is consistent with the model
     only if dividends are expected to decline through time, the historical
     rise being due to sampling error.

suits; the 2 statistic rejects at the 5% level, while the         statistic

narrowly fails to reject at the 10% level. We proceed to construct SL us-

ing discount rates of 8.2% and 3.2% as a check on the robustness of our

methods.

     In Table 2A we report summary statistics for a VAR test of the expec-

tations theory of the term structure. The VAR includes Ay and St as vari-

ables, and the number of lags is chosen by the Akaike Information Criterion

(AIC).22 VARs are estimated for the short sample 1959-78, and the full sam-

pie 1959-83; they have 11 and 6 lags respectively.

     In both sampie periods the lagged variables have a fair degree of ex-

planatory power for the change in short rates. The R2 for the Ay equation

is 21.6% in the short sample, and 17.1% in the full sample. This argues

against the view of Mankiw and Miron [1985] that short rate changes are es-

sentially unpredictable in the postwar period in the U.S.      Furthermore,

there is strong evidence that spreads Granger cause short rate changes as

they should do if the expectations theory is true. The hypothesis of no

Granger causality can be rejected at the 0.01% level for the short sample

and the 0.3% level for the full sample. Short rate changes also Granger

cause spreads, although the significance levels are somewhat weaker at 0.3%

and 1.3% respectively.

     A formal test of the expectations theory restrictions in equation (8)

(which are just the restrictions of equation (2)) rejects very strongly.

The null that excess returns on long bonds are unpredictable can be reject-



22 That is, we pick the number of lags to minimize [ - in likelihood + num-
   ber of parameters] in the vector autoregression. Sawa [1978] has argued
   that the AIC tends to choose models of higher order than the true model,
  but states that the bias is negligible when p<T/lO as it is here. The
  test statistics in Tables 2A and 28 are not highly sensitive to small
   changes in the lag length of the VAR system.

ed at less than the 0.005% level in the short sample, and at the 0.03% lev-

el in the full sample. The corresponding R2 values for excess returns are

26.3% and 16.7% respectively.23

     However this negative result for the model is softened by the results

of two further exercises. First, a test of the innovations variance equal-

ity (12) does not reject. Table 2A reports the innovations variance ratio,

along with an asymptotic standard error for this number. If the ratio is

greater than one, long-term bond returns "move too much". We find that the

ratio is 1.160 in the short sample but only 0.502 in the long sample, and

in both samples the asymptotic standard error is very large.24

     Secondly, when we use the VAR to informally evaluate the model, we

find that the model has considerable ability to explain the time series

movements of the spread.     In the short sample the standard deviations of

the spread 5' and the unrestricted VAR forecast of short rate changes S'.,

are very close at 1.060 and 1.067 respectively. The two variables have a

high correlation of 0.978.    In the long sample the spread appears to move

too much; its standard deviation is 1.320, while the standard deviation of

the unrestricted forecast is only 0.717. However the two variables still

have a high correlation of 0.956. A plot following the tables illustrates

the comovement of St and S' in the short sample.25



23 Nonlinear Wald tests of equation (7) reject at significance levels of
   less than 0.005% in the short sample, and 8.4% in the full sample.

' Runkle [1984] also finds large asymptotic standard errors on variance
   decompositions from VAR models.

   The high correlation of these variables in postwar U.S. data might also
   have been inferred from results in Modigliani and Shiller [1973] (see
   particularly figure 6). Despite the evidence reported in Modigliani and
   Shiller and in the present paper, one of us (Shiller [1979]) presented
   evidence suggesting that long-term interest rates are too volatile to
   accord with the expectations theory. By contrast with Modigliani and
                                     -   21 -
    These results suggest that tests of predictability of returns are

highly sensitive to deviations from the expectations theory; they are so

sensitive, in fact, that they may obscure some of the merits of the theory.

An example illustrates the point. Suppose long and short rates differ from

                                                      =
the expectations theory in the following manner:            + w,   where

is serially uncorrelated noise. As Campbell and Shiller [1984] point out,

a regression of       on S may find that the coefficient has the opposite

sign to that predicted by (4), even if the variance of w is quite small.

In our data, as reported in Table 2A, we find that this regression delivers

the wrong sign in both sample periods. However a regression of        on St

will find that the coefficient has the same sign as predicted by (3), and

downward bias caused by w will be small if the variance of w is small.

Moreover the innovations variance ratio Var()/Var(C) may not be much

greater than one. In this example the metric of equation (10) reveals the

strengths of the expectations theory which are obscured by the metric of

equation (11)26

     In Table 2B we repeat the above exercises for stock prices and divi-

dends. We work with one sample period, but two discount rates. The Akaike

Criterion selects a 4-lag representation for the data when the sample mean

discount rate 8.2% is used, and a 2-lag representation when the cointegrat-

ing regression discount rate 3.2% is used.




   Shiller and the present paper, Shiller [1979] assumed that levels of
   short rates are stationary, an assumption more clearly appropriate for
  prewar data sets.

26 We do not claim that this example is literally correct for our data.
   The model SS'+w can be tested, for any MA(q) process for w, by regress-
   ing   on information known q+2 periods earlier. We found that this test
   rejected the model for q up to 8 using the bond data for 1959-78.

                                  -   22 -
          The VAR estimates suggest that dividend changes are rather highly pre-

     dictable; the R2 values for the equations which explain them are around

     40%. There is very strong evidence that price-dividend differences Granger

     cause dividend changes, which is what one would expect if there is any

     truth to the present value model for stock prices.

          We conduct two formal tests of the model. The first restricts the

     mean of the price-dividend difference, while the second leaves the mean un-

     constrained and restricts only the dynamics of the variable.    (In the case

     of the term structure, the mean spread is always unconstrained because we

     allow a constant risk premium).

          The results of •these tests include some statistical rejections at con-

     ventional significance levels, but they are not nearly as strong as the re-

     jections in the term structure. The pattern of results is sensitive to the

-.
     choice of discount rate. When the sample mean return is used, the mean re-

     striction on SL is satisfied almost exactly. Therefore the test of only

     the dynamic restrictions in equation (8) rejects more strongly, at the 4.7%

     level as compared with the 7.2% level for the full set of restrictions.

     When the discount rate from the cointegrating regression is used, the com-

     plete set of restrictions is rejected at the 1.1% level while the signifi-

     cance level for the dynamic restrictions is only 21.8%.27

         These tests are "portmanteau" tests of the present value model against

     an unspecified alternative. We also present variance ratios in order to

     test against the specific alternative that stock prices "move too much" in

     levels or innovations. The point estimate of the levels variance ratio




     27 Nonlinear Wald tests of the dynamic restrictions in the form (7), rather
       than (8), reject at less than the 0.005% level for the 8.2% discount
        rate, and at the 7.3% level for the 3.2% discount rate.

                                       - 23   -
Var(SLt)/Var(SL') is dramatically different from unity, at 68.91, when the

sample mean discount rate is used. Unsurprisingly the variance ratio is

smaller when future dividend changes are discounted at the lower rate esti-

mated by the cointegrating regression, but it is still considerable at

4.76. However the asymptotic standard errors on these ratios are huge, and

one cannot reject the hypothesis that both of them equal unity.

     The innovations variance ratios Var(t)/Var(t') are also estimated

larger than unity, and here the standard errors are less extreme.     In the

sample mean discount rate case, one can reject at the 5% level the hypothe-

sis that the innovation variance ratio is unity; it is estimated to be

11.27, with a standard error of 4.49. With the lower discount rate, the

ratio is estimated at 1.41, with a standard error of 0.44.

     Plots of the price-dividend difference and the unrestricted VAR fore-

cast of dividend changes give a visual image of these variance results. At

an 8.2% discount rate, SL and SL' are negatively correlated and the ex-

cess volatility of stock prices is very dramatic. At a 3.2% discount rate

SLt and SL' have a correlation of 0.911 and the excess volatility is much

less dramatic. For both discount rates however, a regression of          on

SLt gives a coefficient estimate with a negative sign rather than the posi-

tive sign implied by the present value model.

     To compare our results on volatility with results using earlier meth-

ods, we also computed sample values of S* using two alternative terminal

conditions: S*T=O and S*T=ST, where T is the last observation in our sam-

ple. We computed         analogously. Equation (3) implies cs(S*) >    o(S)
and a(SL*t) >            For the bond data in the period 1959-78, a(S*) =
                o(SL).
1.269 for S*,,0 or 1.217 for S*TST, while        = 1.060 so the inequality




                                  -   24   -
is satisfied. For the stock data at an 8.2% discount rate,    a(SL) = 3.837
for SL*T=O or 7.928 for               while o(SLt) = 15.506 so the inequality

is sharply violated. The inequality is again satisfied by the stock data

at a 3.2% discount rate, where o(SL*t) = 11.207 or 12.888 and o(SLt) =

9. 937.

      Following Scott [1985], we also regressed        on S and a constant.

If the present value model is true, the coefficient on St should be one.

The same holds for the corresponding regression with SL*t and SL. For

bonds in 1959-78, we estimated the coefficient at 0.77 for S*T0 or 0.81

for 5T5T' for stocks at an 8.2% discount rate we estimated it at -0.06

for SL*T=O or 0.16 for SL*T=SLT, while for stocks at a 3.2% discount rate

we estimated it at -0.01 or 0.02. Thus the results using S*t and SL*t gen-

erally support the conclusion that the present value model for bonds fits

the data comparatively well, whereas the model for stocks has a poor fit

even though it cannot be rejected statistically at high levels of confi-

dence.

      We close with two caveats about the plots and summary statistics gen-

erated by the VAR system. First, we do not have standard error bands for

the plotted VAR forecast or its correlation with the spread. The very high

asymptotic standard errors for the levels variance ratios, however, indi-

cate that the VAR forecast is not precisely estimated.2B Thus the favorable

visual impression created by a high correlation between the spread and the

VAR forecast may be due to chance rather than to real merits of the present




20 We found further evidence for this when we examined other data sets. In
   one annual data set on postwar U.S. interest rates, we found that the
   correlation between S and 5' was negative. In this case short-run move-

     Secondly, the VAR simulation method may be misleading if the wrong

value of B is chosen so that the spread variable is nonstationary. For ex-

ample, if U is chosen too large, the movements of St are dominated by the

movements of -By .   The VAR results are then approximately those which one
                t
would get if one regressed Ay and Uy on lagged values of these vari-

ables. It is well known that in finite samplesestimates of autoregressive

parameters for nonstationary variables are biased downwards, and this prob-

lem will afflict the VAR if U is too large.

     In a simple case where      follows an AR-l process with a unit root,

and the VAR includes one lag only, one can show that the estimated VAR com-

panion matrix will have first column zero and second column [(1-p)/U p1',

where p is a downward biased estimate of the unit root. This companion ma-

trix satisfies the restrictions of equation (9) almost exactly, whatever

the behavior of the variable Y. A symptom of this misspecification would

be that mean returns would not obey the model, even though the dynamics of

returns would appear to satisfy the restrictions.

     It is possible that a problem of this sort affects our results for the

stock market when we use a low 3.2% discount rate corresponding to a high B

of 31.092. The cointegrating regression which generates this U estimate -

a regression of the level of Y on the level of y -           is   dominated by the

enormous postwar hump in stock prices. Since this hump coincided with a

much milder hump in real dividends, the regression estimates a coefficient

for y which is much larger than the historical average price-dividend ra-

tio. The negative intercept prevents the fitted value from overpredicting

Y over the sample period as a whole.           As a result, over the bulk of the




                                  -   26   -
 sample period, the spread SL is distinctly negatively correlated with the

 lagged dividend.29 The VAR estimates place considerable weight on this ear-

 lier part of the sample period, because the dividend equation is specified

in terms of dividend changes which are more variable before 1946. Thus the

high correlation of SLt and SL't may be to some extent spurious. The re-

gression of SL* on SL by contrast, is a levels regression which is domi-

nated by the postwar hump in stock prices; in this regression we find the

coefficient to be essentially zero rather than one as required by the mod-

el.




29 Over the period 1871 to 1946, the spread has a correlation of -0.7 with
   the lagged dividend when U is set equal to 31.092.

4.   Conclusions


     In this paper we have shown how a present value model may be tested

when the variables of the model follow linear stochastic processes which

are stationary in first differences rather than in levels. If the present

value model is true, a linear combination of the variables is stationary.

The paper draws on the theory of cointegrated processes to estimate this

linear combination or spread and test the model.

     We also propose an informal method for evaluating the "fit" of a pres-

ent value model. A VAR is used to construct an optimal unrestricted fore-

cast, and this is compared with a restricted forecast from the model. We

compute the standard deviations and correlation of the two forecasts, and

plot their historical movements.

     We apply our methods to the controversial present value models for

stocks and bonds. We find that both models can be rejected statistically

at conventional significance levels, with much stronger evidence for bonds.

However in our data set the spread between long and short term interest

rates seems to move quite closely with the present value of expected short

rate changes. Deviations from the present value model for bonds do not ap-

pear to be highly persistent.      In contrast, our evaluation of the present

value model for stocks indicates that the spread between stock prices and

dividends moves too much, and that deviations from the present value model

are quite persistent, although the strength of the evidence for this de-

pends sensitively on the discount rate assumed in the test.
