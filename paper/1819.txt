                       Job   Duration, Seniority, and Earnings

                                       ABSTRACT

      The stylized fact that seniority and earnings in a cross-section are

positively related, even after controlling for total labor market experience,

has served as the basis for theoretical analyses of implicit labor contracts

suggesting that workers post bonds in the form of deferred compensation in

order to ensure their continued performance at an adequate level. An

alternative interpretation is that good workers or workers in good jobs or

good matches both earn more throughout the job and have longer job durations.

Another stylized fact, that labor market experience and earnings in a cross

section are positively related, has been taken as evidence of the importance

of general human capital accumulation. An alternative interpretation of this

evidence is that workers with more experience have had more time to find good

jobs and/or good matches, resulting in higher earnings.

      Earnings functions are estimated including a measure of the completed

duration of jobs in order to distinguish between the competing hypotheses

regarding both seniority and experience. These yield three main results.

First, workers in longer jobs earn significantly more in every year of the job

than do workers in shorter jobs. Second, controlling for completed job

duration eliminates most of the apparent return to seniority found in standard

cross—section models. Thus, it appears that implicit contracts that provide

for workers posting bonds through deferred wage payments are less important

than has been believed. Third, for blue collar workers there is evidence that

a part of the small observed (cross—sectional) return to labor market

experience is due to sorting of workers into better jobs over time. There is

no evidence of sorting for white collar workers.

 I.   Introduction and Theoretical Background

       An important stylized fact of the labor market is that workers with

 longer seniority have higher earnings even after controlling for total labor

market experience. The empirical support for this stylized fact is that

standard earnings functions estimated using cross—section data produce

significant positive seniority coefficients even when a measure of total labor

market experience is also included in the regression.

       The standard explanations for this positive correlation posit the

existence of implicit employment contracts under which earnings grow with time

on the job in order to provide workers with appropriate incentives regarding

turnover and/or effort. For examp1e, if a job involves investment in firm—

specific training then it may be optimal for workers and employers to

structure implicit employment agreements such that compensation is deferred

until late in the job so that workers will not quit (taking their specific

capital with them)) In effect, the worker is posting a bond to ensure

continued employment. Another possible motivation for such a deferral

arrangement exists where effort is important. Having the worker post a bond

through a deferral of compensation provides the worker with an incentive to

exert the appropriate level of effort on the job. A worker who left or whose

performance fell below agreed—upon standards and in consequence was fired




    1. See Becker (1964) and Mincer (1974) for discussions of investment in
firm specific training. Mincer and Jovanovic (1981) present an an analysis of
the relationships among seniority, mobility, and earnings that relies on
investment in specific human capital.
                                      2


would lose the bond that he or she had posted under a deferred wage contract.2

      The firm-specific human capital explanation and incentive wage deferral

explanations differ in their implications regarding the relationship between

earnings and productivity growth over the work life.3 However, they share the

implication not only that the seniority earnings profile will be upward

sloping but that there will also be a positive return to seniority even after

controlling for total labor nu.rket experience, in other words, the theories

in;ly that seniority produces earnings growth in excess of the earnings groch

associated with labor market experience.

      As stated above, the empirical support for these views of the labor

market rests entirely on cross—sectional earnings function estimates.

However, the positive cross—sectional association between seniority and

earnings does not in fact imply that earnings rise with seniority. An

alternative interpretation of the cross—sectional evidence is that workers who

have been on their jobs for a long time started out earning more. In this

case, despite the fact that earnings are fixed over the course of a job, a

standard earnings function regression will yield a positive seniority

coefficient.

      It is in fact reasonable to suspect that the cross—sectional evidence is

contaminated in this way. Some workers may be both more stable and more

productive than others.4 Some employers may choose to pay higher wages than




    2. See Viscusi (1980), Becker and Stigler (1974) and Lazear (1979) for
models in which wage deferral provides this sort of incentive for workers.
    3. Medoff and Abraham (1980, 1981) and Abraham and Medoff (1982) offer
evidence on the relationship between seniority-related earnings growth and
seniority—related productivity growth.
    4. Indeed, to the extent that there are turnover and training costs,
stability p se can raise an employee's value to the firm.
                                       3



 others, so that workers are unlikely to leave them.5 Finally, some worker/job

 matches may be better than others, in the sense that the worker is more

 productive In those Matches than in other possible matches, so that the match

 is less likely to be broken off.6 It Is quite plausible, then, that high

 quality workers, jobs, and matches will be associated with both higher wages

 and longer job duration. To the extent that worker, job, and/or match quality

 are unmeasured, they represent omitted variables In a cross—section earnings

 regression. Since those spells in any cross—sectjon sample of spells in

 progress that have long durations to date are more likely to be spells that

 will ultimately last a long time (so that seniority will be positively

 correlated with completed job duration) and completed job duration Is

positively correlated with any omitted worker, job, and/or match quality

measures, seniority In a cross—section will also be positively correlated with

these omitted quality measures. The result is an upward bias in the estimated

seniority coefficient in cross—section earnings functions.

      A primary goal of the empirical analysis in this study is to distinguish

between the competing hypotheses regarding the relationships among job

seniority, completed job duration, and earnings that imply a positive cross—

sectional relationship between seniority and earnings. The results of this

analysis shed light on the various theoretical models that have been adduced

to explain the pattern of earnings over the worklife.

      A second and related stylized fact of the labor market is that in a



    5. The efficiency wage literature suggests various possible reasons why
some employers mlght pay higher wages than others to workers of equal quality.
These include differences in the costs of turnover, differences in the costs
of monitoring worker shirking, and differences in the value of worker loyalty.
Shapiro and StiglItz (1984) and Bulow and Summers (1985) present formal
efficiency wage models; Yellen (1984) and Stiglitz (1984) survey the
literature.

heterogeneous match quality.

cross—section of individuals, workers with more total years of labor market

experience have higher earnings. The standard explanation for this positive

association is that general labor market experience raises workers' on—the--job

productivity, which translates into higher earnings (Becker, 1964; Mincer,

1974; crown, 1983). An alternative view of the positive association between

experience and earnings stresses the fact that those with more experience have

had more time to find a good job and/or a good match.7 If sorting into better

jobs and/or better matches over time is an empirically important phenomenon,

it could lead to a strong positive association between experience and earnings

even in the absence of any experience—related growth in productivity.

      Note that If sorting over time of workers into better jobs is an

important phenomenon, then there ought to be a positive correlation between

labor market experience at the start of a job and completed duration of the

job. In order to make this clear, consider a simple model where workers

sample at set intervals from a stable wage offer distribution. Workers change

jobs when the wage associated with the latest draw from the wage offer

distribution exceeds their current wage. It Is straightforward to show that,

as time goes by and workers are In successively higher paying jobs, the

probability of receiving an offer that dominates the best offer to date will

fall. The result will be a positive relationship between initial experience

and job duration.

      On the basis of these arguments, another goal of the empirical analysis

Is to distinguish between the competing hypotheses regarding the relationships

among experience, job duration, and earnings that imply a positive cross—

sectiona1 relationship between experience and earnings. This analysis will




   7. This argument was pointed out to us by Robert Topel. See Burdett
(1978) and Jovanovic (1979).

 shed light on the extent to which there is support for the general human

 capital accumulation theory as opposed to the job sorting theory.8

       An intuitively appealing approach to dealing with bias in the estimated

 return to seniority in the cross—section is to control for the completed

 length of the job in the earnings equation.9 After all, by the argument given

above, the seniority coefficient is biased only because seniority is

correlated with job duration, which in turn is correlated with omitted worker,

job and/or match quality. Section II develops a simple stochastic model of

earnings determination that provides a basis for this approach. Moreover, if

completed job duration Is a proxy —— even an imperfect proxy ——   for   job and/or

match quality and more experienced workers do sort themselves into better jobs

and/or better matches, one might expect that controlling for completed job

duration in the earnings equation should remove at least part of the positive

search component in the estimated return to labor market experience. The

model contained In section II provides a more formal basis for this intuition

as well.

      In section III we construct a completed job duration measure for use in

cross—section earnings equations, using a pooled time—series cross—section

sample of nonunion males from the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics

(PSID). The analysis requires a panel data set, since information on how long

people end up staying on their jobs is needed. While not all of the jobs we

observe end during the period over which the panel is followed, there is some

information available on ultimate durations of all jobs. Even for jobs still

in progress at the end of the sample period, we know that completed job



    8. Our results also have implications for a third model of the return to
experience presented in a recent paper, Harris and Hoinstrom (1982).
    9. Altonji and Shakotko (1985) address the issue of bias in cross—section
estimates of the return to seniority empirically, using an instrumental
variables approach.
                                       6



duration is at least as long as the last observed tenure on the job. This

information is used to predict the completed duration of these matches in the

context of a parametric model of job duration estimated separately for

nonunion professional, technical and managerial employees and for nonunion

blue collar employees; results for a nonunion sample spanning all occupations

are presented for comparison purposes. One interesting finding emerging from

this piece of the analysis Is that additional prior experience increases the

expected length of a new blue collar job, but not the expected length of a new

professional, technical or managerial job.

      In section IV we augment standard earnings functions with our job

duration measure. Because there Is reason to think that the wage

determination process operates differently for workers in different labor

market segments, these earnings equations are estimated separately for

nonunion professional, technical and managerial employees and for nonunion

blue collar workers. Results for a nonunion sample spanning all occupations

are again presented primarily f or comparison purposes. Three issues are

addressed with these estimates. The first issue Is the extent to which

earnings are higher in jobs that end up lasting longer. Our results on this

issue are quite straightforward: workers who are in long jobs earn higher pay

in every year on the job. The second issue is the relative importance of the

"direct" effects of seniority versus omitted person, job and/or match quality

in producing the observed cross—sectional positive correlation between

seniority and earnings. We find that most of the apparent cross-section

return to seniority reflects omitted variable bias. The final issue is the

extent to which the observed positive correlation between experience and

earnings reflects the sorting of' more experienced workers into better jobs

and/or better matches. Our results suggest that more experienced blue collar

workers earn more in part because they are in better jobs and/or better
                                            7



 matches. There is no evidence of such sorting for professional, technical,

 and managerial workers.

         Section V contains an overview of the results and offers a few

 concluding observations.



 II. Completed Job Duration in the Earnings Function

        We turn now to a simple model of the relationships among current job

 tenure, pre—job experience, individual—, job— and match—specific earnings

 components, and completed job duration. This model Illustrates two major

points. First, under the assumptions of the model, the estimated return to

tenure In standard cross—section earnings equations is biased upwards and the

estimated return to experience reflects both returns to experience   se and
returns to search. Second, again under the assumptions of the model,

controlling for completed job duration eliminates the bias In the estimated

return to seniority and removes part of the search component in the estimated

return to experience.10

        Suppose that the earnings of a particular worker on a particular job at

a point in time can be written:

        (1)   lnW1 =    S1       ÷ 2EXP1J +
                                                '11j
                                                       +

where

              W =     hourly   earnings,

              S =     current   seniority (tenure),

              EXP =   pre—job experience,
                =     a person/job specific error term representing the excess

                      of earnings enjoyed by this person on this job over and




    10. A more detailed derivation of the results reported in this section of
the paper can be found in Appendix A.

                           above the earnings that could be expected by a randomly

                           selected person/job combination,

                   =       is   a person/job/time—period specific error term,

               i =         index of individuals,

               j
                   =       index of jobs,
               t =         index of years within jobs, and
                       =   parameters of interest.
For simplicity of exposition, other factors that might Influence earnings are

omitted from the theoretical discussion and all variables are assumed to be

measured as deviations from their means. In this formulation, liii captures

the net influence of three unobservables on hourly earnings: unobserved

person quality, unobserved job quality and unobserved match quality.11 The

error p.. is assumed to be fixed over the course of a job and may be

correlated with S and EXP. The error                 is assumed to be orthogonal to S,

EXP and p.

      In practice, earnings functions are generally estimated using cross—

section data and            is not observable. The earnings function contained in

equation (1) as ordinarily implemented in a cross—section can be rewritten as

      (2)
               lnW                    + 2EXP1 + vet.
The error term (v..) is defined in terms of the underlying stochastic

structure as

      (3)
               v1 P1j +
Thus, the person/job specific component of the error (j..)           is   omitted from the

equation. Note that there is only a single cross—sectional observation on any

individual i or job j        in a   cross-section.



    11. A brief discussion of a more general model that allows for separate
person and job/match components is presented below in the text; a more
detailed discussion can be found in Appendix A.
                                                         9


             How does omitting j., from equation (2) affect the estimated values of

          and 2 This depends on the correlations between p., and the variables

    S.. and EXP1,. As was argued above, good workers or workers in good jobs or

    good matches are likely both to stay on the job longer and to earn more money.

    In a cross—section of workers, those with high current seniority are more

    likely to be in long jobs, so that observed senirity and completed job

    duration will be positively correlated; there will thus be a positive

    correlation between observed seniority and p... One would therefore expect

    estimated from ecruation (2) to be an upward biased estimate of
                                                                                    .    In
    addition, because those workers with more pre-job experience have had more

    chances to find a good job or good match and because good jobs or good matches

    are likely to pay higher wages, there will be a positive correlation in a

    cross—section between j        .    and   EXP. ..   This means that       estimated from
                                  ij             13                       2
equation (2) is likely to be an upward biased estimate of 2' the returns to

experience pse.

           These potential biases can be stated more precisely. Suppose that the

completed duration of jobs is positively correlated with p.. so that the

following relationship holds:

           (4) D. .
                 13
                      = Y.    + .
                         ij            13

where D., is the completed length of the current job, p.. is as defined above,

'    is   a parameter which summarizes the relationship between D and p, and E.

captures the variation in completed job duration that cannot be linked to the

earnings advantage associated with worker, job and/or match quality.                      Suppose
further that workers with more pre—job experience are likely to have found

better jobs and/or better matches. One simple approximation to such a

relationship is

           (5) p. . = aEXP,   .   + $.

                                       10


where ji and EX? are as defined above, a Is a parameter that summarizes the

relationship between ji and EXP and 4.. is the variation in jt not

systematically related to EXP.12 e assume that pre—job experience is not

correlated with completed job duration except insofar as more experienced

workers are more likely to have found a good job and/or a good match, so that

E(EXP..*z) Is zero.13 If each year of any given job is equally likely to be

represented in the cross—section samp1e of observations used to estimate the

earnings function, then on average the observed seniority on the job will be

halfway through the job. More formally,

        (6)    E(Sjjt) =   1/2
and

        (7)    S1 = 1/2 D. + ijt'
where         Is a random variable with zero mean. The distribution of      will

vary depending upon the completed length of the job. However, its mean is

always zero, as Is cov(J.11jj.) cov(Dj.jjt) and cov(EXPijt..t).

Applying the standard bias formula to the seniority coefficient in equation

(2) estimated from cross-sectional data and simplifying yields

        (8) E(1)_1=(l/2)*(l/DET1)*Y*var(EXP1)*var(41)
which is positive provided y (the coefficient summarizing the relationship

between D and i) is positive.

        The expected value of the pre—job experience coefficient in equation (2)

estimated from cross—sectional data exceeds 2' the return to experience p

se. The difference between the two Is




    12. It should be emphasized that equations (4) and (5) are not structural
equations but simply summarize the relationships expected in cross-section
data.
      13. The consequences of relaxing this assumption are discussed briefly at
                                                   11



         (9) E(2)_2=(1/DET1)*
                                                                               +
                            ta*var(EXP1j)*(var(Sijt) —           l/4*var(D1)       l/4*var(E1)}].
which is also positive so long as a (the coefficient summarizing the

relationship between EXP1J and p) is positive.

        An Intuitively appealing approach to removing the just—noted upward

biases is to control explicitly for the completed length of jobs. After all,

the tenure coefficient in equation (2) is biased only because S1 is

associated with             indirectly through U1.. Moreover, equation (4) suggests

that D11 may be useful more generally as a proxy for                           so that Introducing
                                                                       j.,
D1 into the earnings equation might remove at least part of the search

component In the experience coefficient estimated from a cross—section.

Augmenting equation (2) by adding                      as an explanatory variable in a cross—

section yields the following specification:



where
        (10) lnW1 =
        €,   Is
                            ijt    +

                  the estimating equation error. Using the relationships in

equations (3) and (4), this error is

        (11)            =   _(l/y)*E    +
                                            1ijt
        How does introducing D.. into the earnings equation affect the estimated

tenure and experience coefficients? The bias in the tenure coefficient in the

augmented equation (10) model estimated using a cross—section can be shown to

equal zero. intuitively, even though completed job duration (U1.) is an

imperfect proxy for the omitted job/person/match quality variable ()                          in
equation (2), seniority (S±jt) is correlated with ij only through its

 equation (10) Model estimated using a cross—section and 2 equals

 This is still positive so long as a is positive, though comparison of equation

 (12) against equation (9) reveals that introducing     into the earnings

 equation reduces the difference. Note that the expected value of the search

 component in 2 falls to zero as var(.) falls to zero, that is, as
                                                                        D.
becomes a better proxy for p...

      There are at least two obvious ways in which the model presented here

might be generalized. First, one might believe that more experienced (older)

workers are simply more stable than less experienced (younger) workers and

allow experience to have a direct positive relationship with completed job

duration that is not reflected in higher earnings once experience is

controlled for. In more formal terms, the expected value of
                                                              EXP1*c1 could
be positive. This generalization In no way affects our conclusions concerning

the seniority coefficient; the standard cross—section estimate of       is still

biased upward, and this bias is eliminated by including a measure of completed

job duration in the regression. The condition

      (13)   cov(D1..)/var(D1.) >    cov(EXPj.jj)/cov(ExPi..n.j)
is sufficient for the experience coefficient in the standard cross—section

earnings equation to be an upward biased estimate of the returns to experience

    me and for introducing completed job duration into the earnings equation

to reduce but not eliminate this bias.

      A second generalization of the base model is to relax the assumption

that individual—, job-, and match—specific earnings components all have the

same incremental association with job duration. In a more general

specification in which earnings increments associated with unobserved

individual characteristics have a different relationship to job duration than

those attributable to job/match characteristics, equation (4) would be
                                           13


 rewritten as

       (14)       D.. =      +        +

 where p.   is   the earnings increment attributable to unobserved individual

 differences,         is the earnings Increment attributable to unobserved

 job/match characteristics,          captures the variation in completed job

 duration that Cannot be linked to the earnings advantage associated wilth

 either worker or job/match heterogeneity, I index individuals, and j indexes

 jobs. The parameters        and      represent the relationships of Individual, and

job/match characteristics respectively with job duration, and they are both

assumed to be positive. Experience would affect job/match specific attributes

but not (fixed) Individual attributes, so equation (5) would be rewritten in

terms of B. Once again, generalizing the model in this way does not affect

our conclusions concerning bias In the seniority coefficient; the standard

cross—section estimate of          is still biased upward, and this bias is

eliminated by including a measure of completed job duration in the regression.

With regard to the estimated effect of experience, as long as the condition

      (15) var(1.) +             — y )*var(j    )   0

is satisfied, the experience coefficient in the standard cross—section

earnings function Is an upward biased estimate of         and introducing completed
job duration into the model reduces the upward bias.

      In sum, our theoretical analysis suggests that, under a reasonable set

of assumptions, controlling for the completed duration of the job in a

standard Cross—section earnings equation can: 1) eliminate the upward bias in

the tenure coefficient associated with the failure to consider individual, job

and/or match specific earnings components and 2) remove at least part of the

search component in the experience coefficient arising from the same source.

On this basis, the approach we adopt in the empirical analysis is to develop a

measure of completed job duration using longitudinal data and use this measure

In estimating a standard earnings function.

      As a final note, it should be stated that we put no structural

interpretation on the estimated completed job duration coefficient In earnings

functions like equation (10). The relationship between completed job duration

and earnings is certan1y simultaneous. There is a large literature that

estimates turnover probabilities (essentially an inverse measure of job

durztin) as a function of wage rates.'4 Another way of thinking about the

approach taken here is that the earnings function In equation (1) is the

reduced form for one equation in a two equation earnings/duration model. it

is precisely this reduced form that is of interest here, but the coefficient

estimates are biased by the omitted quality measure (ii).   Thus, we include job

duration in the earnings function precisely because it is correlated with the

person, job, and/or match quality component of the error that most would argue

is the source of any "simultaneity bias".15 Despite the ambiguity regarding

causation, job duration provides exactly the information required of it in

this study.



III. Estimating Completed Job Duration

      The first step in implementing the analysis described in the preceding

section is to derive a measure of completed job duration. Clearly, a data set

suitable for this task must follow individual workers over time so that one

can observe how long the jobs they hold ultimately last. The data set should

also have information on the individual workers' characteristics and their




    14. Parsons (1977) and Freeman and Medoff (1984) present surveys of some
of this literature. Mincer and Jovanovic (1981) present a joint analysis of
earnings and turnover.
    15. Measurement of these unobservable factors is likely to be what is
required to identify the underlying structural relationships between earnings
and job duration.
                                       15



 wages/earnings. The Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) satisfies

 these requirements and is used in the empirical analysis. Given the completed

 duration of every job In the sample, the analysis would proceed by including

 this measure in a "standard" earnings function as a control.   Unfortunately,

 there is a general problem with virtually all longitudinal data sets,

 including the PSID, when Information is required on the completed duration of

 a spell of any kind. This is that the individuals are followed for only a

 limited period of time so that there are likely to be many jobs which do riot

 end by the date at which the individual is last observed. Some procedure must

 be used to impute completed durations to these jobs.

       We take the approach of estimating a parametric model of job duration

 that accounts for the censoring of duration in those jobs for which the end is

not observed, This model is then used to Compute an estimate of the expected

completed job duration conditional on the job lasting at least as long as the

last observed seniority level. In the estimation of the earnings function,

this estimate is used as the measure of completed job duration for the

censored spells. The actual completed job duration is used for jobs for which

the end is observed. This procedure has the advantage of using all available

information on duration.

A. The Jobs Sample

      All of the subsequent analysis is performed using data for male

household heads aged 18 to 60 who participated in the Michigan Panel Study of

Income Dynamics (PSID).16 We used only observations from the random national

sample portion of the PSID (the so—called Survey Research Center or SRC



    16. Unfortunately, the design of the PSID precludes meaningful examination
of females for the purposes of this study. This is because complete
information is available only for household heads, and, where households
contain both male and female adults, the male is assumed to be the head by
default.
                                     16



subsample). Persons who were retired, permanently disabled, self-employed,

employed by the government or residents of Alaska or Hawaii were excluded from

the sample. Because we were concerned that different processes might govern

tenure attainment and earnings In the union sector than in the nonunion

sector, we also excluded observations where the individual reported that he

was unionized.17 We were also concerned about differences across occupations

in the processes determining )ob duration and earnings. In what follows, we

therefore focus our discussion on results for two occupational subgroups, one

comprised of nonunion professional, technical and managerial employees and the

second comprised of nonunion blue collar employees; results for a nonunion

sample covering all occupations are included for comparison purposes.     In each

year from 1968 through 1981 In which those individuals satisfying our

selection criteria were household heads, information was available on number

of years they had held their current job, number of years they had worked

prior to taking the current job, years of education, race, marital status,

disability status, occupation, industry, region, and earnings.18



    17. Over the course of the PSID different definitions of unionization were
used. In some years unionization refers to union membership, and in other
years unionization refers to working on a job covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. Where both measures were available, collective
bargaining coverage was used.
    18. Joseph Altonji kindly provided us with an extract containing these
variables which we used in performing our analyses. The procedures followed
in creating this extract are described in detail in an appendix to Altonji and
Shakotko (1985). In order to delete non—SRC subsample observations, we added
information or whether a given individual was part of the SRC subsample or the
nonrandont continuation subsample from the Survey of Economic Opportunity
(SEO). We also smoothed the tenure variable in two ways in instances where a
given individual was assigned the midpoint value of a tenure interval. First,
if the individual on a given job changed tenure intervals in succeeding years,
we computed a smooth tenure variable forward and backward from the change
point. Second, if all observations for the individual on a given job were in
the same tenure interval and thus would have been counted as having the same
tenure in all years on the job, we computed a smooth tenure variable forward
and backward from the middle observed year on the job assuming that tenure in
that year was equal to the midpoint of the interval.

       There are 1048 jobs held by 748 individuals represented in the nonunion

 professional, technical and managerial sample, 1623 jobs held by 958

 individuals represented in the nonunion blue collar sample, and 2857 jobs held

by 1581 individuals represented in the full nonunion sample. Our concern at

this point is with ascertaining how long each of these jobs ultimately
          19
lasted.

      Various characteristics of' the jobs in each of the three samples are

reported In Table 1. Variables that can change over time In an unpredictable

fashion (e.g., marital status, occupation) are assumed constant and measured

at the fIrt point the job is observed in the sample. Any jobs for which

there are some blue collar years and some professional/technical/managerial

years appear in both occupational subsamples. The last observed seniority on

a job is always considered to be the seniority at the last date the person is

observed with an employer, whether or not there has been a change of

occupation during the course of the job.2° There were 91 cases in which an

individual reported moving from blue collar status to professional, technical

or managerial status and 87 cases in which an individual reported moving from

professional, technical or managerial status to blue collar status while a job




    19. The two occupational subgroups for which separate models are estimated
do not cover all nonunion jobs. Approximately 15 percent of the nonunion jobs
were clerical and sales jobs. This is too few to support separate job
duration models for these groups. At the same time, these jobs seemed likely
to differ significantly from other white collar jobs. We chose to exclude
clerical and sales jobs rather than to include them with professional,
technical and managerial jobs in a broader white collar grouping.
    20. For example, if an individual 1) was observed on a single job for ten
years running; 2) reported being a blue collar worker for the first five years
and a professional employee for the next five years; and 3) reported having 13
years seniority in the Jest observed year, then the job would appear in both
the blue collar and the professional/technical/managerial subsamples with a
last observed seniority of 13 years in both. The job would appear once in the
overall nonunion jobs sample, and it would be classified on the basis of the
first observed occupation (blue collar).

 was In progress.

       In all three samples, we observe the end of a substantial fraction of

 the jobs represented in the sample.   In the professional, technical and

 managerial sample, we observe the actual completed duration for 403 of 1048

 jobs; in the blue collar sample, for 839 of 1623 jobs; and in the full

 nonunion sample, for 1396 of 2857 jobs. Not surprisingly, a large proportion

of the completed jobs are relatively short: 73 percent of the completed jobs

in the professional, technical and managerial sample, 84 percent of the

completed jobs in the blue collar sample and 82 percent of the completed jobs

In the full nonunion sample lasted no more than three years. However, In all

three samples, there are a sizeable number of completed jobs lasting 3 to 10

years and over 10 years. Longer jobs are more common among the still—in—

progress jobs: 34 percent of the incomplete jobs In the professional,

technical and managerial sample, 23 percent of the incomplete jobs In the blue

collar sample and 25 percent of the incomplete jobs in the full nonunion

sample had lasted more than 10 years as of the last date they were observed.

      With regard to other characteristics, the completed jobs and the

incomplete jobs generally look similar. In the blue collar sample, completed

jobs tend to have occured slightly earlier in the workllfe (9.9 years of pre-

job experience for completed jobs versus 11.9 years of pre—job experience for

incomplete jobs); the same is not true for the professional, technical and

managerial sample. [n the professional, technical and managerial sample,

professionals account for a smaller share of the completed jobs than of the

incomplete jobs (48.1 percent versus 54.7 percent); in the blue collar sample,

operatives and laborers account for a larger fraction of the completed jobs



    21. It is likely that these numbers overstate the true number of changes
since there are undoubtedly some errors in classification that produce
spurious movements between the two broad occupational groups.
                                       19



than of the incomplete jobs ( 58.5 percent versus 54.5 percent). In te full

nonunion sample, completed jobs appear to have occurred earlier in the

workilfe; professionals are under-represented and operatives and laborers

over-represented among the completed jobs.

B. Specification of the Job Duration Model

       In order to use completed tenure as an earnings equation control

variable in the fashion described in Section Ii, we need a method of

determining the expected completed duration of the Incomplete jobs. We

specify and estimate a parametric model of completed job duration, and then

use the estimated parameters to predict the expected completed length of jobs

still in progress as of the last date we observe them.

       The proportional hazard Weibull specification serves as the basis of the

estimation reported here. In that specification, the probability that a job

has completed duration (D) greater than or equal to T is

       (16)    Pr(DT) = exp[_XTU]

where u is a positive parameter. The proportional hazard assumption implies

that

       (17) X = e_Z'',

where Z is a vector of observable individual characteristics hypothesized to

affect job duration and y Is a vector of parameters. The separation hazard

associated with this distribution is

       (18)   H(t) =

Clearly,   where a=1 this distribution collapses to the exponential as a special

case. In this case the hazard is constant over time and equal to X. Where

>l, this distribution has an associated hazard rate which is increasing as

the spell continues. In other words, the probability that a spell ends at a

point in time given that it has lasted to that point is increasing.

Analogously, where a<l, this distribution has an associated hazard rate which
                                     20


is decreasing as the spell continues. In other words, the probability that a

spell ends at a point in time given that it has lasted to that point is

decreasing.

      If the parameters of a Weibull duration model are estimated, there is

some ambiguity in the interpretation of the estimate of a. The obvious

interpretation is that the estimated value of a indicates "true" duration

dependence. In other words, it indicates how the instantaneous probability of

a spell ending moves over time. An alternative interpretation is that the

estimate of a is biased downward by unmeasured heterogeneity in match quality

so that the estimate (particularly if less than one, as is often the case)

must be interpreted with care. Consider the simple case where there is, in

fact, no true duration dependence so that the hazard rate associated with a

given spell Is some constant X. Heterogeneity in the hazard rates across jobs

could arise because individuals have different temperaments (and thus

different separation propensities), because jobs differ in their relative

attractiveness (and thus in their turnover rates) and/or because there is

variation in the quality of the individual/job match (and thus in the

probability of the match being broken off). If there is unmeasured

heterogeneity in the hazard across spells, the spells that last a long time

are more likely to be the spells with low hazards. These spells are less

likely to end than the randomly selected spell so it appears that spells are

progressively less likely to end as time goes by. However, this apparent

duration dependence is spurious and simply an artifact of a sample of

surviving spells that is becoming increasingly dominated by spells with low

hazard rates.

      For the purposes of this study, we are not interested in distinguishing

between true and spurious duration dependence. We are simply interested in

estimating a parametric model of completed job duration that is flexible
                                     21



enough to make allowance for both true duration dependence and unmeasured

heterogeneity in hazards. While we could specify a particular distribution

for the unobserved heterogeneity in the hazard along with the Weibull form of

duration dependence, it Is well known that there are problems with robustness

of the estimates of' heterogeneity and duration dependence with regard to

changes In the assumed distributions in models of this sort.       We take the

approach of estimating a simple Weibull model of completed job duration

without any explicit representation for unmeasured heterogeneity. However,

the estimate of the parameter   is interpreted here as representing some

(unspecified) combination of true duration dependence and unmeasured

heterogeneity. The resulting predicted expected completed job durations,

which are the important end products of this analysis, are directly affected

both by this parameter and by the last observed value of seniority. Thus,

both duration dependence and unmeasured heterogeneity are accounted for, and

these predicted values should be considered to be the product of a rather

flexible specification for completed job duration. The Important point is

that we are interested in accurately predicting completed job duration, not in

isolating the degrees of true duration dependence and unmeasured

heterogeneity. The Weibull model should be adequate for this purpose.

     As in the case of exponential durations, the contribution to the

likelihood function made by a completed job is the probability—density that

the job lasted exactly Sf years given that the job lasted at least S0 years.23




    22. See Lancaster (1979) for a parametric approach to the problem of
estimating unmeasured heterogeneity in a Weibull model of unemploynent
duration. Heckman and Singer (1984) present a nonparametric approach to
estimating duration models with unmeasured heterogeneity.
    23. It is important to condition on the length of the job as of the date
it is first observed because the sampling scheme is such that jobs will not be
observed unless they last long enough to make it to the start of the sample
period.
                                        22


 Given a Weibull distribution for duration, this is

       (19)    Pr(D=SfID>S) =

 Similarly,   the contribution to the likelihood function made by a job with a

 censored duration is the probability that the job lasted more than Sf years

 given that the job lasted at least S0 years. This is

       (20)
               Pr(DSfID>S) exp[_>(S_SUfl.
 The log-likelihood function is formed from these probabilities as

       (21) ln(L)
                      (C.lnPr(D.Sf.tD>S) +(i—C)lnPr(DSfD>c)j
 where j indexes jobs and C is an indicator variable that equals one if the

 completed job duration is censored (i.e., the job does not end during the

sample period) and equals zero otherwise (i.e., the completed job duration Is

observed).

      Note that this specification of the likelihood function assumes that

unmeasured factors affecting completed job durations are independent across

spells. However, within each of the three samples, there are multiple

observations on job durations for some individuals. A more complete

specification would account explicitly for the possibility that some

individuals are inherently less likely to change jobs than others for reasons

that are unmeasured. This would induce a correlation across jobs in the

completed job durations for a given individual after controlling for observed

differences in the hazard. Given the highly nonlinear nature of the model, an

appropriate tractable procedure for accounting for this correlation is not

obvious. At this point the analysis proceeds under the assumption that

unmeasured factors affecting completed job durations are independent.

C. Estimation of the Job Duration Model

      Column 1 and column 2 of Table 2 contain estimates of the Welbull job

duration model estimated over the subsamples of 1048 professional,technical

and managerial jobs and 1623 blue collar jobs, respectively. These estimates

were derived by maximizing the likelihood function defined above with respect

to the parameters Y and cx.24   in interpreting the estimates of the

determinants of the baseline hazard (X), recall that the hazard rate was

specified such that X=e. Thus, an increase in a variable with a positive

coefficient reduces > and increases the expected duration of the job.

      The two sets of estimates exhibit some interesting differences.25 The

marginal effect of pre—job experience on job duration for professional,

technical and managerial workers is never statistically significant at the .05

level or better. In contrast, among blue collar workers, having more pre—job

experience has a significant positive association with completed job duration.

      Recall that the explanation for a positive relationship between

experience and earnings based on sorting of workers into successively better

jobs also had the implication that completed job duration would be positively

related to pre-job experience. For blue collar workers there is evidence

consistent with this sorting. However, this evidence is also consistent with

the view that blue collar workers mature over time into "naturally" more

stable workers. There is no evidence for sorting or maturation for

professional, technical, and managerial workers.



    24. The algorithm described by Berndt, Hall, Hall, and Hausman (1974) was
used to find the maximum.
    25.  Based on a a1d test, the hypothesis that the parameters of the
models for the two subgroups are identical except for a constant shift and the
occupation dummies in Zy can be rejected at any reaonable level of
significance. The test statistic, distributed as X with 22 degrees of
freedom, is 77.9. The critical value of this distribution at the one percent
level of significance is 40.29. The independence assumption of this test is
not strictly satisfied, since the two samples contain some jobs in common.

  aTh    coefficient estimates are from a Weibull proportional hazards model
implemented using the jobs samples described in Table 1. All explanatory
variables are reported as of the start of the job. Professional/technical
employees are the omitted occupational group in the column (1) and column (3)
models and operatives/laborers are the omitted occupational group in the
column (2) model. The models also include industry and region controls; these
coefficient estimates are reported in Table 2 of Appendix B. The numbers in
parentheses are asymptotic standard errors.
                                      24



       The estimates also suggest that education has a stronger positive

relationship with job duration in white collar occupations than in blue collar

occupations. In both samples, being married raises expected job duration.26

Disabled blue collar workers actually appear to have somewhat longer expected

job durations than non—disabled blue collar workers. Nonwhites have shorter

job durations than whites in the professional/technical/managerial subsample,

though the relevant coefficient is only marginally significant. There is no

significant difference in lob durations by race among blue collar workers. As

might have been expected given the lower percentage of professional/technical

workers in the completed job subsample than in the incomplete job subsample,

the column (1) estimates are weakly Consistent with the notion that, within

the white collar group, professional and technical workers' jobs last longer

than managers' jobs. Within the blue collar group, operatives and laborers

have shorter jobs than do foremen and craftsworkers. The estimates of      are

significantly and substantially less than one for both white and blue collar

jobs. We interpret this as implying some combination of negative duration

dependence and unmeasured heterogeneity.

      Overall, the most interesting difference between the professional,

technical, and managerial job duration model and the blue collar job duration

model is the difference in the effects of prior experience on job duration.

We return to this finding below.

      The third column of Table 2 contains the estimates of the Weibull final

tenure model estimated for the full sample of 2857 nonunion jobs. These

results are intermediate between those for the professional, technical and

managerial sample and those for the blue collar sample. The esmmated



    26. If we accept the notion that married workers are more 'mature', then
this result is consistent with the view that more "mature" workers are
naturally more stable.
                                         25



 coefficients imply that jobs last longer in cases where the person taking the

 job has more previous work experience, has more education, is married and is

 not disabled. Jobs held by whites do not last significantly longer than jobs

 held by nonwhites. The omitted occupational category in the model is the

 professional/technjcaj category. Being a professional or technical worker

 increases expected job duration compared to that associated with any of the

 other occupational categories. The occupational category with the shortest

 expected job duration is the operative/laborer category. The estimate of a is

 strongly significantly less than one, which we again interpret as reflecting

 some mixture of heterogeneity and negative duration dependence.
                                                                        -



 D. Prediction of Job Duration for Incomplete Jobs

       We used the parameter estimates from the appropriate column of Table 2

 to predict the expected completed job duration of each of the incomplete jobs

 in each sample. This expectation is computed conditionally on the job lasting

longer than the last observed seniority (Sf years). Note that the job

duration model we have estimated is based on data for the pre-retirement

period. It will capture the net effects of quit and layoff processes on job

duration, but it will not capture the effect of the competing retirement

process which comes into play for older workers. If we predicted job

durations without taking retirement into account, some would be implausibly

long. We therefore assume that all jobs that are in progress when the worker

reaches age 65 end at that point. For an individual/job match with observable

characteristics Z that has lasted Sf years as of the last date we observe it,

the conditional expected completed job duration is:
                                     S           a          Pr(DS

evaluated numerically.27 Estimates of the conditional expectation in equation

(22) computed using the appropriate set of parameters from Table 2 produce the

job duration measure used for incomplete jobs in the earnings function

estimation in the next section.

        We also use estimates of the square of completed job duration in the

earnings function estimation. For incomplete jobs, this is estimated

similarly to completed job duration itself as
                                         S                 a        Pr(DS

A similar change of variables to that which produced equation (24) yields

easily approximated incomplete gamma functions which are used, along with the

appropriate set of parameters from table 2, to compute our estimate of the

square of completed job duration for incomplete jobs.

        As noted earlier, actual job duration was observed for 403 of the 1048

jobs represented in the professional, technical and managerial sample, for 836




   27. The approximations used were taken from Abromovitz and Steigun (1972).

 of the 1623 jobs in the blue collar sample, and for 1396 of the 2857 jobs In

 the all occupations sample. Many of the professional, technical and

 managerial jobs were quite long; of the 1048 completed and incomplete jobs

 represented In the sample, 19 percent were predicted to have completed

durations of 1 year or less, 10 percent to have completed durations of 1 to 3

years, 18 percent to have completed durations of 3 to 10 years and 53 percent

to have completed durations of more than ten years.28 More of the blue collar

jobs were relatively short; of the 1623 completed and incomplete jobs

represented in the sample, 33 percent were predicted to have completed

durations of 1 year or less, 15 percent to have completed durations of 1 to 3

years, 26 percent to have completed durations of 3 to 10 years, and 26 percent

to have completed durations of more than ten years.29 The distribution of

predicted completed job durations for the all occupations sample is
•                                                   30
intermediate between that for the two subsamples.

      It is not easy to assess intuitively whether the parameter estimates in

this completed tenure model are sensible. One check on the model is to

explore whether its implications regarding the distribution of completed job

durations are consistent with other available evidence. Hall (1982) has

recently reported estimates of various statistics relating to the distribution

of the lengths of completed jobs constructed using a radically different

approach than we have used here. We have computed statistics which can be



    28. Of the 403 completed professional, technical and managerial jobs in
the sample, 82 (20.3%) had completed durations of three to ten years and 25
(6.2%) had completed durations of more than ten years.
    29. Of the 839 completed blue collar jobs In the sample, 103 (12.3) had
completed durations of three to ten years and 28 (3.3%) had completed
durations of more than ten years.
    30. The distribution for the full sample Is not simply the weighted
average of the distributions of the two subsamples for three reasons: 1) Some
jobs appear In both of the occupational subsajnples; 2) A few clerical and
sales jobs appear in neither subsample; and 3) The predicted durations for the
three samples are based on different Weibull model estimates.
                                     28



compared to some of those he reports. For the purposes of this comparison,

all estimates of expected job duration were computed using the model of job

duration contained in the third column of Table 2.

      Hall (1982) uses the CPS tenure data to draw conclusions concerning the

distribution of completed job duration. In essence, his approach is to infer

the probability that a job that has already lasted N years will last another I

years by comparing the proportion of employed persons aged A plus 1 years in

jobs that have lasted N plus 1 years to the proportIon of employed persons

aged A in jobs tnat have lasted N years. Among other statistics, he reports

the probabilities that jobs in various tenure brackets will end up lasting at

least 20 years for workers aged 40 to 45. His estimates are reported in the

first column of Table 3.

      It is relatively easy to compute similar statistics based on the job

duration model in column (3) of Table 2. For comparability with Hall's

results, we perform calculations for an individual aged 42 with the sample

mean amount of education who we assume started school at age 6 and has worked

continuously since leaving school. We assume sample mean values of all other

characteristics except pre—job experience used in making our predictions; pre-

job experience is set so that age upon attaining the mean amount of schooling

plus seniority plus pre—job experience equals 42. Important differences

between the two sets of estimates include the fact that our sample includes

only nonunion male heads of households, whereas Hall's estimates reflect the

experiences of all 40 to 45 years olds, both union and nonunion and both

female and male. Our estimates of the statistics reported by Hall appear in

the last column of Table 4.

      The two sets of estimates are quite similar overall. The major

difference between them is that we generally find somewhat higher

probabilities that short jobs will end up lasting over 20 years. The fact

that Hall's estimates include women while ours do not could explain this

discrepancy, though the fact that Hall's estimates include union jobs while

ours do not seems likely to work in the opposite direction. Overall, we find

it reassuring that Hall's nonparametric procedure and our parametric procedure

produce similar results and take this as evidence that our estimates of

completed job duration are reasonable.



IV. Earnings Function Estimates

      Having derived an estimate of completed tenure which can be used as a

control variable in earnings functions, we turn now to the empirical

investigation of the central questions motivating this research. First, do

those on long jobs receive higher earnings than those on short jobs? Second,

if so, what fraction of the positive association between seniority and

earnings in the cross section reflects the fact that those with longer service

tend to be in better paying, longer jobs? Third, is there any evidence that

the positive cross—sectional association between labor market experience and

earnings in significant measure reflects the fact that more experienced

workers have found better jobs and/or better matches?

      Consider a standard earnings function of the form:

      (26) ln(W) =     +E

where ln(W) is the logarithm of real average hourly earnings, X is a vector of

individual characteristics,   is a vector of parameters, and   represents

unmeasured factors affecting earnings. This earnings function is estimated

using each of three samples of individual—year observations from the three

samples of jobs from the PSID discussed in Section III. As previously noted,

in presenting our empirical findings we have chosen to focus primarily on the

results for the two broad occupational subgroups: nonunion professional,

technical and managerial employees and nonunion blue collar employees.
                                        30


Results for the full nonunion sample are also presented for comparison

purposes. Recall that    the   samples consist only of nonunion male heads of

households. There are 3603 individual—year observations on workers in the

1048 professional, technical, and managerial jobs; 3926 individual-year

observations on workers in the 1623 blue collar jobs; and 8688 individual—year

observations on workers In the 2857 jobs on the overall sample.31

       The first column in each of tables 4a, 4b and 4c contain, for each of

the   samples, the means and standard deviations of the central variables used
in the analysis. Given that we wish to identify the incremental return to

seniority over and above the return to general labor market experience, the

earnings functions we estimate include total labor market experience rather

than pre—job experience.32 The professional, technical and managerial sample

has slightly more total labor market experience (18.14 years versus 17.62

years) and slightly longer current tenure (8.85 years versus 6.46 years) than

the blue collar sample. As explained in Section III, expected job duration

and the expected value of its square were computed based on the Weibull model

for the relevant sample of jobs where the end of the job was not observed; for

the remaining jobs, actual completed job duration and its square are used.

Expected job durations are somewhat longer in the professional, technical and

managerial sample than in the blue collar sample (20.78 years versus 13.94

years). The characteristics of the full nonunion sample are intermediate




    31. Persons who were retired, permanently disabled, self—employed,
employed by the government or residents of Alaska or Hawaii were also
excluded. The overall nonunion sample includes clerical and sales workers.
    32. If both seniority and the experience term were entered linearly, the
two specifications would yield identical fits. If the squares of seniority
and/or experience appear in the earnings function, the two specifications will
not yield identical fits. However, we have estimated all of the Section IV
models with pre-job experience and its square in place of total experience and
its square, and the qualitative conclusions emerging from the analysis do not
change.

between those of the two occupational subsamples.33

      As with the sample of jobs, the individual—year sample has multiple

observations for some Individuals. If there are unmeasured Individual factors

affecting earnings then one might want to estimate some sort of errors

components model that accounts for correlations across observations in t.

While this is relatively straightforward to implement In a linear model, the

estimates presented In this section are standard ordinary least squares (OLS)

estimates that do not account for such correlatIons. The reason for thIs is

fundamentally related to the ultimate goal of using a measure of completed job

duration to account for heterogeneous worker, job, and/or match quality and

yield better estimates of the returns to seniority and experience. If we

estimate a standard fixed effect earnings model, which is equivalent to

including a separate constant term for each individual in the sample in the

earnings function, we can learn nothing about the relative returns to

seniority and experience from those for whom only one job is observed. Unless

a job change occurs, seniority an experience both increase by one each year,

so that their effects are not separately identifiable. Moreover, the

completed job duration measure will vary within the observations on a

particular individual only for those individuals observed on more than one

job. Observing multiple jobs for an individual will be more likely where jobs

are relatively short. It is likely that the returns to seniority and

experience among the group of workers who change jobs during the period we

observe them will differ from the returns to seniority and experience in the

sample as a whole.   In addition, the relationship of the key job duration



    33. As was true with the jobs samples, the all occupations means are not
simply the weighted averages of the means for the two occupational subgroups,
since some jobs appear in both of the occupational subsamples, a few clerical
and sales jobs appear in neither, and the predicted job durations for the
three samples are based on different Weibull models.
                                     32


measure with earnings cannot be adequately estimated through a sample of short

jobs. On balance, it seems preferable to leave the fixed effects unaccounted

for rather than to have the entire analysis rely on jobs with short completed

durations.

      Given that a key variable, completed job duration, is proxied by our

estimate of the expectation of completed job duration, the question of

potential measurement error in this variable ought to be addressed. There are

actually two sources of error In the predicted completed job duration measure.

The first is that the parameters of the job duration model are only estimates

so that the predictions of expected job duration are themselves subject to

error. However, it can be shown that in large samples the estimation error in

the parameters of the job duration model is of small enough order that

coefficient estimates in equations which use the derived measure of duration

as an explanatory variable will be consistent. The second source of error is

that the expected value of completed job duration Is used in place of the

actual realization of completed job duration. This is not a problem because,

by definition, the expected value of completed job duration is uncorrelated

with the deviation between the expected and the true value. Since the

measurement error is exactly the deviation between the expected value and the

true value, there is no correlation induced between the included regressor and

the error term in the regression. Thus, there is no bias from this source in

our estimated earnings function coefficients.

      While these sources of measurement error do not induce inconsistency in

the earnings function parameter estimates, they do affect the estimates of the

standard errors of the coefficients. The standard errors presented are

corrected for the effects of these errors and for general heteroskedasticity

of the form analyzed by White (1980).

      Table 4a contains ordinary least squares (OLS) regression results for

the nonunion professional, technical and managerial sample. Column (1) is a

standard earnings equation; It suggests that professional, technical and

managerial employees enjoy sizeable returns to both labor market experience

and seniority with a particular employer. Column (2) differs from the

standard earnings function In that it also Includes expected job duration and

the expectation of the square of ob duration.35

      The first thing to note about the coefficient estimates in column (2) is

that there is a very strong positive association between job length and

earnings. A man on a job that ends up lasting 10 years rather than 5 earns

7.6 percent more in each year on that job; a man on a job that ends up lasting

20 years rather than 5 earns 18.2 percent more in each year on that job. The

estimates in column (3) allow the effects of completed job duration and its

square to vary with seniority. The substance of the results do not change and

the evidence is persuasive that workers in long jobs earn more uniformly over

the life of the job.36



    34. See Newey (1984) for a detailed discussion of the sort of standard
error calculations used here.
    35. We include the expectation of the square of job duration because we
do not wish to be unduly restrictive about the functional form of the
underlying relationships.
    36. The positive relationship between job duration and earnings, which
exists for both of the occupational subsamples and the full nonunion sample,
provides strong evidence against the Harris and Holmstrom (1982)
Interpretation of the return to experience. In their model, the worker and
all firms are initially uncertain about the worker's productivity. The
initial wage equals the expected value of the worker's productivity minus an
insurance premium and the employer guarantees not to reduce the initial wage.
Workers revealed to have high productivity receive wage increases, either from
treir original employer or by taking a new job with another employer. Workers
revealed to have low productivity cannot duplicate their original wage
elsewhere and for that reason are more likely to stay with their original
employer. Thus, the simple Harris and Holnstrom model predicts a negative
correlation between job duration and earnings; our results indicate that this
correlation is strongly positive.

 aAll models also include controls for education, race, marital status,
disability, occupation, industry, region, and year. These coefficient
estimates are reported in Table 3a of Appendix B. E(completed job duration)
is computed using the estimates in column (1) of table 2. The numbers in
parentheses are standard errors. The standard errors in columns (2) and (3)
are asymptotic and corrected for the fact that E(completed job duration) is
predicted. Sample size=3603.

          A second noteworthy feature of the results in column (2) is that there

is a marked fall in the estimated return to seniority compared to the standard

model. In the model of column (1), an additional year of seniority at the

mean was associated with 1.4 percent higher earnings; in the column (2) model

which includes completed job duration as a control, an additional year of

seniority is associated with only 0.5 percent higher earnings. In the column

 (1) model, 10 years of seniority contribute 19.2 percent to earnings and 20

years of seniority contribute 30.2 percent; in the column (2) model, 10 years

of seniority contribute 5.6 percent to earnings and 20 years of seniority

contribute 11.5 percent to earnings. Thus, roughly two thirds of the

estimated return to seniority in the cross section appears to reflect bias

associated with higher earnings on longer jobs, rather than true returns to
                    37
seniority per Se.

      A third question of interest is whether standard estimates of the return

to experience include a component reflecting returns to search. The fact that

the estimated return to experience does not fall when completed job duration

and its square are introduced into the model suggests that, for professional,

technical and managerial employees, the answer to this question is 'no"; the

positive association between experience and earnings appears to reflect true

returns to experience rather than sorting of more experienced workers into

better jobs.

      Table 4b reports a similar set of earnings equations estimated using OLS

for the sample of blue collar nonunion employees. Column (1) is again the

standard cross section earnings equation. In this model, there appear to be




    37. With both seniority and seniority squared in the column (2) model,
the coefficient of neither was significantly different from zero. Results
based on the estimates of this model are virtually identical to those we
report.

substantial returns to both labor Market experience and tenure. If anything,

it appears that seniority is worth more to blue collar workers than to white

collar workers (2.0 percent per year versus 1.4 percent per year at the

respective sample means. However, blue collar workers appear to have lower

returns to labor market experience (0.4 percent per year versus 1.2 percent

per year at the respective sample means).

      The estimates in column (2) of table 4b, which include expected job

duration and the expectation of its square, imply that, like professional,

technical and managerial employees, blue collar workers in long jobs earn

substantially more than blue collar workers in short jobs. A man in a job

that ends up lasting 10 years earns 7.5 percent more in each year of that job

than a man in a job that ends up lasting 5 years; a man in a job that ends up

lasting 20 years earns 19.4 percent more than a man in a job that end up

lasting 5 years. The estimates in column (3) allow the effects of couwleted

job duration and its square to vary with seniority. As with the professional,

technical and managerial workers, the substance of the results do not change

and the evidence is   persuasive   that workers in long jobs earn more uniformly
                            38
over the life of the job.

      For the blue collar sample, as with the professional, technical, and

managerial sample, the positive association between job duration and earnings

appears to account for most of the apparent return to seniority in the

standard cross section earnings equation; the estimated return to seniority at

the mean drops from 2.0 percent in the standard column (1) model to under 0.4

percent per year in the column (2) model and loses statistical significance.

The point estimates of the coefficients in the column (1) model imply that 10




    38. Once again, this is strong evidence against the Harris and Holmstrom
(1982) interpretation of the return to experience. See note 36.
                                      36


 years of seniority add 24 percent to earnings and 20 years of seniority add 38

 percent; those in the column (2) models, that 10 years of seniority contribute
                                                                         39
4 percent to earnings and 20 years of seniority contribute 8 percent.

      With regard to the return to general labor market experience, the

results for blue collar workers are somewhat different than for the

professional, technical, and managerial workers. For those white collar

workers, there was no evidence of a positive search component in the return to

experience estimated using the standard (column 1) specification, in

contrast, the estimated return to experience for blue collar workers falls by

approximately 20 to 30 percent when our measures of completed job duration are

introduced into the regression (column (2)). Essentially, a piece of the

already—low estimated return to labor market experience among blue collar

workers appears to reflect an underlying correlation between experience and

job and/or match quality, rather than returns to experience per Se. The

estimated return to an additional year of experience at the mean drops from

0.4 percent in column (1) to 0.3 percent in column   (2)..   In the column (1)

model, 10 years of experience contribute 12 percent to earnings and 20 years

of experience contribute 19 percent; in the column (2) model, 10 years of

experience add 8 percent to earnings and 20 years of experience add 13

percent.

      Finally, Table 4c presents results like those just discussed for the

full nonunion sample. With one exception, the full sample results are

intermediate between those f or professional, technical and managerial

employees and those for blue collar workers. The standard earnings function




    39. Again, in a model like that in column (2) that included both
seniority and its square, neither had a coefficient that was significantly
different from zero. Results based on the estimates of this model are very
similar to those we report.

estimates of column (1) indicate the existence of substantial returns to both

labor market experience and seniority. In column (2), both expected job

duration and the expectation of its square are significant, and the estimated

association between job duration and earnings looks similar to that for the

occupational subgroups. The estimates in column (3) allow the effects of

completed job duration and its square to vary with seniority. As with the

occupational subgroups, the evidence is persuasive that workers in long jobs

earn more uniformly over the life of the job.

       The noteworthy difference between the full sample results and the

occupational subgroup results is that the estimated return to seniority

remains slightly larger in the full nonunion sample model than in either of

the occupational subsample models (0.7 percent per year and highly

significant, versus 0.5 percent per year in the professional, technical and

managerial sample and an insignificant 0.4 percent per year in the blue collar

sample). This pattern of results may imply that there is a return to

seniority with a particular employer for some workers that takes the form of

promotion from a blue collar position to a white collar position.40      However,

even in the estimates for the full nonunion sample, no more than a third of

the apparent return to seniority estimated using the standard cross section

earnings function appears to reflect a true return to seniority pse.

      The estimated return to labor market experience in the full sample

column (2) model is between that f or the two occupational subsamples.




    40. As noted earlier, fewer than 178 of the 2857 jobs in the full nonunion
sample involve a move from blue collar status to professional, technical or
managerial status or vice versa. However, if there were substantial returns
to seniority for even a small number of workers taking the form of cross—
occupational category promotions, this could conceivably yield returns to
seniority for the full sample that exceed the returns to seniority for the
occupational subsamples by the 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points we find.

 V. Concluding Comments

        The basis for considering implicit contracts under which compensation is

 deferred from early until late in workers time with their employers to be an

 important feature of the labor market has been the simple cross sectional

 evidence that long seniority workers have higher wages, even taking their

 total labor market experience into account. The evidence presented in this

 study seriously undermines the empirical foundations of this sort of implicit

 contract. Contrary both to the conventional wisdom and to our own prior

expectations, there seems to be only a small return to seniority in excess of

the   return   to general labor market experience for the average worker. For

both the nonunion professional, technical and managerial sample and the

nonunion blue collar sample, the point estimate of the seniority coefficient

in the model including a control for job duration suggests that the true

return to seniority is on the order of 0.5 percent per year, rather than the

1.4 to 2.0 percent per year suggested by the standard cross section model.

The seniority coefficient in the model for the full nonunion sample that

includes a control for job duration is slightly larger and more precisely

estimated than those in the models for the occupational subgroups, but even

that estimate suggests true returns to seniority that are no more than a third

as large as implied by the coefficient estimates for the same sample from a

standard cross section model.41

       This evidence does not imply that implicit contracts entailing the

posting of a bond by workers through a deferral of compensation are never

important.     Indeed, they could be very important for some subgroups of workers

and even a return to seniority of 0.5 percent per year could translate into a




    41. Our findings regarding the returns to seniority are consistent with
those obtained by Altonji and Shakotko (1985) using a much different
instrumental variables approach.
                                     39


substantial cumulative contribution to annual earnings over a period of time.

It Is also possible that parts of the total compensation package other than

earnings, such as fringe benefits or other perquisites, are structured so as
                                                  42
to reward longevity with a particular employer.        However, earnings deferral

under implicit contracts appears to be a much less important factor in both

white collar and blue collar labor markets than has generally been believed.

      A second significant result to emerge from our analysis is the finding

that labor market experience plays a dIfferent role for professIonal,

technical and managerial employees than for blue collar employees. There is

no evidence that nonunion professional, technical and managerial employees

sort themselves into better jobs over the course of their working lives; for

this group, there is no association between pre—job experience and job

duration, and introducing job duration as a control variable Into the earnings

function does not affect the relatively large estimated return to labor market

experience. In contrast, among nonunion blue collar employees, greater pre—

job experience is associated with significantly longer job durations and

introducing job duration as a control variable Into the earnings function

lowers the already—low estimated return to labor market experience by 20 to 30

percent. One interpretation of the results for blue collar workers is that

young blue collar workers pass through a period in which they hold a series of

short, relatively unrewarding jobs, and that, after some time, either because

they find a job that is good enough to stay with (i.e., a job that is unlikely

to be dominated by another) and/or because they mature Into more stable and

more productive workers, they settle into a longer lasting, more remunerative




    42. Freeman and Medoff (1984) provide evidence that the value of nonwage
benefits such as vacations and pension plans rise with seniority. There may
also be less tangible advantages that accrue with seniority.

position.

      The results regarding experience and seniority were derived by including

a measure of completed job duration in an earnings function. One benefit of

this approach is that we can examine the relationship of earnings with

completed job duration directly. In all cases it was found that workers who

are on jobs that will end up lasting a long time earn significantly more in

every year of the job.44 Indeed, this relationship largely explains the

positive cross sectional association between seniority and earnings.

      We would like to be able to say more about the structural foundations of

the positive relationship between earnings and job duration. One key to

untangling the simultaneous nature of this structural relationship is the

measurement of the relative importance of individual heterogeneity versus

job/match heterogeneity as causal factors in determining earnings and job

duration. If such a measurement found that individual heterogeneity accounts

for a significant part of the positive association between earnings and job

duration, the positive relationship may be thought of as a return to

stability, per se, that stable workers could receive from many employers. If,

on the other hand, it were found that job and/or match heterogeneity accounted

for a significant part of the positive association between earnings and job

duration, there may be evidence for efficiency wage behaviour. For example,

if there are employers for whom turnover is particularly costly, monitoring

worker shirking is particularly expensive, or worker loyalty is particularly

valuable, these employers may agree to pay their workers more throughout the




    43. Osterman (1980) characterizes the typical labor mariet behaviour of
non—college—educated men as consisting of a 'moratorium phase" followed by a
'settling down" phase of the sort just described.
    44. This relationship is also implicit in the large body of literature on
the negative relationship between separation rates and earnings. See Parsons
(1977) and Freeman and Medoff (1984) for surveys of this literature.

job. Workers in such jobs will be unlikely to quit. Alternatively, the

positive association between earnings and job duration would reflect the

desire of employers to preserve idiosyncratically good matches.

      In conclusion, we can offer no tangible evidence regarding why earnings

deferral under implicit contracts does not seem to be an Important overall

factor in labor markets. it may be that workers are unable or unwilling to

accept earnings deferral. Minimum wage laws might prevent some workers from

posting the bond required under an earnings deferral contract. Probably more

important, risk aversion and uncertainty about whether the firm will honor its

implicit commitments seem likely to make many workers unwilling to enter into

such arrangements. The nature of long term employment relationships are

certainly deserving of further study.

                                in Cross-section Earnings Equations

        This appendix derives the theoretical results concerning bias in the

coefficients on seniority and experience in cross sectional earnings functions

reported in Section II of the paper. A simple base model is presented first:

the consequences of relaxing two of this model's assumptions are then

explored.

                                              Base Model

        Suppose that the earnings of a particular worker on a particular job at

a point in time can be written:

                                                           +
        (A.l) lnW1 =

                                                      +


where

               W=          hourly earnings,

               S =         is   current seniority (tenure),

               EXP =       is   pre—job experience,

               p =         the excess of earnings enjoyed by this person on this job
                           over and above the earnings that could be expected by a

                           randomly selected person with the same observed

                           characteristics on a randomly selected job,

                           is a person/job/time—period specific error term,

               I =         index of individuals,

               j   =       index   of jobs,

               t =         index of years within jobs, and
                       =   parameters of interest.
For simplicity of exposition, other factors that might influence earnings are

omitted from the theoretical discussion and all variables are assumed to be

measured as deviations from their means. In this formulation, the coefficient
                                                              45


    captures the returns to experience                                        not any increases in earnings

 that occur because more experience workers have sorted themselves into better

 jobs and/or matches. The                            term captures the net influence of unobserved

person quality, unobserved job quality and unobserved match quality on hourly

earnings. The error p.. is assumed to be fixed over the course of a job. The

error fjt is assumed to be orthogonal to S, EXP and p.

      In practice, earnings functions are generally estimated using cross

section data and p., is not observable. When p..

'v is a parameter which summarizes the relationship between D and                                    and
captures the variation in completed job duration that cannot be linked to the

earnings advantage associated with worker, job and/or match quality. Suppose

further that workers with more pre—job experience are likely to have found

better jobs and/or better matches. One simple approximation to such a

relationship is

      (A.5) p. . = aEXP. +

systematically related to EXP. We assume for the present that pre—job

experience is not correlated with coupleted job duration except insofar as

more experienced workers are more likely to have found a good job and/or a

good match, so that E(EXPi.*E..) is zero. Substituting equation (A.5) into

equation (A.4) yields

         (A.6) D
                   ij       yEXP. + y4,.

If each year of any given job is equally likely to be represented in the cross

section sample of observations used to estimate the earnings function, then on

average the observed seniority on the job will be halfway through the job.

          The standard formula for the bias in ordinary least squares regression

 coefficients is:

          (A.l1) E() -           =

 where     is the estimated coefficient vector,                    is the true coefficient vector,

X is the vector of explanatory variables, and T                     is     the equation error.

Applying the standard bias formula to the seniority coefficient in equation

 (A.2) estimated from cross sectional data yields

         (A. 12) E(1)—1 =

where DET1 is the determinant of the (X'X) matrix from equation (A.2) and the

moments are as defined above. This simplifies to:

which is positive provided y (the coefficient summarizing the relationship

between D and p) is positive.

Relaxing    the cov(EXP,) = 0 Assumption

         The preceding has assumed that pre—job experience affects completed job

duration only through its association with job and/or match quality.                 If more

experienced (older) workers are simply more stable than less experienced

(younger) workers, then experience may have a direct positive relationship

with completed job duration that is not reflected in higher earnings once

experience is controlled for. An obvious generalization of the base model is

thus to allow for the possibility that cov(EXP..,..) might be positive. This

affects several of the moments specified in equation (A.7) and equation

(A.10). The following replace the corresponding expressions in equation

         Now consider the standard cross section earnings equation:

The bias in the estimated seniority coefficient is again given by equation

(A.12); although some of the moments in equation (A.12) take on different

values when the assumption that cov(EXP1.,..)=o is dropped, the bias in the

estimated seniority coefficient still reduces to the expression in equation

(A.13).

        The expected difference between the estimated experience coefficient and

      is again given by equation (A.14). In the present case, this reduces to:

         (A.23) E(2)_2=(l/DET1)*

When cov(EXP..,E,) = 0, this reduces to the expression in equation (A.15).

Assuming a to be positive, a sufficient condition for this expression to be

positive is that

        Now consider the effect of introducing completed job duration into the

earnings equation:

                                                                                  3D.ij

                                                                                                      ijt

As in the base case, the resulting bias in the tenure coefficient is given by

equation (A.18). Again, even though some of the moments in equation (A.18)

take on different values when the assumption that cov(EXP. ,E. .)         =0   is
                                                                  ij 13
dropped, it can be shown that this expression equals zero. That is,

introducing completed job duration into the earnings function eliminates the

bias in the tenure coefficient.

      The expected difference between the experience coefficient in an

earnings function that also includes completed job duration as a control and

   is given by equation (A.19). This reduces to:

      (A.26) E(2)_P2=(1/Y*DET2)*{var(Sjjt) —
                                                      (1/4)*var(D))*

This expression is positive so long as the condition stated in equation (A.24)

above holds. However, If

                                          < cov(EXP .,. .)/cov(EXP. ,D. .),
      (A.27) cov( .
                   Dij.,. 13
                          .)/var(D.13.)            lj 13          13 13
then the experience coefficient in the earnings function that includes the

measure of completed job duration will be downward biased.           If the condition

holds with equality, then including the measure of completed job duration

eliminates the bias in 2. It is straightforward to show that, so long as

both a and V are positive, the experience coefficient In equation (A.23) (the

standard cross section earnings function) is larger than that in equation

(A.27) (the earnings function that includes completed job duration). Thus,

under the condition stated in equation (A.24), introducing completed job

duration into the earnings equation reduces but does not eliminate upward bias

in the experience coefficient.

      Overall, then, generalizing the base model to allow for a positive

correlation   heween EXP.. and . . does not change the main conclusions of the
                          13         13

analysis.   The standard cross      section estimate of the tenure coefficient          is

upward biased is befoce,       and introduc I ng U. . I nt:o the equation eliminates that
                                                    52


bias. Under reasonable conditions (as given in equation (A.24)), the standard

cross section estimate of the experience coefficient                         is also biased upwards

as an estimate of the returns to experience Lse and introducing                                into

the earnings equation reduces but does not eliminate that bias.

Relaxing the Single Factor Assumption

      A second potential generallzaton of the base model would be to relax

the assumption that individual—, job-, and match-specific earnings components

all have the same incremental association with job duration. Consider a model

in wnich individual and job/match factors enter separately. In this more

general specification, an earnings increment attributable to unobserved

individual characteristics may bear a different relationship to job duration

than one attributable to job/match characteristics.                        Equation (A.4) is

rewritten as

      (A.28) D1 = Y1j1      +
                                    2jj         +


where p. is the earnings increment attributable to unobserved Individual

differences,          is the earnings increment attributable to unobserved

job/match characteristics, ..               captures the variation in completed job
duration that cannot be linked to the earnings advantage associated with

either worker or job/match quality, i indexes individuals and j indexes jobs.

The parameters        and       capture the relationships of individual and job/match

characteristics, respectively, with job duration; both                        and 2 are assumed

to be positive. Assume further that                      and 8. are independent. Experience

w ;id affect job/match specific attributes but not (fixed) individual

attributes, so equation (A.5) would be rewritten in terms of

      (A.29) a. . = aEXP.       .   + 4'
                 13         13             13
Substituting   equation (A.29) into equation (A.28) yields

      (A.30) D.. =              + ya*EXP            +            +

Given these relationships, it follows that:

 The relationship between S. and D1 is as before, so that cov(Sj.t,Z) =

        Now consider the standard cross—section earnings equation:

The error term (v..t) in this specification equals:

        (A.33) v.       = p.1       +    8.        + 11.

with   the error 111jt assumed to be orthogonal to S, EXP, .i and 8. The bias in

the estimated seniority coefficient equals

        (A.34) E(1)_p1=(1/DET1)*{var(EXp. .)*E(S. *(j+                                  )) —

So long as both         and y2 are positive, the seniority coefficient in the

standard cross section model is biased upwards. The expected difference

between the estimated experience coefficient and
                                                                              2 equals

After   some manipulation, this reduces to

        (A.43)


                                         [var(Zj)+Yi(Yi_Y2)*var(l)1
which is positive so long as the condition specified in equation (A.38) holds.

It is straightforward to show that, so long as both         and            are positive,

the experience coefficient in equation (A.32), the standard cross section

earnings function, is larger than the experience coefficient in equation

(A.39), the earnings function that includes completed job duration as a

control.

        In sum, generalizing the base model to allow for separate individual and

job/match effects does not affect the conclusions concerning bias in the

seniority coefficient; the standard cross section estimate of                 is still

biased upward, and this bias is eliminated by including a measure of completed

job duration in the regression. With regard to the estimated effect of

experience, as long as the condition given in equation (A.38) is satisfied,

the basic results concerning the experience coefficient follow: the

experience coefficient in the standard cross section earnings function is

upward biased as an estimate of the returns to experience L se and

introducing completed job duration into the model reduces but does not

eliminate this upward bias.
