For a finer analysis of global value chain integration and competitiveness, we develop and apply
a method for a micro-data based breakdown of manufacturing industries in the 2010 Belgian
supply-and-use tables into export-oriented and domestic market firms. The former are defined as
those firms that export at least 25% of their turnover. We then derive export-heterogeneous
national input-output tables which we integrate into a global table. Our analyses reveal that: a)
export-oriented manufacturers have lower value-added in output shares and import proportionally
more of the intermediates they use; b) exports of export-oriented manufacturers generate
substantial value added in other Belgian firms, in particular providers of services; c) Belgium’s
backward participation in global value chains is mainly due to export-oriented manufacturers and
its forward participation is due to other firms, d) export-oriented manufacturers participate in
value chains that comprise, on average, a greater number of upstream and downstream production
stages and of which a greater share is located abroad.

1. Introduction

Trade liberalisation and technological developments have largely contributed to increasing global eco-

nomic integration between the early 1990s and the late 2000s by reducing trade costs (transport costs,

communication costs…). This went hand in hand with profound changes in firm organisation that still

shape production processes today. Firms have re-organised their production processes by dividing them

into a growing number of separate stages and by outsourcing more and more of those production stages

to domestic and foreign suppliers. Due to these changes, value chains have become increasingly

fragmented and international or even global. Input-output tables and models are among the foremost

tools for the macro-economic analysis of value chains because they allow to map the full set of upstream

and downstream links in the chain. The calculation of multipliers and linkages based on input-output

tables yields information on how and to what extent industries are integrated into value chains. Such

analyses were traditionally based on national input-output tables and hence restricted to domestic value

chains in individual countries. However, the statistical development of global input-output tables over

the past decade has allowed to widen the scope and look at the integration of countries and industries

into global value chains (Koopman et al., 2010; Johnson and Noguera, 2012; Inomata, 2017; Los, 2017).

For input-output based analyses of value chains, fragmentation also poses a challenge in terms of the

granularity of underlying industry-level data. In input-output tables, firms are traditionally grouped into

industries according to the type of goods and services they produce. But within fragmented value chains

patterns of specialisation are likely to be related to other firm characteristics. Therefore, the analysis of

value creation in the context of fragmented value chains can be improved through a breakdown of

industries into different types of firms. As suggested in OECD (2015), it is desirable to disaggregate

industries in supply-and-use and input-output tables according to firm characteristics such as size,

ownership or exporter status because these characteristics may actually be the source of technological

differences between firms within industries that are traditionally defined in terms of product similarity.



2
The same point is made by Los (2017) arguing that “such differences can only be captured in value chain

trade indicators if each industry is split in two subindustries (p.317)”.

This insight has prompted several efforts to account for firm heterogeneity in supply-and-use tables

(SUT) and input-output tables (IOT), i.e. to generate so-called heterogeneous or extended tables. This

work was initially triggered by the desire to isolate firms engaged in processing trade as these firms differ

from other firms in terms of technology and import patterns. Processing traders were isolated in IOT for

China (Koopman et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2015) and firms operating under special export regimes were

separated out in Mexico’s IOT (De la Cruz et al., 2011). Both these disaggregations have also been

integrated into the OECD’s inter-country input-output tables (Yamano and Webb, 2018). In similar vein,

firms active in free trade zones have been isolated in tables for Costa Rica (Saborio, 2015). Beyond

special trade regimes, Ahmad et al. (2013) provide a proof of concept for a micro-data based split of

industries in Turkish IOT into exporters and other firms. Several other initiatives have been gathered in

the context of the OECD’s Expert Group on Extended Supply-and-Use Tables: they come, amongst

others, from Austria (disaggregation by exporter status and ownership, see Lais and Kolleritsch, 2017),

the Netherlands (disaggregation by size class, see Chong et al. 2017), and the US (disaggregation by

ownership, see Fetzer et al., 2018). Finally, Piacentini and Fortanier (2015) and Cadestin et al. (2018)

introduce firm heterogeneity into multi-country input-output tables in terms of firm size and ownership.

They do so in a proportional way based on aggregated international firm-level databases.

In this work, we break down manufacturing industries in the 2010 Belgian SUT and IOT into firms that

are export-oriented and firms that mainly serve the domestic market. For this purpose, we use the full set

of individual firm-level data sources that serve for the construction of Belgium’s official SUT and IOT

for 2010. The resulting export-heterogeneous tables allow us to test for differences in input structures

and import patterns of export-oriented firms and other firms, and to analyse their respective integration

into domestic value chains based on input-output multipliers and linkages as defined in Miller and Blair

(2009) and Hambÿe (2012). We also compare our results with those for homogeneous industries derived
                                                                                                           3
from the official 2010 Belgian IOT to show that accounting for export heterogeneity in those tables yields

important new insights. Moreover, we integrate the export-heterogeneous Belgian IOT into the global

tables of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to determine how export-oriented and domestic

market manufacturing firms contribute to Belgium’s participation and position in global value chains.

The analysis of contributions to value creation based on data disaggregated along these lines provides a

clearer picture of the sources of a country’s competitiveness.

The novelty of our approach is twofold: the estimation of the industry-level output, input and import

structures in the exporter heterogeneous SUT and IOT are data-based rather than just proportional as in

most prior contributions, and the integration of the Belgian tables into the global table is such that these

Belgian data are not modified. Furthermore, as globalisation has become a major challenge in the

measurement of national accounts for individual countries, we also see this work as a contribution to

determining whether the national accounts – which officially comprise SUT and IOT – can accommodate

recent findings from the academic literature on international trade. Analyses of the characteristics of

exporters based on firm-level data have indeed shown that exporters are different from domestic firms in

terms of production technology. Exporters are not only bigger and more productive (Melitz, 2003), but

they also import more of the intermediates they use (Bas, 2009).

This article is organised as follows. We start off by providing details on constructing export-

heterogeneous supply-and-use and input-output tables for Belgium in section 2. This includes

explanations on how we have disaggregated manufacturing industries in Belgian supply-and-use tables,

derived national heterogeneous input-output tables and integrated them into the global input-output table

of the WIOD project. In section 3, we analyse differences in input structures between manufacturing

exporters and non-exporters and take a look at their integration into both domestic and global value

chains. Finally, we draw conclusions in section 4.

2.    Export heterogeneity in supply-and-use and input-output tables: sources and data

      construction

Supply-and-use tables (SUT) are an integral part of national accounts (NA) and provide detailed

information about economic flows in monetary terms: they describe production processes and income

generated through production. As the central balancing tool for the national accounts, they match the

supply and use of goods and services. While SUT are mainly a statistical tool, symmetric input-output

tables (IOT) are an analytical tool derived from SUT based on assumptions about the relation between

output and inputs. 1

SUT are product-by-industry tables with domestic production and imports given in the supply table, and

intermediate inputs, final uses (final consumption of households and government, gross fixed capital

formation, changes in inventories and exports of goods and services) and value added reported in the use

table. Thus, the use table reveals the structure of production costs by industry. The classification of

industries in SUT is such that industries are made up of production units or firms that produce similar

goods or services, e.g. all producers of chemicals or financial services are grouped together in one

industry. Heterogeneity is traditionally conceived as depending on the detail of the industry classification.

The broadly defined chemicals industry will lump together firms that produce different types of

chemicals: industrial gases, fertilizers, etc. The standard approach to account for such heterogeneity is

further disaggregation of the industry classification along the lines of detailed product categories.

However, as emphasized in OECD (2015), there may also be other sources of firm heterogeneity within

industries: firms in one industry differ in terms of size and ownership, and they are exporters or serve

only the domestic market. Their production cost structure may then differ accordingly. Therefore, it is

worthwhile considering alternative disaggregations of industries within SUT and IOT.

     For a more detailed description of the construction of SUT and IOT and their role within the system of national
     accounts, see Beutel (2017).
                                                                                                                  5
The focus here is on heterogeneity in terms of export behaviour: we disaggregate manufacturing

industries into export-oriented firms and firms serving mainly the domestic market. The literature on firm

heterogeneity and international trade points to differences between exporters and non-exporters in terms

of technology. In particular, exporters are found to have higher productivity levels (and mark-ups) which

allows them to cover the fixed cost related to exporting (Melitz, 2003). Moreover, the more productive

exporters tend to rely more on imported inputs. They have better access to global input markets, which

allows them to purchase cheaper and/or higher quality inputs abroad, thereby further boosting their

productivity (Bas, 2009). These technological differences may also shape and be shaped by the deeper

integration of exporters into global value chains.

We introduce export heterogeneity into Belgian SUT and IOT for the year 2010 by disaggregating

manufacturing industries according to exporter status at the most detailed industry-level breakdown. The

official Belgian SUT for 2010 2 – the most recent input-output reference year – have been constructed

according to the rules of the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010). 3 The most detailed unpublished

version (workformat) of the SUT contains a breakdown into 133 industries and 350 product categories,

which are respectively based on the European Union industry and product classifications NACE Rev.2

and CPA2008. 4 Manufacturing covers NACE Rev.2 industries 10 to 33, which amounts to 57 industries

in the workformat classification. For disaggregating these industries, we rely on most of the firm-level

data that are used in the construction of the SUT. We make sure that our disaggregation is consistent with

the official Belgian SUT, i.e. values for output, intermediate inputs and value added of the split

manufacturing industries sum to the values for the total non-heterogeneous industry.

    We will also refer to these as standard SUT.

The stylized supply table and use tables shown in tables 1 and 2 illustrate the SUT with a disaggregation

of manufacturing industries (columns) according to exporter status. Table 3 and table 4 add a split of the

use table according to the origin of the used goods and services, i.e. whether they are imported or

purchased from Belgian producers (table 3) and, among the latter, whether they are sourced from

exporters or non-exporters (table 4).

In practice, we proceed in several steps to obtain export-heterogeneous Belgian SUT for 2010. First, we

identify exporters and disaggregate total output and intermediate inputs for the 57 manufacturing

industries in the tables. Then, we split the columns of both the supply and the use table that contain the

product distribution of output and intermediate inputs for each industry. We also specifically disaggregate

the use table to identify the use of imported intermediate inputs and purchases of intermediate inputs

from manufacturing exporters and non-exporters. Finally, we derive symmetric heterogeneous industry-

by-industry IOT, which we then integrate into a global multi-regional input-output table (GMRIO).

2.1     Disaggregating total industry-level output and intermediate inputs

Identifying exporters among manufacturing firms allows us to disaggregate total industry-level output

and intermediate consumption for the 57 manufacturing industries in the SUT based on the exporters’

share of turnover and purchases. The results correspond to the dark grey cells in the bottom row of tables

1 and 2 and the 4th row from the bottom in table 2. Disaggregated value added including net taxes on

products is obtained as the difference between total output and intermediate inputs of the heterogeneous

manufacturing industries (dark grey cells in the 2nd and 3rd rows from the bottom in table 2).

The general business register underlying the 2010 national accounts (NA) and SUT contains 40 194

manufacturing firms 5 for which data on turnover and total purchases is available based on the following

sources: balance sheet data, structural business survey data and periodical value added tax (VAT)

    Belgian national accounts (NA) are based on legal units, which we refer to as firms.


                                                                                                         7
declarations. 6 These are the main data sources used to estimate industry-level NA aggregates for total

output and intermediate inputs by industry. The 40 194 manufacturing firms with turnover and total

purchases data constitute our full sample. Their total turnover sums to 229.7 billion euros. Merging in

merchandise export data, we calculate export to turnover ratios for these firms and consider those with a

ratio above 25% as export-oriented. This yields a sample split for manufacturing firms into 2 430 export-

oriented firms, and 37 764 firms that mainly serve the domestic market, which we refer to as domestic

market firms. The share of export-oriented firms in turnover amounts to about 75% (171.2 billion euros).

Hence, export-oriented firms are bigger firms: their average turnover is 70.4 million euros compared to

5.7 million euros for the entire sample. Due to the 25% cut-off ratio for defining export-oriented firms,

this category of firms does not account for all exports. Merchandise exports of export-oriented firms

amount to 98.2 billion euros out of a total of 101.3 billion euros of exports by manufacturing firms (97%).

All these sample characteristics are summarised in the upper part of table 5.

2.2      Disaggregating manufacturing industries in the supply-and-use tables

As illustrated by the light grey cells in tables 1 and 2, the SUT contain the distribution of industry-level

output and use of intermediate inputs over product categories. For the column-wise split of manufacturing

industries in the 2010 Belgian SUT into export-oriented and domestic market firms, we use a restricted

sample of firms for which we have information on turnover and purchases by product category.

In the Belgian SUT, the product distribution of output and intermediate inputs is derived from several

sources. The main source are two supplementary questionnaires annexed to the structural business survey

(SBS): one on the product detail of turnover and the other on the product detail of total purchases. These

two questionnaires are sent out jointly every five years to a restricted sample of big firms (all firms with

at least 50 employees plus smaller firms if necessary to reach a coverage of minimum 50% of turnover



6
    The order of this list of sources reflects the hierarchy in their use. Balance sheet data is the primary source. If
    balance sheet data is unavailable for a firm, then structural business survey data is used, and if that is not
    available either, then data from periodical VAT declarations is used.
8
at the 4-digit industry-level). For the product detail on output in manufacturing industries, the data from

the supplementary SBS questionnaire on turnover is complemented by data from the survey on industrial

production (Prodcom). Moreover, the data is compared to firm-level exports by product category to

correct inconsistencies. By the same token, the data from the supplementary SBS questionnaire on the

product detail of total purchases are cross-checked and corrected for inconsistencies through a

comparison with firm-level imports by product category and data on domestic purchases from the VAT

transaction dataset. 7 The latter comprises all transactions between domestic firms on which VAT is levied.

In the construction of the SUT, the resulting cross-checked datasets are used to distribute total industry-

level output and intermediate inputs over product categories.

In 2010, 1 710 manufacturing firms completed the supplementary SBS questionnaires. They form the

restricted sample for establishing the product distributions. Their turnover amounts to 181.2 billion euros,

which is 79% of the total turnover of the 40 194 manufacturing firms in our full sample. Among these

1 710 firms, 980 are export-oriented (export to turnover ratio above 25%). The turnover of these export-

oriented firms sums to 149.9 billion euros (88% of the turnover of all 2 430 export-oriented firms in the

full sample). Within the restricted sample, the average size of export-oriented firms also largely exceeds

that of firms serving mainly the domestic market (153.0 against 42.8 million euros). Finally, exports of

export-oriented firms in the restricted sample amount to 83.9 billion euros compared to total exports of

85.9 billion euros by all firms in the restricted sample (98%). Again, table 5 provides an overview of

these sample characteristics.

We split the restricted sample into export-oriented and domestic market firms and use the cross-checked

data from the supplementary SBS questionnaires on turnover and total purchases to estimate separate

product distributions of output and intermediate inputs for both groups of firms in each manufacturing




7
    In the construction of the SUT, the aim of these corrections is to avoid that the underlying inconsistencies in
    the firm-level data resurface in the balancing process of the tables.
                                                                                                                 9
industry. We were able to do so for 47 out of the 57 manufacturing industries. The sample size was

insufficient for domestic market firms in eight industries and for exporter-oriented firms in two industries.

In those cases, we had to make a proportionality assumption. Given the aim to investigate differences in

production cost structures, we have been striving to determine the product distributions of output and

intermediate inputs of heterogeneous industries based on firm-level data rather than just assume

proportionality to the non-heterogeneous industries in the official tables. A sample split based on lower

export to turnover ratios increases the number of industries where the sample size for non-exporters is

insufficient for a data-based estimation of the product distribution of output and inputs. Hence, we faced

a trade-off between including exporters with a low export to turnover ratio in the exporter sample and

avoiding proportionality in the estimation of the product distributions of the heterogeneous industries.

Finally, we apply a RAS-procedure to ensure consistency with respect to the product distribution of

output and intermediate inputs of the non-heterogeneous industries in the official SUT. As a result, we

obtain a heterogeneous supply table as shown in table 1 and a heterogeneous use table as shown in table

2. The heterogeneous use table is still at purchasers’ prices. For transformation to basic prices, the

valuation matrices for trade and transport margins and for taxes less subsidies on products must be

subtracted. As we have no firm-level information that would allow us to disaggregate valuation tables by

exporter status, we do so proportionally to values of intermediate inputs at purchasers’ prices.

2.3    Disaggregating the use table according to the origin of the products

The disaggregation of the use table at basic prices according to the origin of the products is done in two

steps: first a split into imported and domestic goods and services (table 3) and then a split of the latter

into goods produced by export-oriented manufacturers and by domestic market manufacturers (upper

part of table 4). The official Belgian use table at basic prices contains a split according to the origin of

the goods and services, i.e. a use table for domestic output and a use table for imports. This is necessary

for deriving an IOT. Hence, we need to split the heterogeneous use table into heterogeneous use tables

for domestic output and imports. This requires specific data work for the columns of manufacturing
10
industries (see table 3). 8 To estimate the use of imported intermediate inputs by export-oriented and

domestic market manufacturers, we use product-level import data for these firms corrected for re-exports

and excluding imports of capital goods. Again, a RAS-procedure is applied so that the disaggregation

respects the values of imported intermediate inputs in the official use table. The use of domestically-

produced intermediate inputs by export-oriented and domestic market manufacturers is calculated as the

difference between total and imported intermediate inputs.

As shown shaded in light grey in table 4, the entire rows for domestically-produced manufactured goods

in the use table can be further disaggregated according to whether these goods are produced by domestic

market manufacturers or by export-oriented manufacturers. To do this, we proceed in two steps. First, we

disaggregate exports, which are part of final uses. As illustrated above, export-oriented firms do not

account for all exports due to the 25% export to turnover cut-off ratio for identifying these firms. Based

on the sample split (full sample) and firm-level export data by product category, we determine exports

by export-oriented and domestic market firms for all categories of manufactured goods. Second, for all

other final and intermediate use categories, we disaggregate the rows proportionally for each category of

manufactured goods based on shares of export-oriented and domestic market firms in output of these

goods that is not exported. These shares are calculated from the data in the heterogeneous supply table.

This completes the column-wise and row-wise disaggregation of Belgium’s 2010 SUT into export-

oriented and domestic market firms in manufacturing industries as illustrated in tables 1 and 4. Tables 6

and 7 present the resulting heterogeneous SUT in a very aggregated form.

2.4      Deriving export-heterogeneous industry-by-industry input-output tables

For the transformation of SUT at basic prices into symmetric industry-by-industry IOT, we choose the

commonly used fixed product sales structure assumption (Model D in Eurostat, 2008). According to this


8
    For all other industries and all final demand categories, the split into goods and services of domestic origin and
    imports is the same as in the official use table.


                                                                                                                   11
assumption, “each product has its own specific sales structure irrespective of the industry where it is

produced” (Beutel, 2017, p.119). This comes down to assuming that an industry’s output of a product is

delivered to users in the same proportion as total economy-wide output of that product. 9

The heterogeneous industry-by-industry IOT that we derive from the heterogeneous SUT is given in very

aggregated form in table 8. The rows of this industry-by-industry IOT show the values of deliveries of

an industry’s output to the different users. The columns for industries indicate where they purchase their

inputs from, and their value added, i.e. they describe the industries’ cost structures.

2.5      Integrating the export-heterogeneous IOT for Belgium into a global table

The last step of our statistical work is to integrate the 2010 heterogeneous IOT for Belgium into a global

multi-regional input-output table (GMRIO) for the same year. Among the available GMRIOs, we have

chosen the global table from the 2016 release of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). 10 This 2010

World Input-Output Table (WIOT) is consistent with the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA 2008)

and covers 43 countries (including Belgium) and 56 industries in a classification that is compatible with

NACE Rev.2. 11 All values are in current dollars.

In a nutshell, the construction of a WIOT starts from publicly available national SUT, which are

complemented with international trade data from COMTRADE and combined into world SUT. The

industry-by-industry WIOT is derived from this world SUT based on the standard fixed product sales

structure assumption. The WIOT respects countries’ published national accounts aggregates (output and

value added by industry as well as totals of final demand by category), but the inner structure of the tables

is not consistent with published SUT or IOT of individual countries due to necessary transformations in

     See Eurostat (2008) for the mathematical expressions of the derivation of industry-by-industry IOT from SUT
     under the fixed product sales structure assumption.

     These tables can be downloaded for free from the website of the WIOD project: http://www.wiod.org/. Timmer
     et al. (2015) provides an introduction to WIOD data, and Timmer et al. (2016) contains a detailed description
     of the sources and methodology for constructing the world input-output tables (WIOT).

the course of the construction process (Dietzenbacher et al., 2013). This is problematic for our analysis

as we want to keep the structure of our export-heterogeneous Belgian table as it is when integrating it

into the WIOT. Edens et al. (2015) have developed a methodology for introducing a national table for

the Netherlands into the WIOT without changing these national data: they replace the input data for the

Netherlands by more detailed national data, which are actually a firm-level-data-based extension of the

most detailed official national SUT, and they replicate the construction process of the WIOT keeping

data for the Netherlands constant. A similar methodology has been applied for Belgium for the years

1995-2007 in Hambÿe et al. (2018). Here, we have opted for a shortcut compared to this thorough

method: we directly integrate the Belgian IOT into the 2010 WIOT. This is less cumbersome than the

method of Edens et al. (2015). As shown in Hambÿe et al. (2018) for the years 1995-2007, the main

difference between official national data and WIOT data for Belgium is in re-exports. This also holds

true for the year 2010.

We start off by converting our Belgian IOT into dollars based on the exchange rate used in WIOD

(1.3257$/€). As a second step, we use the Belgian firm-level data on exports and imports by partner

country to distribute imports and exports in our national tables over countries of origin and destination.

This includes determining the specific country distribution of exports and imports of export-oriented

manufacturers. For the distribution of Belgian exports over use categories in the destination countries,

we rely on data from WIOD on the use of imports from Belgium in these countries. In a third step, we

replace all domestic transactions, imports and exports for Belgium in the WIOT by data based on our

heterogeneous national IOT (including imports and exports distributed over countries and country-user

pairs obtained in the previous step). Then, we adjust the data for all other countries in the WIOT with a

RAS procedure. This yields a 2010 WIOT entirely consistent with national data for Belgium – we also

refer to this as the adapted WIOT – with a disaggregation of Belgian manufacturing industries into

export-oriented firms and domestic market firms.



                                                                                                       13
3.     Export heterogeneity in input-output tables: analysis

Input-output tables enable the analysis of production structures and value chains. With heterogeneous

tables, this analysis can be specifically focused on certain types of firms. In this section, we first compare

the direct cost structures of export-oriented and domestic market firms in Belgian manufacturing

industries. Then, we proceed to the analysis of their integration into domestic value chains based on the

national heterogeneous IOT and standard input-output models taking into account the full indirect cost

structures. Finally, we use the GMRIO tables with export heterogeneity for Belgian manufacturing to

look at the integration of export-oriented and domestic market firms into global value chains (GVC).

3.1    Differences in direct production cost structures

The IOT with exporter heterogeneity in table 8 reveals that export-oriented firms account for almost

three-quarters of total output of manufacturing industries but only for two-thirds of total manufacturing

value added. In other words, export-oriented manufacturers have a lower value added to gross output

ratio than manufacturing firms that mainly serve the domestic market (graph 1). Moreover, export-

oriented manufacturing firms do not only purchase more intermediate inputs compared to their gross

output, they also purchase proportionally more of their intermediate inputs from abroad. Indeed, as

illustrated in graph 1, imports make for almost 57% of total intermediate inputs of export-oriented firms,

while this share is just below 37% for firms mainly serving the domestic market. Hence, in line with

prior findings in the literature on firm heterogeneity and international trade, export-oriented

manufacturing firms in Belgium tend to rely more on imported intermediate inputs. Narrowing things

down to inputs from manufacturing, this import share becomes 65% for export-oriented firms and 51%

for firms that mainly serve the domestic market (graph 1). This corresponds to offshoring of

manufactured goods as originally defined in Feenstra and Hanson (1996). Export-oriented manufacturing

firms engage more into offshoring, which reflects the greater cross-border fragmentation of their

production processes. Graph 1 also reports values for these three indicators (value added to gross output

ratio, share of imports in total inputs and share of imports in total inputs from manufacturing) for the
14
whole of manufacturing based on the standard IOT for 2010. They turn out to be closer to the values for

export-oriented manufacturing firms due to the higher shares of this group of firms in the industry totals.

Based on the heterogeneous IOT and looking at intermediate input structures, graph 2 illustrates

differences between export-oriented and domestic market manufacturers in terms of their purchases from

domestic suppliers. More than half comes from other (service) industries for both groups. But domestic

market firms purchase relatively more of their intermediate inputs from other domestic market firms,

while export-oriented firms purchase relatively more from other export-oriented firms.

Finally, we also test for similarity of intermediate input structures at a more detailed level by calculating

the correlation between technical coefficients of export-oriented and domestic market firms in each

manufacturing industry. Technical coefficients are the result of a normalisation of an industry’s input

structure by its output, i.e. they indicate the amount of the different types of intermediate inputs required

per unit of output. The average correlation between intermediate input structures of export-oriented and

domestic market firms in the same industry is 0.707. This excludes industries for which we had to rely

on proportionality when determining the respective product distributions of inputs for export-oriented

and domestic market firms. The histogram in graph 3 shows the distribution of the correlation

coefficients. Among industries for which the input structure is not split proportionally, ‘Printing’ and

‘Manufacture of motor vehicles’ have the highest correlation coefficients (0.99) and ‘Manufacture of air

and spacecraft and parts thereof’ and ‘Manufacture of leather and related products’ the lowest (0.29), i.e.

export-oriented and domestic market firms have very similar intermediate input structures in the former

and relatively different ones in the latter.

3.2     Integration into domestic value chains

Input-output analysis goes one step further by taking into account the (indirect) intermediate input

requirements of suppliers. The underlying idea is to determine the effect of a final demand shock

(domestic final demand or exports) on economy-wide output or value added. The final demand shock

prompts a firm to expand the scale of its production process. The firm purchases more inputs from its
                                                                                                          15
suppliers, and, as a consequence, the firm’s suppliers also produce more output, for which they purchase

additional inputs from their suppliers. In turn, the suppliers’ suppliers produce more output and purchase

extra inputs, and so on. This gives rise to an upstream effect on output, i.e. through the increase in

purchases of intermediate inputs. Standard input-output analysis models the effect of such a demand

shock on the entire domestic production chain in terms of output, value added and employment generated

in the chain. Here, we focus on output and value added of export-oriented and domestic market firms.

In the input-output model, the total effect on output is measured by multiplying the shock by the Leontief

inverse matrix. This accounts for the magnitude of the shock and all extra output generated in domestic

supplying (upstream) industries. In a national IOT framework, the Leontief inverse matrix 𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑 , which is

also called total domestic requirements matrix, is calculated as follows:

        𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑 = (𝐼𝐼 − 𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑 )−1                                                                  (1)

where 𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑 is an industry-by-industry matrix of domestic technical coefficients and 𝐼𝐼 is an identity matrix

of the same dimensions as 𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑 . For any industry, domestic technical coefficients represent the shares of

inputs purchased from domestic supplying industries in its total output. The matrix 𝐴𝐴𝑑𝑑 is calculated as

𝑍𝑍 𝑑𝑑 ∗ 𝑦𝑦� −1 where 𝑍𝑍 𝑑𝑑 is the matrix of domestically-produced intermediate inputs and 𝑦𝑦� a diagonalised

                                            𝑑𝑑
vector of output by industry. Any element 𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 of the 𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑 -matrix represents domestic output by industry i

generated (directly or indirectly) by a one-euro final demand shock for output of industry j. The sum over

                                                                                   𝑑𝑑
all i (producing industries) is called the output multiplier for industry j (∑𝑖𝑖 𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). It indicates how many

extra euros of domestic output are generated (in all industries) through domestic intermediate input

purchases by a one-euro increase in final demand for output of industry j. The output multiplier is an

indicator of an industry’s backward integration into a country’s economy. 12




12
     Note that, in this national framework, imported intermediate inputs are not taken into account as they do not
     generate domestic output. Thus, industries that use relatively more domestically-produced intermediate inputs
     tend to have higher output multipliers.
16
                                                                      𝑑𝑑
Effects can also be calculated in terms of value added. Multiplying 𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 by industry i’s value added in

output share 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 yields the amount of value added generated in industry i by this shock to industry j’s final

                                                                                                    𝑑𝑑
demand. The value added multiplier corresponds to the sum over the producing industries (∑𝑖𝑖 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). It

indicates how many extra euros of domestic value added are generated (in all industries) through

intermediate input purchases by a one-euro increase in final demand for output of industry j.

Based on the 2010 heterogeneous national IOT for Belgium, we calculate output and value added

multipliers for export-oriented and domestic market firms in manufacturing industries. Overall results

are reported in graph 4, including those for total manufacturing based on the standard IOT. The average

output multiplier is substantially higher for domestic market firms than for export-oriented firms, i.e.

export-oriented manufacturers are less backward integrated into the Belgian economy. This finding

reflects the international fragmentation of their production process. They use more intermediate inputs

than domestic market manufacturers, but most of these inputs are imported, which implies that their

(domestic) output multiplier is lower. The value added multiplier for domestic market manufacturers is

also higher (0.58 against 0.43 for export-oriented manufacturers). Two underlying differences between

export-oriented and domestic market manufacturers drive this result. First, a one-euro final demand shock

to the output of export-oriented manufacturers generates less direct value added than an equivalent shock

to the output of domestic market manufacturers since the value added in output share is lower for export-

oriented manufacturers. Second, it also generates proportionally less output in domestic upstream

industries and hence also less value added. The output and value added multipliers for manufacturing

overall shown in graph 4 are closer to the multipliers for export-oriented firms. This is again due to the

higher weight of export-oriented firms in manufacturing industries.

Graphs 5 and 6 report output and value added multipliers by NACE Rev.2 A64 industry for export-

oriented and domestic market manufacturers (see list in the appendix). The output multiplier of export-

oriented manufacturers is lower for all but five manufacturing industries. Moreover, there is a large


                                                                                                           17
spread in the values of output multipliers: between 1.32 and 1.91 for domestic market firms and between

1.26 and 1.83 for export-oriented firms. The value added multiplier is lower for export-oriented firms

than for domestic market firms in all industries except for the pharmaceutical and the other transport

equipment industries (codes 21 and 30).

Finally, in input-output analysis, an industry’s integration into the domestic economy is considered not

only in terms of its purchases of domestically-produced intermediate inputs (upstream) but also in terms

of its deliveries of goods and services to other domestic (downstream) industries that use them as

intermediates. The former is referred to as backward integration or backward linkages of an industry and,

as mentioned above, can be measured by the output multiplier. The latter is referred to as forward

integration or forward linkages of an industry. Their calculation is based on the Ghosh inverse matrix:

      𝐺𝐺 𝑑𝑑 = (𝐼𝐼 − 𝐵𝐵 𝑑𝑑 )−1                                                              (2)

where 𝐵𝐵 𝑑𝑑 = 𝑦𝑦� −1 ∗ 𝑍𝑍 𝑑𝑑 is a matrix containing the shares of the (domestic) purchasing industries in the

output of the producing industry. Total forward linkages of industry i correspond to the sum of its row in
                                𝑑𝑑
the Ghosh inverse matrix (∑𝑗𝑗 𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and measure how a value added shock to industry i (directly and

indirectly) affects economy-wide output through the sales of industry i’s output as intermediate inputs to

other domestic industries. Hence, an industry with high total forward linkages “supplies a significant part

of its output as intermediate inputs to other industries” (Miller and Temurshoev, 2013, p.9).

Our calculations of this forward linkage indicator show that it is generally much lower for export-oriented

manufacturers than for domestic market manufacturers, i.e. forward integration into the domestic

economy is higher for domestic market firms. Export-oriented firms deliver relatively less of their output

to other domestic industries. However, exports may be used as intermediate inputs abroad. Hence, export-

oriented firms are likely to be integrated forward into global value chains rather than domestic value

chains. This cannot be identified based on a national IOT, which does not provide information on how

exports are used in destination countries, but requires a GMRIO.


18
Integration of export-oriented and domestic market manufacturers into Belgian domestic value chains is

summarized in the scatterplots of graph 7. Backward integration is shown on the horizontal axis and

forward integration on the vertical axis. Both are normalized with respect to the average for all

manufacturing industries. The scatterplot for manufacturing firms serving mainly the domestic market is

skewed more towards the top and right indicating a stronger integration into domestic value chains.

3.3      Foreign and domestic value added in exports

As production processes have become increasingly fragmented at the international level, a growing share

of international trade is trade in intermediate goods and services (Miroudot et al., 2009). Moreover,

greater fragmentation implies that many goods are shipped back and forth in the course of the production

process before being delivered to final consumers. Due to multiple border crossings, gross export flows

have increased faster than the underlying value added. These trends in international trade and production

have prompted researchers to look at the domestic and foreign value added shares in a countries’ exports

(Hummels et al., 2001; Koopman et al., 2014). The vertical specialization in trade (VS) share measure

defined by Hummels et al. (2001) represents “the value of imported inputs embodied in goods that are

exported” (p.76-77) as a share of gross exports. It is a widely-used indicator of the extent of the

international fragmentation of production processes and reveals how much foreign value added is

contained in a country’s exports. The VS share is calculated as 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚 𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑 𝑒𝑒/𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑒𝑒 where 𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚 is the matrix of

imported intermediate input coefficients, 𝑒𝑒 the vector of gross exports and 𝑖𝑖 a summation vector. Its

complement is the domestic value added in exports (DVAX) share (Koopman et al., 2014), calculated as

𝑣𝑣 ′ 𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑 𝑒𝑒/𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑒𝑒 where 𝑣𝑣 is a vector of industry-level value added in output shares. 13 Belgium’s VS share of

exports computed with the standard 2010 IOT amounts to 43.7%. In manufacturing, Belgium’s VS share

stands at the much higher level of 55.2%.



13
     The term 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚 measures the foreign share of output. In the context of calculations with a national IOT, it is
     taken to measure foreign value added in output. This ignores potential feedback effects that can only be taken
     into account with a global table (see section 3.4).
                                                                                                                    19
As emphasized in Piacentini and Fortanier (2015), “the use of homogeneous input-output tables (…)

assumes that imported inputs are used evenly in production for domestic sales and exports. If domestic

production is different from production for exports, i.e. the input-output structure of exporters is different

from the one of non-exporters, then the measure based on standard (IOT) is biased. The direction of the

bias is clear: as exporters make a more intensive use of intermediate imports than non-exporters, the

standard measure under-estimates vertical specialization (p.16).” Based on our export heterogeneous IOT

the overall VS share for Belgium amounts to 44.1% and for manufacturing to 56.0%. 14 Hence, the

downward bias of computing the VS share with the standard table is rather small. Nonetheless, computing

separate VS shares for export-oriented and domestic market firms reveals a large difference, which is

indeed driven by the difference in the intensity in the use of imported intermediates. The VS share is

57.2% for export-oriented manufacturers and 45.1% for domestic market manufacturers. 15

Three main factors have an influence on the VS share: a) the share of exports in total output, b) the value

added to output ratio, and c) the share of imports in total use of intermediate inputs (Piacentini and

Fortanier, 2015). By definition, export-oriented manufacturers have a higher share of exports in total

output. But the other two factors also play a role. Export-oriented manufacturers have lower value added

to output ratios, i.e. use proportionally more intermediates in their production process, and they rely to a

larger extent on imports when sourcing these intermediates. 16

As mentioned above, the complement of the VS share is the domestic value added in exports (DVAX)

share. Total domestic value added generated in Belgium in 2010 by exports amounts to 109.9 billion

euros, which corresponds to 55.9% of Belgium’s total gross exports (196.5 billion euros). We use the

heterogenous IOT to specifically decompose the domestic (Belgian) value added embodied in exports by

industry and firm types. Results are reported in table 9 with value added by types of firms in the rows

and exports by types of firms in the columns. As an example on how to read this table take the cell

corresponding to the second row in the first column: it contains the value added of domestic market

manufacturers generated by exports of export-oriented manufacturers. The table reveals several

interesting results. First, the exports of export-oriented manufacturers generate a total domestic value

added of 45.4 billion euros, of which more than half is value added of this group of firms. But their

exports also generate a substantial amount of value added in the rest of the Belgian economy: 17.1 billion

euros in other industries, which are mainly service industries, and 2.4 billion euros for domestic market

firms in manufacturing industries. Hence, Belgian service industries do actually participate in GVCs

through their deliveries to export-oriented manufacturers. Second, the exports of domestic market

manufacturers and firms in the other industries generate only very little value added for export-oriented

manufacturers. Again, this is related to the lesser integration of export-oriented manufacturers into the

domestic economy. Third, the exports of the other industries, mostly service exports, generate

comparatively less value added in manufacturing (for both export-oriented and domestic market firms).

Two characteristics of service industries contribute to this finding: they have a higher value added to

output ratio and services make for a larger share of the intermediates they purchase. The comparison of

column and row totals of table 9 shows, for export-oriented manufacturers, that the value added generated

in Belgium by their exports (45.4) is much higher than their value added due to total Belgian exports

(26.8). The opposite holds for domestic market manufacturers and firms in other industries. Adding the

imported content of exports, graph 8 sums up the sources of content in gross exports by types of firms.

Graph 9 provides a comparison of shares in gross exports and in domestic value added in exports and

reveals striking differences between groups of firms. Export-oriented manufacturers account for more

than half of Belgium’s total gross exports (54%) but only for a quarter of domestic value added generated

by exports (24%). Most of domestic value added in exports is generated in other industries, i.e. service




                                                                                                       21
industries (69%), while the share of these industries in gross exports is only 40%. For domestic market

manufacturers, shares in gross exports and domestic value added in exports are similar and low. 17

3.4      Integration into global value chains

Incorporating the Belgian export-heterogeneous IOT into the 2010 WIOT allows to look at how Belgian

export-oriented and domestic market manufacturers are integrated into and positioned within global

value chains. Such an analysis relies on a multi-regional input-output model. In essence, the multi-

regional model works the same way as the national model, but the scope of the effects is extended: the

multi-regional model takes into account not only purchases and sales of domestically-produced

intermediates but also purchases of intermediate inputs from abroad as well as deliveries to foreign

intermediate and final demand. In the standard Leontief model, all upstream effects are captured by the

elements of the multi-regional Leontief inverse matrix 𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 , which is calculated based on the multi-

regional matrix of technical coefficients 𝐴𝐴𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 :

        𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = (𝐼𝐼 − 𝐴𝐴𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 )−1                                                         (3)

Any element in this matrix represents the output of a country-industry pair that is generated by a one-

dollar 18 final demand shock to output of another country-industry pair. In this multi-regional set-up, a

final demand shock to the output of an industry in a country gives rise to domestic effects and effects in

other countries through imports of intermediates (spillover effects). Moreover, it may lead to feedback

effects for the country when the industry purchases intermediate inputs from foreign suppliers and these

foreign suppliers, in turn, purchase intermediate inputs from the country where the shock has occurred.

3.4.1 Vertical specialisation




17
     Graph A4 in the appendix also shows where the upstream effects of a shock to exports of export-oriented or
     domestic market manufacturers actually occur (in terms of output and value added). In line with the results
     reported above, the biggest part of the upstream effects occurs in the ‘other industries’, which mainly comprise
     service industries. Note that the composition of exports is different for the two groups of firms.
18
     While national tables for Belgium are labelled in euros, the WIOT is labelled in dollars. We decided to keep
     the original currency of the latter table.
22
In a multi-regional setting, the VS share is a measure of backward integration into GVCs. Its computation

is based on the 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 industry-country by industry-country matrix of value added embodied in exports.

        𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 = 𝑣𝑣�𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ∗ 𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ∗ 𝑒𝑒̂𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀                                         (4)

Here, 𝑣𝑣�𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 is a diagonalised vector of value added in output shares and 𝑒𝑒̂𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 a diagonalised vector of

gross exports for all country-industry pairs contained in the GMRIO table. The 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 matrix can be

divided into a domestic part 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑑𝑑 (on the block diagonal) and a foreign part 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 (off the block

diagonal). The column sum of the domestic part yields domestic value added in exports by country-

industry pair (𝑖𝑖 ′ ∗ 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑑𝑑 ) and the column sum of the foreign part yields foreign value added in exports

by country-industry pair (𝑖𝑖 ′ ∗ 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 ). By summing over industries for each country and dividing by

country-level gross exports, we obtain country-level DVAX and VS shares.

A comparison of VS shares for all 43 countries in the adapted WIOT reveals that Belgium is among the

countries with the highest shares, i.e. it is highly backward integrated into GVCs. This is illustrated in

graph 10. As reported earlier, Belgium’s VS share stands at 43.7% based on the standard (homogeneous)

national IOT and at 44.1% based on the heterogeneous national IOT. When recalculating VS shares with

the adapted 2010 WIOT, i.e. into which we have integrated our national IOT for Belgium, we obtain a

VS share of 43.2% without export heterogeneity and of 43.7% with export heterogeneity. 19 Table 10

summarises VS share results from different types of tables. In our setting where data for Belgium in the

GMRIO tables are entirely consistent with the national IOT, VS shares based on multiregional tables are

by definition lower than VS shares based on national tables. This is due to the feedback effects in the

multiregional model, which increase the domestic value added in exports and hence reduce the VS

share. 20 In practice, the difference between VS shares based on multiregional tables and VS shares based


19
     Belgium’s VS share calculated with the original 2010 WIOT amounts to 42.7%. Note also that Los (2017)
     reports a VS share of 46% for Belgium based on the 2011 WIOT.
20
     The consistency of Belgian data in the adapted WIOT with data from the national IOT for Belgium implies that
     industry-level value-added coefficients and gross exports for Belgium are identical in both tables. Hence,


                                                                                                                23
on national tables is small because feedback effects are small. Table 10 also highlights again that the

downward bias due to the use of standard rather than heterogeneous tables is rather small. But export-

oriented and domestic market manufacturers have very different VS shares as illustrated in table 11.

3.4.2 Global value chain participation

The VS share indicates how a country’s firms participate backward in GVCs, i.e. through purchases of

intermediates from abroad for producing exports. But they may also participate in GVCs by exporting

intermediate inputs that are then used (directly and indirectly) in the production of third country exports.

This alternative way of participating in GVCs was already identified in Hummels et al. (2001). These

authors suggested to measure such forward integration into GVCs by the VS1 share. In their definition,

it is calculated as the value of a country’s exports embodied in foreign countries’ exports divided by the

country’s gross exports. 21 In our set-up, a country-industry pair’s exports embodied in third country

exports corresponds to the row sum of the foreign part (off the block diagonal) of the 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 matrix

(𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 ∗ 𝑖𝑖). A country’s VS1 share is then obtained by summing over all industries for that country and

dividing by the country’s gross exports. 22

Both VS and VS1 shares for a country depend on its average position in GVCs: countries with a greater

share of downstream activities tend to have higher VS shares and lower VS1 shares, and vice-versa for

countries with more upstream activities. For a more comprehensive assessment of countries’ participation




     differences in national IOT-based and WIOT-based DVAX shares (and also VS shares) originate from
     differences between 𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑 and the Belgian domestic part of 𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 . As the national setting cannot account for
     feedback effects, the elements of 𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑 are always smaller than the elements of the Belgian domestic part of 𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀
     (see Round, 2001, and Koopman et al., 2010). Therefore, Belgium’s national IOT-based DVAX share is smaller
     than its WIOT-based DVAX share, and the opposite holds for Belgium’s VS share (see table 10).
21
     Computing this VS1 share requires information about the use of exports in the destination country, which is
     only available in GMRIO tables. Hence, it cannot be done with national IOT. This is why Hummels et al. (2001)
     were not able to compute the VS1 share they had defined.
22
     There is a slight methodological difference between the forward linkages that we have calculated with the
     national IOT and the forward integration into GVCs that we calculate with the adapted WIOT: the former is
     based on a Ghosh inverse matrix, while the latter is based on a (multi-regional) Leontief inverse matrix.


24
in GVCs, Koopman et al (2010) define the GVC participation index that sums the VS and VS1 measures

and is normalised by total country-level exports. 23

Graph 11 shows a comparison of the GVC participation index for all countries in the 2010 WIOT with a

split into the contributions of backward and forward integration. Again, Belgium is among the countries

with the highest values for this index, i.e. Belgium is highly integrated into global value chains, both

backward and forward. This result is in line with the results reported by De Backer and Miroudot (2014)

based on data from the OECD’s 2009 inter-country input-output (ICIO) table. Forward participation is

especially high for countries producing raw materials such as Australia, Norway and Russia. As a

consequence, these countries are higher ranked in terms of GVC participation than in terms of the VS

share. Overall, country size does seem to matter for these indicators with smaller countries having a

higher GVC participation index on average.

The integration of the export-heterogeneous IOT for Belgium into the 2010 WIOT allows to determine

contributions of export-oriented manufacturers, domestic market manufacturers and other industries to

Belgium’s participation in global value chains as shown in graph 12. The third stacked bar in the graph

indicates that Belgium’s participation in GVCs is due for 55% to export-oriented manufacturing firms,

for 38% to the firms in other industries and for the remaining 6% to domestic market manufacturing

firms. The first and second stacked bars illustrate the difference in how export-oriented manufacturers

and firms in other industries participate in GVCs. There is a clear distribution of the roles: export-oriented

manufacturers essentially participate in GVCs through their purchases of imported intermediate inputs

for producing exports (backward integration), while firms in other industries participate in GVCs mainly

through exports of intermediates for export production abroad (forward integration).




23
     De Backer et Miroudot (2014) highlight an issue of double counting for the GVC participation index: “[a]s
     domestically produced inputs can incorporate some of the foreign inputs, there is an overlap and potentially
     some double counting […]. Likewise, some foreign inputs can incorporate domestic value added exported in
     an earlier stage of the value chain (p.10)”.
                                                                                                              25
3.4.3 Position in global value chains

The set of GVC indicators is completed by two measures of the position of an industry or country in

global value chains: the number of embodied production stages and the distance to final demand. For

any industry in a country, the former indicates the average number of production stages up to the point

where the industry’s production activity takes place, while the latter indicates the average number of

production stages until its output becomes embodied in a good or service delivered to final demand.

These indicators of position are complementary with respect to vertical specialisation and GVC

participation, which measure how value chains are fragmented in terms of value added contributions.

Our main aim is to compare Belgian export-oriented and domestic market manufacturers in terms of

value chain position based on these two indicators. Accounting for export heterogeneity in manufacturing

does not significantly alter overall results for Belgium for these position indicators. 24

The number of embodied production stages indicator was initially proposed in Fally (2012). Its original

definition is recursive based on a weighted count of the number of embodied intermediates, i.e. it is a

measure of the length of the input chain of an industry’s production. 25 It can be shown that the calculation

boils down to computing the industry’s total backward linkages (Miller and Temurshoev, 2013). 26 Thus,

with a GMRIO table, it is computed as 𝑖𝑖 ′ ∗ 𝐿𝐿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 . If the production of an industry does not require

intermediate inputs, then the indicator is equal to one. Its value then increases with the number of

intermediate inputs used in an industry’s production process and their importance in that process (share

of intermediates in output). The use of GMRIO tables for calculating the measure allows to distinguish



24
     Computing the number of embodied production stages and the distance to final demand for Belgium with the
     homogeneous or heterogeneous adapted WIOT makes for a difference of 0.1% or less. Values for these position
     indicators based on the original WIOT differ by approximately 2% from values based on the adapted WIOT.
25
     The measure is sometimes also referred to as ‘value chain length’ (De Backer and Miroudot, 2014), but it should
     be kept in mind that it is a purely backward looking indicator, i.e. of the length of the input chain up to the
     industry’s production, and not of the entire value chain up to final demand. Miller and Temurshoev (2013) have
     independently developed the equivalent measure of ‘input downstreamness’. In an earlier contribution,
     Dietzenbacher and Romero (2007) proposed the more complex “average propagation length” measure.
26
     This is true because “the distance between any two stages of production is assumed to be one” (Miller and
     Temurshoev, 2013, p.10).
26
between the domestic and foreign embodied production stages. In terms of interpretation, De Backer and

Miroudot (2014) emphasize that with plant-level information the indicator would represent the actual

number of production stages. Given the relatively high level of aggregation of industries in GMRIO

tables, and in the WIOT in particular, the indicator calculated with such tables should rather be interpreted

as an ordinal measure for comparing countries or industries.

Averaging over industries with output weights, we find a slightly higher number of embodied production

stages for export-oriented manufacturers (2.89) than for domestic market manufacturers (2.72) as shown

in Table 12. This also holds for most individual manufacturing industries (graph 13) and is consistent

with our earlier finding that export-oriented manufacturers purchase more intermediates per unit of

output, i.e. outsource more. Moreover, export-oriented manufacturers have, on average, more foreign

embodied production stages than domestic market manufacturers (1.33 against 0.99) and less domestic

embodied production stages (1.56 against 1.73) as could be expected based on their respective import

shares. Graph 13 shows that this is also the case for almost all individual manufacturing industries.

Finally, the number of embodied production stages of the other industries (mostly services) is lower

(2.07), and most of their embodied production stages are domestic (1.60 against 0.47 for the foreign

ones). In terms of country ranking, graph 14 shows that, in international comparison, Belgium has an

above average number of embodied production stages.

The distance to final demand indicator was originally suggested by Fally (2012) and Antras et al.

(2012). 27 It is the forward-looking complement of the number of embodied production stages indicator.

Its calculation is a weighted count of the number of production stages until an industry’s output (initially

often sold for intermediate consumption) becomes embodied in a good or service delivered to final

demand. It turns out that it is equivalent to an industry’s total forward linkages (Miller and Temurshoev,




27
     Note that it has also been referred to as indicator of ‘upstreamness’ by these authors and as ‘output
     upstreamness’ by Miller and Temurshoev (2013).
                                                                                                          27
2013). In a GMRIO set-up, it is thus calculated for any industry by taking the row sum of the

multiregional Ghosh inverse matrix (𝐺𝐺𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ∗ 𝑖𝑖 where 𝐺𝐺𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = (𝐼𝐼 − 𝐵𝐵𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 )−1). The indicator takes a

value of 1 if all of an industry’s output is delivered to final demand, and it increases with the share of the

industry’s output that is delivered to other industries (i.e. intermediate demand) and with the number of

production stages (i.e. industries) involved until the output becomes embodied in a good or service

delivered to final demand. Industries with a higher distance value are also said to be more upstream and

industries with a lower value are said to be more downstream. 28 Again, values should be interpreted as

ordinal, i.e. for comparing countries or industries. Moreover, the use of GMRIO tables allows for a

distinction between a domestic distance to final demand and a foreign distance to final demand.

According to our results with industry distance values aggregated with output weights, manufacturing

industries in Belgium are on average more upstream with a distance value of 2.62 against 2.12 for the

other – mainly service – industries. This is consistent with the idea that, for example, basic metal products

are transformed in a greater number of production stages before reaching final customers than personal

services. Within manufacturing, export-oriented firms have a slightly higher distance to final demand

than domestic market firms (2.66 against 2.50, see table 12). For the former, the domestic and foreign

distance are identical (1.33), while for the latter domestic distance dominates (1.85 against 0.65). Graph

15 shows a large spread in distance to final demand across manufacturing industries in Belgium but only

small differences between export-oriented and domestic market firms. Finally, in terms of the country

ranking for distance to final demand, Belgium is slightly more specialised in upstream activities than the

world average (distance value of 2.25 against 2.20, see graph 16).




28
     As a caveat, Los (2017) points out that “the upstreamness of an industry (defined at a relatively aggregated
     level as in most global IO databases) can vary substantially across countries, due to the fact that an industry in
     a country can be specialized in the production of components, while the same industry in a different country
     can be specialized in assembly activities (which are downstream). (…) The apparently rather different activities
     carried out in these industries show that international fragmentation of production processes makes
     comparisons of industries with identical labels or codes increasingly difficult” (p.307).
28
4. Conclusions

The disaggregation of industries in SUT and IOT according to exporter status is considered as highly

desirable since it may actually reveal technological differences between firms within an industry defined

in terms of product similarity (OECD, 2015; Los, 2017). In this working paper, we describe the statistical

methodology for obtaining export-heterogeneous SUT and IOT for Belgium for 2010 and their

integration into a GMRIO table, and we present results from analyses based on these tables.

From a statistical point of view, our data-based split of manufacturing industries into export-oriented and

domestic market firms represents a clear improvement with respect to the proportionality assumptions

that most prior contributions in this field have relied on. This is true in particular for the product structures

of output and intermediate inputs of these two types of firms. Our work also illustrates a statistical

limitation in this respect: for a small country like Belgium, sample sizes may prove insufficient at the

most detailed industry level for such a data-based split of output and input structures. In our case, we

faced a trade-off between including minor exporters in the category of export-oriented firms and avoiding

proportionality in the estimation of product distributions for heterogeneous industries. Although this may

be less of an issue for larger countries, it represents a serious constraint for combined disaggregations of

SUT and IOT, e.g. for firm size and ownership.

The analyses based on the resulting national export-heterogeneous IOT reveal differences between ex-

port-oriented and domestic market firms in manufacturing industries in terms of input structures and

import patterns. Export-oriented manufacturers have lower value-added in output shares, and they import

proportionally more of the intermediates they use, i.e. their production processes are more fragmented,

in particular internationally. These results, obtained in a setting that is consistent with the national

accounts, confirm findings in prior analyses on firm heterogeneity in international trade (Melitz, 2003;

Bas, 2009). Furthermore, our input-output analyses show that export-oriented manufacturing firms are

less integrated upstream and downstream into the Belgian economy than domestic market firms, and that



                                                                                                              29
the exports of export-oriented manufacturers generate a substantial amount of value added in other

Belgian firms, in particular providers of services.

With the heterogeneous Belgian table incorporated into the WIOT, we obtain further insights on the roles

of the different types of firms in Belgium’s integration into global value chains. Export-oriented

manufacturers are the drivers of Belgium’s backward GVC participation, i.e. through imports of

intermediates for export-production, while the other firms push Belgium’s forward GVC participation,

i.e. by producing intermediates for other countries’ exports. Moreover, export-oriented manufacturers

participate in value chains that comprise, on average, a greater number of upstream and downstream

production stages and of which a greater share is located abroad.

The value chain analysis based on heterogeneous IOT highlights that the external competitiveness of

Belgian manufacturing depends not only on export-oriented manufacturing firms but also on

manufacturing firms that mainly serve the domestic market and supplier firms in service industries.

Export-oriented manufacturers need to be competitive on foreign markets and domestic suppliers have

to be competitive in the production of the inputs delivered to those export-oriented firms (internal

competitiveness). Hence, it is not sufficient to focus only on export-oriented firms. They are the

spearhead of participation in GVCs, but domestic upstream suppliers must also be taken into account.

Overall, for Belgium to reap the full benefits from exports, the entire value chains must be considered.
