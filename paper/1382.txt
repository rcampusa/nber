                      Pricing FHA Mortgage Default Insurance



                                     ABSTRACT



      The fair premia on FHA mortgage default insurance contracts are computed

under alternative assumptions regarding the expected house price inflation rate

and its variance and homeowner's default costs. The contracts considered vary

by amortization schedule (15 and 30 year level—payment mortgages and two

graduated—payment mortgages) and initial loan—to—value ratio (80 to 95.8

percent) .   The results indicate a wide variation in fair insurance premia.

Because FHA charges all borrowers the same premia, large cross—subsidies exist

within the program, with borrower's obtaining low loan—to—value or rapidly

amortizing loans subsidizing borrowers with high loan—to—value or negative

amortizing loans. Moreover, the movement toward insuring riskier loans ——

graduated payment, price—level adjusted and adjustable rate —— without
increasing insurance premia seems almost certain to lead to significant overall

losses for the program.

                    Pricing FHA Mortgage Default Insurance

                Donald F. Cunningham and Patric H. Hendershott


      In late 1976, FHA introduced the graduated—payment mortgage (GPM) under

Section 245(a) of the National Housing Act. In an effort to offer this

program to potential homebuyers who would not otherwise qualify, authority was

extended in 1980 to loans with lower down payments under Section 245(b) of the

act. In early 1983, FHA began insuring 15—year level—payment mortgages.

Obviously these three mortgages amortize at different rates than each other

and than the standard 30—year level payment mortgage and thus likely have

different default risk. Nonetheless, the FHA fee for default insurance on

these new instruments has been the same half percentage point charged on the

standard 30—year mortgage.1

      This study compares default risk on the FHA 245(b) GPM loan program and

the new 15—year level—payment mortgage with the standard 30—year level—payment

mortgage. The study provides measures of the appropriate FHA default

insurance premia in a competitive market under various assumptions regarding

the expected house price inflation rate and its variance. Our methodology is

an application of the Black and Scholes (1973) option pricing model as

modified by Brennan and Schwartz (1977) .   In   this procedure the insurance

premium is conceptualized as a put option sold by FHA and purchased by the

homebuyer for the default protection of the lender.2 Unlike private mortgage


1Legislation passed in late 1983 allows FHA to insure PLANs, SANs and ARNs.
Alternatives to the half point fee structure are also available, but none of
the possible structures differentiates between mortgage instruments. See
Pesando and Turnbull (1983) for a simulation analysis suggesting that all
non—level payment mortgages, except the SAN, are subject to greater default
risk than the level payment mortgage.

2For an instructive disussion of the pricing of default insurance, including
both references to the 'literature on the determinants of foreclosure and
thoughtful comments on the use of option models, see Swan (1982)

insurance, there is no residual default risk retained by the lender.

      This paper is divided into four sections. The first discusses household

default behavior, and the second describes the model for pricing default

insurance and procedures for obtaining price estimates. The third presents

and interprets the estimates and draws some implications for yields on

alternative fixed—rate conventional mortgages. A summary concludes the paper.



                        I. The Household Default Decision

      This section states the condition for borrower default and discusses

default or moving costs.



The Critical House Price and Default

      A household will default if its house price falls sufficiently that the

gains from default exceed the costs. The gains are the recapture of the

                             and the free rent earned between default and
negative equity (Mt —   H)
foreclosure, Rt. We assume this foreclosure period is one year. The costs of

default for the ith household are C. Thus default will occur in period t+1

if



                                 —        +
                                     Ht       P.   >
                                                       C.

We assume that the costs of default are a fraction, 0,      of   the house value (see

below) and that the free rent at the time of default is 10 percent of the

value of the house at that time. Then

 (1983) and Foster and Van Order (1984)

and   the critical house price below which the ith household will default is




                                                                                 (1)
                        Ft o. +


        All new mortgages are assumed to be priced two points below par. The

outstanding mortgage balance over time is easily computed from the initial

house price and loan—to—value ratio and standard outstanding balance formulae.

        The uncertain variable is the house price. Changes in house prices are

assumed to be normally distributed with mean q and standard deviation o. The

level of house prices is then lognormally distributed with mean in period t of

HetP, where H is the initial house price and t                     =q   +   The lognormal

probability density function is




          f (H) =




         The fraction of households that will have defaulted by time t is the

integral of the lognormal probability density function from 0 to




               F(t/H)

plus the fraction of households that defaulted in earlier periods (had Ht.<

Ht.) but would now have house prices greater than Ht.



Household Costs of Default

      The costs of default vary widely across households depending on the best

housing alternatives available to them, the laws of the jurisdiction in which

they reside, and their 'psychological aversion" to default. Say that the

psychic costs are zero, the jurisdiction does not allow recourse to other

assets the household has, and the optimal housing choice is renting a unit in

the same geographical area. The costs are then only those of locating the

rental unit and moving the family belongings. At most, these costs might be 5

percent of the house sold.

      Costs will be greater if the optimal housing choice is purchasing

another house. Say that due to the default the household will be unable to

obtain mortgage credit for ten years. The costs of default increase by the

present value of the advantage of owning over renting for the next ten years.

Even if a mortgage can be obtained, costs are greater than in the rental—

optimum case. First, the house must be purchased and thus brokerage fees must

be paid. On the assumption that the house purchased is the same value as that

sold, these costs might be 7 percent of the house sold. Second, the household

must pay for insurance on a new mortgage, if one is obtained, and must put

some equity down, equity that is at risk. Because the former house had less

value than the outstanding mortgage, the household had complete protection

against house price declines; that protection does not exist on repurchases

after default.
                                          —5—



       The costs of default, when owning another house is the best housing

alternative, can be modeled conceptually. If owning would provide an after—

tax advantage of a1I-1÷. for each year the ith household is forced to forego

ownership and there are m such years, then this component of default costs is




                  a1He = Htai2eJ                  =
                                                      (ADVi)Ht,      (2a)
              j=l




where r is the borrower's after—tax discount rate.5 If, on the other hand,

the purchase of another house is viable, an estimate of the cost of accepting

downside house—price risk is needed. Assume that the household equity

finances the house and expects to hold it for n years. The cost of downside

risk is the present value of the difference in the expected house price in

period t+n where the house price distribution is truncated at Ht (guaranteeing

against price decline) and the expected price without truncation. This value

is




         Ht                Ht



     [Ht f
              f(H)dH   —
                           f    Hf(H)dH]ern
                                              =
                                                  (PRO)Ht.           (2b)




5The ADV term is also affected by the tax consequences of default (as C.F.
Sirmans reminded us) .      If
                          the potential defaulter is a first—time buyer, then
he would receive rg(H — M ) from the Treasury upon default, where ig is the
homeowner's capital gins ax rate. That is, tax consequences mitigate the
cost of foregoing homeownership. On the other hand, if the potential defaulter
had earned a substantial deferred capital gain on an earlier house purchase, a
tax payment could be due.
                                           —6—




This might appear to be an underestimate of the cost if some risky debt

finance is employed because lenders/insurers will have to charge a greater fee

than the cost of the house value declining below the mortgage owing to both

the lost interest and maintenance during the foreclosure period and the costs

of selling the house. However, households gain the possibility of receiving

rent—free housing for a year in return for the higher cost.

        Finally, households with attachable assets and/or psychological aversion

to default will have higher costs than other households regardless of the

optimal housing choice.

        All of the factors can be combined into a general expression for default

costs for the ith household in period t as



                           C = (.05   +    ÷
                                               )Ht                       (3)




                 0                renters by choice

where      =                      forced to rent
               ADVt
               .07 + PRO          owners



and      reflects the costs owing to attachable assets and/or noneconomic

aversion to default.

        Given that the household originally chose to own, it will still wish to

own in the absence of changes in the relative costs of owning and renting.

Thus in our ex ante analysis with the only uncertainty being house prices,

there are not households who would be renters by choice after default.

        For purposes of evaluating the default costs of households who would be

forced to rent or would continue to own, we assume q =    0.05,   a2 = 0.01 (and

thus i   = 0.055) and r = 0.11.    Assuming a forced tenancy period of 6 to 10
                                     —7—




years [evaluating (2a) for m6 and 10 and a1=0.01], those forced to rent give

up 0.05 to 0.075 of the house price for each percentage point   advantage    owning

gives over renting. For households using FHA financing in a period of high

real interest rates, a one to two percentage point advantage seems reasonable.

For the higher tax—bracket households that utilize conventional financing, the

advantage could be greater. Adding the 0.05 basic default cost and letting

range from 0.05 to 0.10, the cost of default for these households would range

from roughly 15 to 30 percent of the value of the house.6 The cost of

downside risk (PRO) for households that can continue ownership is only 1 to 2

percent of the value of the house, looking 4 to 8 periods into the future

[evaluating (7b) for n = 4 and 8]. Allowing for risk aversion and possible

difficulties in coming up with the new downpayment might make the effective

cost 3 percent. The sum of the basic default cost of 0.05, the 0.07 broker's

fee, the 0.03 and a   ranging from 0.05 to 0.10 gives a cost of default for

these households of 20 to 25 percent of the value of the house. We rewrite

(4) as




                 C = ØHt                                              (3')




where 0 ranges from 0.15 to 0.30.




    a period of lower real (after—tax) interest rates, default costs (the ADV'
term) would be greater for two reasons. First, an increase q (and thus p) or
a decrease in r lowers the real discount rate and thus raises the.present
value of the advantages of homeownership foregone for any given a1 (the annual
advantage to homeownership). To illustrate, a q of 0.08 or r of 0.075 raises
the cost for a0.01 from the 0.05 to 0.075 range to roughly 0.055 to 0.088.
Second, with a lower real after—tax rate, the annual advantage of
homeownership will be greater. The upper end of range of default costs could
well rise to 45 percent.
                                     —8—



      In the above evaluation of default costs (0), households have been

assumed to have the option of remaining in their houses in the absence of

default. If households should have to move, then the moving costs attribu-

table to default are reduced. Most obviously, the O.O5Ht costs of locating a

rental unit and moving the family belongings do not deter default. In

addition, many of these households will be 'forced' to rent temporarily until

their finances are again in order. Thus, only part of the ADV loss is

attributable to default. Finally, the costs of selling their existing houses

adds an incentive to default because these costs are avoided by default. With

these costs equal to O.O7Ht and the reduction in ADV attributable to default

equal to O.O3HtI default costs for those who have to move are reduced by

O.lSHt. Thus 0 would range between 0 and 0.15 for such households.7



                   II. The Simulation Model and Procedures

      FHA or mortgage insurers/lenders can charge for expected default losses

in a one—time up front fee, a higher mortgage coupon rate, or some combination

of the two. From the above analysis, expected losses on any mortgage contract

depend on both the likelihood of default and the expected loss associated with

it, i.e., on the "known" mortgage path and the probabilities of alternative

house price paths, as well as household default costs. Let the fair price for

a mortgage insurance contract be denoted by I. Initially, I is the price of

a contract that would be offered to borrowers under specific assumptions

regarding the mean and variance of house price inflation, the interest rate,




7Default risk on ARMs is thus higher than on FRMs because a jump in interest
rates might force households with ARMs to move. For another reason, also
related to the differential impact of increases in interest rates, why default
risk is greater on ARMs, see note 12.
                                       —9—



the initial loan—to—value ratio, the mortgage amortization schedule and

household default costs. Over time,         reflects the price an insurer would

have to pay another insurer to take over the default contract.

      In competitive markets, insurance contracts can only be sold for a fair

premium. That is, arbitrage profits could not be earned by simultaneously

taking an equivalent position (either long or short) in the house against

which the insurance is written. In what follows, we hypothesize that FHA

desires to charge this fair premium. Our task, then, is to derive a pricing

equation for I that is consistent with zero arbitrage profits. The technique

is to have a household form a riskiess hedge consisting of the purchase of a

partially debt—financed house and the appropriate number of insurance

contracts on the mortgage. The investment in this hedge —— the downpayment on

the house plus the outlay for mortgage insurance contracts —— must then earn

the riskiess rate of return (r).

      Borrowing from the logic of Black and Scholes, the hedged position

consists of the purchase of a house and ''H insurance contracts, where the

subscript denotes a partial derivative. 'H is negative ——        the   amount one

would have to pay another insurer to assume the contract rises as the house

value falls —— and is more negative the greater is the loan—to—value ratio.

Thus fewer contracts are purchased if a lower downpayment is made. The hedge

requires an equity investment of H —   M   —
                                               ''H'   where M is the book value of

the mortgage.

      We assume the hedge could be continuously adjusted according to the

changes in the ratio 1'H' making it a perfect hedge. In the absence of

taxes, the return on the housing purchase consists of the change in the house
                                                     —10—



price (dH) plus net operating income (denoted by sH). The cost of the fully

insured mortgage is simply the risk—free rate under the assumption of constant

interest rates, and the return on the insurance is just dl. Thus we can write

the total return to the equity position as



                   dH + sHdt — rMdt —                        = (H — M —
                                                     dI/IH                I/IH)rdt.   (4)




Note that the terms in M cancel.

      The risk of investing in the house (or in insuring it) is assumed to lie

solely in uncertainty regarding future house prices. Changes in the price of

the house are assumed to follow the diffusion process:




                             qdt +        xiz,                                        (5)




where q is the drift term, dz is a Weiner process, and a2 is the instantaneous

variance of the house price. If I is a smooth function of H, it then follows

from Ito's lemma   that I is also an Ito process and can be expanded in the
following form:


                    dl   =
                             1H'      +
                                          Idt +                                       (6)




Substituting (6) into (4) ,        simplifying         and replacing r—s with q results in:



                         =   rI   —
                                      HI         —                                    (4')




the partial differential equation governing equilibrium insurance premia in a

world without taxes. It is shown in the appendix that q = r—s in a taxiess

world and that (4') also holds in a world with taxes. We confirm that the

hedge is perfect because the stochastic term (IHdH) in (6) is successfully

eliminated, leaving the insurance premium a function of only observable

parameters.

       We utilize the Brennan and Schwartz (1977) finite difference procedure

to approximate a solution to equation (4'). For each partial derivative, we

substitute a central difference approximation, and the algorithm is taken over

discrete increments in the house price for months between the present and the

date the insurance contract expires. The key boundary condition for the

solution is that if the house price hits the critical value               defined in (1)

the household defaults and the insurance contract takes on the value of the

insurer's loss.8 This loss is the mortgage balance plus accrued interest

during the foreclosure period less the house value at the time of default

(adjusted for the absence of maintenance during this period and for selling
                                                                            F'


costs).   We take the loss, and thus the value of I upon default (I), in period

t to be



          = (1.15 Mt — .85 Ht)er =   [1.15   —   .85/(.9   +

The loss is discounted by one period owing to the assumed one year foreclosure

lag.




8Other obvious boundary conditions are that I is nonnegative and equals zero
as Ht approaches infinity.

                                 III.   Price Estimates

      Three sets of price estimates are reported below. All provide one—time

prices as a percent of the initial mortgage balance and (approximate) annual

equivalent fees as a percent of the outstanding mortgage balance. Estimates

are provided for four types of mortgages (15 and 30 year level payment and the

two 245b GPM programs) and four loan—to—value ratios (80, 88, 92 and 95.8

percent). The highest of these ratios is based upon the minimum downpayment a

household could make on a $60,000 house in early l983.

      Section A provides results for the basic parameterization. This

includes an expected inflation rate (q) of 0.05 and a house price variance

(a2) of 0.01.10 The mortgage rate is taken to be 13 percent, and the risk—

free rate to be 11½   percent.    This difference reflects the existence of

prepayment risk.11 The sensitivity of the insurance prices to alternative

parameter values is considered in Section B, and an extension to the

conventional mortgage market is given in Section C.

      Before getting to the actual estimates, a few caveats are in order.

Because we have not modeled interest rate uncertainty, the one—time estimates

of fair default fees are on the high side. If interest rates should rise

significantly, the market value of the mortgage debt declines and households,



9At that time the minimum downpayment on the first $25,000 of house financed
by FHA was 3 percent; on larger amounts the minimum was 5 percent. Thus the
maximum loan on a $60,000 house was .97($25,000) + .95($60,000 — 25,000).
Under new legislation the required 5 percent downpayment will not go into
effect until $50,000.

10Asay (1978) estimated a house price variance rate of 0.0142 for the period
1966 to 1977 in southern California. Recently, Foster and Van Order (1984)
found a house price variance of 0.0081 to provide the best fit for their
default model using FHA data from the 1960s and l970s.

11Buser and Hendershott (1984) show that the price of this risk, when charged
for in the mortgage coupon rate, is virtually identical for the four different
mortgage instruments covered.
                                      —13—



being reluctant to give up what would then be below—market financing, are less

likely to default.12 This gain in reduced default probability is not fully

offset by the cost of increased default probability if interest rates should

decline because, if the decline is sufficient, households will avoid the

higher market value debt by refinancing. There is an offsetting factor at

work in the calculation of the annualized default fees, however. The fees are

computed assuming payment over a full 12 year period. Should the loan be

terminated (called or defaulted upon) prior to the twelve year, then the fees

earned are insufficient to cover the present value of expected losses. Thus

there is not reason to believe that the annualized fees are necessarily too

high.




                              A. The Basic Results

        Table 1 contains the prices for three different values of the default

cost parameter, 0. Of course, the fees, both one—time and annualized, are

higher the greater the loan—to—value ratio, the less rapidly the mortgage

amortizes, and the lower the default costs. In general, raising the default

costs from 0.15 to 0.225 cuts the fair insurance fee by 65 percent for the

15—year mortgage, 50 percent for the 30—year level—payment mortgage and 40

percent for the graduated—payment mortgages. For the specific parameter

values assumed, FHA's half point fee on the 30—year level—payment mortgage

seems to be roughly correct for a 95 percent loan—to—value ratio.




12For this reason, default risk on FRMs is less than that on ARMs (the amount
less being greater the shorter the adjustment period and the less restrictive
the caps on the ARM) . See note 7 for another reason related to differential
impacts of interest rate increases.
                                      —14—




      To facilitate an understanding of how insurance premia ought to vary

across loan—to—value ratios, the data in Table 1 have been standardized around

the 92 percent ratio in Table 2. That is, all one—time fees for each type

mortgage have been divided by the fee for the 92 percent loan. These data are

consistent with von Furstenburg's early (1970) discussion of cross—subsidies

within the 30—year level—payment FHA program. More specifically, if the 50

basis point fee were correct for a 92 percent loan—to—value ratio, then only

30 basis points should be charged on a 88 percent loan and 10 basis points on

an 80 percent loan. In contrast, at least 80 basis points should be charged

on a 95.8 percent loan. These differences are smaller for less rapidly

amortizing loans (GPMs) and larger on more rapid ones (the 15—year level

payment) .   Note, finally, that the variation in the fair premia across loan—
to—value ratios is independent of the costs of default.

      Analysis of how insurance fees ought to vary across mortgage instruments

is facilitated by standardizing the data in Table 1 around the 30—year level—

payment mortgage (all one—time fees for a given loan—to—value ratio are

divided by the fee for the 30—year level—payment mortgage). The variation in

fair premia is enormous. Except for very high loan—to—value ratios and low

default costs, the premia on graduated—payment mortgages are twice those on

the 30—year level—payment mortgage. For 80 percent GPMs, fair premia are

three to five times as large. The far greater proportional difference is due

to the fact that the default option on the 80 percent 30—year level payment

mortgage is virtually "out of the money," while GPMs, especially that with

rising payments for 10 years, is still in the money. The premia on the 15—

year mortgage, in contrast, is less than half that on the 30—year level—

payment mortgage and, for lower loan—to—value ratios and high default costs,

is less than a quarter as large.

                        B. Alternative Inflation Senarios

       The premia in Table 4 indicate the sensitivity of the fair premia to the

assumed expected inflation senario. Because the variance of inflation is

known to be positively associated with its level, the variance parameter is

changed along with the inflation rate.'3 Premia are reported for q = 0.02

(c =   0.006) and q = 0.08   (
                                 = 0.014)   ,   as well as the base case of q = 0.05
   =   0.01).   With the standard 30—year mortgage, premia are marginally lower

at higher inflation (and variance) rates and higher at lower inflation rates.

        Tables 5 and 6 are similar to Tables 2 and 3 in that they illustrate the

sensitivity of the premia for different parameters (inflation and its variance

now, rather than default costs) across loan—to—value ratios and mortgage

instruments by standardizing the premia on the 92 percent loan—to—value ratio

and the standard 30 year mortgage, respectively. As can be seen in Table 5,

the premia across loan—to—value ratios are insensitive to the level of

inflation. In contrast, the data in Table 6 indicate considerable mortgage—

instrument sensitivity to inflation changes. More specifically, the faster

the mortgage amortization, the more declines in expected inflation raise

default premia and increases in expected inflation lower them. In fact, while

the premium on the standard 30—year mortgage is negatively related to the

level of expected inflation (see Table 4), the premium on the 15—year mortgage

is positively related to inflation.

        The data in Table 7 provide another example of the importance of the

amortization path. Table 7 contains the fair premia for all the mortgages and

all the loan—to—value ratios for both 9 and 13 percent mortgage rates. In

each case, the risk—free rate is 1½ percentage points below the mortgage rate,


13Parks (1978) documents a positive relationship between the variance of the
inflation rates of the 12 major consumption expenditures categories in the
U.S. NIPA and the square of the aggregate consumption inflation rate.
                                      —16—



the expected inflation and variance rates are 0.05 and 0.012, and default

costs are set at the high 0.3 value. Even though the inflation rate is

identical, the insurance fees are uniformly lower for all instruments at the 9

percent rate because of the increased principal amortization. Fees on the

15—year mortgage are reduced the most, approximately 30 percent, followed by

the fees on the GPMs which are reduced by about 20 percent. Fees on the

standard 30—year mortgage are lowered by only about 5%. These results

correspond directly to the effect on principal amortization over time for each

instrument. To illustrate, after five years the decreases in the outstanding

principals on the three mortgages when the coupon rate is 9 percent, relative

to when the rate is 13 percent, are 6 percent, 5 percent and 2 percent

respectively.



                C. An Extension to the Conventional Mortgage Market

      In the conventional mortgage market, default risk is absorbed by lenders

or shared by them and private mortgage insurers. All residential mortgages

with initial loan—to—value ratios above 90 percent must carry private mortgage

insurance, and, in practice, mortgages with loan—to—value ratios above 80

percent are so insured. This insurance typically covers the top 12% to 20% of

mortgage claims; any residual risk is borne by the lenders. For initial

loan—to—value ratios of 80 percent or less, lenders typically bear all default

risk and pass the cost on to borrowers in the form of higher effective

mortgage coupon rates.

      The price (cost) of default risk that borrowers should be charged on 80%

conventional loans is precisely the same fee that FHA should charge for a 80%

loan—to—value ratio mortgage. Thus, computation of the fair default premium

that should be built into 80% conventional mortgage rates is the same as
                                      —17—



computation of the fair FHA fee on such loans.14 These premia were reported

in Tables 1 and 4 and are summarized as ranges in Table 8 for the different

mortgage instruments. The "reasonable range" data in the far right column

indicate   that the default risk on 80% loan—to—value loans is negligible for

the 15—year mortgage, is minor for the standard 30—year mortgage and is

significant for the GPMs. That is, coupon rates on the standard mortgage

should contain only a 10 basis point premium, while those on the GPMs should

have a premium of a quarter to a half percentage point.15 Of course, these

calculations assume accurate house price appraisals, an assumption that might

be tenuous in a period dominated by builder buy—downs and other creative

financing techniques.



                                   IV. Summary

        An occupant of a house financed by mortgage debt will default on the

debt if the gains from doing so exceed the perceived costs. There are two

gains from default: the recapture of the negative equity in the house (the

difference between the value of the mortgage and the value of the house) and

the free rent that can be obtained between the time of default and actual

foreclosure. The costs of default, covered by the term "moving costs,"

include dollar and psychic costs of moving, as well as losses of attachable

assets and credit rating, to the extent they are relevant. Of course, if the

household has to move (owing to an inability to make the mortgage payments or


14Further, the difference between the fair fee on 95.8% FHA loans and the fee
on 80% loans is a close approximation to the fee private mortgage insurers
should change for 16% coverage on 95% loan—to—value loans. That is, the sum
of the fee for coverage from 95% to 80% (16 percent of 95) and the residual
fee on the remaining 80% is the same (approximately) as the fee on a 95.8%
loan.

15Note from Table 7 that the premium on GPMs would be lowered by a quarter to
a third if the market mortgage rate were to decline from 13 to 9 percent.
                                    —18—



a shift to a job in another location), then the costs of default are greatly

reduced because many of the moving costs must be paid whether or not default

occurs. Our analysis of moving costs suggest that they are proportional to

the value of the house at the time default is being considered and that the

factor of proportionality ranges between 0.15 and 0.3 for most households.

      Expected default losses on any mortgage contract depend on the

likelihood of default and the expected losses associated with its occurrence.

Both are functions of the known mortgage path, the probabilities of

alternative house price paths, and household moving costs. Mortgage insurance

premia should cover the expected default losses. Following the logic of Black

and Scholes, we derived a partial differential equation governing this premia.

The critical issue to evaluation of the equation is determining when default

occurs. If the insurance were a pure put option, then default would occur

when the value of the insurance equaled the negative equity in the house.

However, we have shown that the borrower's default decision is driven by his

moving costs. As a result, default will not occur until significant negative

equity occurs.

      Insurance premia were calculated for four mortgages —— 30 and 15 year

level payment (LPMs) and 30 year graduated payment (GPMs) with 5 and 10 year

graduation at 7.5 and 4.9 percent per annum, respectively —— and for four

loan—to—value (LV) ratios —— 95.8 (very high ), 92   (high) ,   88 (moderate) and

80 (low) percent. While FHA charges the same premium for all mortgages and

LV5, our calculated fair premia vary widely, suggesting substantial cross—

subsidies in the FHA program. In a 5 percent expected inflation environment,

very high LV 30 year LPMs are 65 percent riskier than high LV loans. Moderate

and low LV loans are 40 and 80 percent less risky, respectively. To

illustrate, the 95.8 percent loan is nearly four times as risky as the 88
                                         —19—



percent loan and thus should have four times as large an insurance premium.

(These differences are up to twice as great for the 15 year mortgage and

somewhat smaller for GPMs.) All differences are quite insensitive to the

assumed level of default costs and to changes in the inflation (and variance)

rates. The cross—subsidies among 30—year LPM borrowers are substantial

because there is, in fact, wide variance in loan—to—value ratios of FHA

borrowers. In the 1980—82 period, for example, 40 percent of borrowers had

loan—to—value ratios below 90 percent (nearly 20 percent had ratios of 80

percent or less) ,   while   30 percent had ratios of 95 percent or higher. Our

estimates suggest that half of the premia of the former are, on average, used

to subsidize the latter.

      Looking across mortgage instruments, at moderate and very high LVs, GPMs

are generally 2 to 3 times as risky as the 30 year LPM. Moderate and high LV

10 year GPMs are even riskier for households with high default costs, and low

LV 10 year GPMs are 4 to 6 times as risky. On the other hand, the 15 year LPM

is 50 to 80 percent less risky than the 30 year LPM, with the differences in

riskiness being greater for lower LV loans and for households with high

default costs. Thus expanding the mortgage menu further increases the

possible magnitude of cross—subsidies. This expansion, particularly when it

includes riskier PLAM and ARM loans, could also lead to substantial net FHA

losses.

      The default risk on 80 percent LV loans is roughly the residual risk of

lenders in conventional loan markets (the greater risk on higher LV losses is

borne by private mortgage insurers). These expected default losses must be

recovered via higher mortgage coupon rates. Our analysis suggests that an

extra 5 to 15 basis point charge is sufficient on the standard 30 year LPM.
                                    —20—



For the 15 year LPM, the charge is less than 5 basis points, but for the GPMs,

the appropriate charge is 15 to 60 basis points, with the 10 year GPM

requiring the largest fee.

                                       Appendix:

Taxes, Service Flows and the Equilibrium Insurance Premium

      In a world of taxes, the formation of the hedge position in houses and

insurance contracts will generate an aggregate after—tax return. If we

decompose this return, we see that each component will be taxed at a different

rate and will depend on who forms the hedge. Gains and losses from the house

appreciation would be taxed at the capital gains rate of Tq changes in the

value of the insurance contracts would be taxed at the ordinary rate of T, and

the after—tax service flow from the house, which now includes the depreciation

tax shield, will reflect the tax rate on ordinary income of the marginal

landlord. In equilibrium, the after—tax rate of service flow (s') can be

expressed as



                  s'      (l—i)r —   (l—T )q.                               (a)
                                        q


In a no tax world, s' =   s = r—q.

      With the introduction of taxes, the government becomes a partner in the

equity position. It shares Tq of the risk of house price appreciation and T

of the risk of the insurance contract. Therefore, the perfect hedge position

requires the purchase of (l_Tq)/IH(l_T) insurance contracts for each house

purchased. The equity position would then earn the after—tax riskless rate.

As a result, the tax analogue to (1) ,      after   canceling the mortgage terms, is:
                                                —22—




dH(lTq) + s'Hdt
                    —
                        dI(lT) (l_Tq)/IH(lt)           =   [H_I(l_Tq)/IH(l_T)]r(lT)dt.   (b)




         Substituting (3) into (b) and simplifying results in:




                          =   rI       [(1_i) -
                                                               -
                                                  (l_T)]HIH


If we now substitute the expression for the equilibrium service flow (a) into

(b') ,   we discover that all the tax variables are eliminated and the partial

differential equation governing the equilibrium insurance premium is simply:



                          =   rI   -
                                       HI   -                                      (b)



This is the same expression as the no-tax model (1'). s long as the marginal

real estate investor forms the hedge position, the specific tax rate of this

investor is irrelevant owing to the adjustment of the equilibrium service flow

and the hedge ratio to this investor's tax bracket.
