Student Loan Choice Overload

NBER Working Paper No. 25905

JEL No. D12,D14,D91,H31,I22

                                           ABSTRACT

What influences college student borrowing? In a field experiment with a large community
college, we send emails about federal student loans to students who have received information
about financial aid but have not made a borrowing decision. A treatment reminding students that
they need not borrow the maximum amount of available loan aid does not affect borrowing.
Treatments referencing amounts borrowed by recent graduates shift students from borrowing the
maximum amount to not borrowing. Consistent with the hypothesis that students experience
choice overload when observing multiple dollar amounts, the response is largest among low-
performing students and arises from inaction.

1         Introduction

Outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. has grown steadily over the past decade, exceeding
$1.46 trillion by the end of 2018 (Federal Reserve Bank of New York 2019). While estimated
returns to college completion suggest that borrowing to finance college is optimal for the
average young adult (Avery and Turner 2012), the returns to educational investments are
uncertain, and some students might take on debt without generating offsetting increases in
human capital or post-college earnings.1 Concerns that students are making uninformed
borrowing decisions have led to calls for increased counseling, information, and guidance.2
Such efforts are predicated on the assumption that additional information about loan options,
terms, and future payments can help improve borrowers’ decisions and financial well-being,
but existing research provides mixed evidence on whether students benefit from information
about borrowing options, outstanding loan debt, and expected repayments.
        To help fill this gap, we present evidence from a field experiment in which students at a
large, anonymous community college (hereafter, LACC). Our experimental treatments are
designed to test between two models that could explain the fact that most students either
forgo federal student loans or choose an amount exactly equal to the nonbinding loan “offer”
listed in their financial aid award letters, whether or not the offered amount is the maximum
amount available (Marx and Turner 2019). First, students could be inattentive to the fact
that they can choose a different loan amount. Accordingly, our first treatment provides a
reminder that students need not borrow the offered amount. Second, students could view
the offer as a recommendation of the optimal loan size, leading to anchoring or updating
one’s own belief towards this amount. To test this, two additional treatments reference the
    1
     In recent years, however, over half of all borrowers had not paid down even $1 of their debt two years
after entering repayment, and 20 percent had defaulted on their loans within five years of repayment entry
(Looney and Yannelis 2015).
   2
     For example, the 2018 PROSPER Act would have allowed institutions to require students to complete
additional counseling before borrowing through federal loan programs, while the 2019 Know Before You Owe
Act would require institutions to inform student borrowers of their likely income and monthly student loan
payments (based on program of study and estimated loan debt at graduation) and include a statement that
the student can borrow less than the amount of loan aid displayed in their financial aid award letter.



                                                    2
unconditional ($800) or conditional ($3000) mean annual amount borrowed by past LACC
graduates. We then test whether the reference-point treatments cause students to shift
towards the (lower) reference points.
   Our results indicate that students understand they have a choice over their loan amount
but are easily overwhelmed by this choice. The reminder of the option to borrow less than
the offered amount had no effect on loan take-up or the amount borrowed, suggesting that
students were already aware of this possibility. Neither reference-point treatment led students
to borrow the referenced amount, suggesting that students did not view the behavior of recent
graduates as providing a useful reference point. Most striking, we find that both reference-
point treatments reduced the probability that a student borrowed at all by 11 percent.
The probability of borrowing the maximum available amount also falls by approximately
11 percent, suggesting that the reference-point treatments induce students who would have
borrowed the maximum amount to instead borrow nothing.
   We argue that students’ response to receiving references to amounts borrowed by other
students is most consistent with choice overload, the theory that individuals may become
overwhelmed when presented with too many options (Iyengar and Lepper 2000). We are
not aware of any studies that find choice overload in response to the presentation of options
that were already available, but several results support this explanation. First, we test
whether the reference-point treatments affected the likelihood that a student made an active
decision to decline the loan offer. We show that the reduction in borrowing is not explained
by an increase in the number of students actively declining their loan offer, but rather an
increase in the likelihood of making no decision (and thus receiving the default loan of $0).
Second, we test for heterogeneous effects by student characteristics. Choice overload should
be most common for students who are unfamiliar with or unsupported in making a borrowing
decision, are prone to using heuristics (e.g., complying with nudges), or have lower cognitive
ability. We find heterogeneity in treatment effects consistent with all of these predictions.
Estimated effect sizes are relatively larger for students who are new to the college and are


                                              3
significantly larger for students who are classified as independent (nontraditional) students.3
Effects are concentrated among students who have borrowed in the past, i.e., those who were
more likely to have previously complied with the nudge provided by the (nonzero) amount
listed in LACC’s financial aid award letters. Finally, using baseline academic performance as
a proxy for cognitive ability, we find that students whose baseline grade point average (GPA)
is below the median for their level of credit accumulation are significantly more affected than
their above-median-GPA counterparts.
       Our paper contributes to a body of evidence that the design of federal student aid pro-
grams may hinder students’ ability to take advantage of these resources. In particular, a
growing literature suggests that student decisions are distorted by behavioral biases including
debt aversion (Field 2009; Caetano et al. 2011), cognitive costs associated with complexity
(Dynarski and Scott-Clayton 2006; Bettinger et al. 2012), issues of self-control (Cadena and
Keys 2013), framing effects (Pallais 2015; J. Evans et al. 2018; Abraham et al. 2018), opt-in
costs (Marx and Turner 2018), default bias (Cox et al. 2018), and salience (Marx and Turner
2019). Many first-year students either do not realize that they have taken out student loans
or cannot recall the amount that they have borrowed (Akers and Chingos 2014), and only 20
percent of borrowers attending public institutions could answer two “loan literacy” questions
correctly (Anderson et al. 2018).4 In a nationally representative survey, most student loan
recipients stated that they did not calculate the size of their future monthly payments before
deciding whether and how much to borrow (Lusardi et al. 2016).
       Past interventions intended to help inform students’ borrowing decisions have produced
mixed results. Using a difference-in-differences design, Schmeiser et al. (2017) study a com-
prehensive intervention aimed at reducing borrowing among students carrying high loan
balances at Montana State University and find only a 2 percent reduction in the amount
   3
      An undergraduate student is classified as independent if she will be over the age of 24 by the end of the
calendar year in which she is enrolled, is married, has dependent children, was in foster care or a ward of
the court since age 13, is an emancipated minor, is a homeless unaccompanied youth, is currently serving on
active duty in the military, or is a veteran.

      The questions tested for understanding of the consequences of defaulting on the loan and for knowledge
of income-driven loan repayment plans.


                                                      4
borrowed, with no effect on the probability of borrowing.5 In contrast, we find that simply
sending students an email showing average borrowing of past graduates reduced the amount
borrowed by 13 percent. Barr et al. (2017) show that text messages about loans and access
to one-on-one counseling (provided via text message) reduced the amount borrowed and
attainment among community college students who had applied for loan aid.6 Evidence
from experiments in both the U.S. and the Netherlands suggest that student-loan-specific
information alone does not significantly alter students’ borrowing decisions, even when it
increases students’ understanding of loan terms and programs (Booij et al. 2012; Darolia
and Harper 2018).7 In contrast, changing the amount of loan aid listed in the financial aid
award letter, without changing the cost to the college or the choices available to the student,
significantly affects borrowing and attainment (Marx and Turner 2019).
    Our findings also contribute to the literature on choice overload. In theoretical models,
choice overload can arise from costs of searching for or evaluating options (Kuksov and Villas-
Boas 2010) or if individuals expect they may regret their choices (Sarver 2008; Buturak
and Evren 2017). Increasing the number of available options has been found to increase
the likelihood that agents make inefficient or dominated choices over retirement plans and
savings (Benartzi and Thaler 2001; Iyengar et al. 2004; Iyengar and Kamenica 2010) and
health insurance plans (Heiss et al. 2010; Abaluck and Gruber 2011; Zhou and Zhang 2012).8
Our reference-point treatments do not introduce new options so much as increase the salience
of alternatives, but our finding that they increase the likelihood of inaction is consistent with

     Starting in fall 2012, Montana State University sent letters to students with high outstanding debt that
included an incentivized invitation to participate in a one-on-one counseling session with a certified financial
counselor.
   6
     Treatment status included a variety of interventions, including the ability to ask for assistance from
financial aid staff and text messages with information about loan terms (e.g., lifetime limits, future payments),
encouragement to complete required financial aid forms, and, similar to our experiment, reminders of the
option to borrow less than the offered amount of loan aid and references to smaller loan amounts. Our
experiment allows us to isolate the effects of each of the reminder and reference messages.
   7
     An exception is Stoddard and Urban (forthcoming), who find that high school requirements that students
complete financial education to graduate increase federal student aid applications and shift students from
credit card debt in favor of federal student loans.
   8
     Evidence from lab experiments involving choice over hypothetical health insurance plans is also consis-
tent with choice overload (Schram and Sonnemans 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Kairies-Schwarz et al. 2014;
Bhargava et al. 2017).

Shafir et al. (1993), who find that subjects in a lab experiment are more likely to choose to
wait for more information when given two purchase options than when given a single option.
Meta-analyses by Scheibehenne et al. (2010) and Chernev et al. (2015) find heterogeneity
in the effect of additional options, with factors that appear to contribute to choice overload
including choice set complexity and preference uncertainty. Both factors likely characterize
students’ choices of a specific dollar amount of loan aid needed for expenses to be incurred
over an academic year.
    The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe the student loan
program and our experimental site. Section 3 details the design of our experiment, while
Section 4 describes our empirical framework. We present results in Section 5, including
the main effects of the emails on borrowing outcomes, heterogeneity in these effects, and
estimates of effects on attainment. Section 6 concludes.



2     Student Financial Aid and LACC

Low-income college students in the United States are eligible for federal grants and loans. In
order to access federal aid, prospective students must fill out the free application for federal
student aid (FAFSA) by providing information on their family income, assets, siblings, and
other family members’ college attendance. Older students, those with dependents, and
those who are married are classified as “independent” and need only include their own
income and assets in the FAFSA, while “dependent” students’ EFCs take into account the
resources of both students and their parents. These inputs are fed through a complicated,
nonlinear formula to determine a student’s expected family contribution (EFC), the federal
government’s measure of ability to pay. Eligibility for federal need-based grants, subsidized
loans, and campus-based aid generally depend on EFC, either directly (as in the case of
Pell Grant aid) or when combined with additional information (as in the case of work-study
funding).



                                               6
2.1       Federal student loans

All students who are enrolled at least part-time and have completed a FAFSA are eligible
to borrow through federal loan programs. The primary source of federal loan aid for under-
graduate students is the Direct Loan Program.9 The terms of federal loan aid depend on a
student’s course load, dependency status, class standing, and unmet need. While students
must attempt at least 6 credits to be eligible to borrow, above this threshold, the terms of
borrowing do not explicitly depend on a student’s course load. A student’s unmet need,
equal to her total cost of attendance (tuition, fees, and a cost of living allowance) minus
her EFC and total grant aid from all sources, determines her eligibility for subsidized loans,
which do not accrue interest while in school. Students classified as freshmen are eligible
for subsidized loans equal to the lesser of remaining need and $3500.10 Community college
students who are classified as sophomores are eligible for an additional $1000 in subsidized
loans.11 Dependent undergraduate students face a lifetime eligibility limit of $31,000 in
federal loans, while the limit for independent undergraduate students is $57,500.
       Although the federal rules described in the previous paragraph dictate the amounts of
subsidized and unsubsidized loans for which a college student is eligible, colleges can decide
how much loan aid to offer in financial aid award letters. The Department of Education and
college financial aid administrators call this process packaging. In all cases, not borrowing
is the default: students who take no further action do not receive loans, regardless of the
   9
     Student loan interest rates are pegged to the 10-year Treasury note interest rate plus 2.05 percent and
are updated on an annual basis. Students in our study who had their loans disbursed before July 1, 2016
faced an interest rate of 4.29 percent, while those loans disbursed between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017
had an interest rate of 3.76 percent.
  10
     Subsidized loan eligibility is also reduced when a student’s remaining lifetime eligibility for subsidized
loans ($23,000) is less than these amounts.
  11
     Students enrolled in four-year institutions who are sophomores or juniors are classified as “upper-level”
and are eligible for an additional $2000 in subsidized loans. Regardless of credit accumulation, community
college students cannot be classified as upper-level. At most institutions, dependent students can borrow
an additional $2000 in unsubsidized loans, and independent students can borrow an additional $4000. At
these institutions, students who do not qualify for subsidized loans can still borrow unsubsidized loans up
to the overall maximum (e.g., $5500 for freshmen dependent students and $9500 for freshmen independent
students). Unsubsidized loans begin accruing interest immediately after disbursement, but interest rates for
both subsidized and unsubsidized loans are fixed over the lifetime of repayment.




                                                      7
amount offered. Students who receive nonzero loan offers must still accept the offer, and
new borrowers must also complete federal requirements (entrance counseling and a Master
Promissory Note) in order to receive their desired aid. Students who do not receive a loan
offer (or receive a $0 offer) can still request a loan, with the specific request process varying
across institutions. Nearly all four-year institutions offer students the maximum amount of
loan aid for which they are eligible. Community college students are roughly evenly split
between colleges that offer loans and colleges that do not (Marx and Turner 2019).


2.2       LACC

We contacted LACC based on its relatively large student body. LACC had a 12-month full-
time equivalent enrollment (FTE) of approximately 31,000 in 2014, compared to 4,300 at
the average community college. Financial aid receipt is similar between LACC students and
community college students nationwide. For instance, approximately 54 percent of LACC
students received Pell Grant aid and 15 percent received federal loans in 2014, compared to
41 and 19 percent of students at the average community college.
      LACC offers subsidized loans to all students with unmet need who are eligible for fed-
eral loan aid. Prospective students who listed LACC on their FAFSA received information
relating to their financial aid packages electronically via a web-based system. An example
financial aid award letter from the year of the intervention appears in Figure 1. All students
were offered the maximum amount of subsidized loan for which they were eligible. In ad-
dition to federal requirements, LACC required students to actively confirm that they wish
to borrow and specify the amount of loan aid they would like via an electronic loan request
form. New borrowers had to complete federal entrance counseling and a Master Promis-
sory Note. Only a subset of LACC students were eligible for unsubsidized loans, and these
students were required to complete and submit a request for the additional loan aid to the
LACC financial aid office in person.12
 12
      During the year of the intervention, LACC was participating in a Department of Education initiative



                                                    8
3     The Experiment

The experiment was implemented prior to the start of the 2016-17 academic year and entailed
random assignment of emails to students who had not yet chosen whether to borrow. Prior
to the intervention, LACC students received information about their cost of attendance,
available grant aid, and subsidized federal loan offers through an electronic financial aid
award letter. All students were offered the maximum amount of subsidized federal loan aid
for which they were eligible. In late August 2016, the LACC financial aid office identified
students who had not yet made a student loan choice. These students were assigned to
either the control group or one of three treatment groups. Randomization was stratified by
EFC bins and all possible combinations of binary variables for new vs. returning, freshman
vs. sophomore, dependent vs. independent, and with vs. without outstanding student loan
debt.13
    Table 1 displays the characteristics of students in the LACC experimental sample in
comparison to the nationally representative sample of community college students from the
2016 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) who were enrolled during the
2015-16 academic year. LACC students are similar to the nationally representative sample in
terms of gender and class standing, but they are less likely to be white (34 versus 69 percent)
and more likely to be black or Hispanic (44 versus 22 percent and 39 versus 25 percent,
respectively). LACC students are substantially more likely to be eligible for a Pell Grant (92
versus 23 percent) and have lower average EFCs ($1409 versus $4268) but ultimately have
similar levels of financial need. LACC students are less likely to have borrowed in the past -
only 16 percent had any outstanding student loan debt at baseline compared to 37 percent
of community college students nationwide - and have lower average balances of outstanding
debt ($766 versus $5062). Following this trend, during the fall semester, only 14 percent of
that allowed schools to limit unsubsidized borrowing for specific subsets of students.
  13
     Break points for stratification by EFC were determined within combination of the binary variables so as
to roughly equate the number of students per strata based on data from the two preceding years. A separate
category was created for the considerable number of students with a zero EFC, and the break points always
included the $5234 threshold for Pell Grant eligibility in the 2016-17 academic year.

LACC students borrowed, while 24 percent of community college students nationwide took
up a federal loan. LACC students earned lower academic-year GPAs (2.392 versus 2.765)
but graduated at similar rates as students in the national sample (15 versus 16 percent).
    Panel A of Figure 2 displays the email sent to students assigned to the control group.
Panel B contains the additional text in the emails sent to students in the three treatment
groups. The additional text was displayed in a third separate paragraph at the end of the
message.



4     Empirical Framework

The random assignment of students to treatments Ti allows us to obtain causal estimates
from ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regressions of the form:


                           Yi = α + β1 T 1i + β2 T 2i + β3 T 3i + i                      (1)

In equation (1), we examine outcome Yi as a function of the treatment dummy variables: T 1i
for the reminder that one can borrow an amount other than that listed in the award letter,
T 2i for the reminder and the reference to graduates’ conditional borrowing average of $3000,
and T 3i for the reminder and the reference to graduates’ unconditional borrowing average
of $800. In this regression, the constant (α) captures the average value of the outcome in
the control group, and the β coefficients capture the differences between average outcomes
of each treatment group and the control group. Estimated standard errors are robust to
heteroskedasticity.
    Our primary outcomes describe the amount that students choose to borrow. The first is
a dummy variable indicating whether the student borrowed and the second is the amount
of loan aid, including values of zero. Our third borrowing outcome is a dummy variable
that indicates whether the student borrowed the maximum available loan. This indicator is
intended to capture whether there is any type of response to the treatments, all of which are


                                              10
expected to push students in the direction of borrowing less than the offered maximum.
   In addition to equation (1), we estimate regressions of the form:


                                 Yi = α + β (T 2i + T 3i ) + i                             (2)

We employ equation 2 to test for an effect of having any reference dollar amount listed in
the email. Equation 2 offers greater precision than equation (1) if β1 = 0, a hypothesis
that we test after estimating equation (1). That is, if the reminder of the possibility of
borrowing less than the maximum amount has no effect on students’ borrowing decisions,
then the most efficient estimator of average effects of reference-point treatments compares
students in these treatment arms to students in treatment arms without reference points. If
reference-point treatments have the same effect (β2 = β3 ), then pooling also provides a more
efficient estimate of this effect than estimating the effect of either reference-point treatment
separately.
   None of the treatments has a significant effect on enrollment. Of the sample that was
sent emails, 89 percent enrolled at LACC, and we find no significant effects of treatment
group assignment on enrollment: p-values all exceed 0.38 for individual treatments and are
larger than 0.90 when comparing the reference-point treatment arms to the other arms. The
95 percent confidence interval for the pooled reference point treatment specification excludes
effects larger in magnitude than a 1 percentage point (1.1 percent) increase or decrease in
the probability of enrollment. Thus, it does not appear that enrolled students constitute
a sample that is selected on treatment status, and hence we limit the sample in our main
analysis to students who enrolled at LACC and could thereby obtain a loan that is observable
in the data. In an appendix, we show that our estimates are robust to including all students
in the initial randomization sample, thereby including students who could not borrow from
LACC but may have borrowed at a different institution.
   To obtain evidence on on mechanisms, we test for heterogeneity in the treatment effect.
To conduct these tests with maximal statistical power, we utilize equation 2. We jointly

                                              11
estimate this equation for partitions of the sample and then test for equality of effects
across equations. For example, we split the sample into dependent students and independent
students, estimate equation 2 for each of these subsamples, and test for equality of effects
between the two samples.
      Table 2 provides evidence that predetermined student characteristics are balanced across
treatment arms. Balance is to be expected for inputs to the stratification (e.g., freshman,
independent, new to LACC, prior borrowing, and EFC), but it also holds for other base-
line characteristics including gender, race/ethnicity, financial need, and measures baseline
attainment (credits earned and cumulative GPA). As would be expected for the number of
characteristics and treatments over which we test sample balance, we find only a few differ-
ences that are statistically significant when tested individually; students in treatments T1
and T2 were about 3 percentage points more likely to be female than students in the control
group; and students in treatment T4 received their financial aid package on average 1.4 days
earlier than the control group. An overall F-test of joint significance of the treatments fails to
reject a balanced sample for any of the baseline characteristics, and we find that controlling
for baseline characteristics does not materially affect our estimates.14



5       Results

In this section, we first present estimated treatment effects on borrowing outcomes. Next we
provide evidence suggesting choice overload is the most consistent explanation for our main
results. In particular, we estimate whether treatments affect the number of students who
make active choices about their loans, and we examine heterogeneity in treatment effects.
Finally, we examine treatment effects on measures of academic attainment.
 14
      Appendix Table A.1 shows that baseline characteristics are balanced in the initial randomization sample.

5.1    Borrowing outcomes

Table 3 displays our estimates for borrowing outcomes. Within the control group, 14 percent
of students take out a loan, 12 percent borrow the maximum, and the unconditional mean
amount borrowed is $496 (Panel A). Panel B shows the estimated effects of each treatment
on students’ borrowing outcomes. The reminder that a student can borrow an amount
other than the offered maximum (treatment T 1) has no significant effects on borrowing.
However, the treatments that reference a specific dollar amount borrowed by past graduates
significantly affect student borrowing.
   Both reference-point treatments reduced the average amount borrowed by about $65. As
would be expected in this setting, in which the maximum available loan amount was offered
in students’ financial aid award letters, the reduction in borrowing is due to a reduction in
the share of students who borrow the maximum, a change of roughly 1.5 percentage points
for each reference-point treatment. Less expected, we find changes of similar magnitude in
the share of students who take up any nonzero amount of loan aid. For both reference-
point treatments, students do not appear to shift towards the intermediate loan amounts
referenced in the email, but rather to switch to not borrowing at all. This can be seen in
Figure 4, which shows each treatment group’s distribution of loan amounts that are strictly
between zero and the student’s maximum available loan. The figure shows that students in
the reference-point treatments are not induced to borrow the referenced amount or other
amounts near it.
   Table 3 also shows the results from tests of the equality of effects across treatments. Our
tests of equal effects of the two reference point treatments - T 2 and T 3 - produce p-values
above 0.5 for all three loan outcomes. In contrast, we can reject a test of the equality of all
three treatments with p < 0.05 in the case of effects on borrowing and p < 0.1 in the case
of effects on the amount borrowed. Taken together, these results indicate that the reminder
that a student can borrow less than the maximum available loan does not affect borrowing,
but both emails with reference points describing borrowing among past students were equally


                                              13
likely to lead a student to not borrow at all.
   We proceed by estimating models that combine the reference-point treatments (i.e., equa-
tion 2). These models provide greater precision when the reference-point treatments have
similar effects and the reminder treatment has no effect, as we found and reported in Table
3. Estimates appear in the bottom panel of Table 3. Comparing the reference-point treat-
ment effects to control group means, we find that emails that referenced amounts borrowed
by past students reduced loan take-up by 11 percent (1.6 percentage points; p < 0.01), the
average amount borrowed by 13 percent ($65; p < 0.01), and the probability of borrowing
the maximum available loan by 12 percent (1.4 percentage points; p < 0.01).
   The estimated effects of the reference point treatment are robust to the inclusion of
additional controls and FAFSA filers who did not enroll in LACC. Panel A of Table 4
replicates our main estimates from Table 3. Panel B displays estimates from specifications
that include additional controls for randomization strata fixed effects, while estimates in
Panel C come from specifications that include controls for baseline attainment measures
(whether the student is new to LACC and, for returning students, baseline cumulative credits
earned and GPA at LACC). Finally, Panel D displays estimates from our main specification
for the sample of both enrolled LACC students and FAFSA filers that did not enroll in
LACC. Point estimates are virtually the same across these four specifications for all three
borrowing outcomes.


5.2    Inaction as a Mechanism

We next explore the extent to which the reduction in borrowing among students who received
emails containing reference points can be attributed to an active choice versus a failure to
make a decision. To obtain a loan, LACC students must complete federal requirements and
either actively accept the amount offered in their award letter or request a different loan
amount. Students may actively decline their loan offer, but students who take no action also
receive no loan. We observe whether a nonborrower made an active choice or took no action,


                                                 14
and we estimate treatment effects on the latter to test for choice overload.
   Table 5 presents effects on whether students made an active borrowing choice. The first
column replicates estimated effects on the extensive-margin of borrowing shown in the first
column of Table 3. Next, we examine whether the reference-point treatments affected the
probability that a student actively declined the loan offer, an action taken by 22 percent of
students in the control group. We find no evidence of meaningful changes in the probabil-
ity that a treated student actively declines her loan: the estimated 0.04 percentage point
reduction in the probability of actively declining a loan is statistically insignificant and is
less than 3 percent of the magnitude of the estimated impact on borrowing. Third, we test
for treatment effects on the probability that a student made no active decision to accept
or decline the loan offer. Students assigned to the reference-point treatment groups were
1.7 percentage points (p = 0.045) more likely to avoid making a decision. The magnitude
of this effect is very similar in size to the magnitude of the estimated impact on borrowing
(1.6 percentage points). Thus, it appears that many, if not all, of the students who would
have borrowed in the absence of the reference-point treatment did not actively choose to
decline their loan offers but rather avoided making any decision. That financial information
intended to provide guidance would instead cause inaction offers a cautionary finding for
colleges and governments.


5.3    Heterogeneity

Next, we test whether emails had heterogeneous effects across student subgroups. We first
examine subgroups defined by baseline characteristics used for stratification in random as-
signment: past experience of borrowing (any outstanding debt versus no outstanding debt),
student resources (Pell Grant eligible versus ineligible), prior LACC enrollment (new versus
returning), class standing (freshman versus sophomore status, as determined by 30-credit
threshold), and dependency status. To do so, we jointly estimate equation (1) for each of
ten subgroups of students and then test for equality of effects across equations. Table 6


                                              15
contains these results.
       We find two dimensions along which the effects of the reference-amount treatment are
statistically distinguishable between stratification subgroups. First, we find large differences
in the borrowing response to seeing an explicit loan amount in the reminder email when split-
ting the sample by whether a student had borrowed in the past. Differences in reductions in
the probability that a student borrows, the amount borrowed, and the probability of borrow-
ing the maximum available amount due to reference-point treatments are economically and
statistically larger in magnitude for past borrowers than for students who have not borrowed
before. The reference-point treatments decreased borrowing by 9.2 percentage points and
$362 among past borrowers and by only 1.0 percentage points and $40 among students with
no outstanding debt.15 If students who have borrowed in the past have more information
about their federal loan eligibility, then the relatively large effects on these students would
be inconsistent with our finding of no effect from the information-only treatment. Rather,
it appears that there are students who simply accept the number they see, which was the
maximum available loan in the past for LACC students, unless they are presented with more
than one amount.
       The email referencing an explicit dollar amount also had significantly larger effects on
borrowing for independent students than for dependent students. Differences in effects on
the probability of borrowing and amount borrowed are both statistically significant at the 5
percent level, while the difference in effects on the share borrowing the maximum available
loan amount are marginally significant (p = 0.055). This dimension of heterogeneity is
consistent with dependent students being more likely to have someone with whom to discuss
their borrowing choice (e.g., a parent or high school guidance counselor) than independent
students, resulting in independent students being more susceptible to choice overload. These
patterns of effects by both dependency and past borrowing status are quite similar to those
  15
    We can reject tests of the equality of treatment effects by past borrowing for all three outcomes; p-
values equal 0.008 (any borrowing), 0.009 (amount borrowed), and 0.022 (borrowing the maximum available
amount).

produced by the loan-offer nudges examined by Marx and Turner (2019), providing further
evidence of the characteristics of students who have trouble choosing a loan amount and
instead simply adhere to the amount listed in the financial aid award letter.16
    Next, we test for heterogeneous effects by baseline GPA. If a student’s GPA serves as a
proxy for her cognitive ability, and if the effect of reference-point emails operates through
choice overload, then students with low baseline GPAs should exhibit larger borrowing re-
sponses to these emails. This is indeed what we find. Table 7 shows that effects are con-
centrated among those with below-median baseline GPAs.17 The reference-point treatments
reduce the share of low-GPA students borrowing by 2.8 percentage points (p < 0.01), while
effects on high-GPA students are small, positive, and statistically insignificant. Likewise, the
amount borrowed falls by a statistically significant (p < 0.01) $106 among low-GPA students
who received a reference point email and the share of low-GPA students borrowing the max-
imum available loan decreases by a statistically significant 2.3 percentage points (p < 0.01),
while effects on these outcomes among high-GPA students are positive and insignificant. We
can reject a test of the equality of treatment effects by baseline GPA with p ≤ 0.02 across
each of the three borrowing outcomes.18
    Choice overload appears to provide a better explanation for our results than alternative
explanations. For example, it is possible that a reference to past graduates and their debt
reduces borrowing by increasing the salience of debt repayment. In this case, we might
   16
      Appendix Table A.2 provides corresponding estimates of heterogeneity in treatment effects on the prob-
ability of actively declining a loan offer and inaction. In all cases, treatment effects on the probability of
inaction are larger in magnitude than treatment effects on the probability of being an active nonborrower,
and there are no subgroups for which we find significant treatment effects on the probability that a student
actively declines her loan. New students are significantly more likely to respond to reference-point treatments
through inaction than returning students (4.1 versus 0.8 percent point increases; p = 0.085). None of the
other differences in treatment effects on inaction between subgroups are statistically significant at conven-
tional levels, but patterns are generally consistent with inexperienced and lower-income students being more
likely to experience choice overload.
   17
      Because a student’s GPA is correlated with the number of classes she has taken, we calculate the median
GPA for each level of baseline cumulative credits earned and split the sample of returning students by above
versus below median.
   18
      Appendix Table A.3 shows that while low-GPA students are more likely to respond to the reference-point
treatments with inaction than high ability students, the difference in treatment effects is not statistically
significant (p = 0.105).



                                                      17
expect larger treatment effects among forward-looking students, but we find larger effects
among low-performing students who are likely less forward-looking. Moreover, the salience
explanation is not consistent with the null effects obtained in debt letter experiments, where
the information provided to students focused on the link between borrowing and post-college
payments (Schmeiser et al. 2017; Darolia and Harper 2018). We find no evidence that
students shift their borrowing towards the referenced amounts, as would be predicted by
models with anchoring or students updating their beliefs about the optimal loan amount
(Figure 4). Rather, it appears most likely that introducing a second concrete option for
students to consider increased the likelihood of inaction.


5.4    Attainment Effects

Borrowing can increase educational attainment if students are liquidity constrained or face
trade-offs between working and studying (Lochner and Monge-Naranjo 2012). Recent studies
provide evidence of positive average effects of student loans on educational attainment for
students who borrow when they have access to loans (Dunlop 2013; Wiederspan 2016; Solis
2017). Nudges that reduce borrowing can have negative effects on attainment (Barr et al.
2017; Marx and Turner 2019). Given our finding that information about past students’
average borrowing also led to a significant reduction in loan take-up, we also test for effects
on educational attainment.
   As discussed in Section 4, we can rule out all but negligible effects of our experimental
treatments on the likelihood that a student enrolls in LACC for the fall semester. Because our
experimental treatments have relatively small effects on borrowing patterns, we would not
expect large effects on in-college attainment, even if changes in borrowing have large effects
on attainment among students who respond to the treatments. For completeness, however,
we proceed to estimate effects of emails on educational attainment, as measured by credits
attempted, credits earned, grade point average, and degree receipt. In Appendix Table
A.4, we provide these estimates for the pooled reference-point treatments that significantly


                                              18
affected borrowing.
       We find no statistically significant effects on any of these measures of attainment.19 The
confidence intervals for these estimates are large, and so the lack of statistical significance
should not be taken as evidence about the attainment effects of loan aid.20 The observed
reductions in borrowing may also reduce attainment and therefore may not be in the best
interest of students. Students may be better served by information or assistance tailored
to their individual circumstances, particularly if they fall within one of the categories of
students who appear to be overwhelmed by the student loan decision.



6        Conclusion

We experimentally test the effect of informational emails on community college students’
borrowing decisions. Randomly assigned reminders that students could borrow less than the
amount listed in the financial aid award letter do not affect borrowing decisions. However,
when this information is combined with a reference to the average amount borrowed by past
graduates, students are less likely to borrow at all. These letters referencing amounts of past
borrowing, rather than providing a helpful recommendation, appear to have induced choice
overload, as the reduction in borrowing is driven by a reduction in the likelihood a student
makes any decision about their loan offers, rather than an increase in the probability a student
actively declines her loan. Consistent with this interpretation, effects were concentrated
among independent students and those with lower academic ability.
       A non-negligible share of students appears overwhelmed by choosing how much to borrow,
a key decision for human capital investment. While these students appear to know that
they do not have to borrow the listed amount, many do so anyway, and those affected by
treatments referencing the amounts borrowed by comparable peers appear unsure of how
  19
     There are also no effects that are significant at the 0.05 level when we separate each individual treatment
(Appendix Table A.5).
  20
     We cannot rule out effects of borrowing that are of similar magnitude to those found in our prior work
(Marx and Turner 2019), such as a 0.9 additional credits earned and 0.16 higher GPAs per $1000 borrowed.



                                                      19
much to borrow. For colleges and the U. S. Department of Education, these results suggest
that when it comes to decisions about student loans, simply providing information may not
be sufficient to improve student outcomes.
   The nature of the choice over student loan amounts makes policy prescription difficult,
but our results offer some suggestions. Besedeš et al. (2015) show that in the lab, choice
overload can be reduced by placing options in a tournament so that individuals consider a
smaller number of options at any given time, but it would be difficult to implement such a
tournament when the choice involves a continuous measure such as loan amount. Following
this logic and our results, though, we speculate that a budgeting exercise in which students
consider their expected sources of income and expected expenses would help them identify
their expected financial need and choose an appropriate loan amount. Future work could
explore interventions that assist or require active choice. For researchers, our results suggest
caution in drawing welfare conclusions from the observed choices of students. In particular,
models of rational, forward-looking borrowing may be misspecified and may give misleading
impressions of students’ need for credit.
