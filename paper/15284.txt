                                             ABSTRACT

After three decades of decline, the amount of time spent by parents on childcare in the U.S. began
to rise dramatically in the mid-1990s. Moreover, the rise in childcare time was particularly pronounced
among college-educated parents. Why would highly educated parents increase the amount of time
they allocate to childcare at the same time that their own market returns have skyrocketed? After finding
no empirical support for standard explanations, such as selection or income effects, we offer a new
explanation. We argue that increased competition for college admissions may be an important source
of these trends. The number of college-bound students has surged in recent years, coincident with
the rise in time spent on childcare. The resulting “cohort crowding” has led parents to compete more
aggressively for college slots by spending increasing amounts of time on college preparation. Our
theoretical model shows that, since college-educated parents have a comparative advantage in college
preparation, rivalry leads them to increase preparation time by a greater amount than less-educated
parents. We provide empirical support for our explanation with a comparison of trends between the
U.S. and Canada, and a comparison across racial groups in the U.S.

I. Introduction

       One of the most surprising findings from the recent research on time use concerns trends

in time spent with children in the United States. Despite shrinking families and dramatic

increases in women’s time spent in the workforce, the amount of time parents spent with children

rose over the last several decades (Sayer, Bianchi, and Robinson (2004); Bianchi, Robinson, and

Milkie (2006)). In contrast, the amount of time spent on other types of “home production”

activities, such as cleaning house and cooking, fell significantly (e.g. Robinson and Godbey

(1999), Bianchi, et al. (2006), Aguiar and Hurst (2007)).

       This paper takes a closer look at trends in childcare. Linking twelve time use surveys

between 1965 and 2007, we show that the increase in time spent with children occurred starting

in the mid-1990s. We also show that the increase in childcare has been twice as great for

college-educated parents. This differential trend is particularly puzzling in view of the dramatic

increases in wages of college-educated individuals. We also show that the most important

components of the increase in childcare time was time spent on older children, and in

particularly on coordinating and transporting them to their activities.

       The literature has offered several explanations, both for why childcare time increased and

why educated parents spent more time with their children (e.g., Bianchi, et al. (2006, p. 87),



                                                 1
Aguiar and Hurst (2007), Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney (2008)). These explanations include

selection effects, income effects, safety concerns, enjoyment, and more flexible work schedules.

We test each of them and find that they are not consistent with the data.

       The inability of existing explanations to account for the evidence leads us to offer a new

explanation for the upward trends. We argue that the increase in time spent in childcare,

particularly among the college educated, may be a response to an increase in the perceived return

to attending a good college, coupled with an increase in competition in college admissions.

Importantly, the size of college-bound cohorts rose dramatically beginning in the early 1990s,

coincident with the increase in time spent on childcare. Bound and Turner (2007) have provided

evidence that larger cohorts are associated with increasingly severe cohort crowding at quality

schools. Increased scarcity of college slots appears to have induced heightened rivalry among

parents, taking the form of more hours spent on college preparatory activities. In other words,

the rise in childcare time resulted from a “rug rat race” for admission to good colleges.

       In order to clarify the mechanics of this explanation, we develop a simple theoretical

model in which college admission depends on parents’ choice of college preparation time.

College-educated parents are assumed to have a comparative advantage in preparation time.

When slots at good colleges are relatively plentiful, the marginal slots are filled by children of

less-educated parents. Competition among these parents determines the preparation required for

admissions. When good slots become relatively scarce, rivalry for the marginal slots shifts to the

college-educated parents, who are better able to compete. A rug rat race emerges among these

parents, driving up both admissions requirements and the time spent on childcare.

       Our model also accounts for the observed increase in childcare time among less-educated

parents. Since a rising wage premium raises the returns to a college education, these parents




                                                 2
raise their preparation time in order to secure the higher returns for their children. It is also true

that the opportunity costs of preparation for college-educated parents rise along with the wage

premium. Nevertheless, as long as the college-educated parents have an overall comparative

advantage in preparation, rivalry for scarce slots drives their efforts upward relative to those of

the less-educated parents. Thus, both groups invest more time in childcare, but the investments

of the college-educated rise by a greater amount.

       We provide support for this explanation using two comparisons. First, we compare

childcare trends in the U.S. to those in Canada. The U.S. and Canada are similar in many

respects, but differ in two ways that are key to our explanation: the Canadian system lacks a

steep prestige hierarchy among institutions, so that Canadians do not experience the intense

rivalry to gain admission into higher rated colleges; and the returns to a college degree have

increased much less in Canada. Thus, our theory predicts that we should not see the same

increase in time spent in childcare there, particularly among the more educated. Employing

time-use data from Canada’s General Social Survey, we show that time spent in childcare by

educated parents in Canada changed very little over this period, corroborating our theory.

Second, we show that college-educated underrepresented minority parents in the U.S., who

would be expected to face less competition for college, spend less time on childcare than college-

educated white parents. Moreover, the difference across educational levels is much greater for

white parents than for underrepresented minority parents.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section II documents trends in childcare over the 1965-

2007 period. The standard explanations are evaluated in Section III. Section IV presents

evidence showing increased competition for college over this period, and develops our new

explanation along with the empirical support. Section V concludes.

II. Trends in Time Spent in Childcare

       Trends in time spent in care of children have been the subject of many studies in

sociology (e.g. Bryant and Zick (1996), Robinson and Godbey (1999), Sayer, Bianchi, and

(2004)). It has long been noted that college-educated mothers devote more time to child rearing

than less educated mothers (e.g. USDA (1944), Leibowitz (1974), Bianchi, et al. (2006), Guryan,

Hurst, and Kearney (2008)). Here, we document that since the mid 1990s there has been a

widening of the gap between college-educated and less-educated parents.



A. Data Description

       To document trends, we use information from twelve nationally representative surveys

from 1965, 1975, 1985, 1992-94, 1995, 1998, 2000 and 2003-2007. All of the surveys are based

on time diary information, which is considered to be the most reliable measure of how

individuals spend their time. Table A1 of the data appendix provides details about the surveys.

We use the American Heritage Time Use Study (AHTUS) versions of the 1965, 1975, 1985, and

1992-94 surveys (Fisher, Egerton and Gershuny (2006)), and the original versions of the other

surveys.

       The key measurement issue is the extent to which the studies give consistent measures

over time. The potentially problematic surveys are the 1992-94 survey and the BLS surveys

starting in 2003. Many childcare researchers believe that the 1992-94 survey undercounts

primary childcare activities (Robinson and Godbey (1999), Bianchi, Cohen, Raley and

Nomaguchi (2004), Bianchi et al (2006)). Using results from other time use studies that are not

part of the AHTUS, but are considered comparable to the earlier studies, Allard, Bianchi, Stewart




                                               4
and Wight (2007, footnote 19) argue that the 1992-94 study is not comparable. The 1992-94

survey suggests that time spent in childcare was one hour per week lower in the early 1990s

(compared to 1985), whereas the 1995 survey suggest that it was one hour per week higher.

Thus, any drops in childcare time between 1985 and 1992-94 may be due to problems with the

1992-94 survey. Another important drawback of the 1992-94 study is the lack of information on

key controls, such as marital status.

       Concerns have also been expressed about the comparability of the 2003-2007 BLS

surveys with the earlier surveys. For example, recently some researchers have questioned

whether the significant increase in childcare recorded in the 2003 BLS survey is due to a change

in the types of questions asked (e.g. Egerton et al (2005), Aguiar and Hurst (2007)). Allard, et al.

(2007) compare the 2003 BLS survey to the 2000 Survey Research Center survey of parents and

finds very similar estimates of primary time spent in childcare (though not secondary time spent

in childcare). The 2000 survey was designed to be comparable to the earlier surveys, so it

appears that the increase in time spent on childcare in the BLS surveys relative to earlier surveys

is real rather than due to methodological differences in the survey.

       Fortunately, the 1965, 1975, 1985, 1995, 1998, and 2000 surveys all involved John

Robinson as a principal investigator. As a result, the coding of activities is very similar across

surveys. Because these studies span the time period in which childcare began trending upward,

we feel confident that the trends we find in time spent in childcare reflect actual trends rather

than changes in activity classification.

       We use a comprehensive measure of childcare that includes care of infants, older

children, medical care of children, playing with children, helping with homework, reading to and




                                                 5
talking with children, dealing with childcare providers, and travel related to childcare. The data

appendix gives details of the activity codes used.



B. Trends in Total Childcare

           To study changes in childcare over time, we regress individual-level time spent on

childcare on various sets of controls. Most of our results are based on the following simple

descriptive model:

                                                   CH it = X it β + ε it ,

where CHit is the number of hours per week spent on childcare for person i in year t, Xit is a set

of controls, and ε it captures omitted other factors affecting childcare time. Our sample consists

of parents aged 18 to 64 who are not students, where “parent” is defined as having a child under

18 years in the household.1           We use the recommended weights from the various studies,

normalized so that a representative individual in 1965 has the same weight as a representative

individual in 2007. In addition to the year of the survey, Xit may also include dummy variables

for the age group of the individual (ages 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64), whether or not

the individual has a college degree, the interaction of the college degree dummy with year,

marital status, the number of children, the number of children squared, category variables for the

age of the youngest child (age <= 1, age = 2, 3-5, 6-9, 10-13, and 14-17), and the number of

children under age 5.

         We first consider time spent in childcare for mothers between the ages of 18 to 64. In

our benchmark specification we do not condition on any choice variables that may be correlated

1
 We use this definition because most of the earlier time use studies did not specifically identify parents. In 2003-
2007, the difference in average time spent in childcare by actual mothers versus all women who lived in a household
with children present was only 27 minutes per week. One of the reasons we omitted students from all of our
samples was to avoid recording a college student living at home with younger siblings as a parent.


                                                         6
with educational level; thus, the only control variables used are the five age categories of the

women, as defined above. The omitted dummy variables are 1975, less-than-college education,

and ages 25-34.2

        Column 1 of Table 1 shows the results from this estimation. The levels effects for the

year indicators show that the amount of time spent in childcare decreased from 1965 to 1975,

and again in 1985 and 1992-94 (“1993” for short). Recall, though, that many believe that the

1992-94 survey undercounted childcare, so this estimate may not indicate an actual decrease.

Childcare time in 1995 was 1.76 hours more per week than in 1975, and by 2000 it had risen to

nearly four hours more. From 2003 through 2007, less-educated mothers spent over four hours

more per week in childcare activities than they did in 1975.

        Of interest to this study are the coefficients on the interactions between year and college

education. After a trough in the early 1990s, the coefficients on this interaction began to grow in

the late 1990s. These estimates show that from 1965 to 1995, college-educated mothers spent

between 0.06 and 2.1 more hours per week on childcare than did non-college-educated mothers.

Beginning in 1998, however, this differential underwent a dramatic increase: college-educated

mothers spent over three hours more per week in 1998, roughly five hours more in 2000 and

2003, and over six hours more in 2004 and 2005.                    Between 1998 and 2007, the college

differential in every year was at least double the highest differential observed between 1965 and

1995.

        These trends are depicted graphically in panel A of Figure 1, which is based on the

estimates from column 1 of Table 1; these numbers indicate the time spent in childcare by

mothers in the 25-34 age group. For both education groups, time spent in childcare rose


2
 We use 1975 as the omitted year because we will later be comparing 2000 and later studies to 1975 with the more
complete set of controls that are available for those studies, but not for other years.


                                                       7
beginning in 1995, but after 1998 the upward movement was much sharper among college-

educated mothers. As discussed earlier, problems with the 1992-1994 study make it likely that

the true 1993 value was somewhat higher.

        Column 2 of Table 1 compares childcare by mothers in 1975, 2000, and 2003-2007 using

the more complete set of controls that are available for these seven years. In addition to the age

category of the mother, we also control for marital status, the number of children (using a

quadratic), and the five dummy variables for the age category of the youngest discussed above.

These additional controls have substantial explanatory power. In this specification, we are

seeking to compare mothers with similar numbers and ages of children across education levels

for the seven years. The results are similar to those without the complete controls. The amount

of time spent on childcare by less-educated mothers rose by four hours per week from 1975 to

the 2000s, and time spent by college-educated mothers rose by more than eight hours per week.

Thus, even with the more complete sets of controls, we find that college-educated mothers

increased the amount of time spent in childcare by double the amount of less-educated mothers.

        Is the same true for men? Column 3 of Table 1 and panel B of Figure 1 show the results

of our benchmark specification for fathers. While fathers on average spent much less time on

childcare, the time spent on childcare for men also rose sharply in the late 1990s. The final

column of Table 1 compares childcare of fathers in 1975 to later years and includes the full set of

controls. The results are similar to those without the additional controls. We conclude that time

spent on childcare by both mothers and fathers increased beginning in 1995, and that this

increase was significantly steeper among the college educated. 3


3
  Our results differ from Bianchi, Cohen, Raley and Nomaguchi (2004). They do not find a statistically significant
increase in the differential between college-educated parents and less educated parents from 1975 to 2000. On the
other hand, a recent paper by Chalasani (2007) that studies married parents finds results similar to ours: a larger
increase in childcare time among the college-educated between 1985 and 2003.


                                                        8
         Corroborating evidence for these trends is provided by time use studies of children. For

example, Sandberg and Hofferth (2005) link time diary studies of children in 1981 and 1997 to

determine trends in time spent with parents. They find that children between the ages of 3 to 12

spent 18 more hours per week with one or both parents in 1997 as compared to 1981. Thus,

children’s time diaries corroborate the trends found using parents’ time diaries.



C. Trends in Categories of Childcare

         We now break down the trends into particular categories of childcare. To produce

consistent estimates of trends over time, we limited the sample to 1965, 1975, 1985, 1995, 1998,

and 2000 because these six surveys (i) had the same activity codes for subsets of childcare; (ii)

distinguished between basic care of young children versus care of older or mixed age children;

and (iii) included key variables we could use as controls.4 The controls included age categories

of parents, marital status, a quadratic in the number of children, and the number of young

children.5 We construct five subcategories of childcare: (1) general care of young children; (2)

general care of older children or mixed age children; (3) playing with children; (4) teaching

children, which involves reading, helping with homework, disciplining and conversing; and (5)

travel related to childcare, coordinating children’s activities, and picking up and dropping off

children.6

         Figure 2 shows the various categories for mothers and Figure 3 shows the various

categories for fathers. The estimates have been normalized to be zero in 1975. As the figures



4
  The reason we could not construct these categories for the BLS data is that they do not distinguish between basic
care of younger children and older children.
5
  The definition of “young children” changed slightly across surveys. In 1965, it was “under 4 years of age,” in
1998 it was “under 7 years of age,” and in the rest it was “under 5 years of age.”
6
  We omit medical care in order to make the graph clearer. There was no noticeable trend in time spent in medical
care for any group.


                                                         9
reveal, time spent in basic care of younger children fell for all four gender-education groups,

although it recovered after the mid-1990s for college-educated mothers. The childcare category

with the greatest increase for all four gender-education groups is general care of older children.

Time spent in this category increased by four hours for college-educated mothers and by three

hours for college-educated fathers.      The second most important category was travel and

children’s extracurricular activities.

       The BLS surveys offer further evidence concerning differences in childcare time

allocation between college- and less-educated parents during the post-2003 period. Although

these surveys do not distinguish time spent with younger children versus older children, they do

contain other detailed categories of interest. We examined the following categories for 2007: (1)

physical care of children and supervision; (2) educating and teaching children, including reading,

helping with homework, meeting with teachers, and associated travel; (3) playing with children,

including sports and arts and crafts; (4) health care, including associated travel; (5) organizing

activities and attending child’s events; and (6) chauffeuring, which includes dropping off/picking

up, waiting, and other travel (excluding travel associated with education or health).

       Figure 4 shows time spent by parents whose youngest child is less than five years old.

The bulk of time spent by mothers is physical care and supervision, followed by playing.

College-educated mothers spend substantially more time on these two categories than less-

educated mothers, almost 12 hours in physical care and supervision and seven hours in playing.

The other categories for this age group are much lower, two hours or less per week. The time

spent by education level does not differ much for the other categories, with the exception of

educational activities where college-educated mothers spend more time. The story is similar for




                                                10
fathers, but at lower levels of hours.              College-educated fathers spend more time in both

categories than less-educated fathers.

         Figure 5 shows time spent by parents whose youngest child is five years or older. Note

that the scale is different on this graph: time spent in physical care and supervision has shrunk to

3.5 hours per week for college-educated mothers. The second most important category for

mothers with older children is chauffeuring, with college-educated mothers spending an hour

more in childcare-related travel than less-educated mothers.                    This category excludes travel

associated with education and health. Activities and travel associated with education constitute

the third most important category for college-educated mothers. Also important are organizing

and attending extracurricular activities. Fathers spend less time than mothers in all categories

except playing. The three most important categories for fathers are physical care, traveling, and

playing. Overall, college-educated parents spend more time in each category except for health

care. The most important sources of the extra time spent by college-educated parents, however,

are in chauffeuring, education- and activity-related categories.7

         The patterns highlighted in Figure 5 mirror the differences highlighted in other research.

For example, Mahoney, Harris, and Eccles (2006) used pooled data from the 1997 and 2002

Child Development Survey of the PSID to show that children of college-educated parents spend

at least three more hours per week on organized activities than children of less-educated parents.

Hofferth (2008) found an increase in time spent in academic activities from 1997 to 2003.

Lareau’s (2003) ethnographic study, Unequal Childhoods, documents the dramatic differences in

how educated parents raise their children compared to less educated parents. The children of

less-educated parents spend most of their free time playing with friends and relatives in their


7
 One should not infer from these results that pure travel time accounts for most of the increase in childcare time.
Total travel time associated with childcare increased by approximately one hour from 1975 to the 2000s.


                                                          11
neighborhood, unsupervised by adults. Lareau calls this the “natural development” approach.

On the other hand, more-educated parents take a “concerted cultivation” approach, which

requires significant commitments of parental time:

       Children’s activities create substantial work for their parents. Parents fill out enrollment
       forms, write checks, call to arrange car pools, wash uniforms, drive children to events,
       and make refreshments…. Simply getting ready for an activity – collecting the
       equipment, organizing the children, loading the car – can be exhausting…, in addition to
       the labor of preparing, there is the labor of watching. (page 47)

In sum, it appears that college-educated parents with children age 5 or over spend a good deal of

their time on education and children’s activities.



D. Trends in Overall Time Use of Mothers

       Figure 6 sheds light on the source of the extra time devoted to children by mothers. We

have categorized other time expenditures into “work,” “chores,” and “free and personal care

time.” “Chores” include housekeeping, cooking, and shopping. “Free and personal care time”

includes any time not included in the other categories, such as sleeping, personal care time, and

leisure activities. All time use surveys are used and the only controls are the age category. We

have subtracted 65 hours from personal and free care time so that magnitudes are similar.

       Work time of less-educated mothers increased until the late 1990s, and then fell

somewhat. Work time of college-educated mothers increased between 1985 and the mid-1990s,

and then flattened out. Time spent on “Chores” fell steadily over the entire sample for both

education levels. “Free time” for both types of mothers fell starting in the mid-1990s. For

college-educated mothers, free time in 2007 was 10 hours less per week than in 1975 and 1985.

Thus, the decline in free time makes up for all of the increase in childcare time.




                                                 12
       In sum, the evidence suggests that all time spent in childcare has increased since 1975,

but it increased much more for higher educated parents. Moreover, with the caveats about the

1993 study in mind, it appears that these increases began in the mid 1990s, and a substantial

proportion of the rising college differential was due to travel and activities of older children. The

trends we highlight are consistent with descriptions from popular books, such as Judith Warner’s

Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety (2005). The key question is, why have

educated parents decided to spend their time in this way? The next section will evaluate various

possible explanations.



III.    Conventional Explanations

       As discussed in the Introduction, Bianchi, et al. (2006, p. 87) and others have offered

several potential explanations that could explain the rise in time spent on childcare. We find,

however, that none of these explanations is consistent with the evidence.



A. Selection Effects

       One possible explanation for this time reallocation involves the declining incidence of

parenthood over this time period. Since fewer individuals choose to be parents, those who do

choose to be parents might be those persons who enjoy childcare more. This selection effect

could account for the observed trends in childcare hours per week spent by parents.

       To test this argument, we obtained a new set of estimates using an expanded sample that

included all adults aged 18-64 who were not students. Results are presented in column 1 of

Table 2, and panel A of Figure 7. The trends in total childcare and the college differential are

clearly present among the general population of women; in particular, the rise in childcare




                                                 13
beginning in 1995 continues to be much steeper for college-education women.             Thus, our

findings are not an artifact of selection into motherhood.



B. Income Effects

       A second possible explanation for the increase in childcare time pertains to income

effects. If childcare is a normal good, then increases in income should raise the time spent in

childcare. Since the incomes of households with college-educated adults have grown much

faster since the early 1980s than incomes of households with less-educated adults (owing to the

increase in the skill premium), this explanation could also potentially explain the widening gap

in childcare time across education levels.

       To investigate this possibility, we analyze the cross section relationship between time

spent on childcare and income and then use the estimates to determine whether they can explain

the time series trends. According to our time use surveys, average real household income in

households with children rose by $21,300 from about $70,000 in 1975 to $91,300 in 2007 (in

$2007). Thus, real income rose by about 30 percent from 1975 to 2007.

       We pooled the BLS surveys from 2003-2007 and focused on parents. We used real

household income in thousands of 2007 dollars. See the data appendix for how we constructed

income. In the regressions, we controlled for year fixed effects, age category dummy variables,

dummy variables for education (high school dropouts, college graduates, and those with a

graduate degree), the full set of dummy variables for the age of youngest child, a quadratic in the

number of children, and marital status.

       Table 3 shows the effects of income for numerous specifications, Panel A for mothers

and Panel B for fathers. We considered both a quadratic in income and the logarithm of income.




                                                14
Because household income is related to hours of work, and hours of work are probably

negatively related to time spent in childcare, in some specifications we also included controls for

usual hours of work of the respondent as well as the spouse. Also, in order to try to estimate the

pure income effect of childcare, we show results where the sample was limited to just

nonworking mothers.

         Table 3 shows that while a number of the income coefficients are statistically different

from zero, all of them are miniscule in terms of economic impact. The fourth column uses the

estimated cross-sectional coefficients combined with the actual change in income from 1975 to

2007 to see how much of the increase in childcare could have been induced by an increase in real

income. Every number in the column is a mere fraction of an hour. Thus, income cannot

explain the increase in childcare.8



C. Safety Concerns

         Bianchi, Robinson, and Milkie (2006) suggest that heightened concerns about safety may

induce parents to accompany their children in their activities and to substitute structured

activities for the free, unaccompanied play on neighborhood streets that was the norm in earlier

times. This explanation is problematic for two reasons. First, the violent crime rate rose from

200 (per 100,000 population) in 1965 to a peak of 758 in 1991, and then began declining again

(Statistical Abstract, Historical Statistics, HS-23). Thus, the violent crime rate moves negatively

with time spent in childcare, which is contrary to the hypothesis of a positive crime-childcare

link. Second, educated parents tend to live in safer neighborhoods than less educated parents.



8
  The results are even weaker if we instead use the 1975 survey. Most of the income coefficients are not statistically
significant, and all are near zero. We find similarly small coefficients if we instead use earnings as Kimmel and
Connelly (2007) and Guryan, Hurst, and Kearney (2008) did.


                                                         15
Thus, if this explanation were important, then we would expect the educated parents to spend

less time on childcare, which is inconsistent with the evidence.

       Of course, what matters is parents’ perceptions of safety.      However, the evidence

suggests that parents now worry less about numerous safety issues. Safe Kids USA (2008)

reported the results of Harris polls in 1987 and 2007, which asked parents about their major

concerns about raising kids. Among the categories were concerns about children being involved

in accidents, kidnapped by strangers, influenced adversely by friends, and exposed to street

drugs. In every case, parents were significantly less concerned in 2007 than they were in 1987

(Safe Kids USA (2008), page 9). Thus, trends in safety perceptions cannot be the source of

trends in time spent in childcare.



D. Enjoyment

       A fourth possible explanation is that parents now experience greater enjoyment from

childcare. However, measures of enjoyment do not indicate rising enjoyment of most types of

childcare. Robinson and Godbey (1999) report enjoyment ratings for various activities from the

1985 survey. In this survey, which covered both men and women, basic childcare ranked below

work and cooking, but above housework. Krueger, Kahneman, Schkade, Schwarz, and Stone

(2007) report measures of enjoyment of various activities by women in 2004 and 2005.

According to their Table 8.3, basic childcare ranked below both cooking and housework. Thus,

there is no evidence that basic childcare has become more pleasant.

       One caveat is that playing with children has always ranked highly in terms of enjoyment.

We have followed the standard practice of including these activities in our measure of childcare

because they are considered to be crucial activities for investment in children’s human capital.




                                                16
However, it might alter the interpretation of the results if one believes that the increase in

childcare time is simply a redirection of time from one high enjoyment activity to another.

       To investigate this possibility, we re-estimated the regressions for the subsample of

parents, excluding time spent playing with children from our measure of childcare.            Only

parents’ ages are used as controls. The results for mothers are shown in the first two columns of

Table 4. Column 1 reproduces the first column of Table 1, while column 2 gives the results

using the restricted childcare variable. By comparing the columns, one can see that omitting

playing with children reduces the amount of the increase by about one hour for less-educated

mothers, and by about three hours for college-educated mothers. Nevertheless, most of the

increase over time and across education levels remains even when playing with children is

omitted. The results are similar for fathers, as seen in columns 3 and 4.



E. More Flexible Work Schedules

       Yet another possible explanation is that parents now have more flexible work schedules,

and can thus reallocate their time in a way that allows them to spend more time with their

children even when they are working. Unfortunately, we do not have measures of work schedule

flexibility, either in our time use data or to gauge aggregate trends. However, one implication of

this hypothesis is that the biggest increases in childcare time should be among working mothers

rather than stay-at-home mothers.

       To test this implication, we split the sample by work status and re-ran our basic

regressions. We found that the increase in childcare is much greater for those mothers who do

not work, and that the gap is much greater across educational levels. One might worry about

selection effects since the labor force participation rate of mothers has increased since 1975,




                                                17
which is our usual comparison year. However, even when we compare to 1985, a year when the

labor force participation rate for college-educated mothers was about the same as in 2007, we

find that the increase in childcare time among college-educated nonworking mothers was around

15 hours per week as compared to an increase around 8 hours per week for college-educated

working mothers.           Thus, some other factor must have been at play to lead even nonworking

mothers to increase their childcare time so much.



IV. A New Explanation: The Rug Rat Race

           We now offer a new explanation for the trends in time spent in childcare, tied to

increased competition for college admissions, particularly among the college educated. Our

claim is that increased competition was driven by a steep rise in demand for college admissions

together with a relatively constant number of slots in the more attractive colleges. The resulting

“cohort crowding” for college admissions gave rise to heightened competition among parents for

attractive slots, manifesting itself in greater time spent on college preparation of their children.

This expenditure of childcare time in dissipative rivalry may be dubbed the “rug rat race.”



A. Evidence on the Increase in College Competition and its Effects

           Empirical trends in demand for college have displayed a remarkable agreement with

trends in time spent on childcare. The top panel of Figure 8 shows the number of high school

graduates each year since 1965.9 The initial large hump is due to the large size of the baby boom

generation. The number of high school graduates fell to a low around 1990, and have since

spiked up as a result of the “baby boomlet.” The number of high school graduates is expected to

peak in 2009 before decreasing again.
9
    These data are from the 2007 Digest of Education Statistics, Table 191.


                                                           18
       The second panel of Figure 8 indicates the number of recent high school graduates who

have enrolled in college. This graph shows a somewhat different pattern because of the long-run

upward trend in the propensity for high school graduates to go to college. As the figure reveals,

after declining from 1980 to 1990, this number increased dramatically during the 1990s and,

while fluctuating from year to year, has stayed high through the present. Observe that the jump

in college enrollment occurs at the same time as the rise in childcare time that we estimated

previously.

       An additional reason for the increased demand for college slots is the dramatic increase in

the college wage premium over the last three decades. Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008) update

the trends first highlighted by Katz and Murphy (1992), documenting that the college/high

school wage premium for full-time workers has increased by 25 percentage points since 1980.

Thus, the rise in the demand for college entrance can be viewed as a response to the dramatic

changes in the returns to going to college.

       Of course, the rise in the college premium also means that the opportunity cost of time

for college-educated parents has grown at the same time that these parents have increased the

amount of time spent on childcare. Other things equal, this rise in opportunity cost should have

led to a smaller increase for these parents. We argue, however, that college-educated parents

have had a lower overall marginal disutility of devoting time to childcare, even after accounting

for the opportunity cost of work. In the next section we present a theoretical model that

rationalizes these various factors.

       Turning to the supply side, the number of slots at the more attractive colleges has not

expanded commensurately with demand. Between 1990 and 2005, total enrollment in college by

recent high school completers increased by 30 percent. In contrast, the number of full-time




                                               19
enrolled freshman increased only 13 percent at the ten elite universities of “The Ivy Plus” and by

only 10 percent at the top 25 liberal arts colleges.10 Bound and Turner (2007) show that this

“cohort crowding” extends to public institutions as well. Using variation in cohort size across

states, they show that the elasticity of undergraduate enrollment with respect to the age 18

population is well below unity. According to Table 4 of their paper, two-year community

colleges have the highest elasticity of 0.8, followed by non-flagship public universities with 0.56,

and flagship public universities with an elasticity of only 0.2. This evidence indicates that the

number of slots becomes much less responsive to enrollment pressure as the quality of the

institution increases.

        For the last several years, the popular press has been filled with stories of unprecedented

competition for college. Some of the perceived increase in competition is simply a statistical

mirage: the average student now applies to more colleges, both because of the increased ease of

filling out applications and the perceived greater uncertainty about getting into a given college.

However, there is ample evidence that part of the increase in competition is real. Bound,

Hershbein, and Long (2009) document many facets of the increase in competition. For example,

they show that test scores of entering students are higher now, particularly at the top ranked

schools. They also show that the percentage of high school graduates applying to a four-year

institution has increased over time. Moreover, they show that the probability of acceptance to a

four-year college for a student of a given ability has declined significantly since 1982.

        Although there are still many colleges that will accept most applicants, there is evidence

to suggest that parents and children have increased the emphasis that they put on selective

colleges. Hoxby (1997) documents that the market for higher education has changed from a


10
  These numbers are based on our calculations using data extracted from Integrated Postsecondary Education Data
System.


                                                      20
collection of local markets to a nationally integrated market. According to the International

Herald Tribune (May 16, 2007), “the preoccupation with the top universities, once primarily a

phenomenon in the Northeastern United States, has become a more countrywide obsession.”

Observers note that college admissions anxiety has spread to the Midwest and Sun Belt, where

enrollment in SAT/ACT prep classes has grown more than seven times the overall national

growth rate over the last five years (Justin Pope (AP) October 22, 2006). In its annual report,

State of College Admission, the National Association for College Admission Counseling (2008)

documents that the group of 257 four-year colleges that accept fewer than 50 percent of

applicants receive 31 percent of all applications (Table 6, page 18).

        Developmental psychologists and pediatricians have drawn an explicit link between

competition for college slots and the increase in time devoted to academics and extracurricular

activities. For example, Luthar and Becker (2002) and Lareau (2004) argue that many middle-

and upper middle-class parents see building up their children’s “after-school resumes” as

absolutely necessary because of the competition for college admission. The American Academy

of Pediatrics (Ginsburg (2007)) cites the increase in competition in college admissions as a key

reason for the decrease in free play time and increase in scheduled activities among children

nationwide.11 Our evidence on trends in childcare time, which shows a sharp increase in time for

this class of activities, is entirely consistent with this picture. Bound, Hershbein, and Long

(2009) document the various ways that high school students are changing their behavior in

response to the increase in competition. For example, they show that the fraction of seniors who

have taken at least one Advanced Placement exam increased from 16.5 to 30.9 percent from

1992 to 2004, and that time spent in extra curricular activities rose. Surprisingly though, they

11
  An ongoing debate among child development experts asks whether the dramatic increase in extracurricular
activities helps or hurts children. See, for example, Rosenfeld, Wise, and Coles (2001) and Mahoney, Harris and
Eccles (2006).


                                                       21
find that while time spent in homework is now higher than in the early 1980s, the upward trend

reversed somewhat during recent years.

        Another factor that might explain the increase in extracurricular activities is the increase

in college tuition. There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that many parents hope that

investing time in developing their children’s sports and music abilities might result in a college

scholarship.     However, there is also evidence that parents over-estimate the number of

scholarships that are available (e.g. The Washington Post, February 13, 2003).



B. Theoretical Model of the Rug Rat Race

        To clarify our ideas about childcare time and competition for college slots, we develop a

simple theoretical model in which parents compete for slots by investing in their children’s

college preparation. Each parent is assumed to have a single child. Parent’s schooling may be

either college- or less-educated, represented by c and l, respectively. The numbers of college-

and less-educated parents are denoted by mc and ml , respectively, and m = mc + ml gives the

total number of parents.

        We assume that a child’s college preparation depends on her parent’s time spent in

childcare, denoted by h. A less-educated parent incurs a disutility of d l (h) from choosing h,

while a college-educated parent incurs wd c (h) , where w > 1 reflects a wage premium. The

disutility functions satisfy, for s = l , c , d s′ , d s′′ > 0 , d s (0) = d s′ (0) = 0   and d s′ (∞) = ∞ .

Moreover, we assume that college-educated parents incur lower marginal disutility in the

absence of a wage premium, i.e., d c′ (h) < d l′ (h) .

        A child’s ultimate wealth is given by wqh , where q reflects the quality of the college

attended by the child. This is meant to capture both pecuniary and psychic benefits from college


                                                      22
attendance. For example, parents may value the prestige of sending their children to more elite

institutions. Parents choose h to maximize their children’s wealth net of their own disutility.

Thus, the objective function of a less-educated parent is wqh − d l (h) .          In the absence of

constraints on college attendance, the optimal preparation level, hl* (q) , is determined by

                                           d l′ (hl* (q)) = qw .

For a college-educated parent, the objective function is wqh − wd c (h) , and the optimal

preparation level, hc* (q) , satisfies

                                            d c′ (hc* (q)) = q .

        The effect of parent’s schooling on optimal preparation time is considered in Figure 9.

For less-educated parents, the optimal decision occurs at point A, where the marginal return wq

equals the marginal disutility d l′ . A parent’s college education shifts the marginal disutility

locus down to d c′ .      This captures a productivity effect in preparing children for college.

Countering this is an opportunity cost effect, whereby a given quantity of time commands a

higher market wage.       The marginal return to preparation, adjusted for opportunity cost, drops to

q, and the optimal decision occurs at point B. We assume that the productivity effect dominates

the opportunity cost effect, so that hc* (q) > hl* (q ) holds for every level of q. Thus, college-

educated parents have a comparative advantage in investing in college preparation.

        College attendance is restricted by the availability of slots. Suppose there are k1 slots

available at first-tier colleges, and k 2 m slots available at second-tier colleges, where k1 + k 2 m <

m . Thus, while college slots are scarce overall, the first-tier slots become relatively scarcer as

the college-eligible population expands. Wealth obtained from attending a first-tier college is




                                                    23
wq1 h , while wealth from a second-tier college is wq 2 h , where q1 > q 2 > 0 . If a child does not

attend college, then wealth is q 0 h , where q 2 > q 0 > 0 .

        Parents simultaneously choose h, and colleges observe the values of h for each child.

The colleges then fill their slots in descending order of h.            This acceptance rule may be

rationalized in a number of ways. For example, children may contribute a proportion of their

wealth to their alma maters, and admissions decisions may be made in order to maximize total

contributions. Since first-tier slots are most valuable, they will be filled first. In equilibrium, a

threshold h1 will exist such that children with h ≥ h1 are accepted to first-tier colleges, and there

are exactly k1 such children. The second-tier slots are filled next: there is a threshold h2 such

that children with h ∈ [h2 , h1 ) , numbering k 2 m , are accepted to second-tier colleges. Finally, the

remaining m − k1 − k 2 m children with h < h2 do not attend college.

        We first consider the case in which mc is small, in the sense that there are sufficiently

many first-tier slots to accommodate the children of college-educated parents. Proposition 1 of

the Theoretical Appendix characterizes the outcome for the case of mc < k1 . In equilibrium,

college-educated parents exploit their comparative advantage in college preparation to get their

children into first-tier colleges. The children of less-educated parents take up the remaining first-

tier slots along with all of the second-tier slots. The acceptance thresholds h1 and h2 make the

latter parents just indifferent between first-tier, second-tier and no college. The thresholds are

distorted upwards relative to the corresponding unconstrained optimal preparation levels hl* (q1 )

and hl* (q 2 ) , reflecting rivalry among these parents for scarce slots.

        Now suppose that mc rises to the point where there are too few first-tier slots for the

children of college-educated parents. As shown in Proposition 2 of the Theoretical Appendix,


                                                    24
once mc > k1 the focus of rivalry shifts from less-educated to college-educated parents. The

children of the less-educated are driven completely from the first tier, as the acceptance threshold

h1 jumps to a level that makes the college-educated parents indifferent between the first and

second tiers. This new level is distorted upwards relative to unconstrained optimal preparation,

hc* (q1 ) .

              Figure 10 illustrates the time paths of college preparation choices when m and mc rise

gradually, with mc = k1 occurring at time T. We interpret T as corresponding to a point of time

in the mid 1990s. The wage premium w is also assumed to rise over time, leading to steadily

increasing paths of h1 and h2 . Prior to T, the growth of mc gradually squeezes the children of

less-educated parents out of the first-tier colleges, shifting their parents’ preparation choices

from h1 to h2 . The average level nevertheless increases if the growth of w is sufficiently rapid.

The preparation choices of college-educated parents also rise if h1 > hc* (q1 ) . At time T the latter

parents jump to a discretely higher level of college preparation, while the choices of the less-

educated continue to rise with h2 .

          The model shows how a combination of increasing rewards for college attendance and

rivalry for ever-scarcer slots can fuel a rug rat race among parents. Rivalry is manifested in

higher college preparation requirements, and in order to secure slots for their children all parents

must devote increasingly large amounts of time to childcare. Once the first tier slots become

sufficiently scarce, rivalry among the college-educated parents intensifies greatly, driving up

their time spent in childcare relative to that of the non-college-educated.




                                                   25
C. Tests of the Theory

       In the next two subsections, we test our theory by comparing time spent in childcare

across groups with differing competitive pressures for college. The first section compares time

use trends by educational attainment in Canada to the U.S. The second section compares time

use across whites and underrepresented minorities in the U.S.



1. A Comparison of Trends in the U.S. and Canada

       As a test of our theory, we compare trends in childcare in the U.S. and Canada. The

comparison of these two countries is ideal for our purposes. Because of geographic proximity

and similarity of language and culture, we would expect that changes in childcare time caused by

knowledge diffusion or fads to affect both countries similarly.   However, these two countries

differ significantly in two key ingredients of our theory: trends in the college wage premium and

the competition to get into college.

       Consider first the college wage premium. Boudarbat, Lemieux, and Riddell (2006) show

that between 1980 and 2000 the wage premium of a college degree relative to just a high school

degree in Canada rose by about 10 percentage points for men and 5 percentage points for

women. This contrasts with an average rise over both sexes of 25 percentage points in the U.S.

during the same period (Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008)). Thus, the returns to college have

increased much more in the U.S.

       A second key difference between the U.S. and Canada is the nature of competition in

higher education. Davies and Hammack (2005) document the similarities and differences in

higher education between the U.S. and Canada. The countries are similar in that just over 60

percent of high school graduates in both countries pursue a postsecondary education. Both




                                               26
higher education systems have decentralized governance and both are experiencing rises in

enrollments and increased competition. However, as Davies and Hammack document, the nature

of the competition in the two countries is very different. They argue that while the Canadian

system consists of formally equal public universities, the U.S. system is distinguished by a steep

prestige hierarchy of higher education, and that this hierarchy leads to a distinctive form of

competition that has increased over the last decade. The effects of this competition have been

felt at all lower levels of education. In contrast, competition in Canada occurs within the post-

secondary system itself and takes the form of competition to enter lucrative majors. Davies and

Hammack argue “Where one studies is seen as more important in the U.S., while what one

studies dominates in Canada.” In fact, many Canadian college students who cannot get into their

desired programs at 4-year colleges often transfer to community colleges in order to pursue their

desired field. Moreover, Canadians are much less likely to go to college outside their home

province than American students.

         The more muted increase in the college premium, along with the lower competition to get

into the hierarchy of colleges, suggests that there should be less pressure on educated Canadian

parents to invest time in preparing their children to get into college. We test this prediction by

studying trends in childcare in Canada.

         To this end, we use microdata from the 1986 (cycle 2), 1992 (cycle 7), 1998 (cycle 12)

and 2005 (cycle 19) of the Time Use Survey from Canada’s General Social Survey (Statistics

Canada) to construct trends in childcare time by education level.12 However, there was a

significant break in a definition between the two earlier surveys and the two later surveys. In


12
  We used the Statistics Canada microdata file of the 4 cycles, which contain anonymized data. All computations
on these microdata were prepared by Nova Scotia Department of Finance and the responsibility for the use and
interpretation of these data is entirely that of the authors. We are deeply grateful to Tarek Harchaoui for obtaining
access to the data for us.

particular, the two earlier surveys counted as childcare any care of children between the ages of 0

and 18. In the two later surveys, it counted as childcare any care of children between the ages of

0 and 14. Using the standard childcare variables would therefore bias down the trends over time.

We use total family care (children and adults) as the most consistent measure.                           The data

appendix shows that the change implied by this measure lies between the lower bound using the

available childcare variable and the upper bound based on some imputations we made.

        Otherwise, we analyze the data similarly to the way we analyzed the U.S. data. We

estimate the same baseline regressions as before, controlling for the age group of the parent and

interacted year and education variables.13

        Figure 11 and Table 5 show the results. Columns (1) and (3) of Table 5 show the results

with baseline controls whereas columns (2) and (4) show the results in which controls for marital

status and the age group of the youngest child. Figure 11 plots the results for the baseline

regressions. We have normalized the hours to be zero in the base year in each country, 1985 in

the U.S. and 1986 in Canada.

        Figure 11 shows that time spent in childcare by less educated parents increased by about

the same amount in both countries, about four to five hours per week for mothers and about three

hours per week for fathers since the mid-1980s. The contrast is in time spent by college-

educated parents. Whereas time spent by college-educated mothers rose by nine hours per week

in the U.S., it rose by only one hour per week in Canada. For college-educated fathers, the

increase in the U.S. was six hours per week and the increase in Canada was two hours per week.

Thus, Canada did not mirror the big increases in time by educated parents.                            In fact, the

educational gap in childcare time grew in the U.S., but shrank in the Canada.


13
  Because of data limitations in some of the years, the youngest age category includes those ages 20-24 rather than
18-24 as in the U.S. data.


                                                        28
            Our findings are broadly consistent with other analyses of trends in the Canadian data.

Pronovost (2007) finds that the amount of time that parents spent in the presence of their children

fell from 1986 to 2005. Turcotte (2008) similarly finds a decrease in time spent with family

members over the period 1986 to 2005.



2. A Comparison across Racial and Ethnic Groups in the U.S

            As an additional test of our theory, we compare childcare time across race and ethnic

groups. One group in the U.S. that should not have felt as much increased competition to enter

college is underrepresented minorities.14                   Despite the overall increase in applicants, most

colleges are still eager to admit underrepresented minorities. One exception is public universities

in states that banned affirmative action in the late 1990s, namely California, Florida, Texas, and

Washington.

            Ideally, we would compare trends by race and education group over time. Unfortunately,

the surveys before 2003 are too small to provide information for underrepresented minorities by

educated level. For example, the largest of the pre-2003 surveys includes 202 black parents, but

only 34 college-educated black parents, and no Hispanic parents.15

            On the other hand, the sample sizes of the BLS surveys from 2003 to 2007 are

sufficiently large to provide some cross-sectional information, particularly if we pool the

surveys. The problem with cross-sectional comparisons is that there may be other reasons that

particular racial or ethnic groups spend more or less time on childcare. Thus, we will focus on

differences by education level and state of residence (i.e. “difference-in-difference” effects)




14
     We are indebted to Daniel Hamermesh for suggesting this test to us.
15
     For the same reason, it is not possible to relate time use trends across states to state-level cohort crowding.


                                                              29
          According to our theory, underrepresented minorities should feel less competitive

pressure in applying for college, particularly in states that allow affirmative action in their public

universities. Thus, we would expect underrepresented minorities to spend less time in childcare

than white parents, and the college differential in time spent to be less within the group of

minority parents. We compare time spent in childcare by underrepresented minorities to whites,

distinguishing by education level and by whether they reside in the four states that banned

affirmative action in university admissions before 2003.

          We re-estimate our baseline specification with two modifications.         First, we allow

interaction terms between race, education, and whether the state bans affirmative action. Our

underrepresented minority group consists of “black only” and Hispanic. Second, because the

underrepresented minorities tend to be less educated within our two broad educational

categories, we include additional controls for high school dropouts and those with a graduate

degree.

          Table 6 shows the estimates for the pooled samples from 2003 to 2007. All of the

numbers shown are differentials relative to blacks and Hispanics with less than a college degree

living in states that allow affirmative action. Consider first the results for mothers. Within each

educational group, white mothers spend significantly more time on childcare than

underrepresented minorities. Moreover, the within-race educational differential is lowest for

underrepresented minorities in states that allow affirmative action and highest among whites. A

college-educated minority mother in a state that allows affirmative action spends less time on

childcare than a less-educated white parent in either type of state. All of these results are

consistent with our theory that competition for college drives up time spent in childcare.




                                                 30
Another interesting finding is that all groups spend more time on childcare in states that ban

affirmative action than in states that do not.

       The bottom panel of Table 6 shows the results for fathers. Although white fathers with a

college degree spend more time than minority fathers with a college degree, the within-group

educational differential is greatest for minority fathers in states that allow affirmative action but

smallest for minority fathers in states that ban affirmative action. Thus, some of the results for

fathers are consistent with our theory, but the estimate for one key group is not.

       To summarize, the results for mothers are consistent with our theory, with the groups

least likely to face increased competition spending the least time on childcare. The results for

fathers are mixed, with some rankings consistent with our theory but other rankings inconsistent

with our theory.



V. Conclusion

       This paper has documented a dramatic increase in time spent in childcare by college-

educated parents since the early 1990s. While time spent in childcare rose for all parents, the

rise was far more pronounced for college-educated parents. Since the early 1990s, college-

education mothers have reallocated more than nine hours per week from leisure time to childcare

time. This reallocation occurred at the same time that competition to get into college intensified,

as a combination of demographic forces and the increase in the college premium led to a surge in

the demand for college slots. In contrast, time spent in childcare by educated parents in Canada

changed very little over this period.

       We have explained these trends using a model in which the rise in time devoted to

childcare is the optimal response to the increase in rivalry for scarce college slots. We postulate




                                                 31
that college-educated parents have a comparative advantage in preparing their children for

college, which they exploit to get their children into the most attractive colleges. When slots are

plentiful relative to demand, the required amount of child preparation is relatively low.

However, when demand rises, rivalry among the college-educated parents drives the required

preparation upwards. Less-educated parents also raise their childcare effort, but to a lesser

extent.

          In this paper we have focused on explaining observed trends in time use, but our results

also have implications for socially efficient time allocation. To the extent that the private costs

and benefits of college preparation reflect social costs and benefits, the rivalry for college slots

implies wasteful overinvestment in preparation. Overinvestment may be mitigated by expanding

the number of slots, or by modifying college acceptance rules to place greater emphasis on

criteria that cannot be directly influenced by parents. In a broader context, however, parents may

not fully internalize the social benefits of preparing their children, which raises the possibility

that the rug rat race provides a useful stimulus to human capital investment. These issues

warrant closer investigation in future work.

Construction of household income

The household income variable was “hufaminc” in the CPS data set. The CPS variable gives
ranges of income, with a top code of $150,000 and above. We used the midpoints of the ranges.
For the top-coded category, we used information from Saez’s (2008) annual U.S. distribution of
income for families, including realized capital gains, to compute the average income for the top
category. We converted income to 2007 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

Race/ethnic group definitions: “White” is ATUS-CPS variable ptdtrace = 1 and pehspnon~=1.
“Minority” is ptdtrace = 2 or pehspnon = 1.


Canadian Time Use Data

        We use microdata from 1986 (cycle 2), 1992 (cycle 7), 1998 (cycle 12) and 2005 (cycle
19) of the Time Use Survey from Canada’s General Social Survey. There were three ways in
which the sample of parents differed from the U.S. data. First, the definition of a “parent” in
Canada is someone whose own child ages 0 to 18 is in the household, whereas in the U.S. it is
someone who lives in a household with a child ages 0 to 18. Second, in Canada all childcare
refers to household children; in the U.S. it refers to both household and nonhousehold children.
Third, because of data limitations, the adults in the Canadian data are ages 20 to 64, compared to
18 to 64 in the U.S. data. To preserve cultural comparability with the U.S., we limited the
sample to Canadians for whom English was one of the main languages spoken at home.
        A key complication arose in constructing a consistent series of childcare across time.
Time spent in childcare in 1986 and 1992 referred to children ages 0 to 18, whereas time spent in
childcare in 1998 and 2005 referred to children ages 0 to 14. Using this definition would bias the
time trends down.
        To create a consistent variable over time, we used all childcare and adult care time. For
1986, this was variable DVCHILDC, plus variables DURAC_41 and DURAC_42. DVCHILDC
included only childcare time in 1986, so we added in the two adult care variables. For 1992,
1998, and 2005, DVCHILDC included both childcare and adult care. (See the table in Appendix
J of the documentation of the GSS 2005 for more details.)
        We also compared this series to a constructed childcare series that we expect to give an
upward bias in the trend. In particular, we constructed this series by linking several series over
time. For 1986 and 1992, we used the available childcare series that covered care of children
ages 0 to 18 (DVCHILDC in 1986 and CHLDDOMS in 1992). Because the childcare series in
1998 and 2005 omitted care of children ages 15 to 18, we attempted to augment the series in the
cases where we thought that child of this age was present. In particular, in 1998 and 2005, we
substituted total family care time for childcare time in those households that had a nonzero
probability of having a child ages 15 to 18. We determined that probability as follows:

1998 survey: The variable CHR1518C indicated the number of children ages 15 to 18. If this
variable was positive, we substituted total family care time for childcare time.

2005 survey: This survey did not contain the variable CHR1518C. We had to use other
variables to indicate a probability of a child between the ages of 15 to 18. These cases were:



                                               35
(1) The respondent had a child below the age of 19 (CHRTIME6=1) and no children ages 0 to 14
(CHR0014C=0) in the household.
 (2) The respondent likely had a child between the ages of 12 and 18 in the household
(CHRTIME6=4, 5, or 6), the number of respondent’s children of any age in the household
(CHRINHSDC) was greater than the number of respondent’s children ages 0 to 14 (CHR0014C),
and the respondent had a child ages 0 to 24 in the household (LIVARR12 = 3 or 4).

The table below gives the change in each measure for all parents from 1986 to 2005

Measure                                                      Change (in hours per week)
1. Childcare of ages 0-14 in 2005 and childcare of ages 0-   2.39
18 in 1986
2. Total family care (children and adults)                   2.45

3. Constructed childcare variable that substitutes total     2.84
family care in some households in 2005

We know that Measure 1 will bias the estimate of the change downward because of the change in
definition. We know that Measure 3 will bias the estimate of the change upward because of the
substitution of total family care in some households in 2005. The change in total family care, the
consistent measure, lies between the upper and lower bound.

Theoretical Appendix


Proposition 1. If mc < k1 , then the equilibrium acceptance threshold h1 is uniquely determined

by h1 = h1A > hl* (q 0 ) and

                                           wq1 h1A − d l (h1A ) = hl* (q0 ) − d l (hl* (q 0 )) ,

and the equilibrium threshold h2 is uniquely determined by h2 > hl* (q 2 ) and

                                               wq 2 h2 − d l (h2 ) = hl* (q 0 ) − d l (hl* (q 0 )) .

Moreover, h1A > h2 , and:

         •    College-educated parents choose h = max{hc* (q1 ), h1A } ;

         •    Less-educated parents divide themselves between h = h1A , h = h2 and h = hl* (q 0 ) ,

              where hl* (q 0 ) is the optimal preparation choice when a child does not attend college.



Proof.       Let Gl (h | q) = wqh − d n (h) and Gc (h | q) = wqh − wd c (h) represent the objective

functions of less- and college-educated mothers, respectively. Under our assumptions, these

functions are strictly concave in h and decrease without bound as h approaches infinity. Since

Gl (hl* (q1 ) | q1 ) > Gl (hl* (q 0 ) | q 0 / w) , there is a unique point                        h1A >   hl* (q1 )   satisfying

Gl (h1A | q1 ) = Gl (hl* (q 0 ) | q 0 / w) .      Similarly, Gl (hl* (q 2 ) | q 2 ) > Gl (hl* (q0 ) | q 0 / w) implies that

there is a unique point h2 > hl* (q 2 ) satisfying Gl (h2 | q 2 ) = Gl (hl* (q0 ) | q 0 / w) . Furthermore,

Gl (h2 | q1 ) > Gl (h2 | q 2 ) = Gl (hl* (q 0 ) | q0 / w) implies h2 < h1A .

         Consider the h choices of college-educated mothers when hc* (q1 ) ≥ h1A . Clearly, hc* (q1 )

is optimal among h ≥ h1A . Moreover, for all h ∈ [h2 , h1A ) , Gc (hc* (q1 ) | q1 ) > Gc (hc* (q 2 ) | q 2 ) ≥



                                                                  37
Gc (h | q 2 ) , and for all h < h2 , Gc (hc* (q1 ) | q1 ) > Gc (hc* (q 0 ) | q 0 / w) ≥ Gc (h | q 0 / w) .              Thus,

hc* (q1 ) is strictly preferred to any other h.

         Next suppose h1A > hc* (q1 ) . Let hˆ = max{hc* (q 2 ), h2 } . Note that hc* (q 2 ) < hc* (q1 ) and

h2 < h1A imply hˆ < h1A . Moreover, hˆ ≥ h2 implies Gl (hˆ | q 2 ) ≤ Gl (hl* (q 0 ) | q 0 / w) . Thus,

                        0 ≥ Gl (hˆ | q 2 ) − G n (hl* (q 0 ) | q 0 / w) = Gl (hˆ | q 2 ) − Gl ( p1A | q1 )

                                                    h A1                                     h A1
                       = wq 2 hˆ − wq1 h1A + ∫ˆ d l′ (h)dh > wq 2 hˆ − wq1 h1A + ∫ˆ wd c′ (h)dh
                                                    h                                        h



                                                = Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) − Gc (h1A | q1 ) ,

where the strict inequality comes from the fact that hc* (q) > hl* (q ) for all q implies

wd c′ (q) < d l′ (q ) for all q.        Thus, Gc (h1A | q1 ) > Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) , and it follows that Gc (h1A | q 2 )

> Gc (h | q 2 ) for all h ∈ [h2 , h1A ) since ĥ maximizes Gc (h | q 2 ) over this range of h. Finally,

consider h < h2 .         If hˆ = hc* (q 2 ) , then Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) > Gc (hc* (q 0 ) | q 0 / w) ≥ Gc (h | q 0 / w) for all

h < h2 , whereas hˆ = h2 implies hˆ > hc* (q 0 ) and

                        0 = Gl (hl* (q 0 ) | q 0 ) − Gl (hˆ | q 2 ) > Gl (hc* (q 0 ) | q 2 ) − Gl (hˆ | q 2 )

                                               hˆ                                               hˆ
                    = hc* (q 0 ) − wq 2 hˆ + ∫ *        ψ l′ (h)dh > hc* (q 0 ) − wq 2 hˆ + ∫             wd c′ (h)dh
                                               hc ( q0 )                                     hc* ( q0 )



                                           = Gc (hc* (q 0 ) | q 0 / w) − Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) ,

whence Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) > Gc (h | q 0 / w) for all h < h2

         Now consider the h choices of the less-educated mothers. Because of strict concavity and

h1A > hl* (q1 ) , Gl (h | q1 ) < Gl (h1A | q1 ) for all q > q1A . Similarly, Gl (q | q 2 ) < Gn (h2 | q 2 ) for all

h ∈ [h2 , h1A ) .    Since hl* (q 0 ) < h2 and hl* (q 0 ) maximizes Gl (h | q 0 / w) , it follows that



                                                                  38
Gl (h | q 0 ) < Gl (hl* (q 0 ) | q 0 / w) for all h < h2 , h ≠ hl* (q 0 ) . Thus, the choices h1A , h2 and hl* (q0 )

are strictly preferred to any others, and by construction these three are equally preferred. Q.E.D.



Proposition 2. If k1 < mc , then the equilibrium acceptance threshold h1 is uniquely determined

by h1 = h1B > hc* (q1 ) and

                                          wq1 h1B − wd c (h1B ) = q 0 hˆ − wq 0 d c (hˆ) ,                          (1)

where hˆ = max{hc* (q 0 ), h2 } , and h2 is determined as in Proposition 1. Moreover, h1B > h1A , and

         •    College-educated parents divide themselves between h = h1B and h = hˆ ;

         •    Less-educated parents divide themselves between h = h2 and h = hl* (q 0 ) .




Proof.        Equation      (1)    can    be     expressed      as     Gc (h1B | q1 ) = Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) .   Moreover,

Gc (hc* (q1 ) | q1 ) > Gc (hc* (q 2 ) | q 2 ) ≥ Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) . Since h1B > hc* (q1 ) , it follows that h1B is uniquely

defined, and Gc (hˆ | q1 ) > Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) implies h1B > hˆ .

         We now verify that h1B > h1A .

                                                                                       B
                                                                                  h1
                       0 = Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) − Gc (h1B | q1 ) = wq 2 hˆ − wq1 h1B + ∫ˆ wd c′ (h)dh
                                                                                   h


                                                     B
                                                h1
                         < wq 2 hˆ − wq1 h1B + ∫ˆ d l′ (h)dh = Gl (hˆ | q 2 ) − Gl (h1B | q1 ) .
                                                 h



This implies Gl (h1B | q1 ) < Gl (hˆ | q 2 ) ≤ Gl (h2 | q 2 ) , and comparison with (1) and (2) shows that

h1B > h1A .

         Consider the h choices of college-educated mothers. Since h1B > hc* (q1 ) , Gc (h | q1 ) <

Gc (h1B | q1 ) for all h > h1B .      If hc* (q 2 ) ≥ h2 , then hc* (q 2 ) is strictly preferred to any other


                                                          39
h ∈ [h2 , h1B ) , while if h2 > hc* (q 2 ) , then Gc (h | q 2 ) < Gc (h2 |, q 2 ) for all h ∈ (h2 , h1B ) . Thus,

Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) maximizes Gc (h | q 2 ) over h ∈ [h2 , h1B ) . The argument from the proof of Proposition

1 shows that Gc (hˆ | q 2 ) > Gc (h | q 0 / w) for all h < h2 . Thus, the choices h1B and ĥ are strictly

preferred to any others, and they are equally preferred by construction.

        As for the non-college-educated mothers, h ≥ h1B implies Gl (h | q1 ) ≤ Gl (h1B | q1 ) <

Gl (h2 | q 2 ) , so h2 is strictly preferred to any such h.           The arguments from the proof of

Proposition 1 establish that h2 and hn* (1) are strictly preferred to any other h < h1B , and they are

equally preferred by construction. Q.E.D.

Notes to Table 1:

This table shows the regression of weekly hours spent on total   childcare on
the variables of interest. Columns (1) and (2) report results    for all
mothers 18-64 who are not students; columns (3) and (4) report   results for
fathers 18-64 who are not students. “Mother” and “father” are    defined as
having a child under the age of 18 in the house.

The omitted year is 1975.

Controls for parents’ ages (dummies for 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64)
are included in columns (1) and (3). The omitted category is age 25-34.
Columns (2) and (4) also include marital status, a quadratic in the number of
children, dummies for the youngest child in each of the following age
categories: (i) age ≤ 1; (ii) age = 2; (iii) 2 < age < 6; (iv) 6 ≤ age < 10;
(v) 10 ≤ age < 14.

The income variable is in thousands of 2007 dollars. The income-induced
increase in childcare is calculated by applying the cross-sectional income
coefficients to the actual changes in average family income from 1975 to
2007. Quantities are in hours per week.

The sample consists of BLS surveys from 2003-2007. All regressions include
controls for year, age categories of parents, full controls for children’s
ages and numbers, marital status, and dummy variables for high school
dropouts, college-educated and post-college degree.

This table shows the difference in weekly hours spent in childcare relative
to black or hispanic parents in states that allow affirmative action. The
sample is the pooled BLS surveys from 2003-2007. Controls for parents’ ages
(dummies for 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64) are included.   The states
that banned affirmative action in university admissions before 2003 were
California, Florida, Texas, and Washington.

Standard errors in parentheses. * indicates that the differential is
significant at 5%; ** significant at 1%.

† indicates that the within-race, within-state educational differential is
significant at 5%;
