Temporary Shocks and Persistent Effects in the Urban System: Evidence from British Cities
after the U.S. Civil War

                                             ABSTRACT

Urban economies are often heavily reliant on a small number of dominant industries, leaving them
vulnerable to negative industry-specific shocks. This paper analyzes the long-run impacts of one such
event: the large, temporary, and industry-specific shock to the British cotton textile industry caused
by the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865), which dramatically reduced supplies of raw cotton. Because the
British cotton textile industry was heavily concentrated in towns in Northwest England, I compare
patterns in these cotton towns to other English cities. I find that the shock had a persistent negative
effect on the level of city population lasting at least 35 years with no sign of diminishing. Decomposing
the effect by industry, I show that the shock to cotton textiles was transmitted to other local firms,
leading to increased bankruptcies and long-run reductions in employment. This transmission occurred
primarily through the link to capital suppliers, such as machinery and metal-goods producers. Roughly
half of the reduction in city-level employment growth was due to the impact on industries other than
cotton textiles.

1       Introduction
Whether it is automobile manufacturers in Detroit, technology firms in Silicon Valley, or cot-
ton textile producers in 19th century Manchester, many cities and regions are characterized
by specialization in just one or two dominant industries. One consequence of this concen-
trated production is that these areas may be strongly affected by temporary industry-specific
volatility. When the dominant industry in a city receives a large temporary negative shock,
the impact on the local economy is often clearly visible and widely discussed. But what
are the long-run consequences of severe industry-specific shocks to city economies? Existing
empirical work by Davis & Weinstein (2002) shows that cities can rebound from even very
large shocks. At the industry level, theoretical work suggests that temporary shocks may
have “cleansing” effects that eliminate less productive units (Caballero & Hammour (1994)),
which may allow for more rapid growth in the post-shock period. These results suggest that
the long-run impacts may be limited. On the other hand, recent theoretical work shows how
a shock to one sector of a local economy may spread to other sectors and generate aggre-
gate effects, if that sector is large (Gabaix (2011)) or well-connected to suppliers (Acemoglu
et al. (2012)). These concerns have motivated substantial government interventions aimed
at cushioning the impact of industry-specific shocks to local economies.1
    This study takes advantage of a unique historical event in order to provide new evidence
on the long-run impact of a large industry-specific shock on city economies. The experiment is
provided by the large exogenous shock to the British cotton textile industry generated by the
U.S. Civil War (1861-1865). The cotton textile industry was Britain’s largest manufacturing
sector during the 19th century and was entirely reliant on imported supplies of raw cotton,
most of which came from the U.S. South. The Civil War sharply disrupted these supplies,
leading to a deep depression in the industry that saw hundreds of thousands of operatives
put out of work or working short-time. Moreover, the U.S. Civil War had little direct effect
on industries outside of the cotton textile industry. Thus, this event provides a large, clearly
identified, temporary, and sector-specific shock.
    One feature of this empirical setting is that the policy response to this event was limited,
despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of workers became unemployed.2 This lack of
response was due to the strong free-market ideology that dominated British policy during
this period, as well as the small size of central government. Thus, we are able to observe the
impact of the shock in the absence of substantial intervention. In contrast, modern shocks
    1
     One recent example is the billions of dollars in government loans made to automotive manufacturers in
2009, which was aimed in part at protecting the economy of the Detroit region.
   2
     The main government response came in the form of relief for truly destitute unemployed workers and
some government-sponsored public works projects.

of this magnitude are likely to elicit substantial government responses.
    Another important feature of this empirical setting is that prior to the Civil War there
was substantial variation across British cities in the share of employment in the cotton
textile industry. Most of Britain’s cotton textile employment was concentrated in towns in
the Northwest region, and within these towns the cotton textile industry often provided 20-
30% of employment. These initial agglomeration patterns, which date to the 18th century,
were driven by historical features, such as the availability of water power, that had little
direct effect on the industry by 1850 (Crafts & Wolf (2013)). However, as a consequence of
this pattern there was substantial geographic variation in the impact of the cotton shortage.
This means that I am able to compare outcomes in the affected cotton textile towns to those
in other British cities, where the direct impact of the U.S. Civil War was very small.
   To further strengthen the analysis, I compare the cotton textile towns to a set of other
British cities with economies that were heavily reliant on textile production, but based on
wool, linen, or silk, rather than cotton. These other textile sectors, particularly wool textiles,
were also important British industries during this period. They were also very similar to
cotton textiles in terms of technologies, other inputs, and organization. However, they were
not negatively impacted by the cotton shortage.3
    In the first part of the analysis, I draw on new data describing the population of British
cities from 1841-1901 to show that the cotton textile towns – those with more than 10%
of workers in the cotton textile sector prior to the war – suffered a reduction in decadal
population growth on the order of 7-13 percentage points over the 1861-1871 period, relative
to other towns in Britain. This is around half of the average decadal growth of 20-22 percent
experienced in the cotton towns over the two decades prior to the war. After 1871, the
growth rate returned to, but not above, normal levels. Thus, the Civil War had a temporary
growth effect and a permanent levels effect on overall population in the cotton textile towns.
This result holds whether I compare the cotton towns to all other British cities, or only to
other textile-producing cities. The levels effect persists at least through 1901, with no sign
of diminishing.
    This finding contributes to the literature on persistence in urban economies ((Davis &
Weinstein, 2002, 2008; Miguel & Roland, 2011; Redding et al., 2011; Bleakley & Lin, 2012;
Kline & Moretti, 2013)). An important difference between this paper and previous work
in this area is that this paper is the first in the literature to analyze the impact of a large
idiosyncratic economic shock to an important local industry. This is exactly the kind of shock

   3
    If anything, the non-cotton textile industries show modest positive effects during the Civil War period
due to the lack of competition from cotton textile products.


                                                    2
that urban economies are periodically exposed to, and that policymakers must regularly
address.
    The second part of the analysis seeks to understand the mechanisms behind these effects
by analyzing how each industry in the economy was impacted. I find that the shock to the
cotton textile industry had both contemporaneous and long-run effects on other industries
in the cotton textile towns. The most important of these was the Metal & Machinery
sector, an important sector of the economy and a key supplier of capital inputs to the cotton
textile industry. I show that the shock to cotton textile producers generated an increase in
bankruptcies among metal & machinery firms during the Civil War period and had long-run
negative impacts on employment in this sector in the cotton textile towns. To my knowledge,
this is the first study to provide well-identified evidence that a temporary industry-specific
shock, working through inter-industry connections, can generate long-lasting effects.
   To generate these results, I draw on two new sets of data. The first covers every
bankruptcy – over 40,000 in all – in England on a monthly basis from 1862-1866. These data,
which were digitized from original sources, report the location and occupation/industry for
each bankruptcy filing. Thus, they allow me to track the contemporaneous impact of the
Civil War at the level of cities and industries.
    Using these data, I investigate bankruptcy patterns around two periods of panic, in Oct.
of 1864 and March of 1865, when unexpected news about the Civil War generated panic
and many bankruptcies among cotton textile producers. I show that in the month following
the panic there were significant increases in bankruptcies in sectors related to the cotton
textile industry – particularly the metal & machinery sector – in the cotton textile towns,
controlling for the rate of bankruptcies in this sector in other English cities.
    The second data set I draw on describes employment at the city level in 30 industries
spanning nearly the entire private sector economy. These data are available for 71 cities from
1851-1871 and 25 cities from 1851-1891. I analyze these data using a panel approach that
compares the response of employment in each industry in the cotton textile towns, relative
to all other towns, in the post-shock period. This is done while controlling for city-industry
fixed effects and time-varying industry effects. My results reveal that the metal & machinery
sector experienced substantially lower employment in the cotton textile towns in the post
shock period, relative to non-cotton towns. Thus, it appears that the negative contempora-
neous effects revealed by the bankruptcy data also had long-run employment consequences.
However, the cotton textile industry itself does not show negative employment effects in the
cotton textile towns relative to other cities. This reflects the fact that cotton textile produc-




                                               3
ers in every location were directly impacted by the cotton shortage.4 In contrast, producers
in other industries experienced a differential impact depending on the importance of their
links to local cotton textile producers. As a result, metals and machinery producers in the
cotton textile towns suffered while their competitors in non-cotton towns did not. The result
was a permanent loss of competitiveness, and therefore employment, in these industries in
the cotton textile towns relative to firms in the same industries in non-cotton towns.5
    My results are related to recent theoretical work that considers the possibility that a shock
to one industry (or firm) can generate aggregate effects, if the impacted sector is either large
(Gabaix (2011)) or connected to many other industries (Acemoglu et al. (2012)). Related
empirical work, such as Foerster et al. (2011) and Atalay (2014), uses a model-based approach
to identify idiosyncratic shocks in aggregate data in order to assess their importance.6 This
study takes a different but complementary approach to the same issue. By studying a single
well-identified event shock, I provide clear evidence that industry-specific shocks can lead
to aggregate effects, at least at the city level. Of course, analyzing the city level is not the
same as studying the national economy, but looking at local or regional economies may be
a good starting point because it allows me to overcome the degrees-of-freedom problem that
often plagues national-level analysis.7 Furthermore, I am also able to provide evidence on
the types of inter-industry connections that appear to drive the results I observe. Links to
capital suppliers play a key role, while intermediate-goods input-output linkages appear to
be less important. Finally, while this literature has tended to focus on contemporaneous
aggregate effects, I show that these can also lead to long-run impacts.
    This paper is also related to a growing literature on the effect of trade on local labor
markets ((Topalova, 2007, 2010; Autor et al., 2012, 2013; Kovak, 2013; Dix-Carneiro &
Kovak, 2014)). An important difference between my paper and previous work in this area is
that existing studies tend to focus on changes that are plausibly permanent, at least in the
medium term, while the event I consider was widely seen as temporary. Another difference
is that I focus on an industry-specific shock, and then trace the impact operating through
inter-industry connections. In contrast, previous work tends to focus on changes that occur
across many industries with varying intensity, making it difficult to identify the role of inter-
industry connections. Finally, unlike most studies using modern data, using a historical


   4
      In fact, historical evidence suggests that smaller cotton textile producers located away from the center
of the industry may have been more severely affected by the cotton shortage.
    5
      Because industries such as metal and machinery manufacturing produced traded goods, employment will
reflect competitiveness in a setting with labor mobility.
    6
      These are two recent examples from a larger literature that is too extensive to review here.
    7
      This point has previously been made by Autor et al. (2013).


                                                      4
setting allows me to track impacts over several decades following the event.8
    This study draws on ideas from several recent studies focused on localized inter-industry
connections and agglomeration economies ((Ellison et al., 2010; Rosenthal & Strange, 2004;
Greenstone et al., 2010; Hanlon & Miscio, 2014)). These studies provide evidence that
localized inter-industry connections between firms exist and are economically important.
This study also finds evidence of such connections, and shows that they play a role in
transmitting temporary shocks across sectors.
    Methodologically, this study is related to previous work using exogenous changes to
local labor demand to study contemporaneous and long-run effects on local production or
labor markets ((Carrington, 1996; Black et al., 2005; Hornbeck, 2012)). Finally, this study
is related to Hanlon (Forthcoming), which studies the impact of the U.S. Civil War on
innovation patterns in the cotton textile industry.9
   The next section introduces the empirical setting, followed by the data, in Section 3, the
analysis, in Section 4, and conclusions in Section 5.



2       Empirical setting

The cotton textile industry was Britain’s largest manufacturing sector (by employment) in
the second half of the 19th century. In 1861, just prior to the U.S. Civil War, the industry
employed 456,646 workers, equal to 2.3% of the total population or 9.5% of manufacturing
employment.10 Cotton textile products were Britain’s most valuable export good, while raw
cotton was the most important single import.
    By the mid-19th century, when our study begins, the cotton textile industry was heavily
geographically concentrated in the Northwest region of England, comprised of the counties
of Lancashire and Cheshire. According to the 1861 British Census, 82% of the cotton textile

    8
      An exception is Dix-Carneiro & Kovak (2014), which is able to look at outcomes lasting up to 15 years
after the end of the trade liberalization that they study. This is still only about half as long as the post-shock
period available in my study.
    9
      That paper considers the impact of the shift in the relative supply of higher-quality U.S. cotton to lower
quality Indian cotton on the rate of innovations related to using these two cotton varieties. The main result
is that the shock caused directed technical change towards technologies that enabled British cotton spinners
to take advantage of relatively more abundant Indian cotton supplies. Because these innovations took place
in a very specific set of cotton-textile-related technologies they are unlikely to have a direct impact on the
broad city-level or cross-industry trends considered in this study, other than by reducing somewhat the
negative direct impact of the shortage of U.S. cotton on the British cotton textile industry.
   10
      This figure includes only those employed in cotton textile manufacturing and excludes other closely
related industries such as cotton textile printing (12,556 workers) and cotton textile dying (4,772 workers).
Thus, it likely understates the industry’s importance.


                                                        5
workers in England and Wales were located in these two Northwest counties.11 In 1851,
cotton textile production accounted for 29% of employment in these counties.
    This pattern of concentration dates back to the late 18th century, and perhaps earlier.
Using data from the reports generated by the introduction of the Factory Acts in 1838,
Crafts & Wolf (2013) show that this pattern of geographic concentration was related to the
availability of water power, the ruggedness of terrain (which decreased the cost of land),
proximity to a port (Liverpool), access to markets in other nearby cities, and the area’s
history of textile innovation in the 18th and early 19th century. While the Northwest region
also benefited from access to local coal deposits, many other regions did as well, and Crafts
& Wolf find that this had little impact on the location of the industry by 1838. By 1850 the
importance of initial advantages due to water power and cheap land had largely ceased to
matter. Access to markets in other nearby cities was also unlikely to have been an important
concern in 1850 given that nearby markets provided only a small fraction of industry demand.
Thus, of the initial conditions that drove the location of the industry, only access to the port
of Liverpool still mattered by the period we study.
    A useful feature of this empirical setting is that we can compare outcomes in the cotton
textile towns of Northwest England to outcomes in a set of similar textile-producing towns
with industries based on wool, linen, silk and lace, rather than cotton. Many of these
other textile towns were also geographically proximate to the Lancashire cotton towns, in
nearby Yorkshire County. The second most important textile industry in England during
this period was wool textiles. The two branches of this industry, Woolen and Worsted,
employed 209,276 workers in 1861, equal to about 1% of the total population of England
and just over 4% of the industrial workforce. For historical reasons that were likely similar
to those that operated in Lancashire, though not as well studied, the industry was heavily
concentrated in Yorkshire.12 Similar patterns hold in silk towns such as Derby, Norwich
and Coventry, and in Nottingham, which was a center for lace production. Despite using
different inputs, these other textile industries shared many similarities with the cotton textile
industry, including their technology, other inputs such as coal and machinery, labor forces,
employment practices, and organization. Much of this similarity was driven by the adoption
by other textile manufacturers of the innovations generated in the cotton textile industry in
the late 18th and early 19th century.

  11
     In a similar vein, Crafts & Wolf (2013) report that Lancashire County contained 66% of Britain’s cotton
textile spindles in 1850 and 79% in 1903. Their figures appear to come from the British Parliamentary
Papers for those years.
  12
     The 1861 census shows that 72% of the woolen textile workers and 90% of the worsted textile workers
in England and Wales were located in Yorkshire County. Wool textile production accounted for 30% of
employment in the industrialized West Riding region of Yorkshire.

This information is drawn from the input-output table constructed by Thomas (1987) and a variety of other
historical sources. The list excludes the main intermediate inputs – cotton, wool, flax, and silk – which were
not produced in British cities.


   The textile industries had links to other upstream and downstream industries which will
be important for our analysis. Table 1 describes the key linked industries. Authors such as
Allen (2009) have argued that the linkages between the cotton textile industry and other
industries, particularly engine and machinery manufacturing, played an important role in
the development of the British economy. One consequence of these connections was that,
over time, many of these related and supporting industries had become agglomerated in the
cotton and other textile towns.



2.1     Impact of the U.S. Civil War

Prior to 1861, most of the raw cotton used in England’s textile mills was grown in the South-
ern U.S. The onset of the U.S. Civil War in 1861 created a major disruption of raw cotton
supplies. While other major suppliers, such as India and Egypt, did increase production,
they were unable to adjust rapidly enough to make up for the sharp fall in U.S. exports.13
The left-hand panel of Figure 1 show the effect of the Civil War on British cotton textile im-
ports. The right-hand panel describes domestic raw cotton consumption, the best available
measure of production in the industry.

  13
    Furthermore, the cotton produced by these other suppliers, India in particular, was a lower-quality
variety that was an imperfect substitute for the better quality U.S. cotton (see Henderson (1969) (pp. 50-51)
and Hanlon (Forthcoming)).


                                                      7
    Figure 1: The impact of the U.S. Civil War on the British cotton textile industry

          British raw cotton import quantities       Domestic raw cotton consumption in Britain




Import data from Mitchell (1988). Domestic raw cotton consumption data, from Mitchell & Deane (1962),
are the best available measure of industry production.


    It is clear from these graphs that the U.S. Civil War had a substantial impact on the
British cotton textile industry during the 1861-1865 period. The figure also suggests that
the impact of the shock on the industry as a whole was temporary and that the resumption
of input supplies was matched by a recovery in output by 1870, followed by a return to
consistent growth. There was, however, a change in the source of these input supplies, with
cotton from suppliers such as India, Egypt and Brazil making up a much larger share than
during the pre-war period.
     Figure 2 describes the evolution of the raw cotton price during this period. We can see
that the price of raw cotton rose from an average of around 7 pence per pound in the pre-war
period to reach a peak of over 30 in 1864. I have highlighted four periods on the graph that
will be important for the analysis. The first highlighted region contains the rapid rise and
fall of prices in the second half of 1862 that marked the first period of panic in the industry. I
have also highlighted the rapid price reductions in Sept. - Nov. 1864 and in Jan. - Apr. 1865.
These periods, which I will discuss in more detail later, were characterized by dramatic drops
in the price of raw cotton, occurring during a time of great financial uncertainty. The sharp
reductions in the cotton price forced many firms holding cotton supplies into bankruptcy. A
similar, but less spectacular fall, occurred in Mar. - Jun. 1866. As in 1864-1865, the fall in
1866 was reflected in a large number of bankruptcies, which Henderson (1969) described as
“the postponed liquidation of the crisis of 1864.” These periods of crisis will be important
when we come to the analysis.
   There is little evidence that the market anticipated the impact of the Civil War. For
example, raw cotton prices show very little increase in the first year of the war. This is

                                                 8
consistent with the historical record, which suggests that contemporary observers broadly
failed to anticipate the length and severity of the Civil War.14


                          Figure 2: Benchmark cotton prices, 1855-1869




Price data were collected from The Economist magazine. This price is for the benchmark variety, Upland
Middling cotton from the U.S., but the prices for other varieties show very similar patterns.


    To argue that the U.S. Civil War created a shock that was primarily industry-specific,
I look for evidence of other large direct effects of the war. I would expect any such effects
to occur either through import or export channels. However, data from Mitchell (1988) (see
Figure 6 in the appendix) show that, once raw material for textiles are removed, British
imports suffered no noticeable effect from the U.S. Civil War. Similarly, once textile exports
are excluded, British exports also show no negative effects. In the armaments and shipbuild-
ing industries, where we would expect the war to have a more direct effect, the impact was
substantially muted by Britain’s policy of neutrality, which included a prohibition on pro-
viding weapons to either side (though we know that some producers managed to circumvent
these rules).15
  14
     For example, J.C. Ollerenshaw (1870, p.112), remarked in his presentation to the Manchester Statistical
Society that, “The American War commenced on April 5th, 1861, but for many months it had little effect
on commerce - being generally regarded as merely temporary...” A striking piece of evidence of this is
underestimation of the magnitude of the impending conflict is the fact that the initial Union Army enlistments
were for only 90 days; it was assumed that the war would be over before the expired.
  15
     One area where there was substantial changes was in ship transport, where many U.S. flagged vessels
were transferred to British ownership to avoid Confederate privateers. This may have had an impact on
the entrepot trade in port cities. Since none of the textile towns were major trading towns outside of their
textile-related imports and exports, this should not be a major concern when I confine the analysis to only


                                                      9
   Since I will make a particular comparison between towns specializing in cotton textiles
and similar towns specializing in other textile industries, it is worth noting that, unlike
cotton, other textile industries experienced little direct impact from the U.S. Civil War.16
For example, imports of raw wool were unaffected, since most of these imports come from
Spain, Australia, South Africa, or South America. While there was some effect on demand
from the U.S., due to tariffs imposed to help fund the war effort, the U.S. was a much smaller
market at the time than it is today. Also, exports to European markets increased during the
period, particularly to France following a new trade agreement in 1860.
    As a result of the geographic concentration of the cotton textile industry, the impact of
the shock generated by the Civil War was heavily geographically concentrated. This fact is
illustrated in Figure 3 which shows the number of able-bodied workers seeking relief from
local Poor Law Boards as a fraction of the total 1861 population, in the cotton region of
Northwest England over the shock period. For comparison, the figure includes the fraction of
relief seekers in the nearby wool textile region of Yorkshire and in all other English counties
over the same period.

   To summarize, the U.S. Civil War generated a large, exogenous, and well-identified shock

to one important sector of the British economy. The impact of this shock was geographically
concentrated in the cotton textile producing towns in the Northwest of England. Other
sectors do not show large direct effects from U.S. Civil War. In the next section, I describe
the data that I will use to analyze the differential impact of this shock across English cities.



3      Data

The first main data set used in this study describes the population of English cities starting
in 1841. This new database was collected and digitized from British Census of Population
abstracts. The census data were collected every ten years, with the first usable census occur-
ring in 1841. Because these data will be used to analyze patterns of overall city population,
it is important that we work with consistent geographic areas. To obtain geographically con-
sistent series, I take advantage of the fact that in each census report the Census Office took
the town boundaries for a set of major towns based on that year and then went back to the
previous census data and used the more geographically disaggregated data to reconstruct
the population within those boundaries in several previous decades. These reconstructed
town population data are available in two series, with the first spanning 1841-1891 and 46
cities and the second covering 1851-1901 and 55 cities.17 Thus, two or three observations are
available prior to the U.S. Civil War, and it is possible to track impacts up to 35 years after
the War’s end.18
    To provide further evidence on the impact of the shock on city population, I take ad-
vantage of information on the county of birth of the residents in each city reported in the
Census of Population Abstracts. These data allow me to estimate the net flows of workers
into a town from each other county over the course of each decade.
    To analyze the role of specific industries, I use the occupation data, also from the Census
of Population reports, covering 1851-1891. The occupation data cover every individual,
including women and children, and in the vast majority of cases the reported occupations
closely correspond to industries. Examples include “cotton textile spinner”, “iron founder”,
or “boot and shoe maker”. Over time, the Census changed the set of occupational categories
  17
     The data from the 1891 Census, which covers 1841-1891, reports population for 57 major towns based on
the 1891 town boundaries. Of these, I am able to identify the share of cotton textiles in total employment in
1851 for 46 towns. The data from the 1901 census reports population for 79 cities for the 1851-1901 period
based on 1901 boundaries. Out of these, I can identify the 1851 cotton textile employment share for 55 of
these towns.
  18
     The 1861 observations were collected before the beginning of the U.S. Civil War and there is little chance
that these could have been substantially affected by expectations of the onset of the conflict. Thus, I treat
1861 as a pre-war observation.

private sector industry categories that will be used in the analysis.19 Table 2 provides an

Employment figures include only the 25 towns available in the 1851-1891 analysis dataset.


       The set of towns for which occupational data are reported changes sharply in 1881,
  19
      These categories exclude agricultural occupations, government workers, non-workers, and a limited num-
ber of occupations such as ”Labourer” that do not clearly correspond to an industry.
   20
      These industries are very similar to those used in Hanlon & Miscio (2014) except that in this project
it is necessary to break out the textile sector into separate series for cotton, wool, linen, and silk textiles.
One consequence of this is that the useful data for this project end in 1891; after that date it becomes
more difficult to generate consistent series for the separate textile industries. Several of these industries
require further explanation. We have to be particularly careful with “Textile finishing, etc.” which contains
supporting textile-related industries such as bleaching and dying, small textile sectors such as ribbon or
lace making, and textile workers that did not report their particular branch. The service industries are also
somewhat complex. The “Messenger, warehousing, etc.,” for example, contains a variety of communication
and storage-related work. The category “Merchant, agent, etc.” contains all business services (including, e.g.,
accountants and brokers). “Professionals” is made up primarily of lawyers and doctors. The “Chemicals
& drugs” industry contains some intermediate cotton textile inputs such as dyes. “Oil, soap, etc.” also
provided inputs, such as rubber goods, to cotton textile production.

when the census office begins reporting these data only for towns with a population over
50,000. Thus, I will conduct analysis using two sets of city-industry data. One data set
covers 1851-1871 and includes 71 towns, with 8 towns specializing in cotton textiles and 10
towns specializing in non-cotton textile products. The second data set covers 1851-1891 and
includes 25 towns, with 6 towns specializing in cotton and 6 towns specializing in non-cotton
textile products.
    In addition to the Census data, I will also draw on a new set of data covering all bankrupt-
cies in England from 1862-1866. These data provide a uniquely rich and comprehensive way
to track one important aspect of the shock in real-time. The roughly 40,000 bankruptcies in
the database that I construct were hand-entered from announcements printed in the London
Gazette, England’s official government register. These data are available on a monthly basis
and include the name, location, and occupation of the bankrupt individual. The original
data report around 15,000 unique occupations, which I have classified by hand into industry
categories that reflect those available in the Census data (Table 2).
    There are a few important facts to keep in mind when using the bankruptcy data. First,
there was a major change in bankruptcy law that came into effect in November of 1861.
This change expanded bankruptcy to cases where it had not applied before, leading to very
high levels of bankruptcy in late 1861 and 1862. As a result, in the analysis I use data
starting in June, 1863, when bankruptcies had returned to more normal levels. Second,
these were personal bankruptcy filings in a time in which the vast majority of firms were
privately owned. Thus, they will capture substantially all firm bankruptcies, but they may
also include bankruptcies by individuals who are not firm owners. For example, the category
of cotton textile related bankruptcies can include both the bankruptcy of a firm owner and
the bankruptcy of a foreman at the firm. Thus, the bankruptcy counts may not reflect the
wide variation in the size of the bankruptcy they reflect; the bankruptcy of a major cotton
manufacturer will look the same as the bankruptcy of a one-man shop. Unfortunately,
because we do not know the size of the bankruptcy it is not possible to adjust for these
differences.21 Despite these issues, we will see that the bankruptcy data can still help shed
light on the impact of the Civil War shock.




  21
     This is very similar to the problem regularly encountered when using patent data. The solution in that
setting is to use additional information to adjust for the quality differences across patents. Unfortunately I
have not found a good way to adjust the bankruptcy counts for the importance of individual filings.

4       Analysis
This section begins with an analysis of the impact of the U.S. Civil War on overall population
growth in cotton textile towns relative to other towns in England. I then turn to the analysis
of the role of industries in generating these effects.


4.1       Patterns of town population growth

A good starting point for understanding the impact of the shock on city population growth is
to look at the average growth rates in the cotton towns and all of the other towns over each
decade in the 1841-1891 period. This is done in Table 3 using 46 towns. There are ten cotton
towns, defined as those with more than 10 percent of the working population employed in
the cotton textile industry in 1851.22 There are eight other textile towns, defined as those
with more than 10 percent of the working population employed in any textile industry and
less than 10 percent employed in cotton textiles. In practice, these towns are dominated by
other textile industries and have fairly low levels of cotton textile employment (never more
than 2.8%). These definitions will be used throughout the paper.
   The first pattern to take away from Table 3 is that, relative to all other towns or to just
other textile towns, the cotton towns in the Northwest of England suffered slower growth in
the 1861-1871 period. This was a reversal of the previous trend of faster growth in cotton
towns. After 1871, we see that growth in the cotton towns rebounds, but does not overshoot,
suggesting that population in these downs did catch-up after the shock, at least through 1891.


                      Table 3: Average decadal population growth in towns

                               1841-1851         1851-1861      1861-1871      1871-1881     1881-1891
       All towns (47)            25.1%             22.2%          19.1%          20.2%         19.9%
       Cotton towns (10)         22.3%             20.4%         10.8%           18.3%         13.0%
       Other textile towns (8)   19.0%             12.2%          16.2%          17.5%         13.3%
       Non-textile towns(29)     25.8%             22.7%          21.3%          20.8%         21.8%

The cotton towns are identified as those with more than 10 percent of the working population employed in
the cotton textile industry in 1851. The cotton towns are Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Bury, Manchester,
Oldham, Preston, Rochdale, Stockport and Wigan, which are all in Lancashire or Cheshire. The other
textile towns are identified as those with more than 10 percent of the working population employed in any
textile industry and less than 10 percent employed in cotton textiles. The other textile towns and their main
products are Huddersfield (wool), Halifax (wool), Bradford (wool), Leeds (wool), Derby (silk), Norwich (silk),
Nottingham (lace), and Coventry (silk).
  22
   This is a natural cutoff point, since there is a sharp drop-off in the share of cotton textiles in town
employment from Wigan, with 16.5%, to Warrington, with 7%.


                                                     14
     Figure 4 allows us to compare population growth in cotton towns compared other textile
towns over the study period. This figure presents the sum of log population for the cotton
and other textile towns across the entire 1841-1891 period.23 This graph shows that there was
little change in the population growth rate in the other textile towns over this period, so that
a trend-line based on the 1841-1861 period predicts population through 1891 reasonably well.
For the cotton towns, we can see that the trend is fairly constant in the 1841-1861 period, but
slows substantially between 1861-1871. There is also weak evidence that population growth
remained lower in the cotton textile towns after 1871 than would have been predicted based
on the initial growth trend.



                 Figure 4: Population growth in cotton and other textile towns




   Next, I explore these patterns using a regression approach. The baseline regression
specification I consider is,

  23
    Using the sum of log population here ensures that the patterns are not dominated by the large cities. It
also matches my empirical approach.


                                                    15
        ln(P OPct ) − ln(P OPct−1 ) = β0 + β1 (CottonT OW Nc ∗ Shockt ) + γc + λt + eit                  (1)


where P OPct is the population of city c in period t, Shockt is an indicator variable for the
shock period, γc is a full set of city fixed effects, and λt is a full set of time effects.
   The coefficient of interest in these regressions is β1 . In interpreting this coefficient, it is
important to keep in mind that, because all towns are operating within a connected economic
system, a negative shock to the cotton textile towns may generate positive effects for the
non-cotton towns. Thus, the β1 coefficient will reveal the change in relative growth rates
between cotton and non-cotton towns generated by the shock, which will be composed of
both the negative effects in the cotton towns and any positive impact of the shock on non-
cotton towns. Thus, this estimate will likely be larger than the change in the growth rate of
the cotton towns relative to their counterfactual growth in the absence of the shock.
    Spatial correlation is a potential concern in this setting. To deal with this, I estimate
standard errors robust to spatial correlation up to 100km based on Conley (1999).24 These
spatial-correlation-robust standard errors are generally lower than the heteroskedasticity-
robust standard errors, suggesting that errors are negatively spatially correlated. Thus, I
also present standard robust standard errors for all specifications. While serial correlation
can be an issue in panel data settings (Bertrand et al. (2004)), this is less likely to be a
major concern for the current study given the relatively short time dimension in the data.
    Table 4 describes results generated for different time periods using the specification in
Equation 1. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are reported in single parentheses,
while spatial-correlation-robust standard errors are in double parentheses. Because I present
multiple standard errors for each regression, I will not follow the standard practice of using
* to indicate statistical significance levels.




  24
     To implement this approach I follow Hsiang (2010). I have experimented with allowing correlation over
different distances and I did not find that this substantially affected the confidence intervals. I have also
experimented with allowing limited serial correlation based on the method from Newey & West (1987) and
this also does not seem to substantially impact the results.

       of city fixed effects and year effects. The regressions in columns 1-5 use data from the 1891
       census covering 1841-1891. The results in column 6 are based on a slightly different data
       set from the 1901 census covering 1851-1901.




    The first column reports results from a placebo test using only data from 1841-1861, prior
to the war. We can see that the cotton towns do not exhibit differential growth patterns
during this pre-period. The second column compares the decades just before and just after
the war. There is clear evidence that the rate of population growth in the cotton towns fell
in the 1861-1871 period. Column 3 expands the pre-period to include 1841-1851. The results
in both columns 2 and 3 are statistically significant at the standard 95% confidence level.
Columns 4 and 5 use the full set of available data and estimate separate impacts for the
1871-1881 and 1881-1891 periods. Here, we are looking for evidence that the cotton towns
experienced faster growth after 1871 which might have allowed them to catch-up to their
previous growth path. The results provide no evidence that any such catch-up took place,
at least before 1891. This suggests that reduced growth in 1861-1871 generated a persistent

                                                    17
effect on the level of population in the cotton producing towns.
    The results in Table 4 include the full set of towns for which sufficient data are available.
A potential concern here, as in all difference-in-difference analysis, is the parallel trends
assumption; for the procedure to deliver reliable results, the growth path of the untreated
towns, controlling for their initial growth rate, must provide a valid counterfactual for the
treated towns. We may worry that there is substantial variation in the underlying character-
istics of the cities that may lead to this assumption being violated. Seaports, for example,
may not be a good counterfactual for inland industrial towns. One way to address this
concern is to confine the analysis to a subset of towns that are more similar to the treated
towns. This can strengthen our confidence in the parallel trends assumption, but it comes
at the cost of working with a somewhat reduced sample size.
   Table 5 presents results calculated by comparing the 10 cotton textile towns to the 8
other towns where (non-cotton) textile production formed an important part of the economy.
These towns are economically very similar to the cotton textile towns. This table shows that
I obtain even stronger results when comparing the cotton textile towns to this subset of
economically similar towns.
    To further support these findings, I can draw on information on the movements of workers
between locations provided by the Census of Population. The census data can help reveal
migration patterns within England because the population enumerated in a particular loca-
tion are asked their location of birth. Substantial changes in the population of one county
or town that report a county of birth in another can then be used as an indicator of net
population flows between locations.

    Figure 6 plots the number of residents of other English counties who were born in the
Northwestern Counties (Lancashire and Cheshire) in each year. We can see that the Civil
War period was characterized by a sharp increase in residents of other counties who were
born in the Northwest, suggesting that out-migration took place during this period. The
number of people born in the Northwest but living in other counties increased by around
21,000 from 1861-1871, equal to a movement of about 0.7% of the 1861 population or 1.4% of
the 1861 working population of the Northwest counties. This compares to an increase of just
over 1,600 from 1851-1861. Note that, because these data span the 1861-1871 decade, they
will understate migration during the shock period if it was accompanied by return migration
before 1871.

                             Data collected from Census of Population reports.




    Much of this out-migration flowed to the textile and industrial districts of nearby York-
shire county.25 Figure 7 describes the change in the number of Northwest residents reporting
Yorkshire as the location of birth and Yorkshire residents reporting the Northwestern coun-
ties as a location of birth. Both of these series reflect the net migration from Lancashire to
Yorkshire during the Civil War period, and we can see that the original patterns of migration
resume after 1871 but that there is no evidence of the overshooting needed to return the
locations to the original growth path. Thus, the shock period generated a persistent shift in
the relative position of the two lines, suggesting that the migration flows that occurred in
the 1861-1871 period were not reversed in later decades.




  25
     A number of factors may have contributed to the migration flows out of the Northwest region in response
to the Civil War shock. One likely contributing factor is the relatively modest level of transfer payments
available at the time. While this period marked a turning point in the development of the British system
of Poor Relief, aid remained primarily for the truly destitute. Another potential driver was the availability
of less-affected cities close to the cotton towns, many with jobs matching the skills of the displaced workers.
In Appendix A.3 I explore a number of factors that might have contributed to these migration flows. I find
that three factors – geographic proximity to the cotton towns, the initial population of Northwest residents
in a town, and the share of town employment in other textile industries – are correlated with the size of
migration flows to the non-cotton towns. Among these, geographic proximity appears to be the dominant
factor determining the destination of migrants leaving the cotton textile towns during the 1861-1871 decade.

                         Data collected from Census of Population reports.



    This section has provided evidence that population growth in cotton textile towns was
reduced in the 1861-1871 period relative to other British towns. There is no evidence of
higher growth in the years after 1871 that would suggest catch-up to the initial growth path.
Migration data confirms the increased outflow and decreased inflow of residents behind the
city-size effects. In the next section, I unpack the overall city effects by looking at the role
played by specific industries and the connections between them.


4.2    Decomposing effects by industry

This section explores the role of industries in generating the persistent city-size effect docu-
mented in the previous section. The analysis proceeds in four parts. First, using Census of
Population data I consider the contribution of different industrial sectors to growth in the
cotton textile towns and compare this to the pattern observed in other towns. In the second
step, I draw on the bankruptcy data to show how shocks to the cotton textile industry led
to bankruptcies in other related industries during the Civil War period. I then return to
the Census of Population data to look at whether similar patterns appear when we look
at industry outcomes in the long-run. Finally, because I observe particularly strong effects
among metal & machinery producing firms, I provide some further evidence on the patterns
observed in this industry.
    My starting point is Table 8, which uses the Census of Population data to decompose
city employment growth into the contribution of broad sectors of the city economies. The

                                                21
tables is read as follows: if an industry represents 10% of employment in a set of towns
at the beginning of the decade, and grows by 10% over the course of the decade in those
towns, then the contribution of that industry to employment growth in that set of towns is
1%. Thus, the figures in this table reflect both the initial size and the growth rate of each
sector of the economy, which together determine the sector’s contribution to city employment
growth. The first panel focuses on the six cotton textile towns available in the 1851-1891
city-industry database. The second panel conducts a similar exercise for the non-cotton
textile towns, while the last panel includes all towns other than the cotton textile towns.
    In the cotton textile towns, employment growth prior to the U.S. Civil War was driven by
cotton textile manufacturing and other non-textile manufacturing (highlighted rows). How-
ever, the growth contribution made by the cotton textile industry dropped sharply starting
in 1861-1871. Clearly the direct shock to the cotton textile industry had an important ef-
fect on overall employment growth in these towns. The contribution of cotton textile to
employment growth continued to fall in 1871-1881. This was due in part to poor macroe-
conomic conditions from 1873-1879, a period called the “Long Depression”. Cotton textiles
employment growth then recovered after 1881.
    Importantly, employment growth in non-textile manufacturing industries also slowed
down substantially during the 1861-1871 period. This fall cut an average of over 4% off
of employment growth in the cotton textile towns, which is roughly as large as the di-
rect impact of the cotton textile industry itself. Non-textile manufacturing growth then
increased after 1871, but the growth contribution of this sector remained below the initial
rate through 1891. This pattern suggests that the shock had an important indirect effect
on city growth in the cotton textile towns, through these other manufacturing industries.
Comparing this pattern that observed in the bottom panel (highlighted row) shows that the
reduced growth in the non-textile manufacturing sector in the cotton textile towns was not
driven by national-level changes in the growth contribution of this sector.
   The story is quite different in the other textile towns described in the middle panel. There,
the 1861-1871 period was characterized by a sharp increase in growth in non-cotton textile
manufacturing. An even more interesting pattern is visible for the non-textile manufacturing
industries, which experienced a substantial increase in their growth contribution in 1861-
1871 and a sustained higher level through 1891. This persistent increase contrasts with the
persistent decrease in non-textile manufacturing experienced in the cotton textile towns.




                                              22
                    Table 8: Decomposing the growth contribution by sector




Each cell of these tables represents the contribution of an industry to city growth over the period indicated.
So if an industry represents 10% of employment and grows 10% over the period, that industry’s contribution
to city growth is 1%. Thus, the column sum of each table equals the total growth of the group of towns over
the period. Note that the column sums will differ from those in Table 3 both because we are working with
a different set of cities and because they represent employed population rather than total population.


    This table reveals that only about half of the reduction in employment growth in the

                                                     23
cotton textile towns from 1861-1871 was due to the losses in the cotton textile industry
itself. Other industries – specifically non-textile manufacturing sectors – played an equally
important role. In the remainder of this section, I investigate the role that linkages between
the cotton textile industry and other sectors played in generating these effects.
    I begin by considering patterns during the shock period using the bankruptcy data, which
start in the middle of 1863 and continue through the end of 1866. Figure 5 describes the
pattern of bankruptcies in cotton textiles (solid line) and in related sectors (stacked bars) in
major cotton textile towns during this period.26 We can see that there were three periods
with high levels of bankruptcies in the cotton textile sector over this time frame.27 These
correspond to the three periods in which the price of cotton rapidly declined (recall Figure
2).


                       Figure 5: Bankruptcies in major cotton textile towns




The bar chart (left-hand axis) describes bankruptcies in a number of industrial sectors related to cotton
textiles. Solid line (right-hand axis) describes the number of bankruptcies in the cotton textile sector. The
cotton textile towns included in this chart are Accrington, Ashton-under-Lyne, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley,
Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale, Warrington, Wigan, Stockport and Chester. All of these are
in Lancashire except for the last two, which are in Cheshire.
  26
     This figure excludes a large number of bankruptcies by shopkeepers, beer sellers, farmers, government
employees and other miscellaneous sectors. Figure 12 in Appendix A.4 shows that there is at most a weak
relationship between bankruptcies in these other sectors and bankruptcies in the cotton textile industry.
  27
     There is also evidence of a high level of cotton textile bankruptcies in 1862, but it is difficult to be sure
that these were not related to the new bankruptcy law passed in 1861.


                                                       24
    This figure shows a fairly clear pattern in which sharp increases in bankruptcies in the
cotton textile sector were accompanied, usually with a one-month lag, by spikes in bankrupt-
cies in other industrial sectors. Many of these additional bankruptcies are in the non-textile
manufacturing industries, though smaller increases also appear in construction, merchants,
and other textile industries.
    It is worth pausing now to consider the historical record on the causes of these large
spikes in cotton textile industry bankruptcies. The first and largest increase, in October of
1864, has been called the “peace panic” (Watts (1866)) because it was generated by rumors
that a peaceful end to the Civil War was being negotiated. Watts (1866) (p. 224) describes
this event:
           ...a rumor crossed the Atlantic that men were meeting at Niagara Falls,
           to try to arrange the terms of peace. Straightway men, instead of shaking
           hands and throwing up their hats in thankfulness...looked into each other’s
           faces with blank despair, as if peace, instead of war, was the greatest
           curse upon earth. Nor was it without reason that this fear and terror was
           expressed. Middling Orleans cotton fell from thirty-one pence to twenty-
           three pence halfpenny...men who held largely of cotton, twist, or cloth
           found their fortunes vanished in a night at the breath of this rumor. All
           trade arrangements were in chaos. The workers on full-time were reduced
           in two months by one hundred and forty-four thousand and fifty nine...
In a similar vein, the sharp fall in prices in the spring of 1865 was due to news that made it
increasingly clear that the South could not win the war.28 What this means for our purposes
is that we can think of the timing of these two price declines as largely exogenous, and driven
by the changing fortunes of the cotton textile industry. Thus, the responses observed in other
sectors can be interpreted as the causal effects of the shock working through linkages to the
cotton textile industry. In contrast to these events, the spike in bankruptcies in mid-1866
was driven by forces outside of the cotton textile sector, so this cannot be used to identify
links between cotton textiles and other sectors of the economy.29
   I now turn to a regression approach that takes advantage of the exogenous shocks caused
by the panics in late 1864 and early 1865. Because I am dealing with count data, I use
Poisson regressions, specifically the Poisson Conditional Fixed Effects Maximum Likelihood
Estimator (PCFE). The regression specification is,
  28
      Watts (1866) writes, “In February, when it became evident that the Confederate government in America
must die, the fall of Richmond renewed the panic in this country, and again the prices of cotton and cloth
fell suddenly and considerably.”
   29
      Specifically, the panic in 1866 was precipitated by the failure of Overend, Gurney, & Co., a “bankers
bank” that played an important role in the British financial system at this time.

                                 BKcti = φc exp αi CotP anicct + ηt                                      (2)

where BKcti is the count of bankruptcies in industry i, city c and month t, φc is a set of
city fixed effects, CotP anicct is an indicator variable for the cotton towns in Nov., 1864
and April, 1865 (the months after the cotton price drops generated a spike in cotton textile
bankruptcies), and ηt is a full set of time effects. Including these time effects allows me to
control for economy-wide factors, such as changes in the interest rate, that may have affected
the level of bankruptcies in an industry. This regression is run separately for each industry to
obtain an industry-specific αi describing whether each industry was impacted in the month
after each of the panics.
    The PCFE estimator has the advantage that it is robust to time dependent errors as long
as the conditional mean is correctly specified (Bertanha & Moser (2014)). Spatial dependence
may be a concern, but Bertanha & Moser (2014) show that as long as the pattern of spatial
dependence is time invariant the standard sandwich PCFE estimator is consistent. My data
pass Bertanha & Moser’s test for time-varying spatial dependence, so the results below use
the standard sandwich estimator.30
    The industry definitions used in these bankruptcy data follow those used in the city-
industry employment data built from the Census returns. However, because of sparseness in
the data at the city-industry level, several of the smaller industries, those with few bankrupt-
cies, have been aggregated.31
   The results are shown in Table 9. Note that the number of observations used in each
regression changes, as some industries show no bankruptcies in some towns over the period
covered by these data, resulting in these towns being dropped. The first column of the top
panel shows that bankruptcies increase in the cotton textile towns in the month following the
panics. In particular, the incidence rate ratio for the arrival of a (non-cotton) bankruptcy
in a cotton textile town during a panic period is 1.59. The remaining columns look at
the response of particular industries in the month after the panics. While most industries
show an increase, only two – “Merchants, agents, etc.” and “Metal & Machinery” – exhibit

  30
      I have also explored results generated using the estimator introduced by Bertanha & Moser (2014) that
allows for time-varying spatial dependence. That approach generally leads to lower standard errors than
those reported in Table 9.
   31
      Wool, linen/flax, and silk textiles have been aggregated into a single “Other textiles” category, while
road, rail and sea & canal transport have been aggregated into a single “Transport” category. “Messen-
gers, warehousing, etc.”, which includes warehousing, has been combined with the “Merchants, agents, etc”
category. Two similar manufacturing industries, “Oils, soaps, etc.” and “Chemicals & drugs”, have been
combined. Several industries with too few bankruptcies have not been included in the analysis: “Earthenware
& bricks,” “Shipbuilding,” “Water & gas service,” and “Tobacco.”

statistically significant increases in bankruptcies. The first of these provides business services
to the cotton textile industry. The second provides capital goods. The coefficient on the
“Metal & Machinery” result suggests an incidence rate ratio of 3.7, implying a substantial
increase in bankruptcies in that industry in cotton textile towns in the month following each
panic. Two categories, “Professionals” and “Mining related”, show statistically significant
reductions in bankruptcies in the month following a panic. However, these results are highly
sensitive to the specification and should be considered unreliable. A variety of robustness
check related to these results are presented in Appendix A.4. These show that the results
for all non-cotton industries, for “Merchants, agents, etc.”, and for “Metal & Machinery”
are robust to changes in the underlying data and the empirical approach.

    The results above show that panic in the cotton textile sector spilled over into other
industries, generating contemporaneous negative effects. In the next part of the analysis, I
consider whether these contemporaneous impacts are also reflected in the long-run. To do
so, I return to the Census of Population data. I start using data covering 1851-1871. The
advantage of starting with this data set is that it allows me to analyze patterns occurring
across 71 towns, with 8 cotton towns and 10 other textile towns.32 I apply a difference-in-
difference approach:
                                                 X
           ln(EM Pict+1 ) − ln(EM Pict ) = α +       ai (CotT OW Nc ∗ Y R1861−71 ) + ηit + θic + ict      (3)
                                                 i




where EM Pict is employment in industry i, city c, and period t, CotT OW Nc is an indica-
tor variable for towns with more than 10% of employment in cotton textiles in 1851, and
Y R1861−71 is an indicator variable for the 1861-1871 period, and ηit and θic represent, re-
spectively, a full set of industry-time and city-industry effects.33 The ai coefficients in this
regression allow me to identify the growth response of each industry in the cotton textile
towns in the post-shock period, controlling for national industry growth and time-invariant
city-industry growth rates.
    Both serial and spatial correlation in errors are a potential concern in these regressions.
To deal with these, I apply multi-dimensional clustered standard errors following Cameron
et al. (2011) and Thompson (2011). Errors are clustered by city-industry to deal with serial
correlation, by city-year, to allow correlated errors among industries within the same city,
and by industry-year, to allow cross-city spatially correlated errors at the industry level.
    Table 10 lists the estimated ai coefficients and standard errors. The first set of results are
for a regression that includes all towns, while the second set are obtained when using only
data from the 18 textile towns. A consistent result across both of these regressions is that
the Metal & Machinery industry experiences a significant reduction in employment growth
in the 1861-1871 period in the cotton textile towns. Note that “Cotton textiles” does not
exhibit negative impacts in the cotton textile towns relative to other cities in the data.




  32
      Recall that cotton towns are those with more than 10% of their employment in cotton textiles. Other
textile towns are those with more than 10% of their employment in textiles but less than 10% in cotton
textiles. In general the share of cotton in these towns is low.
   33
      Note that I could potentially include city-year effects here. These are not included because I want to
allow for the possibility that many (perhaps all) industries grew more slowly in a particular city in a period,
a possibility that would be eliminated if we control for overall city growth in a year.

specification in Equation 3. The data cover 1851-1871. The first set of results use data on 71 towns with

a full set of city-industry and industry-year effects. Standard errors, shown in parenthesis, are clustered by
city-industry, city-year, and industry-year. The omitted industry is “General services.”


    Next, I use data covering the full 1851-1891 period and consider the effects on levels,
rather than growth rates, to identify the industries that experienced persistent employment
shifts in the cotton textile towns following the Civil War. The specification is,
                                          X

where P OSTt is an indicator variable for the decades after 1861.
   Table 11 lists the estimated bi coefficients and standard errors for regressions based on
Equation 4 with data from 1851-1891. The results in this table consistently show that
the Metal & Machinery sector suffered reduced employment in the decades after the Civil
War shock. Construction, another capital-goods supplying industry also shows consistent
negative effects. There is also evidence that some other textile industries, such as “Silk
textiles,” suffered reduced employment in the cotton textile towns. Results generated using
more disaggregated data divided into 152 industry categories, available in Appendix A.5,
show that among metal and machinery industries, the most negatively affected were pin and
needle manufacturers and engine and machine makers. Both of these produced important
capital inputs used by the textile industries.34
    One consistent result in Tables 9 - 11 is that the Metal & Machinery sector suffered
negative contemporaneous and long-term impacts in the cotton towns. This was an impor-
tant sector in the British economy during this period.35 It was also a major employer in
the six cotton textile towns studied in Table 11. Out of the 30 industries in the analysis
database, Metal & Machinery firms made up between 3.3 and 10.4 percent of employment
in the cotton textile towns and were always among the 5 largest employers. In two towns,
Bolton and Oldham, it was the second most important private-sector industry. Motivated
by these facts, in the remainder of this section I take a closer look at the Metal & Machinery
industry.
    Historical evidence suggests that the Metal & Machinery sector had important ties to
the cotton textile industry, ranging from textile machinery and tools to the steam engines
that powered the textile factories.36 There is also evidence that these producers gained from
close proximity to their cotton textile customers. Textile machinery makers in Bolton, for
example, specialized in producing machines for spinning fine thread counts, a product in
which Bolton textile spinners were dominant, while in Oldham, machine makers specialized
in machinery for spinning the coarser thread count products that were largely produced by
textile factories in the Oldham area.
  34
     The pin and needle manufacturers would have been important for producing components, such as cards,
used in cotton textile machinery.
  35
     Allen (2009) (p. 273) writes that, “the great achievement of the British Industrial Revolution was,
in fact, the creation of the first large engineering industry that could mass-produce productivity-raising
machinery”
  36
     Farnie (2004) writes that, “Textile engineering became the most important of all the ancillary trades [to
cotton textile production]. Its light engineering section supplied spinning machines and looms and a while
succession of related equipment, while its heavy engineering industry supplied steam engines, boilers, and
mechanical stokers.”

specification in Equation 4. The data cover 1851-1891. The first set of results use data on 25 towns with
750 city-industries and 2987 observations. The second set of results use data on 12 textile towns with 360
city-industries and 1435 observations. In both sets, there are 6 cotton textile towns. The regressions include
a full set of city-industry and industry-year effects. Standard errors, shown in parenthesis, are clustered by
city-industry, city-year, and industry-year. The omitted industry is “General services.”




    Figure 12 describes the growth path of employment in the Metal & Machinery industry
in the cotton towns, the non-cotton textile towns, and all non-cotton towns, over the 1851-
1891 period. Employment is given as the sum of log employment across the towns in each
group, so that the larger towns do not dominate the results, and for comparability each

series has been normalized by its 1851 value.37 Prior to the Civil War, we can see that this
industry was growing more rapidly in the cotton textile towns. After 1861, growth in the
cotton textile towns slows down sharply, while growth in the non-cotton towns remains high
(though slowing slightly during the weak economy of the 1870’s). Overall, it appears that the
Civil War period marked a relative decline of the growth of Metal & Machinery employment
in the cotton textile towns.
    To summarize the results presented in this section, we can see that the shock to the cotton
textile industry was transmitted to other industries in the cotton towns, particularly suppliers
of capital goods. The negative impact of the shock on these industries played an important
role in the reduced overall city growth rate in cotton textile towns. Figure 8 suggests that
the fall in employment, particularly in the large Metal & Machinery manufacturing industry,
contributed as much to the reduction in city growth as the direct effect operating through
the cotton textile industry.

5        Conclusions
This paper draws on a unique historical setting in order to provide well-identified evidence
on the persistent impacts of temporary sector-specific economic shocks to urban economies.
  37
       Note that focusing on log employment is also consistent with my econometric approach.


                                                     32
To my knowledge, this is the first study to trace out the persistent impacts of such shocks in
a well-identified way. I find that the shock had a temporary effect on city population growth
and a permanent impact on the level of city population. These levels effects are visible up
to 35 years after the end of the temporary shock and show no sign of diminishing. This may
have implications for urban policymakers, particularly when facing decisions related to the
level of industrial diversity in a city.
    My findings suggest that city growth may be characterized by multiple equilibrium growth
paths. This result contrasts with previous studies, such as, (Davis & Weinstein, 2002, 2008),
which do not find persistent impacts on city size following a large negative shock.38 It is not
clear why my results differ from those obtained in previous work. This difference may be
due to differences in the empirical setting, in particular because labor mobility was high and
government intervention minimal in the British cities that I study. Alternatively, it may be
due to differences in the type of shock considered, since I focus on an economic event while
other studies have generally focused on war-related damage. Understanding why we observe
persistent impacts in one setting but not in others is one direction for future research.
    This is also the first study to provide well-identified evidence on the role of inter-industry
connections in translating sector-specific shocks into aggregate effects. These inter-industry
effects are important, explaining roughly half of the reduction in city employment growth
during the Civil War period. This provides support for theoretical work in this area (Gabaix
(2011), Acemoglu et al. (2012)) and complements empirical results generated with more
aggregated data (e.g., Foerster et al. (2011), Atalay (2014)). Additionally, this study provides
new evidence on the channels that may be behind these results. While current studies tend
to focus on all types of input-output connections, my findings suggest that connections to
capital suppliers play a particularly important role. One explanation for this may be that
capital investment was more procyclical than intermediate goods purchases, so that capital
suppliers suffered more from the idiosyncratic shocks to their customers than intermediate
suppliers. Another potential explanation is that capital producers may have been more
reliant on local financing, which could have dried up during the crises. Further work is
needed to differentiate between these and other potential channels. Finally, this study shows
that these transmitted contemporaneous effects can also have long-run impacts, a point that
has not been made in previous studies in this literature.




  38
     Other studies, such as Bleakley & Lin (2012) and Redding et al. (2011) do find evidence of persistent
effects. These studies both conder factors that were temporary but were in place for at least a couple of
decades.

exports related to textiles have been separated from those related to all other industries.

   Figure 7 shows employment in the four main textile sectors over the 1851-1891 period
based on Census of Population data available every ten years starting in 1851. The cotton
textile industry grew rapidly from 1851-1861, but growth slowed from 1861-1871. In contrast,
wool textiles experienced a growth acceleration during the 1861-1871 period, due largely to
the lack of competition from cotton textiles. All of the textile industries experienced slow
growth from 1871-1881, a period that includes the Long Depression of 1873-1879. Over all
periods, cotton textiles did substantially better than the declining silk and flax/linen sectors.

Chart includes data from the 25 towns for which city-industry data are available over the 1851-1891 period
                                     (see Data section for details).




    Figure 8 provides some additional data that allows us to construct a rough proxy for the
pattern of productivity growth in the cotton textile industry over the study period. The
solid line describes national cotton textile employment over the study period (in a log scale).
We can see that the pattern of national employment growth matches the pattern shown in
Figure 7 for the 25 towns contained in the main city-industry database. The top line in
Figure 8 gives cotton consumption in the year before each employment observation based
on data from Mitchell & Deane (1962). I.e., for 1851 I report cotton consumption in 1850.
This is done both because the Census employment data come from early in the year and
because it allows me to report consumption in 1860 rather than 1861, when consumption was
impacted by the beginning of the Civil War. This is the best available measure of industry
output. Finally, the dashed line in the middle of the graph reports cotton consumption, in
thousands of pounds, per cotton textile worker. This provides a rough proxy for productivity
growth in the industry. We can see that productivity grew strongly between 1851 and
1861, stagnated from 1861-1871, and then resumed growing at a somewhat slower pace.
This pattern may seem surprising given that Hanlon (Forthcoming) shows that there was
a burst in innovative activity in the cotton textile industry during the Civil War period.
However, the innovation undertaken during the Civil War period was primarily aimed at
mitigating the negative productivity effect of switching from higher-quality U.S. cotton to

                                                   37
lower quality cotton coming primarily from India. Thus, innovation during the Civil War
period served mainly to reduce the negative productivity effects of the war, rather than to
increase productivity relative to the pre-war period.




Figure 8: Cotton textile employment, consumption, and consumption per worker, 1851-1891




Total cotton textile employment for England and Wales is based on Census data. Cotton consumption data,
from Mitchell & Deane (1962), are for the year before the employment observation.




    Figure 9 compares the agglomeration patterns of the textile industries over the study
period using the index from Ellison & Glaeser (1997) and firm size data from the 1907
Census of Production. Somewhat surprisingly, cotton textile was actually less agglomerated
than the other textile industries during the study period. This was due in part to the fact
that the industry was so large that it was forced to spread over numerous towns, while smaller
textile industries were easier to accommodate in just one or a few towns. Another pattern
visible in the data is that after 1861 the cotton textile industry became more agglomerated,
while the level of agglomeration tended to decline in all of the other textile industries over
the study period.

A.2        Data appendix

This section presents some additional details about the data used in this study. For the
Census of Population employment data, extensive details are available in the online appendix
to Hanlon & Miscio (2014).39 Thus, this appendix focuses on the bankruptcy data, which
are unique to this paper.
   The data on bankruptcies come from the London Gazette and were collected starting
in Nov. 15, 1861, when they Gazette begins reporting bankruptcies filed under the new
Bankruptcy Act of 1861. To obtain the data, PDFs were downloaded from the London
Gazette website, and then the information was hand-entered off of each sheet. I have collected
only information from the “Notice of Adjudication of Bankruptcy and First Meeting of
Creditors.” These notices, which informed creditors that a person had filed for bankruptcy,
represented the first posted notice following a bankruptcy filing. They usually come within
the week after the bankruptcy judgment.

                                                     39
   Figure 10 shows the first notice entered into the database. From each notice, we entered
the name of the bankrupt, their occupation, and their town and county. London counts as
both a town and a county. The occupation data was then hand cleaned and standardized.
In doing so, I tried to follow as closely as possible the categorizations used in the Census
occupation data.




     Figure 10: Example bankruptcy notice from the London Gazette, Nov. 15, 1861




    In many cases the notices list multiple occupations; I focus on the first occupation listed
(a similar approach was taken by the Census office when constructing the Census data
categories). Table 13 lists the number of bankruptcies in each of the industry categories
in England and Wales over the period from Nov. 15 1861 to the end of 1866. The largest
category of bankruptcies is among shopkeepers and salesman, followed by construction, food
processing (bakers, butchers, etc.), and merchants, agents and accountants (which includes
all commercial businessmen). Among manufacturing categories, we can see that the largest
number of bankruptcies occurred among clothing and shoe producers. This makes sense
given that this sector was characterized by many small local producers. There is also a large
number of bankruptcies in the metal and machinery category, which is characterized by a
mix between large and small firms. The number of bankruptcies in textile manufacturing
are relatively small, reflecting the fact that firms in that sector were larger.

                                              40
        Table 13: Bankruptcy counts by industry category, Nov. 1861 - Dec. 1866




    The bankruptcy law in England underwent a major change with the passing of the
Bankruptcy Act of 1861. This Act merged bankruptcy and insolvency law (Lester (1995)).
Prior to the Act, only “traders” could file for bankruptcy, which allowed them to discharge
their debts without fear of imprisonment. The Act extended these bankruptcy protections
to all. This had the result of substantially increasing the number of bankruptcies, particu-
larly during the first year after the law change. This pattern is clearly visible in Figure 11,
which plots the number of bankruptcies by month in England and Wales from Nov. 15, 1961
through 1866. These data begin in the middle of November of 1861 because that was the
first point at which the London Gazette begins reporting notices of preliminary adjudication
of bankruptcy under the new 1861 law.
    To avoid the large spike in bankruptcies caused by the change in bankruptcy laws, I begin
my analysis with data starting in July of 1863. Thus, my analysis excludes the months high-
lighted in Figure 11. This Figure suggests that by mid-1863 the initial surge of bankruptcies
had passed and the overall level of bankruptcies had reached something resembling a normal
level.

                                              41
              Figure 11: Monthly bankruptcy counts, Nov. 1861 - Dec. 1866




    Excluding data prior to July, 1863 leaves me with 25,123 bankruptcies. Because this
cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, I check the robustness of the results to the alternative of using
all of the data from 1863 (see Section A.4). Next, I limit the data geographically to ensure
that I am comparing the cotton textile towns to other urban areas. Specifically, I limit the set
of analysis towns to those in which a reasonable number (at least 30) bankruptcies occurred
of the period from mid-1863 through 1866. Table 14 shows the set of towns with more than
30 bankruptcies. I also exclude London from the main analysis. This is done both because
London is an outlier in terms of size, and because the data from London are more difficult
to deal with. This is because within London, people often listed their location as their
neighborhood, rather than simply as London. Also, in many areas that were part of the city
of London, people sometimes reported them as part of one of the home counties, particularly
Middlesex. As a result, it is necessary to include all of Middlesex as part of London. The
robustness exercises in Section A.4 show that including London does not substantially affect
my findings.

                                              42
                   Table 14: Towns included in the bankruptcy analysis




   An important feature of the bankruptcy data set is that it covers all private bankruptcies.
Thus, it may include both bankruptcies by the owners of private business and bankruptcies by
workers who do not own a business. In some cases, the occupation data allow us to identify
whether the person works for a business or is a business owner, but in general it is not

                                             43
possible to systematically separate these two types of bankruptcies. This is not necessarily
a drawback of the data; even bankruptcies by individuals that were not business owners
can be revealing, since individuals are more likely to file for bankruptcy when they become
unemployed, which in turn is often a reflection of the distress of their former employer.
In one respect this may offer a type of quality adjustment, since bankruptcies by larger
firms are more likely to result in bankruptcies by their workers. Still, we may be concerned
that including bankruptcies by workers is misleading. To try to help address this issue,
I have categorized bankruptcies where the individual is obviously a worker rather than a
business owner. These are identified as occupations in which the bankrupt is listed as an
“Assistant”, “Journeyman”, “Servant”, “Labourer”, “Foreman”, “Manager”, “Machinist”,
“Engineer” (which at this time often means someone who operates an engine), and “Clerk.”
In the robustness exercises in Section A.4, I show that my main results are unchanged when
bankruptcies containing one of these worker identifiers are dropped.
    For manufacturing industries, I have classified both makers and dealers into the same
category, a practice which follows the system used in the Census data. Thus, both a ma-
chine manufacturer and a machine parts dealer would be listed in the Metal & Machinery
category. However, much of the existing literature in this area has focused on manufacturers
and excluded dealers. To enable a similar divide in my data, I reviewed every occupation
in the manufacturing categories and divided them into “Makers” and “Dealers”. Many oc-
cupations include both producing and selling a good, and these I have classified as Makers.
In the robustness exercises in Section A.4, I calculate separate results for the manufacturing
industries in which dealers are dropped from the data. I find that focusing exclusively on
makers does not affect the results in a substantial way.
    Another issue arises for public companies. Bankruptcies of public companies will not be
reflected in the bankruptcy database. However, public companies were a rarity during the
period I study; the vast majority of companies would have been privately held and therefore
would appear in the bankruptcy data.



A.3     Further evidence on migration flows

To explore the factors that determined migration flows out of the Northwest, I use town-level
data on the location of birth of town residents from 1851-1871. The specification is,



 ∆ log(N W bornct ) = α0 + α1 (X1851 ∗ Shockt ) + α2 ∆ log(N OT N W bornct ) + δc + ηt + ect (5)

                                              44
where ∆ log(N W bornct ) represents the growth rate of Northwest-born residents in city c and
decade t , ∆log(N OT N W bornct ) is the growth rate of residents not born in the Northwest,
Xi1851 is some town feature in 1851, Shockt is an indicator variable for the decade of the
Civil War, δc is a full set of city fixed effects, and ηt is a time effect. Thus, the coefficient
α1 identifies the features of towns that experienced an acceleration in the growth of their
Northwest-born population during the Civil War period, while controlling for differences in
the overall growth rate of the town population born outside of the Northwest counties.
    The data allow me to explore several potential drivers of migration flows. First, I look at
measures of the economic similarity and geographic proximity of towns, as described above.
I also consider a town’s initial share of residents born in the Northwest, since ties to previous
migrants has been shown to be an important determinant of later migration flows (Bartel
(1989), Altonji & Card (1991)). I also consider the share of cotton textiles, wool textiles,
or manufacturing in total employment. I control for the growth rate of town residents born
outside of the Northwestern counties to account for the fact that migrants are likely to be
attracted to more rapidly growing towns.
    The results are shown in Table A.3. The separated regression in Columns 1-5 suggest
that three factors – geographic proximity, the initial population of Northwest residents in
a town, and the share of wool textiles in town employment – may have played a role in
determining migration patterns. However, once all factors are combined in Columns 6-7,
only geographic proximity remains statistically significant. Not surprisingly, city growth
also plays a strong role in attracting migrants. Once we control for each city’s growth rate,
geographic proximity is the key determinant of migration patterns.

Geographic proximity is measured as exp(−dist) where dist is the distance in thousands of km to Manchester.
Economic proximity is measured by taking the correlation in the vector of employment shares in a set of
broad employment sectors between each town and the average employment shares across the cotton textile
towns in 1851. Initial NW pop. is the share of NW-born residents in total town population in 1851. Cotton
emp. shr. is the share of cotton textile workers in total town employment in 1851. Wool emp. shr. is the
share of wool textile workers in total town employment in 1851. Non-textile manuf. emp. shr. is the share
of all other manufacturing workers in total town employment in 1851.



A.4      Additional bankruptcy results

This section provides some additional details related the the analysis of the bankruptcy data.
First, I provide additional charts, similar to Figure 5, describing the pattern of bankruptcies
in sectors unrelated to cotton textiles in the Northwest counties, in sectors related to cotton

                                                     46
textiles in the wool towns, and in sectors related to cotton textiles in all non-cotton towns.
Following that, I present a series of robustness checks related the results presented in Table
9.




            Figure 12: Bankruptcies in other sectors in major cotton textile towns




Bankruptcy data were collected from the London Gazette. The bar chart (left-hand axis) describes bankrupt-
cies in those sectors not included in Figure 5. These include many shopkeepers, beer sellers, government
employees, farming and mining firms, and some other miscellaneous occupations. Solid line (right-hand axis)
describes the number of bankruptcies in the cotton textile sector. The cotton textile towns included in this
chart are Accrington, Ashton-under-Lyne, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Preston,
Rochdale, Warrington, Wigan, Stockport and Chester. All of these are in Lancashire except for the last two,
which are in Cheshire.

                Figure 14: Bankruptcies outside of the cotton and wool districts




Bankruptcy data were collected from the London Gazette. The bar chart (left-hand axis) describes bankrupt-
cies in a number of industrial sectors related to cotton textiles. Solid line (right-hand axis) describes the
number of bankruptcies in the cotton textile sector. The chart includes all of England outside of Lancashire,
Cheshire and Yorkshire counties.



   Next, I conduct several robustness exercises that look at how my results are affected by
some of the decisions made when constructing the data and the empirical exercise. This is
done in Table 16. The first column presents results in which I construct the key explanatory
variable using a three month window rather than the one-month window used in the main
results. The new three month window is centered on the one-month window used in the
main text. Thus, for the panic in October, 1864, I look at effects in October, November, and
December of 1864. In the second column, I include London, which was excluded from the
results presented in the main text for reasons described in the Bankruptcy Data Appendix.
In the third column, I assess the impact of my choice to include only towns with more
than 30 bankruptcies during the period from mid-1863 through 1866. This column presents
results where instead I also include smaller towns with between 25 and 30 bankruptcies.
The fourth column addresses the fact that the bankruptcy data include both workers and
business owners. This is done by dropping bankruptcies with occupations that include
a term that clearly indicates that the bankruptcy is by a worker rather than a business
owner. These terms are “Assistant”, “Journeyman”, “Servant”, “Labourer”, “Foreman”,

                                                     49
“Manager”, “Machinist”, “Engineer” (which at this time often means someone who operates
an engine), and “Clerk.” The fifth column considers the impact of my decision to use only
data starting in July, 1863, to generate the results presented in the main text. To do this,
this column adds in the data for the first half of 1863. Finally, the sixth column addresses the
fact that, for manufacturing industries, the bankruptcy data pool together manufacturers
and dealers. I have gone back and reviewed all of the occupations in a set of manufacturing
industries in order to separate dealers from manufacturers. Column 6 presents results for
these manufacturing industries where all dealers have been dropped from the analysis data.
Overall, we can see that they key results presented in the main text – particularly the increase
in bankruptcies in Metal & Machine industries in the cotton textile towns following months
of panic in the cotton market – are robust to each of these alternative approaches.

A.5     Additional results using the city-industry data

This section presents some additional results calculated using the city-industry database. I
begin with a robustness exercise related to the results presented in the main text. Next, I offer
some additional results obtained using more disaggregated occupation/industry categories.
   One feature of the city-industry database, discussed in the online appendix, is that it is
necessary to adjust the 1871 data for the number of workers under 20. This is necessary
because the data for 1851 and 1861 report employment divided into workers over 19 and

                                                  51
workers under 20, and the data for 1881-1891 report only total employment, while in 1871
only employment for workers over 20 is reported.40 Because workers under 20 make up an
substantial portion of the labor force, it is important to adjust the 1871 data in order to
obtain a consistent series. This is done using the national data for 1871, which reports
employment by industry divided into workers over 19 and workers under 20. This is used to
calculate a share of workers in each industry that were under 20. This share is then applied
to adjust employment in each city industry, under the assumption that the share of workers
under 20 in any particular industry does not vary too much across cities.
    Because 1871 is an important year in the analysis, we may be worried that this adjustment
is influencing the results. One way to check this is to use only the data for workers over
19, which is available on a consistent bases for 1851-1871 without the need for adjustment.
Using these data, I obtain the results shown in Table 18.




 40
      An exception is London, where data are reported only for all workers in 1871.

*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Table displays ai coefficients and standard errors based on the regression
specification in Equation 3. The data cover 1851-1871 and include only workers over 19 years of age. The first
set of results use data on 71 towns with 2096 city-industries and 4161 observations. The second set of results
use data on 18 textile towns with 534 city-industries and 1064 observations. In both sets, there are 8 cotton
textile towns. The regressions include a full set of city-industry and industry-year effects. Standard errors,
shown in parenthesis, are clustered by city-industry, city-year, and industry-year. The omitted industry is
“General services.”



    To gain additional insight into the results reported in the main text, we can apply a sim-
ilar approach to the same data, but with a more disaggregated set of occupation/industry
definitions. These disaggregated data include 152 industry categories and cover the 25 anal-
ysis towns over the period 1851-1891. I use exactly the same procedure as was used to

                                                     53
generate the results shown in Table 11. This procedure generates 151 coefficients describing
how each industry fared in the cotton towns, relative to comparator towns, in the post-shock
period. For brevity, I present only the 20 most negatively and most positively affected in-
dustries (based on the estimated coefficient). The first set of results, reported in Table 19,
include all towns. The second set of results, reported in Table 20 include only the textile
towns.
    In both sets of results, we can see that there are a set of negatively affected metal &
machinery categories. This includes pin and needle makers, which would have supplied cards
the the cotton textile industry, an important input. Engine and machine manufacturers, a
key capital input supplier, also show significant negative impacts in both sets of results.
Textile categories, such as worsted textile manufacturing, wool textile manufacturing, and
silk textile manufacturing, show consistent negative effects. Finally, there are a number
of construction related classes, such as bricklayers and stone workers, that show consistent
negative results.

errors, shown in parenthesis, are clustered by city-industry, city-year, and industry-year. The omitted
industry is “Domestic service.”
