        Capital Controls, the Dual Exchange Rate, and Devaluation



                               ABSTRACT


     This paper re—examines the effect of devaluation under capital—account

restrictions, adding to traditional formulations the seemingly minor (but

realistic) assumption that central—bank reserves earn interest. The extra

assumption has important implications.    En an intertemporal model, devalua—

tion is no longer neutral in the long run as it is in the literature on

the monetary approach to the balance of payments. Further, the economy

may possess multiple stationary states, some of them unstable.

    The analysis confirms, however, that even large devaluations must

improve the balance of payments if the economy is initially at a stable

stationary position. A by—product of the analysis is a pricing formula

for the financial exchange rate in a dual exchange rate system. That

formula is consistent with recent consumption—based models of asset pricing.

                                 Introduction

    A number of controversies in international monetary economics have cen-

tered on the analysis of devaluation. Ikst recently, accounts of the mone-

tary approach to the balance of payments have used the devaluation example

to illustrate some basic insights of that view (see Mundell [1971]

Dornbusch [19731 , and Frenkel and Mussa [1984]). A typical exposition

assumes that there is no private international capital mobility, so that

the aggregate real money stock is predetermined. Devaluation, by instan-

taneously reducing real balances, leads to a flow excess demand for money,

a temporary balance—of—payments surplus, but no change in the economy's

unique long—run real equilibrium. The result is intuitively appealing, as

it conforms to the principle that changes in nominal variables should have

no permanent real effects.

    This paper re—evaluates the foregoing predictions about devaluation in

a simple optimizing model of an economy with capital controls. Unlike the

models used to illustrate the monetary approach, the model used here

recognizes that central—bank foreign reserves generally earn interest.

This modification leads to two important conclusions. First, devaluation

must lead to an increase in the economy's long—run consumption and real

balances, and thus is nonneutral.    Second, the economy may have multiple

steady states, some of them unstable, even when all goods are normal.

    In an optimizing model   similar to the one employed here, Calvo [1981]
has obtained the monetary—approach conclusion that devaluation is asymp-
totically neutral when central—hank reserves earn no interest and there is
no private capital mohi lity. As I show below, however, devaluation is not
in general neutral w'hen capT tal is mobile unless central—hank reserves earn
                                    —2—

interest at the market rate. The assumption that reserves earn interest

would therefore seem to be a natural one to make in an investigation of the

effects of devaluation under capital controls. While the central bank's

reserve transactions do enable the public to engage in net external saving

and dissaving under capital immobility, however, the interest rate per-

ceived by the public can differ from the one available to the bank. This

distortion lies behind the economy's peculiarities, and I model the

domestic real interest rate explicitly by introducing a dual foreign

exchange rate for financial transactions. A characterization of the dual

exchange rate and its dynamic behavior is a by—product of the analysis.'

    The paper is organized as follows.

    Section I studies the benchmark case of perfect capital mobility,

showing that under certain idealized conditions (including interest—bearing

official reserves), devaluation is fully neutral, even in the short run.

This result was demonstrated previously in Obstfeld [1981} under assump-

tions about individual preferences somewhat different from those made below.

    Section II modifies the previous section's model by adding an official

prohibition on private capital movements. Individuals are still allowed to

hold a fixed pool of "financial foreign exchange, and the price of this

asset in terms of consumption defines a floating dual exchange rate. It is

shown that the equilibrium dual exchange rate is given by a standard

consumption—based asset pricing formula.

    Section III studies the dynamics of the resulting model. Because the

return to national saving, the world interest rate, differs from the

domestic   interest rate motivating private saving decisions, the usual

saddle—path stability condition characterizing steady states of optimizing
                                       —3—

models need not hold. Further, there may exist several long—run

equilibria, some saddle—path stable and some entirely unstable.

    Section IV analyzes the effect of a permanent, unanticipated deva-

luation on an economy initially at a stable long—run equilibrium.

Devaluation always leads to a balance—of—payments surplus; but because the

counterpart of this surplus is an increasing stock of official interest—

bearing reserves, the economy's new long—run position is characterized by a

level of national income higher than that prevailing initially. It follows

that when capital is immobile, devaluation generally has real effects both

in the short and long runs.

    Concluding remarks are contained in Section V. An appendix deals with

some technical matters.


            I. Capital Mobility and the Neutrality of Devaluation

    This section develops a simple optimizing model with capital mobiliity

in which an unanticipated devaluation is fully neutral. As is discussed

below, some idealized features of the economy described guarantee this

neutrality. But the model is a useful benchmark for the discussion to

follow, which shows how the imposition of capital controls renders deva-

luation nonneutral in the short and long runs even in a frictionless setting.

    Residents of the economy consume a single perishable consumption good

that may be freely inported or exported. Domestic output of the good is

constant at level y. The only two assets held by residents are a domestic

money   not held by foreigners and an internationally traded consol—type bond
paying r units of the consunption good per unit time in perpetuity. The
economy is small in   the world's   markets   for goods and   bonds:   both the
                                            —4--

foreign—currency price of the consumption good, P, and the world real

bond price, q*, are exogenous, and assumed fixed. In the model of this

section, there are no official restrictions on international capital move-

ments. An implication is that the real rate of interest,                   r/q*, is

given by the world capital market and constant.

      A representative immortal consumer inhabits the economy. The

consumer's instantaneous utility is a function of consumption, c, and real

balance holdings, m, where the latter variable is defined as nominal money

holdings, M, divided by the domestic—currency price of consumption, P.

      To simplify the subsequent discussion of the central hank's balance

sheet, I consider the case in which the exchange rate (the domestic—

currency price of foreign exchange) is fixed except for discrete, t1nantici—

pated devaluations. As will he evident, the analysis would easily

generalize to an economy in which       the   exchange rate, though pegged at each

instant, s expected to move continuously over time (see Calvo [19811 or

Obstfeld [1981]). Under a fixed exchange rate F, goods—market arbitrage

guarantees that P equals FP, and        because    P is fixed, the expected

domestic   inflation   rate is zero. The opportunity cost of holding money            is

where   b0 is the (net) number of bonds issued to the domestic private sector

by foreigners up to (and including) time 0 and r represents expected real

time—t transfer paents from the government.4

    The central bank holds as foreign reserves consols issued by

foreigners. Since the domestic public does not hold foreign currency ——

which yields neither utility nor interest —— the central hank can hold the
exchange rate constant at E by exchanging foreign bonds for home money when-

ever there is excess demand or supply in the home money market. Earnings

on central—bank foreign reserves are turned over to the government and

other central—bank assets earn no interest. If government consumption

is zero, the consolidated public—sector budget constraint is

           Tt =   rf                                                   (3)



where f devotes the central bank's stock of foreign reserves.

    The central—bank balance sheet links official foreign reserve holdings

to the (high—powered) domestic money stock, m. Assume for simplicity (and

without loss of generality) that no devaluations or changes in q* have

occurred in the past. As long as no devaluations do occur, the real money

stock is given by

           m      q*f   + (D0/P)                                       (4)

          The assumption that central—bank foreign assets earn interest plays a

key role in the analysis, and will he discussed further below. It should

be noted now, however, that the assumption is certainly more realistic than

the alternative hypothesis that the central hank willingly forgoes interest

income. 6

remain constant over time. To derive the unique shadow value of wealth

associated with an optimal individual program, use (6) and (7) to express

desired consumption and real balances as explicit functions of A0 and :

          The model cannot be closed until the process generating expectatons of

future          government transfers is               specified. For this purpose the economy's

equilibrium is assumed to be a                        perfect foresight equilibrium, in the sense that

                                       —7--


brought into equilibrium at each instant through official foreign exchange

intervention ——   in   effect, exchanges of foreign bonds between the domestic

public and central bank. Real balances m may therefore jump at a point In

time.   It is important to remember, though, that the sumb + f of net

claims on foreigners held by the economy as a whole is a predetermined or

non—jumping variable that can change only over time through current account

deficits and surpluses. Instantaneous domestic portfolio adjustment can

alter the money supply, but it cannot result in a transfer of real resour-

ces between countries.

    Substitution of (3) and (4) into (8) with       = m( A0, ck) for t > Q

yields the equation
                        -
                            q*(b+f)+(y/p*)                                   (9)

When no devaluation is expected, the equilibrium shadow price of wealth

is the solution to (9) , and can be expressed as a function of predetermined

or exogenous variables only:

            =
                A0(b0+f0,y,p).                                               (10)

(A0 is unique because, as is easily verified, c < 0 under the normality

assumptions.) Since domestic money is a nontraded asset, the economy's

discounted planned consumption cannot in equilibrium exceed the capftalized

value of its real resources. The equilibrium A0 may be interpreted as the

unique shadow price of wealth consistent with both individual optimality

and this aggregate intertemporal constraint.

   The effects of an unanticipated devaluation at time 0 (an increase in

the exchange rate to F' from F) may now be analyzed. The devaluation occa—

sions an incipient excess demand for domestic real balances, but this is

eUminated immediately as rcsidents sell the central hank     foreign bonds         to
                                         —8—

 rebuild their aoney holdings. This process of portfolio readjustment remo-

ves foreign claims from private ownership and places then under government

ownership, hut leaves the sum b0       + f0   unaltered. Equation (10) therefore
shows that X0 —— and   thus consumption and real balances —— iS unchanged.
&gents can instantaneously restore their real balances yet maintain their
previous consumption level because the foreign interest payments they
sacrifice to rebuild their money holdings are [by (3)] returned to them in
the form of higher transfers. Essentially for this reason, devaluation is
fully neutral.
      For future reference,   it   is useful to derive the effect on the central—
bank balance—sheet relation (4) of the unantLcipated devaluation at time 0.
Let c (F' — E)/E' denote the percentage devaluation. After devaluation,
but   before private portfolio readjustment has occurred, the real money
supply is given, not by (4), but by

                q*f0 + (D0/P)_r[q*f0+(D0/p)],                              (ii)
provided the central hank does not monetize the nominal capital gains on
                       7
its foreign reserves. The devaluation thus causes an incipient reduction
in real money, but as we have seen, an immediate real private capital
inflow equal to c[q*f0 + (D0/p)] prevents such a reduction from occurring
in equilibrium. Because Am.=q Af if no further devaluations occur, the
real central—hank balance sheet relation becomes

               q*f+(D0/p)_c[q*f0+(D/p)]                                    (12)

in future periods. Real money is then equal to real foreign reserves plus
real domestic credit minus an adjustment reflecting the fact that official
                                            —9—
                                                                  **
 reserves purchased up to time 0 were purchased at a money price EP q lower
                                   *
than the current price E'P q
       It was observed earlier that certain idealized features of the present

economy are necessary in order that devaluation be neutral in the short

run.     If central bank reserves do not earn interest, the capital inflow

following devaluation causes a fall in national income and in consumption

(Frenkel and Rodriguez [1975]); devaluation essentially acts as a tax in

this case.     If bonds are claims to nominal payments in different curren-

cies, devaluation can alter domestic wealth by changing the real value of

the net external debt (Boyer [1977] and Lapan and Enders [1978]). If the

economy is inhabited by overlapping generations with finite horizons, deva-

luation has real effects if it leads to redistribution of income across

generations. Abstraction from these conventional sources of nonneutrality

is necessary in order to isolate conceptually the impact of capital

controls.

              II. Capital Controls and the Financial Exchange Rate

       The assumption of unrestricted external asset trade is now abandoned.

Under the regime of capital controls postulated here, domestic residents

can neither buy nor sell bonds abroad, and any foreign exchange earnings

must be converted immediately into domestic money at the central bank. A

domestic bond market continues to operate, and, as before, home bonds are

perfect substitutes for claims on foreigners making up a pool b of

"investment currency" that the home public is allowed to hold.

       The central hank now buys and sells foreign exchange for commercial

purposes only, pegging the commercial exchange rate (initially at E).
                                                        *
This    suffices   to peg   the   home price level at EP .   Because   the   central hank
                                      —10—

does not intervene in the investment currency market, the stock of foreign

bonds b held by the public is fixed. The real price of such bonds, q, need
                                  *
no longer equal the world price, q , and can be thought of as a dual,

financial exchange rate. Correspondingly, the domestic real interest rate

p =   (r+)/q   can differ from the world rate p. Both q and p will be deter-

mined endogenously in the model developed in this section.

      Capital—account restrictions have several major effects on the func-

tioning of the economy. First, while individuals can still borrow or lend,

the private sector cannot in the     aggregate   alter its net claims on

foreigners. Second, while individuals can instantaneously alter their

money holdings, the domestic real money supply is, in the aggregate, a pre-

determined variable. Third, the economy as a whole (i.e., the private sec-

tor plus authorities) can alter its net foreign asset position over time

through balance—of—payments disequilibria (which under capital immobility

correspond to current—account disequilibria); hut in this process, the

central bank acts as an intermediary for the domestic public, acquiring

foreign bonds when the public desires growing real balances and decumu—

lating reserves in the opposite case. Fourth, the divergence (noted above)

between the domestic equilibrium real interest rate p and the rate

available to the central hank     introduces   a new distortion into the

economy.8      As we shall see, this distortion may result in an economy with
multiple stationary positions, some of them unstable.
      The representative individual' s problem is now to maximize V [given by

where                            is the expected real interest rate path.

Differentiation of a Lagrangian expression analogous to (5) yields the

necessary conditions


       u(ct,mt) = X0exp(&—fp ds),                                           (14)

for all t. It is clear from (14) and (15) that consumption and real balan-

ces need no longer be constant over time.

       Because the financial exchange rate is endogenous, it is difficult to

derive an explicit, closed—form characterization of the economy's

equilibrium as in the previous section. A diagrammatic approach is there-

fore adopted here. Differentiation of (14) yields the relationship


                  =

according to which utility "capital gains" on wealth must match any excess

of the subjective discount rate over the real rate of return. By (15),

(16) can be written


                      + U             =

In perfect—foresight equilibrium, it is also true that b = b for all t, so

that b =0 for all t.             In equilibrium, then, (19') imolies that the evolution

of real balances is governed by the equation


              =   y + r + p*{m      (1oI1)] —     c.                            (20)


Equations (17) and (20) together give the equilibrium motion of

consumption:

                      u(c,m) —

By (16), (20), and (21), a stationary state (q, in, c) of the economy is

defined by the relations

q =   r/,                                                                       (22)

C =   y   + rb + p*[rn —
                             (D0/P)],                                           (23)

u(c,m)/u(c,m) =                                                                 (24)

(recall the definition of p as (r+4)/q). It is assumed henceforth that at

least one stationary state exists.

      Equations (20) and (21) together define a complete dynamic system in

real balances and consumption: the dual exchange rate q enters neither

equation. It follows that co—movements in m and c may be analyzed diagram—
                                          —13—

matically without reference to movements in q. The paths of the two former

variables do affect that of q, however, for equation (16) may be integrated

to yield

             u (c ,m )
q   =
        f {c(t
        o  c 0,0
                           r exp(—t) dt

    =   Jr   exp (—fp ds) dt.                                                (25)
        0          0

According to (25), the real financial exchange rate has two equivalent

interpretations. First, as in constnption—based models of asset pricing

(e.g., Grossman and Shiller [1981]), q is an integral of future physical

yields, weighted by marginal rates of substitution between present and

future consumption and discounted at the subjective time preference rate.

Second, q may be thought of as an integral of future physical yields

discounted by market real interest rates.

                                    III. Dynamics

    To analyze the dynamics of real balances and consumption, it is con-

venient initially to linearize the system consisting of (20) and (21) in

the neighborhood of a stationary state. There is no guarantee, however,

that the steady state (if it exists) is unique. The easiest way to see

this is to graph equation (23), which gives long—run consumption as a

function of long—run central—bank reserves, together with (24), the Engel

curve associated with the price 6. Because (23) ——        also   the locus along

which i=0 ——     defines   an upward—sloping line, the Engel curve may intersect

it several times even when both goods are normal, as in figure 1.          (Figure

1 also shows that there could easily be no stationary state.) Of course

when central bank reserves earn no interest, as in Calvo (1981) and the

earlier monetary—approach literature, the =O locus is horizontal at c =

y+rb > 0, and normality of both goods ensures the existence of a unique

long—run equilibrium.

    While one could rule out multiple stationary states under certain

assumptions (e.g., homothetic preferences), there is no compelling reason

for doing so. The following section will analyze devaluation from both the

local and global perspectives.

    Let tn and c be stationary levels of real balances and consumption. The

linear approximation to (20) and (21) around those levels is

where functions beneath overbars are evaluated at (rn,c). The condition for

saddle—path stability of (26) is that the system have real characteristic

roots of opposite sign. M the determinant of the matrix in (26) is the

product of those characteristic roots, the stability condition may be

written

Figure 2 displays the phase portrait of (26) under the assumption that

(27) holds. The stability assumption implies that the slope of the r=Q

locus is positive, exceeding that of the ii=0 locus, as shown. It is

assumed that, given an initial level of real balances, the equilibrium con—

sumption level is the unique level placing the economy on the convergent

trajectory SS.

       Inequality (27) has a straightforward interpretation. The left—hand

side of the inequality is just the slope of an Engel curve such as that

pictured in figure 1. The inequality thus states that no stable trajectory

will exist unless an increase in real balances induces an increase in con-

sumption exceeding the world interest rate p. The logic of this condition

is evident. Suppose there is a current—account (i.e., balance—of—payments)

surplus. An increase tm in real balances is associated with an increase

q*f in central—bank foreign reserves and hence an increase             in

national income. Because real balances are a normal good, the rise in

income induces a further rise in desired real balances, and unless absorp—

tion                                                              *
       is rising faster than national income (i.e., unless tc > p tn), the

current account surplus will widen over time rather than shrink. Figure 3

depicts a stationary position around which (27) does not hold.'°

    The foregoing discussion implies an easy saddle—path stability cri-

terion for the multiple stationary states shown in figure 1. Bcause the

i=O locus has slope p, any point at which the Engel curve cuts it from

beLj is a saddle point. Similarly, any point at which the Engel curve

cuts the ri=O locus from above is an unstable stationary state. Figure 4

shows an example of a dynamic system with several stationary states.

Note that the Engel curve coincides with the global =O locus only when the

instantaneous utility function is separable in consumption and real balan-

ces (u=O).

   There are obviously several potential pathologies. For example, if the
 = 0 locus first intersects the ii   =0   locus from above, there is no

convergent equilibrium to the left of the first (i.e., lowest real—balance)

steady state. Similarly, if the      = 0 locus intersects the   i =0   locus

from above at its last intersection, there is no convergent equilibrium to

the right of the last (i.e., highest real—balance) steady state. To rule

out these cases, I assume that for every real—balance level, there exists a

value of consumption placing the economy on a stable trajectory.'' The

usual sufficient conditions imply that these stable paths are equilibria

for the economy.

      Using (25), it is easy to describe.the behavior of the dual exchange

rate q along a convergent path. When the balance of payments is in defi-

cit, say, consumption is high relative to its ultimate level, and the

marginal utility of consumption is low. Thus, q exceeds its long—run level

q =   r/   S, and, by (25) ,   falls   toward it as the economy converges to external

equilibrium. This heuristic argument indicates that a deficit is accom-

panied by a falling (or appreciating) financial exchange rate, and a

surplus by a rising (or depreciating) rate. An appendix presents a

rigorous proof of the proposition.12

                                IV. Nonneutral Devaluation

      The preceding apparatus may be used to demonstrate that when central—

bank reserves earn interest and there are no private capital movements,

devaluation alters the economy's long—run equilibrium. This section first

analyzes the effect of a small, unanticipated devaluation when the economy

is initially at a saddle—path stable stationary equilibrium. The result of

the experiment is always a balance—of—payments surplus that leads to a rise

in long—run consumption and real balances. A global analysis of deva-

luation yields essentially the same outcome. Even when there are multiple

equilibria, a large devaluation can never leap—frog an unstable sta-

tionary state and cause a balance—of—payments deficit.
                                         —17—

    Consider first the local analysis of a small, unanticipated devaluation

on the assumption that the economy is initially at a stable long—run

equilibrium (rn,c) such as that shown in figure 2. A change in the exchange

rate (to E' from E) generally shifts both the ti=O and the O loci, for

this policy action alters the balance—sheet relation linking the real money

stock and the stock of foreign reserves. By (4) and (12), the post—

devaluation equations of motion for the economy are


          y + r + p m— (D0/P) +              —
                                                 c   ,                      (28)

devaluation for the case in which the =0 locus shifts upward. Because the

 consumption falls in the short run. Corresponding to the public's desire

 to rebuild its real balances is a balance—of—payments surplus. As real

balances rise over time, however, central—bank reserves rise, and because

these earn interest at rate p*, national income grows as well. At the new

long—run equilibrium (m' ,     c'),   consumption and real money demand are there—

fore higher than before the devaluation.13

        Section Ill's results imply that the dual exchange rate q is also

affected by the devaluation. The sudden reduction in real wealth reduces

private demand for foreign bonds; equilibrium requires a fall in their

price and a depreciating financial exchange rate. Over time, expectations

are fulfilled as q rises toward r/. In the short run, therefore, an unan-

ticipated devaluation causes the real interest rate to rise.

       The preceding results were derived using "local" arguments. Must the

conclusions be modified when large devaluations are considered? It turns

out that no modification is needed: a large devaluation can never lead to

a long—run decline in consumption and real balances.

       Figure 6, which combines the consumer's Engel curve with the ifi=O locus,

is used to make this point. If initial real balances at the stable

equilibrium A are m, devaluation reduces them to (1—c)rn, and also shifts

the i=O schedule leftward by m. The Engel curve's position does not

change.

       The economy will now travel to one of the two stationary positions clo-

sest to C, labelled B and D in figure 6. But B must be the stable

equilibrium,    as shown: with both goods normal, the Engel curve cannot cut
i'=O    from above between C   and B and still pass through A, the initial posi-
tion.     Thus, the closest stationary state to left of C is unstable, while

the closest to the right is stable.        It follows again that the short—run

result of devaluation is a fall in consumption and a balance—of—payments

surplus. Ultimately, real balances and consumption rise above their origi—
                                                                   14
nal values as the central bank accumulates foreign reserves.


                                   V. Conclusion

      This paper has re—examined the effect of devaluation when there are

capital—account restrictions, adding to traditional formulations the

realistic assumption that central—bank reserves earn interest. In an

intertemporal model, devaluation is no longer neutral in the long run as it

is in the monetary—approach literature. Further, the economy may possess

multiple long—run equilibria, some of them unstable.

     The analysis confirms, however, that even a large devaluation must

improve the balance of payments if the economy is initially at a stable

stationary position. A by—product of the analysis is a pricing formula for

the financial exchange rate in a dual exchange rate system. That formula

is consistent with recent consumption—based models of asset pricing.

                                       Appendix

     This appendix proves that in the neighborhood of a stable steady state,

a balance—of—payments surplus is accompanied by a rising (or depreciating)

financial exchange rate q and a deficit by a falling (or appreciating)

rate. To see this, linearize the model around a long—run equilibrium

(q, in, C),   defined by (22)—(24). By (14) and (15), u(c,m)/u(c,m) =

Pt
     =
         (r+i)/q   ,   so that the dynamics of q are governed by

                   =   {[u (c,m)/u (ct,mt)] —     (rIq)}q   .

      If stability condition (27) is assumed, the foregoing system has two

      c —         = (w3/2)(m0      —         ) exp(Ot).

Differentiation of this solution yields

Because w31w2 =          —0   > 0, consumption and real balances rise or fall

together during the transition to a stable long—run equilibrium (as the

diagrams in the text showed). To establish that q rises during a surplus

(when m < rn) and falls during a deficit (when in > rn), it must be shown that

        > 0.

Squaring both (positive) sides of (A2) yields an inequality which,, after

some manipulation, can be shown to be equivalent to

But (A3) is true because the instantaneous utility function is strictly

concave. Thus                          > 0, as was to be demonstrated.

1. Descriptive models of two—tier exchange—rate systems are developed by

Flood [19781 ,    Marion   [19811 ,   Aizenman   [19831 ,   Kiguel   [1983] ,   and Cumby

[1984] .      Calvo [1979] presents a related model in which nonreproducible

"land plays the role of foreign assets under capital controls. Adams and

Greenwood [1983] use a two—period optimizing model to study a regime in

which the authorities intervene to fix both the commerical and financial

exchange rates.

2. The neutrality result established in this section is not sensitive to

the particular preference setup adopted. Obstfeld [19811 gives an example

of devaluation neutrality under time—inseparable tastes.

3. The assumption S=p is made only to ensure the existence of a non—

degenerate stationary equilibrium for the economy; see, for exarñple,

Obstfeld and Stockman [1984] ,         section   5.1.       It should be clear, however,

that devaluation is neutral in the present model when                           The assumption

&p* is relaxed in the following sections.

4. Because there is a single representative individual, the individual's

net holding of domestically—issued bonds is zero.

5. In a more general forniu1ation, D0 would would reflect also past deva-

luations (as discussed below) and past changes in q*.

6. Of course if central—bank reserves f were negative ——                   implying   past

official borrowing to support the exchange rate ——                the central bank would
                                   —23—

not have a choice about paying interest (barring default). In this case,

according to (3), the public would be taxed to meet official debt—service

obligations.

7. Typically the central bank creates a fictitious non—monetary accounting

liability instead.

8. There is already a distortion in the economy, even under capital mobi-

lity, because the private opportunity cost of real balances is positive and

thus exceeds the zero marginal cost at which money can be provided by the

central bank.

9. The following equation reflects the assumption that interest payments

on foreign bonds are repatriated at the commercial exchange rate.

10. Models based on intertemporal optimization typically imply the

existence of a convergent saddle path. That implication cannot be obtained

here because of the interest—rate distortion. Descriptive models of exter-

nal asset accumulation typically need to assume a stability condition like

(27), however. For a discussion, see Obstfeld and Stockman [1984], section 4.1.

11. Tangencies are also excluded by assumption.

12. This result also emerges from the descriptive literature cited in foot-

note 1.

13. Clearly a decrease in the money supply would have a similar long—run

impact. Monetary policy (like devaluation) is therefore nonneutral in the

present model.

14. A natural question is whether a devaluation has similar effects when

the economy is out of long—run equilibrium. It appears that devaluation,

in this case, may improve or worsen the balance of payments on impact.

However, arguments similar to that in the preceding paragraph suggest that
                                   — 24 —


the long—run equilibrium attained after a devaluation is characterized by
higher consimiption and real balances than would have been attained in the

absence of devaluation.
