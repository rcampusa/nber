Why Do Households Without Children Support Local Public Schools?

                                             ABSTRACT

While residents receive similar benefits from many local government programs, only about one-third
of all households have children in public schools. We argue that capitalization of school spending

into house prices can encourage residents to support spending on schools, even if the residents
themselves will never have children in schools.        We identify a proxy for the extent of

capitalization—the supply of land available for new development—and show that in response to a

plausibly exogenous spending shock in Massachusetts, towns with little undeveloped land have

larger changes in house prices, but smaller changes in quantity (construction). Towns with little

available land also spend more on schools. We extend these results using data from school districts

in 46 states, showing that per pupil spending is positively related to the percentage of developed

land. This positive correlation persists only in districts where the median resident is a homeowner

and is stronger in districts with more elderly residents who do not use school services and have a

shorter expected duration in their home. These findings support models in which house price

capitalization encourages more efficient provision of public services and may explain why some

elderly residents support school spending.

       School spending is the subject of some of the most contentious debates in local

government. While many residents benefit relatively equally from expenditures on police and

fire services or plowing the streets, only about one-third of all households have children in public

schools.1 Although altruism may drive some voters without children to support public schools,

one might expect that many communities will “underprovide” education from the perspective of

an individual that considers demand for education over his entire lifecycle.

       A countervailing argument is that good schools are an amenity that is capitalized into house

prices. Past research strongly supports the proposition that good schools are capitalized into

house prices.2 Even if a voter does not use the schools, a future buyer of the property may care

about school quality. Thus childless residents may vote in favor of school spending to maximize

home values. Yet the extent of house price capitalization varies across communities. House

prices may respond more strongly to a spending change in towns where land for new residential

construction is scarce. Thus residents in such towns have an additional incentive to support

school spending.

       Previous theoretical work supports this proposition. Brueckner and Joo (1991) show that in

a world with imperfectly mobile residents, the voter’s ideal spending level for durable local

public goods reflects a blend of his or her own preferences and those of the eventual buyer of the

house. Data from the American Housing Survey shows that the median homebuyer outside of

central cities has school-aged children although the median resident does not. This link may

explain why some voters without children, such as the elderly, might still support additional

school spending.

     The 1990 U.S. Census shows that 36 percent of households have children below 18 years. The National
Household Education Survey estimates that 91 percent of grade 3-12 students were enrolled in public schools in
1993.

(2004), Dee (2000), and Weimer and Wolkoff (2001).


                                                         1
       In the prototypical Tiebout (1956) world, residents would perfectly sort into the community

with their exact preferences. Older households would move to communities that focus

exclusively on services for the elderly. However, with a finite number of communities, multi-

dimensional preferences, and moving costs, residents often live in communities whose mix of

services don’t match their precise preferences. Elderly households may live in a community with

good schools and high school spending because they are long-time residents or because that town

has other desirable amenities besides the schools.

       Previous research has sometimes, but not always found that educational spending is

negatively correlated with the percentage of elderly residents. 3 Harris et al. (2001) show that

percent of elderly has only a modest negative effect on local school spending, but a strong

negative effect on state spending. They argue that the difference is due to the fact that state

spending is not perceived as having any impact on house prices, while local spending matters

more for house prices. Similarly, Bergstrom et al. (1982) present evidence from a Michigan

survey of elderly voters showing unusual support for school spending, speculating that such

support might be driven by the observation that many of these voters planned on selling their

house soon and that bad schools bring down house prices.

       To examine the hypothesis that the extent of house price capitalization drives expenditures

on schools, we examine communities that differ in their relative availability of undeveloped

residential land. This link is quite intuitive. As long as the local supply curve of land available

for housing is upward sloping and communities are not perfect substitutes, both price and

quantity will adjust in response to demand shocks. However, price adjustment should be larger

(and quantity adjustment smaller) in places with less available land for development. This

                                                        2
argument is at odds with the assumption in other research that local property values fully reflect

the present discounted value of future taxes and benefits. Such an approach depends on demand

factors alone and assumes that the supply of undeveloped land is inelastic and similar across

locations. Only a few studies consider the possibility of variation in the supply elasticity among

different locations (e.g., Malpezzi 1996 and Harter-Dreiman 2004) or the effect of differential

land supply elasticity on the extent of capitalization (Bruce and Holtz-Eakin 1999).

      We present evidence in favor of this hypothesis using two different data sources. First, we

expand on the empirical framework in Bradbury et al. (2001), who use variation from a property

tax limit in Massachusetts to generate exogenous instruments for spending changes across

communities. When we divide their sample into two parts based on the extent to which towns

have available undeveloped land, we find that demand shocks lead to larger changes in house

prices and smaller changes in quantity in locations with little undeveloped land. These land

constrained communities also vote to increase school spending at a faster rate.

      Next, we use data on school districts in 46 states to show that per-pupil spending is

strongly and positively related to the percentage of developed land in a school district, a proxy for

supply inelasticity. The coefficients suggest that a school district with little available land for

development (68.1 percent of potentially developable land is already used for housing) spends

roughly 10 percent more per pupil on schools, all else equal, than a district with a large amount of

land available for development (6.6 percent developed land). Given the likelihood that land

availability is correlated with other factors that might impact school spending, we examine a

number of interactions that are driven by theory linking house price capitalization to school

spending. For example, the positive correlation between school spending and the percentage of

developed land only exists in communities where more than one-half of households are

homeowners. In addition, the percent of elderly residents is positively related to per-pupil school


                                                   3
spending in districts with little available land, but percent of elderly residents is unrelated or

negatively related to school spending in districts where land for construction is more easily

available. This effect is even more pronounced for older elderly residents who have a shorter

expected duration in their property. These results support our proposition that spending on

schools is higher in places with more house price capitalization.

       These empirical findings have implications for theoretical and empirical studies in a variety

of areas. For example, the capitalization of durable local public goods into property values can

induce local governments to behave efficiently (e.g., Edelson 1976, Sonstelie and Portney 1978,

and Fischel 2001) and provides a mechanism so that present generations internalize the well-

being of future generations (e.g., Oates and Schwab 1988, 1996, Glaeser 1996, and Conley and

Rangel 2001). Fischel (2001) describes homeowners as “homevoters” whose voting and local

political activities are guided by their concerns about home values. Our results support such

normative implications in locations with limited opportunities for new construction, but not for

places where land for development is freely available.

       Finally, research in many areas makes the implicit assumption of uniform capitalization,

including urban quality-of-life comparisons4 and capitalization studies of environmental

amenities,5 school spending (or school quality),6 government subsidies,7 and taxes.8 Such

conclusions may be inaccurate given that the extent of capitalization varies across jurisdictions,

for example, due to differences in the extent of land-use regulation (Mayer and Somerville 2000

     See, for example, the meta-analysis by Smith and Huang (1995) or recent work by Bui and Mayer (2003).
   6
     While Black (1999) looks only at houses very close to attendance district boundaries where land supply might
indeed be equally and completely inelastic, Haurin and Brasington (1996) and Dee (2000) present estimates based on
much less disaggregated data, which might be biased without controlling for land supply.
   7
     Several authors have argued that location-based aid (as opposed to grants to poor individuals) can have adverse
consequences, since poor residents are typically renters who will be forced to pay higher rents if the transfers are
capitalized into higher house prices (e.g., Hamilton 1976 and Wyckoff 1995).

and Hwang and Quigley 2004). Our findings suggest that house price capitalization estimates

cannot be easily interpreted as a household’s willingness to pay for amenities when land for new

development is readily available, as is often true outside of coastal areas in the US.



1       Theoretical Framework

        In the analysis that follows, we argue that the extent of capitalization of fiscal variables and

amenities into house prices should be particularly high in places where supply of land for new

residential construction is relatively inelastic. Some have argued that as long as boundaries do

not change, land supply must always be completely inelastic. Yet the amount of developable

land for housing is not fixed because land has an opportunity cost that depends on its previous

use such as farming or lower density residential development (Novy-Marx 2004).

1.1     Land Supply Elasticity and House Price Capitalization

        It is intuitive that both price and quantity will adjust in response to demand shocks and that

the price adjustment will be larger (and quantity adjustment smaller) if land supply is relatively

inelastic. This argument is illustrated in Figure 1. The figure depicts a residential land market

with an upward-sloping land supply curve. Land must always be valued above the reservation

price pF , which we think of as the present value of future land rents from farming. As residential

land values rise, more land (L) becomes developed for housing.




    8
     Variation in the extent of capitalization may lead to differences in homeowner benefits from the mortgage
interest deduction and other federal taxes and subsidies. See Capozza et al. (1996), Stull and Stull (1991), Man and
Bell (1996), and Palmon and Smith (1998a, b).

                                            Total land area of community


      As in the models of Capozza and Helsley (1989 and 1990) and Novy-Marx (2004), when a

community becomes increasingly built-up, the incremental “cost” of building an additional

housing unit increases. The intuition is straightforward. Initially, owners will convert land to

residential use that has other low-value uses, such as farming or parking lots. Eventually,

builders must convert land that is being used for relatively high-value purposes. In addition, by

building today, owners forgo the option to redevelop land in the future when undeveloped land

may have even higher value. Hence the hurdle rate required to exercise the development option

rises quickly when there is little remaining undeveloped land.

      Previous research on zoning provides further evidence in favor of an upward-sloping

supply curve for residential land in a given community. Pogodzinski and Sass (1994) show that

land-use regulations appear to “follow the market,” after controlling for selection bias. Fischel

(1985) and Rudel (1989) argue that undeveloped land can be relatively easily converted into

residential use in rural areas and locations at the edge of cities but not in more developed places



                                                            6
such as large urban and suburban communities, where existing residents have relatively strong

incentives to pass restrictive zoning measures and thereby effectively limit supply.

       In the empirical work that follows, we use the amount of available developable land in a

community as a proxy for the residential land supply elasticity. The rationale for that choice is

illustrated in Figure 1. Suppose that all communities in a specific region have an identical land

area L and residential land supply curve LS , but that one locality, community A, has had little

previous residential development and is on a very elastic portion of the residential land supply

curve, while community B, with a lot of residential development, is on the inelastic part of the

supply curve. As the figure indicates, an exogenous demand shock will have a stronger price

effect (and a smaller increase in new construction) in community A, with a higher percentage of

already developed land, than in community B, with much less developed land.

       Several papers provide empirical support for our theoretical framework. Mayer and

Somerville (2000) show that land supply elasticities vary across MSAs, with MSA housing

permits exhibiting a lower responsiveness to prices in more highly-regulated markets. Hwang

and Quigley (2004) obtain similar findings. Brasington (2002) provides evidence that

capitalization of schooling and crime is weaker toward the edge of an urban area where housing

supply elasticities and developer activity are greater.

1.2    A Property Tax Limit as an Exogenous Demand Shock

      Brueckner (1982) notes that if local governments provide local public goods in a property-

value-maximizing fashion, they will choose a spending level such that the marginal benefit of an

extra dollar of spending will be exactly offset by the marginal cost of the property taxes needed to

finance that spending. Brueckner’s argument is illustrated in Figure 2 for the simple case where

aggregate property values are a single-peaked function of a local public good g. Spending to the

left of the peak signifies underprovision, while spending to the right of the peak is too much.

      We use this framework to analyze the effect of a tax reform that limits the flexibility of

individual communities to choose their desired level of property taxes, as was approved in states

such as California, Michigan, and Massachusetts in the 1970s and 1980s. Sponsors claimed that

entrenched local officials spent more on public services than the residents wanted. The existence

of a property tax limit will increase the utility of homeowners if spending were to the right of g*,

such that ∂P / ∂g < 0 . However, if the tax limit restricts the local government from increasing

spending to the optimal level, that is, ∂P / ∂g > 0 , the utility of homeowners is decreased in

restricted towns. In this case, restricted towns can realize gains in property values if they can

overcome the tax limit.

      We examine the impact of Proposition 2½ in Massachusetts, approved in November 1980,

as a specific example of such a tax reform. Proposition 2½ limited local municipal spending such

that: 1) effective property tax rates were capped at 2.5 percent and 2) nominal annual growth in

property tax revenues was limited to 2.5 percent, unless residents passed a referendum (called an

“override”) allowing a greater increase. Spending rules under Proposition 2½ applied equally to


                                                        8
all cities and towns, yet variations in local conditions at the time of its passage have led the

measure to have a very different impact across communities.

      Bradbury et al. (2001) measure the impact of spending changes on housing values using the

tax reform to provide instruments for local changes in spending that are unrelated to changes in

property values. In 1990, 224 out of 351 communities were at their levy limit, so that the only

way to increase nominal spending by more than 2.5 percent per year was for residents to pass an

override. Bradbury et al. show that Proposition 2½ significantly constrained local spending in

some communities, with most of its impact on school spending. Constrained towns realized gains

in house prices to the degree that they were able to increase school spending despite the

limitation. Changes in non-school spending had little impact on home values. The authors

speculate that the marginal homebuyer may place a higher value on school spending than the

median voter, possibly because homebuyers are more likely to have school-aged children. That

communities were able to realize gains in property values to the extent that they were able to

increase spending in spite of the limitation suggests that Proposition 2½ caused many towns to

under-provide local public education, at least from the perspective of the marginal homebuyer.

      We expect that communities which increased spending despite Proposition 2½ should have

realized stronger gains in property values if their land supply curve is inelastic rather than elastic.

This effect is illustrated in Figure 3.

fiscal distortion induced by the property tax limit results in lower property values. If the

community increases the public spending level despite the limitation to g1 it realizes gains in

property values that depend on the land supply elasticity.9 A town with inelastic land supply will

have a greater increase in property values than a community with more elastic land supply.10

        Of course, this framework assumes that some portion of current spending affects the utility

level of future residents. This assumption holds if a school district purchases durable goods that

benefit future residents, or if current spending decisions represent a signal or commitment to


   9
     The price level of the three curves is arbitrary. However, rural communities that have elastic land supply
consist of inexpensive farmland while suburban and urban communities with inelastic supply of land typically have
scarce amenities and more expensive residential land.
   10
      Figure 3 also implies that spending increases despite Proposition 2½ lead to smaller gains in property values in
communities that are closer to the optimum. In this context it is important to point out that the likelihood of being
constrained by Proposition 2½ is not related to land availability (see the empirical analysis below for evidence).


                                                            10
future spending. For Proposition 2½, most increases in the levy limit are permanent; so if voters

choose to increase the spending limit in one year, they are choosing to increase that limit in all

future years as well.


2     Empirical Analysis for Massachusetts

      The preceding section argues that house prices in towns constrained by a tax limit should

change more strongly (and construction less strongly) in response to spending changes in areas

with little available undeveloped land than in areas with plenty of undeveloped land. To the

extent that increases in spending result in higher house prices, communities with little available

land have an additional incentive to spend more money on schools. These communities should

also be more willing to pass a referendum that approves additional school spending. We test

these hypotheses using data from Massachusetts and the passage of Proposition 2½.

      This setting has several advantages. We estimate the impact of government spending on

house values using a well-identified setting. Community characteristics from the date

Proposition 2½ was passed in 1980 serve as instruments for otherwise endogenous spending

changes 10 years later. By examining changes in spending we are able to difference away time-

invariant attributes that may be correlated with house prices or with our independent variables.

Finally, we have very detailed data on land use in each community. We show that the amount of

available land for development in a community serves as a good proxy for supply elasticity and

that school spending is higher in communities with less remaining developable land.

2.1   Empirical Specification

      We estimate the following system of equations:

      ∆ price = α 0 + α1 (construction) + α 2 (∆ spending ) + α 3 (demand shifters) + ε p            (1)

      construction = β 0 + β1 (∆ price) + β 2 (supply shifters) + ε c                                (2)


                                                   11
      ∆ spending = γ 0 + γ 1 (∆ pupils) + γ 2 (% developed land) + γ 3 (spending shifters) + ε sp     (3)

      ∆ pupils = δ 0 + δ1 (supply shifters) + δ 2 (demand shifters) + δ 3 (pupil shifters) + ε pu .   (4)

All of the bold variables in equations (1)-(4) are assumed to be endogenously determined. As in

Mayer and Somerville (2000), we model new construction, the change in housing stock, as a

function of the change in price and other supply variables. Demand, supply, spending, and pupil

shifters are vectors of variables that also serve as instruments to separately identify coefficients in

other equations. The exclusion restrictions across these equations are quite important. In the

empirical section, we examine the results of loosening some of these restrictions.

      We lay out the mechanisms through which capitalization impacts school spending with the

following predictions:

Prediction 2A: The coefficients on changes in spending (α2) and the demand shifters (α3) in

equation 1 (demand) will be larger in absolute value in towns with less available land for

development (Figure 3).

Prediction 2B: The price elasticity of construction (β1) in equation 2 (supply) will be smaller in

places with less available land for development (Figure 1).

Predictions 2A and 2B suggest that demand shocks in locations with less available land should

result in larger price changes, but less construction relative to places with more available land.

Prediction 2C: Communities with less available land for development increase school spending

more in response to Proposition 2½. Spending increases have a larger impact on house prices in

towns with less available undeveloped land and thus voters in these towns have stronger

incentives to raise spending to maximize house prices.

      To examine these predictions, we estimate equations (1)-(3) using two-stage least squares

with instruments drawn from other equations. Our sample runs from 1990 to 1994, a time period



                                                     12
when most Massachusetts communities were constrained by Proposition 2½. We measure ∆

price as the percentage change in single-family house prices from 1990-1994 for each

community. Construction is the number of new single-family home permits issued between

1990 and 1994 divided by total existing housing units in each community. We disaggregate ∆

spending into two parts, with separate variables for percentage change in school and non-school

spending over the same period.

      First consider equation (1). We use supply shifters from equation (2) and spending shifters

from equation (3) as instruments for construction and ∆ spending, respectively. As with

Brueckner (1982), we interpret the coefficient on (change in) school spending as the net impact

on house prices of spending another dollar on schools (or other public goods), taking into account

the taxes necessary to pay for the additional spending.

      Following Bradbury et al. (2001) and Case and Mayer (1996), we include three variables as

demand shifters for housing in equation (1). These variables are based on previous work

suggesting that aggregate shocks in demand have varied effects across local communities. For

example, as Bradbury et al. (2001) document, the aging of the baby boom and the associated echo

baby boom led to an increase in aggregate public school enrollments in Massachusetts since

1990. The resulting increase in the percentage of households who have children in public schools

raised the demand for houses in towns with good quality schools relative to communities with

poor quality schools. Thus we include average test scores as a proxy for differences in school

quality across communities. As Case and Mayer (1996) show, the coefficient on this variable

changes when aggregate enrollments are falling. We also include two dummy variables

measuring a community’s proximity to Boston to control for changes in the value of location

during a period of increasing job growth in downtown Boston and the surrounding suburbs.



                                                13
      The system of equations provides many instruments for ∆ price in the construction

equation, including the demand shifters, the spending shifters, and the pupil shifters. All of these

variables impact price changes, directly or indirectly, by shifting demand, but not the supply of

new units. The supply shifter in equation (2) is the lagged amount of new construction. We

include lagged construction as an indication of the extent of regulation in various communities.

One might be concerned that lagged construction is the least reliable of our instruments. The

only specification where the supply shifter is necessary to separately identify a coefficient is in

equation (1). Our findings are unaffected if we drop the construction variable and do not use the

supply shifter as an instrument in this equation or if we drop the supply shifter as an instrument in

other equations. We also estimate equation (2) over a relatively short 4-year period. To the

extent that long-run supply is more elastic than short-run supply, our empirical work might over-

estimate the price effects and underestimate the quantity effects of a given demand shock. This

may bias against finding any effect of land availability on capitalization and supply elasticities.

      To test Predictions 2A and 2B, we estimate equations (1) and (2) separately for

communities with above- and below-median percentage of undeveloped land. Land availability

comes from a 1984 University of Massachusetts aerial survey of the entire Commonwealth of

Massachusetts. Land is classified into 21 uses. We measure the amount of developable land as

the percentage of “open” or “undeveloped” land, which includes farmland. One might be

concerned that this measure is endogenously determined, so that communities with stricter zoning

rules also have more developable land, and vice versa. That is, some communities may have a lot

of undeveloped land, but regulations limit new construction on that land. If true, we should find

empirical evidence that communities with more developable land have a greater extent of house

price capitalization. However, exactly the opposite is the case.




                                                 14
      We examine Prediction 2C by estimating equation (3) to see if school and non-school

spending are related to land availability. As before, we use demand shifters, the supply shifter,

and pupil shifters as instruments for the changes in the number of pupils in the school spending

equation. The pupil shifter in equation (4) is the percentage of children under age 5 in 1990.

This variable is correlated with expected demand for changes in school services, but is unrelated

to resources to fund the schools under Proposition 2½. However, excluding this variable from

the housing demand equation (1) is less clear-cut. Our results are unchanged if we drop it when

estimating equations (1) and (2). In the non-school spending equation, we measure change in

demand for services with percentage change in the number of residents. We use the same

instruments in the school and non-school spending equations.

      Proposition 2½ provides a wealth of variables that are correlated with spending changes

but are plausibly uncorrelated with housing supply or demand between 1990 and 1994. For

consistency with Bradbury et al. (2001), we include all of these variables as spending shifters in

our baseline specifications. (See Table 4 for the complete list of spending shifters used in the

regressions.) Most variables are taken from the early 1980s prior to the passage of Proposition

2½. However, a few variables are taken from the 1990 Census or state revenue data, including

median family income, the nonresidential share of housing value, the ratio of school enrollments

to population, and equalized property value per-capita. These variables are measures of

community resources to support local schools or the political support for schools. However, one

could argue that these variables might not be excludable from the housing demand equation.

Thus when we estimate the house price regression, we include only the 1980 values of these

variables as instruments, a time prior to the passage of Proposition 2½. The results are also little-

changed if we exclude these variables entirely.




                                                  15
      Finally, we provide additional evidence on Prediction 2C by examining the likelihood of

passing an override for communities whose spending levels have reached their cap (the levy

limit) under Proposition 2½. This test may be the most directly applicable to the theory because

constrained communities must go directly to the voters in order to pass an override. The

independent variables in this specification are identical to those used in equation (3).

2.2   Data

      Bradbury et al. (2001) provides a detailed description of the data on house prices,

construction, land availability, community characteristics, school indicators, and fiscal condition.

These variables are summarized in Table 1. Even during the relatively short 1990-94 time

period, communities exhibit substantial variation in many of these variables. For example,

although the average community increases school spending by 15 percent, individual towns had

much larger positive and sometimes even negative changes in spending.

      Case, Shiller, and Weiss, Inc. (CSW) provide house price indexes for 208 of the 351

communities in Massachusetts that are based on data from 135,000 pairs of sales drawn between

1982 and 1995. The communities with relatively few transactions that CSW drops from its data

are small, often rural, communities that may have the most available land. This data limitation

likely leads us to underestimate the impact of supply elasticity on capitalization because the

smaller communities are likely to exhibit the smallest degree of house price capitalization.

2.3   Results

A. Land Supply and Extent of Capitalization

      To begin, we estimate equation (1) separately for communities with above- and below-

median percentage of available developable land (Table 2). The results are consistent with the

prediction that communities with less available land have a greater extent of capitalization.




                                                 16
      All of the coefficients in the house price equation for communities with little available

developable land (column (1)) are larger in absolute value than the coefficients in towns with

more available land (column (2)). Of particular interest, the coefficient on changes in school

spending is more than three times larger (0.33 versus 0.10) in the towns with the least percentage

of developable land and is only statistically significantly different from zero in those

communities. As with Bradbury et al. (2001), the coefficient on changes in non-school spending

is not statistically significant in either regression, though it is larger in the first column than the

second one. Good commuting locations in the Boston MSA and the suburban ring and better

quality school districts also became relatively more valuable in communities with little available

land. Finally, price changes with respect to construction are much larger in communities with

less developable land. An F-test rejects the hypothesis that the coefficients on the spending and

demand variables are equal in columns (1) and (2) (p-value=0.03).

      As mentioned above, we include a broad set of instruments in our base specification for

comparability with previous research. Yet one might wonder whether all of these instruments are

truly exogenous or whether we are over-fitting the data, and in particular, whether some of the

instruments may be correlated with the percentage of undeveloped land, an issue that would not

have concerned previous researchers. To examine these possibilities, we re-run our specification

removing as instruments six variables that are correlated with the percentage of undeveloped land

with a p-value of at least 10-percent. Most obviously, the non-residential share of property value

in 1980 may be difficult to separate from the percentage of land that is developed. An additional

four of those instruments are measures of wealth or income, which might also be related to the

extent of development or housing demand in a community due to political economy (voters want




                                                   17
to protect property values) or community desirability.11 The final instrument in this category, the

percentage of residents less than 5-years old in 1990, only has a p-value of 0.10, but we exclude it

for consistency.

        The sensitivity tests continue to suggest that communities with less available land have a

greater extent of capitalization. When we drop the six potentially troublesome instruments, the

results become somewhat stronger than those presented in Table 2. The difference in the

coefficients on the capitalization of school spending for more and less developed communities is

larger in magnitude (0.45 vs -0.08), while the difference in other coefficients remains similar.

Hansen’s J-Statistic, a joint test of exogeneity of the instruments, has a p-value of 0.45 when we

exclude the six troubling instruments, suggesting we cannot reject exogeneity. The findings also

do not change if we re-estimate the equation by removing over-identified instruments one at a

time. Finally, we estimate the equations with a minimal set of instruments that have no

demographic characteristics or recent Proposition 2½ variables, including lagged permits, the

1980 tax rate, and the number of years required to reduce tax rates to 2½ percent. With the small

set of instruments, the coefficients are quite similar to those in Table 2, although the standard

errors rise such that some of the endogenous variables are no longer statistically significant.

        Table 3 examines differences in land supply elasticities between the same two groups of

communities. Consistent with the second prediction from our theory, the evidence shows that

shocks to demand lead to greater construction in towns with more available land. The dependent

variable is the number of single-family home permits divided by total housing units. Columns

(1a) and (1b) report direct estimates of land supply elasticities. The coefficient on change in

house prices is relatively large and significant at the 5 percent level in locations with more


   11
      These instruments include per-capita property value in 1980, per-capita income in 1980, the proportion of state
aid in the local budget in 1981, and the percent of adults with a college education in 1980.


                                                         18
developable land, while it is quite small and not statistically significant in the more developed

locations. The test of equality between the coefficients in columns (1a) and (1b) rejects with a p-

value of 0.10. Columns (2a) and (2b) include lagged permits to control for other factors that

might lead to new construction. We exclude this variable in the first specification out of concerns

that it might not be truly exogenous. Even with its inclusion, the coefficient on change in house

prices is about one third larger in locations with more available land. A test of equality between

the coefficients in columns (2a) and (2b) rejects with a p-value of 0.10. The regression constants

suggest that steady-state construction is one-half as large in relatively developed regions.12

B. Spending and Override Regression Results

        The findings in the previous section suggest that locations with little available land for

development respond to demand shocks with relatively larger changes in house prices and

smaller changes in new construction. Next, we examine whether communities with little

available land have a disproportionate increase in spending on public services when faced with a

shock to school spending due to Proposition 2½.

        Table 4 reports regression estimates from the equations for percentage change in school

spending and non-school spending between 1990 and 1994 for all communities in our sample.

To control for differences in the usage of local services, the school spending regressions include

the percent change in number of students as an endogenous variable, while the non-school

spending regressions include the percent change in population between 1990 and 1994. We

include exogenous variables from the housing demand and supply equations in Tables 2 and 3 as

instruments for percent change in pupils or population. Columns (1) and (2) report the equations

with all of the variables described in the data section, a broad set of constraint variables from


   12
    Our estimated supply elasticities are much lower than in other work that looks at longer time periods. See
Gyourko and Voith 2000, for example.


                                                        19
Proposition 2½, plus the percentage of developed land, the variable of interest. The results are

virtually unchanged in columns (3) and (4) when we drop the more recent variables.

      As suggested by Prediction 2C, land scarcity has a positive effect on school spending. The

coefficient on percentage of developed land is statistically significant at the 5 percent level and is

quite similar across specifications (columns 1 and 3). The coefficient in column (1) suggests that

a community with 10 percent more developed land in 1984 has a 2.4 percent larger increase in

school spending. Cities and towns that were required to cut revenues for the first two or three

years of Proposition 2½ (the communities that faced the largest initial constraints) increased their

school spending 9 and 16 percentage points less, respectively, than communities with zero or one

year of initial revenue cuts. All of the Proposition 2½ coefficients but one (at levy limit, no

overrides) have the anticipated sign, and many variables are statistically different from zero.

      The non-school spending results are much weaker, although still in line with our prediction.

The coefficient on percentage of developed land is positive, but not statistically different from

zero. Only three other constraint variables are individually statistically significant, with the

coefficient on at levy limit in 1989, no overrides again having the wrong sign. These findings are

consistent with those in Bradbury et al. (2001), who speculate that non-school spending, which is

dominated by costs for fire, police, and public works such as trash removal, street repair, and

snow plows, may have fewer discretionary items than the school budget.

      Finally, we examine the relationship between land availability and the cumulative amount

of overrides (per capita) in the communities that were most highly constrained by Proposition 2½,

towns whose spending in 1989 is within 0.1 percent of state-mandated spending (levy) limits.

Thus voters in these towns must explicitly approve an override allowing spending increases

above 2½ percent per year. Similar to Prediction 2C, we expect that land scarcity (and thereby

the extent to which additional spending on schools is capitalized into house values) provides


                                                  20
stronger incentives to vote for an override. Basic summary statistics support our prediction.

Over one-half of constrained towns with little available land pass an override (57 percent)

compared with only 35 percent of towns with more potentially developable land.

      Table 5 examines determinants of the amount of overrides approved by voters in

communities that were near their levy limit in 1989. Column (1) reports results for the base

equation with controls for the percentage of developed land in 1984 and other local

characteristics for 1990 that may affect demand for education, but without Proposition 2½

variables. Since these communities are already constrained by Proposition 2½, there is no reason

that Proposition 2½ variables should affect incremental spending. Nonetheless, columns (2) and

(3) include early and late 1980s Proposition 2½ variables, respectively. Finally, column (4) adds

endogenous population growth to control for increases in demand. As predicted, the coefficient

on percentage developed land is always positive and statistically significant at the 5 percent level

(columns (1)-(3)) or at the 10 percent level (column 4). The size of the land scarcity coefficient

is quite stable across equations. Few other variables have a statistically significant effect on the

cumulative amount of overrides. Given that the impact of overrides is greatest on school

spending, it is not surprising that towns with a higher percentage of college-educated adults and a

high ratio of school enrollment to total population approve bigger overrides.



3     Empirical Analysis for the National Sample

      The empirical results in Section 2 demonstrate a consistent relationship between scarcity of

developable land and a greater extent of house price capitalization, smaller supply elasticities,

and increased school spending. To examine the applicability of these results in a broader setting,

we turn to school district level data that covers most areas of the United States. While we lose

the nicely identified setting from Massachusetts under Proposition 2½, we gain a much broader


                                                 21
sample that allows us to examine the relationship between land scarcity and school spending in

more detail. We provide new results that may help allay concerns that land scarcity might be

correlated with other important unobserved amenities or attributes.

3.1   Capitalization and School Spending

      Previous theoretical research points out that in the presence of house value capitalization,

voters take into account preferences of eventual buyers of their house (e.g., Wildasin 1979 and

Sonstelie and Portney 1980). If expenditures on durable public goods are not fully capitalized

into house prices, communities may underinvest (left of the peak in Figures 2 and 3) because

current homeowners do not sufficiently incorporate the utility functions of future residents.

      In our context, if home price capitalization is large, some households might vote in favor of

spending to improve schools even if they have no children. This is because households could sell

their houses in the future to families with children. Of course, the opposite result is possible in

communities with perfectly elastic land supply and thereby no capitalization. Investments in

durable school facilities will attract other households to the community, converting farmland to

residential use, but not raising existing house prices. In this case, households without school-

aged children will pay additional taxes without receiving any benefit, so they have little incentive

to support new school spending.

      We derive these and other predictions by analyzing voter decisions in a more formal

framework. Consider a resident who has the option to vote in favor of or against an investment

that aims to provide better local public school services. We assume that the benefit from this

investment, Bt , has a durable component and improves school quality in the future as well as the

present period. Even spending on current-use items such as teacher salaries and supplies can

have a durable component if such expenditures serve as an indicator of future spending levels




                                                 22
(e.g., if layoffs are costly). If the majority of voters opt for the investment, property owners will

finance the investment with a lump sum tax, τ t , payable now and in future periods. Voters who

do not have children in public schools get no current benefit from the investment. Owners of

non-residential land, if they live in the town, have similar preferences to voters with no children.

      Renters, of course, have smaller incentives than homeowners to vote in favor of an

investment that has a durable component. Most renters do not have children and thus receive no

benefits from school spending. Renters also do not benefit from possible future increases in

house prices. In fact, if rents incorporate any portion of increased taxes, renters will be worse-off

as a result of the spending increase. This analysis holds constant the extent to which altruism

impacts expenditures. The fact that the US has publicly provided education suggests that

altruism plays an important role in determining government expenditures. Yet we also believe

that private interests play an additional role in the support for spending—residents who directly

benefit from expenditures should be willing to spend more than residents who receive no benefits

from those expenditures.

      Now consider the determination of house prices. The net benefit of school spending for the

marginal homebuyer j may be partially or fully capitalized into house values. If the marginal

homebuyer j does not have children in school, the net benefit is b jt = −τ t and house values may

even decline as a result of the investment; otherwise, the net benefit is b jt = Bt − τ t and house

values increase to the extent that Bt > τ t . The degree of house price capitalization

θ ∈ [ 0,1] depends on the land supply elasticity. As above, towns with a more inelastic supply of

land for residential construction should have a greater extent of capitalization, θ .

      The median voter's payoff is composed of a direct effect (current net benefit of the

investment) and an indirect effect (future capitalization effect). The median voter’s likelihood of


                                                   23
voting in favor of the investment depends on: (a) whether the median voter owns a home, (b) the

net benefit of the investment, Bt − τ t , (c) whether the marginal homebuyer has children, (d) the

extent of capitalization, and (e) the median voter’s likelihood of moving.

      If the median voter is a renter with no children in school, he or she is unlikely to vote for the

investment. In this case the extent of capitalization should not affect the probability that the

median voter opts for the investment.

      Now consider a town where the median voter owns a home. Households with children will

vote in favor of the investment if Bt > τ t , but such households rarely represent a majority of

voters. In such communities, votes by households without children are usually decisive.

Equation (5) expresses the payoff to a homeowner without children in the public schools:

                                 T λ B −τ
           t −τ t                                 
      P = ∑                + θ ∑    j t       t
                                                   ,                                         (5)
           t =1 (1 + r ) t
                                t=t (1 + r ) t
                                                   

where λ j = 1 if the future buyer has school-aged children and λ j = 0 otherwise, r is the discount

rate, t is the expected duration in the property, and T represents the investment duration.

      Clearly households with a shorter duration in their house will be more sensitive to the extent

of capitalization and the preferences of the future marginal homebuyer. Below, we focus on

elderly households who appear to meet two conditions that make them particularly sensitive to

house price capitalization: they are likely to have a relatively short expected duration in their

house and are unlikely to have school-aged children. Equation (5) implies that elderly

homeowners are more likely to support better schools if they live in a place with a greater degree

of house price capitalization. We examine these predictions in the empirical work below.

3.2   Empirical Specification

      Our basic estimating equation for school expenditures per pupil is as follows:



                                                        24
      spending per pupil = π 0 + π 1 (% developed land) + π 2 (local characteristics)
                            +π 3 (school characteristics) + π 4 (population density)             (6)
                            +π 5 (state) + ε .

Dollar denominated variables such as total school spending per pupil and household income are

measured in logs. The equation includes variables that may explain school spending including

proxies for costs, educational and demographic characteristics of residents, and state dummy

variables. The school district’s population density proxies for geographic variation in the cost of

providing education that may be correlated with land availability.

     Previous research has shown that racial differences and income inequality impact the

variability in school spending across communities, including differences in racial composition

between the elderly and school-aged children (Poterba 1997) and ethnic fractionalization

(Alesina et al. 1999). Following this literature, we include the percentage of non-whites among

children aged 5-19 minus the percentage of non-white elderly among total elderly and a measure

of the probability that two persons drawn randomly from the population belong to different self-

identified ethnic groups (white, black, American Indian, Asian, Hispanic, and other). We also

include the Gini coefficient as a measure of income inequality within each community.

      Below we examine whether the percentage developed land in a school district, our proxy

for the extent of capitalization, is correlated with higher school spending. While the

Massachusetts spending regressions have a quasi-experimental design, the national regressions

examine overall per pupil spending levels and assume that most communities in the sample are at

or near their desired spending. Given the likelihood that land availability is correlated with other

community factors that are unrelated to land supply and might be correlated with school

spending, we use theoretical predictions from the model in the previous section that should be

specifically driven by a land supply effect, including:



                                                  25
Prediction 3A: School spending will be positively related to the percentage developed land, our

proxy for the extent of house price capitalization.

Prediction 3B: The positive effect of the percentage developed land on school spending should

only exist in communities where the median resident is a homeowner.

Prediction 3C: The interaction between percentage developed land and percentage elderly

residents should be positive. That is, the elderly should be more willing to support school

spending in districts where the extent of capitalization is high, since the elderly have a relatively

short time horizon in their property.

Prediction 3D: The positive relationship between percent elderly and percent developed land

should be larger for older elderly residents who have a shorter expected duration in their home.

3.3     Data

        The data used in this section are drawn from the School District Data Book (SDDB)

collected by the U.S. Department of Education for the school year 1989/90 and the National Land

Cover Data 1992 (NLCD). The SDDB reports total expenditures per pupil, the type of school

district, the number of schools within a district, and proxies for school cost (such as the

percentage of children below the poverty line, the percentage of children that “speak English not

well,” or the percentage of children “at risk”13). The SDDB also provides data from the 1990

U.S. Census that is geographically matched to school district boundaries.

        The NLCD classifies land use into 21-categories for 48 states (excluding Alaska and

Hawaii). The classification is provided as raster data with a spatial resolution of 30 meters

derived from satellite photos mostly acquired from 1991 to 1993. The Wharton GIS Lab



   13
       A child, 6 to 19 years of age, is defined “at risk” if the child is not a high school graduate and lives with a
mother who is not a high school graduate or is divorced or separated, and whose income is below the 1989 poverty
level.


                                                          26
geographically matched the raster data to the school district level boundaries. ‘Percentage

developed land’ is calculated as the ratio of developed residential land to total developable land.14

        We exclude data on school districts from states with full school finance equalization

(California, Hawaii, and New Mexico) as our theory only applies to school districts with at least

partial local control over school spending. We also exclude school districts with missing data,

with implausibly low or high total expenditures per pupil, and the five percent of school districts

with enrollments of less than 70 students as their per-pupil costs are likely to be quite high. Table

6 reports summary statistics for our final sample of 11,565 school districts.

3.4     Results

        To begin, we examine Prediction 3A; school districts with less available land for new

development will have greater per-pupil expenditures. Table 7 reports estimates for per-pupil

school spending as in equation (6). Column (1) shows the results for the base equation that

includes the percentage developed land as a proxy for land supply inelasticity. The percentage

developed land is strongly and positively related to school spending, even when controlling for

household income, the educational and demographic background of residents, cost variables,

school agency specific characteristics, ethnic factors, and population density.

        The coefficient on percentage developed land is both statistically significant (p-value of 99

percent) and economically meaningful. Table 9 presents quantitative effects for two hypothetical

school districts: a less developed school district at the 75th percentile (with 6.6% of all

developable non-industrial land used for residential purposes) and a more developed school

district at the 95th percentile (with 68.1% of developable non-industrial land used for residential

purposes). The coefficients suggest that the school district in a location with more developed


   14
     Land is considered non-developable if it is classified as industrial, open water, perennial ice, barren, or
wetland. Our results are essentially unchanged if we drop industrial land from the list of non-developable uses.


                                                         27
land spends 10.7% more on schools than the district in a less developed location. This represents

an additional $549 per pupil relative to mean per-pupil spending of $5,131.

        Most other control variables have the expected effect on school spending and are reported

in the Appendix Table. Schools spend more money in districts with a higher percentage of

children below the poverty line or who speak English “not well”. Economies of scale appear

important. School districts with more schools spend less per-pupil (at a decreasing rate), as do

districts in more densely populated locations. School spending increases with the percentage of

residents with a college education and with the median household income. However, ethnic

polarization has no statistically significant effect on school spending.15

        The results in column (2) support Prediction 3B; the relationship between percentage

developed land and school spending is closely tied to homeownership. When the homeownership

dummy variable (which equals 1 if the district’s homeownership rate exceeds fifty percent) is

interacted with the percent developed land, the coefficient on the interaction is positive and

significant at the 1 percent level, while the coefficient on percent developed land is small and no

longer statistically significant. These results suggest that the positive relationship between

percentage developed land and spending only exists in communities where the median resident is

a homeowner. Note that the coefficient on the homeownership dummy itself is negative

suggesting that homeowners per se are less willing to support school spending compared to

renters if such increases have no positive impact on property values. Table 9 (row 3) indicates

that the positive effect of land scarcity on school spending (+10.7 percent) is almost exclusively




   15
      The coefficient on ethnic polarization is not inconsistent with Alesina et al. (1999), who find that ethnic
polarization is negatively related to the school share of total spending at the city level, but positively related to
overall spending. Their model has an ambiguous prediction about the impact of ethnic polarization on overall school
spending.


                                                         28
confined to locations with homeowner-majorities, which is in line with the predictions of our

model in Section 3.1.

     Columns (3) to (5) show that the percentage of elderly residents is positively related to

additional school spending only in school districts with a greater percent developed land. We

interact percent elderly with percent developed land and run separate regressions that define

elderly residents as those aged 65 and above, 75 and above, and 85 and above. Predictions 3C

and 3D suggest that the interactions will be positive and increase in magnitude for the older

elderly residents who have progressively shorter expected durations in their property. In all three

columns, the interaction between percent elderly and percentage developed land is positive and,

as predicted, the size of the coefficients on these interactions rises with age. Two of the three

interaction effects are statistically significant with p-values exceeding 95 percent. The interaction

effect for elderly residents aged 75 and above has a p-value of 87 percent. The direct effect of

percent elderly is either insignificant or negative. Table 9 shows that a one standard deviation

increase in the percent elderly results in higher spending of between 0.8 and 2.7 percent in

districts with more developed land relative to districts with less developed land.

     Next we add location fixed effects, confining our analysis to cross-sectional variation within

specific location types. The data allow us to categorize districts based on their location in central

cities of large MSAs (population over 1 million in MSA), in suburbs of large MSAs, in central

cities of medium-sized MSAs (MSA population between 250,000 and 1 million), in suburbs of

medium-sized MSAs, in central cities of small MSAs (MSA population below 250,000), in

suburbs of small MSAs, and in non-MSA locations.

     The results in Table 8 with the new location controls confirm our earlier findings. Table 9

reports quantitative effects. For example, the coefficient in column (1) suggests that the more

developed locations spend about 9.2 percent (or $472 per pupil) more on schools. This compares


                                                 29
to 10.7 percent (or $549) in the base specification without location type controls. The results in

column (2) are the same as our earlier finding that the relationship between percentage developed

land and school spending is confined to districts with homeowner majorities. Finally, the

interactions between percent elderly and percentage developed land are larger in magnitude than

those in Table 7 and are statistically significant with p-values exceeding 95 percent for all three

age categories.

        To further test the validity of our results, we estimate a number of additional specifications.

The results of these additional specification tests, which were reported in previous versions of the

paper, confirm our main findings and are available from the authors upon request.

        For example, we estimate our base regressions without any controls for crime.

Unfortunately, crime data is incomplete or missing for many districts in our sample. Some

readers have suggested that the locations with a higher percentage developed land might also

have a higher crime rate, biasing our analysis. To examine this hypothesis, we obtain crime rates

at the zip code level in as many jurisdictions as possible from the FBI.16 Crime data is

considerably more problematic than other variables because not all jurisdictions report crime data

and the geographical make-up of jurisdictions differs between school districts and police forces.

For example, some communities have local schools, but their crime rates are only reported at the

county level. Given the difficulties of using disaggregated crime statistics that are unlikely to be

accurate for particular locations, we primarily examine school districts where the crime data are

reported at the city level or below.17 This exclusion decreases our sample by one-third, leaving


   16
       The crime data come from U.S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Uniform Crime Reporting
Program Data: United States—Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest, 1990, compiled by the U.S. Dept. of
Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation. ICPSR ed. Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and
Social Research (producer and distributor), 1997. We also used zip code information from ESRI Inc. and
Geographic Data Technology, Inc. to help match the crime data with the school agency information.
    17
       All of the results with crime rates are similar if we apply county-level crime rates to individual agencies,
although we believe this approach to be less accurate.


                                                         30
7,979 remaining school districts. The greatest loss of observations is for rural places without

their own police forces.

     The inclusion of crime rate variables has little effect on the empirical results reported in

Tables 7 and 8. The coefficient on percentage developed land is highly statistically significant

but slightly smaller than in Table 7 if we estimate our base specification with the sample of

locations with non-missing crime data. When we add the murder rate and the murder rate

interacted with the homeownership rate or the percent elderly, the coefficients on percentage

developed land and its interaction terms are either unchanged or are slightly larger in magnitude.

The coefficient on the murder rate itself is positive and statistically significant at the 90 percent

level; suggesting that locations with higher crime rates spend more on schools. The coefficients

on the interaction between elderly and murder rate or homeownership and murder rate are

negative and marginally statistically significant. These findings are unchanged if we use all

crimes or crimes committed by juveniles instead of the murder rate.

     We consider three additional specification checks. First, we examine the data in California

and New Mexico, where spending is determined at the state level. The predictions from Section

3.1 should only hold for districts that have at least partial control over school spending. When we

run the regressions in Tables 7 and 8 for these two states, the coefficients on developable land

and its interaction terms are statistically insignificant and economically small. We also estimate

our equations omitting population density, which captures the cost of providing education but

may also be correlated with percentage developed land. The results are not appreciably different

and, in fact, statistical significance levels on the interaction terms improve slightly. Finally, our

main results remain qualitatively unchanged and significance levels are somewhat improved

when we add state and federal revenue per pupil to the base equation. It is worth noting that the




                                                  31
results imply that local districts increase total spending by only about 2.5 percent of the revenue

received from state and federal sources.


4     Conclusion

     This paper argues that the extent of house price capitalization within a school district is an

important factor in determining spending, encouraging homeowners to support additional school

spending even if they have no school-aged children. We argue that house price capitalization is

highest in developed areas where there is little available land for new construction, while

capitalization is lower in locations where land is more readily available. Hence, localities with

little available land should spend more on schools, all else equal. We expect these effects to be

most pronounced when the median voter is a homeowner and in places where elderly live, as the

elderly typically own homes and have a relatively short expected duration in their house.

     We examine these theoretical predictions using two alternative data sources. First, we take

advantage of a unique shock to local spending, Proposition 2½ in Massachusetts. We find that

fiscal variables and amenities are capitalized to a much greater extent in towns with little

available land and that these locations also have a lower elasticity of land supply. Communities

with little remaining developable land spend more on schools and their voters are more likely to

pass spending overrides in order to undertake new spending.

      Next we examine school spending from 1990 in 46 states and show that per pupil spending

is higher in school districts with little available developable land. The estimates are quite large.

For example, a community with 68.1 percent developed land spends $549 (10.7 percent) more

per pupil than a town with 6.6 percent developed land. Consistent with theory, the estimated

positive relationship between percent developed land and spending is confined to school districts

with homeownership rates above fifty percent. Finally, we demonstrate that elderly voters are not



                                                 32
necessarily averse to public school spending. A higher percent of elderly voters in more

developed locations is correlated with increased spending on schools, but more elderly residents

in undeveloped (rural) areas are associated with unchanged or even lower school spending levels.

The correlation between spending and the interaction of percent elderly and percent developed

land becomes larger when one examines older elderly citizens who have a shorter expected

duration in their house.

     These findings raise questions about the future of school spending in the U.S. Poterba

(1998) suggests that the coming increase in percentage of elderly voters might lead to cuts in real

education spending, although he speculates that house price capitalization might serve as a

counterweight. Our results suggest that an increasing share of elderly voters does not necessarily

portend lower school spending in more heavily developed places. However, projecting these

results into the future relies heavily on the assumption that the marginal homebuyer will continue

to value public schools in most communities.

     More generally, these results support models in which house prices encourage the efficient

provision of public services. In this regard, the fact that voters care about the preferences of

future generations of (marginal) homebuyers provides positive incentives to provide a variety of

services that may be consumed by only a minority of current residents. It also discourages

communities from financing their services by imposing burdens on future generations of residents

or home buyers.

  Notes: Numbers in parentheses are robust standard errors. * Significantly different from zero with 95 percent

  demographic characteristics of the residents of the school district, school district specific characteristics, and
  state fixed effects (see the Appendix Table for a full list of control variables). "Percentage developed" is
  defined as percentage of residential developed land divided by the total non-industrial developable land in a
  school district in 1992. The regression sample excludes states with full school finance equalization
  (California, New Mexico, and Hawaii). Consistent with theory, all interaction effects reported in Table 7 are
  completely statistically insignificant for the sample of school districts with full school finance equalization.
  Results are not appreciably different when population density is excluded as a control variable. The
  statistical significance levels of the interaction effects overall slightly improve. If the log of state and federal
  revenue per pupil is included as an additional control variable results remain similar, with all interaction
  effects reported in Table 7 having the predicted sign and being statistically significantly different from zero
  with at least 90 percent confidence. The log of state and federal revenue per pupil is not included in the base
  specification because it is arguably endogenous.

Notes: The total average school spending per pupil in the regression samples is $5,131. "Percentage developed" is
defined as percentage of residential developed land divided by the total non-industrial developable land in a school
district in 1992. The baseline is a representative school district with a homeowner-majority. That is, quantitative
effects are measured at the regression sample averages except that a homeowner-majority is assumed rather than
the sample average of the homeownership dummy variable (=0.97). * The quantitative effects reported in columns
(1) and (2) do not always precisely add up to the differential percentage value reported in column (3) due to
rounding errors.
