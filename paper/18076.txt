Sequential or Simultaneous Elections? A Welfare Analysis
Patrick Hummel and Brian Knight
NBER Working Paper No. 18076
May 2012
JEL No. D7,D8

                                               ABSTRACT

This paper addresses a key question on the design of electoral systems. Should all voters vote on the
same day or should elections be staggered, with late voters observing early returns before making
their decisions? Using a model of voting and social learning, we illustrate that sequential elections
place too much weight on the preferences and information of early states but also provide late voters
with valuable information. Under simultaneous elections, voters equally weigh the available information
but place too much weight on their priors, providing an inappropriate advantage to front-runners. Given
these trade-offs, simultaneous elections are welfare-preferred if the front-runner initially has a small
advantage, but sequential elections are welfare-preferred if the front-runner initially has a large advantage.
We then quantitatively evaluate this trade-off using data based on the 2004 presidential primary. The
results suggest that simultaneous systems outperform sequential systems although the difference in
welfare is relatively small.

1    Introduction
While many elections are held on the same day, other elections are staggered, with
di erent voters casting their votes on di erent days. This distinction between simul-
taneous and sequential systems is particularly salient in the design of presidential
primary systems, which have traditionally followed a calendar in which Iowa and
New Hampshire vote rst, followed by group of states on the rst Tuesday in Feb-
ruary and another group on the rst Tuesday in March. This is followed by several
months of further elections, with the process often continuing into early summer.
During the 2008 season, there was signi cant front-loading, with 22 states moving
their primary to the rst Tuesday in February, and this date was dubbed by some
commentators as a \national primary". In the 2012 Republican primary, by con-
trast, only a handful of states voted in early February, with a large group voting on
the rst Tuesday in March.
    Given concerns associated with the current system, several alternatives have been
proposed. At the extreme, advocates of a true National Primary, in which every state
would vote on the same date, point towards a more e cient and fair system. Hybrid
systems, which move towards a simultaneous system but retain some features of the
current sequential system, include the Rotating Regional Primary System, under
which Iowa and New Hampshire would vote rst, followed by four weekly rounds of
regional primaries, with the order of the regions rotating from election to election.
    Debates over the choice between traditional sequential calendars and these al-
ternative, more compressed, calendars, typically focus on trading o the relative
advantages of the two systems. In particular, opponents of the current system ar-


                                         1
gue that early states have disproportionate in uence, while supporters argue that it
is enhances competition since dark horse candidates can better emerge from the eld
of candidates. Under simultaneous elections, by contrast, states would have equal
in uence but dark horse candidates may not be provided with su cient opportunity
to compete. While these factors have dominated the debate, there has been little
formal analysis of this trade-o , and there have also been no attempts to weigh the
relative importance of these advantages and disadvantages of the two systems.
    In this paper, we use the positive model of voting and social learning developed
in Knight and Schi (2010) in order to conduct a normative analysis of this trade-
o . In the model, voters are uncertain over candidate quality but have some private
information. Under sequential elections, voters in late states attempt to infer the
information of voters in early states from voting returns. Using this model, we com-
pare both simultaneous and sequential elections to a public information benchmark,
under which all voters observe all relevant signals. In the context of a simple ver-
sion of the model with two candidates, we show that neither system is optimal and
that there is indeed a trade-o between voters equally weighing the preferences and
information under simultaneous systems and late voters being better informed un-
der sequential elections. We then develop welfare expressions based upon aggregate
voter utility and show that the simultaneous election tends to dominate when the
advantage of the front-runner is small. When this advantage is large, by contrast,
sequential election systems tend to dominate as they provide greater opportunities
for dark horse candidates of unexpectedly high quality to emerge from the eld.
Finally, we conduct an empirical welfare analysis based upon the 2004 election,
and the estimates suggest that simultaneous election systems outperform sequential
election systems, at least in the context of this election.
    The paper proceeds as follows. We rst discuss the related literature and then
review the positive theoretical model of voting and social learning. Using this model,
we provide a comparison of sequential and simultaneous systems and show that
either system might be preferred from a welfare perspective. Finally, we conduct a
numerical welfare analysis based on the 2004 Democratic primary calendar and the
associated pool of candidates competing in this election.

2     Literature Review
This paper is at the intersection of four literatures: social learning, theoretical
analyses of sequential voting systems, empirical analyses of sequential voting systems
in the context of Presidential primaries, and optimal electoral institutions. We
discuss each in turn below.


2.1    Social Learning
The literature on social learning began with Welch (1992), Bikhchandani, Hirsh-
leifer, and Welch (1992), and Banerjee (1992). In these models, agents take actions
in a predetermined sequence, individual payo s depend only upon individual ac-
tions, and late movers have an opportunity to observe the actions of early movers.
If actions are discrete and payo s are su ciently correlated, a herd may form in
which agents ignore their private information and simply follow the actions of those
earlier in the sequence. Note that, despite the fact that information may be lost in
this process, simultaneous choice never dominates a sequential order from a welfare
perspective. This follows from the fact that individual payo s depend only upon
individual actions, and thus agents moving in a sequence would rationally ignore
the behavior of early agents were it in their best interests to do so. In the vot-
ing context, by contrast, individual payo s depend upon the actions of all agents
and thus whether a simultaneous or sequential calendar is preferred from a welfare
perspective is less clear.


2.2    Theoretical Analyses of Sequential Voting
Several papers have examined this issue of social learning in the electoral context,
with a focus on binary elections. In a model with strategic voters, Dekel and Piccione
(2000) show that every equilibrium of the simultaneous game is an equilibrium of
the sequential game. This follows from the fact that voters condition on being
pivotal and hence behave as if exactly half of the other voters favor one option over
the other. Thus, the identity of the early voters is irrelevant, and voters do not
condition on the behavior of those earlier in the sequence. The converse, that every
equilibrium of the sequential game is an equilibrium of the simultaneous game,
however, is not necessarily true. In particular, Ali and Kartik (2012) construct

                                          3
equilibria in which late voters do condition on the behavior of early voters. Other
theoretical analyses of sequential elections include Battaglini (2005), who focuses
on voter turnout, Hummel (2012), who focuses on multicandidate elections, Morton
and Williams (1999, 2001), who focus on learning about candidate ideology from
early voters and conduct corresponding experimental tests, Callandar (2007), who
examines sequential elections in the context of a model in which voters prefer to vote
for winners, Hummel (2011), who addresses the desire to avoid a long and costly
primary, Aldrich (1980) and Klumpp and Polborn (2006), who examine campaign
  nance in the context of sequential elections, and Strumpf (2002), who examines
candidate incentives for exiting the election.
    The most closely related work in this literature is Selman (2010), who investigates
whether parties should choose sequential or simultaneous systems when designing
primaries. In his model, there are two candidates, one of which is high quality
and one of which is low quality, and voters receive private information about which
candidate is of high quality. Loyal voters always vote for their preferred candidate,
whereas uncommitted voters support the candidate of higher expected quality. Un-
like our model, neither candidate is favored in terms of voter priors over quality. In
the context of his model, Selman shows that the sequential system is preferred when
loyal voters are imbalanced and the quality of information is low. That is, herding
by late voters compensates for the imbalance among loyal voters. While competition
also plays a role in our comparison between sequential and simultaneous elections,
the mechanism is quite di erent. Unlike Selman (2010), candidates in our model
are advantaged due to voter priors, and the advantage of the sequential system is
that voters place less weight on these priors. An additional contribution of our pa-
per relative to Selman (2010) is our empirical analysis, which attempts to measure
whether the advantages of the sequential system outweigh the disadvantages.


2.3    Empirical Analyses of Sequential Voting
Empirical analyses of presidential primary systems include Knight and Schi (2010),
who, using daily polling data from the 2004 presidential primary, document momen-
tum e ects and provide empirical support for a social learning interpretation. Note
that Knight and Schi (2010) is purely positive in nature and does not address the
normative question of which system is welfare-preferred. Bartels (1987, 1988) ex-


                                          4
amines polling data in 1984 and shows that candidate viability plays a key role in
momentum e ects. Bartels (1985) and Kenney and Rice (1994) also examine other
possible empirical motivations for momentum e ects using data from the 1980 and
1988 presidential primaries. Finally, there are a series of papers, including Adkins
and Dowdle (2001), Steger, Dowdle, and Adkins (2004), and Steger (2008), doc-
umenting that early states have a disproportionate in uence in terms of selecting
the winning candidate in presidential primaries. These papers are all relevant in
the sense that they document important di erences in electoral outcomes between
simultaneous and sequential systems.
    In closely related work, Deltas, Herrera, and Polborn (2010) examine a model
in which late voters learn about valence from the voting returns in early states. In
addition to this vertical dimension, candidates are also distinguished by a horizontal
dimension, and, when there are more than two candidates, their model thus intro-
duces the potentially interesting issue of ticket-splitting. On the other hand, their
model does not allow for candidates to di er in terms of the priors of voters over
quality, and thus does not allow for front-runner and dark horse candidates. Thus,
in their context, the advantage of sequential elections involves the ability of voters
to better coordinate as the election unfolds, rather than allowing dark horse can-
didates of high quality to emerge from the eld. After structurally estimating the
model using aggregate, state-level voting returns data from the 2008 primary, they
show that sequential elections tend to outperform simultaneous elections in terms
of electing candidates of higher valence and being more likely to elect the Condorcet
winner. Given that the underlying advantages of sequential elections are di erent
in their model, we view our work as complementary to this paper.


2.4    Optimal Electoral Institutions
Finally, this paper is related to a broader literature on the normative analysis of
electoral institutions. Hummel and Holden (2012) address the question of whether
it is better to have small states vote before large states or well-informed states vote
before less informed states in sequential elections, but do not analyze simultaneous
elections, as we do in this paper. Maskin and Tirole (2004) develop the optimal
constitution in a model in which public o cials can be held more or less accountable
via reelection. Lizzeri and Persico (2001) compare the distribution of public goods


                                          5
under winner-take-all and proportional electoral systems. Coate and Knight (2007)
develop the optimal districting plan for district-based legislative elections. Persson,
Roland, and Tabellini (2000) and Persson and Tabellini (2004) compare presidential
and parliamentary systems. And nally, Coate (2004) and Prat (2002) examine
campaign nance from a voter welfare perspective.



3    Basic Model
This section lays out our framework for comparing simultaneous and sequential
elections. The notation follows Chamley (2004), and readers are referred to Knight
and Schi (2010) for additional details and discussion.
    Consider a set of states (s = 1; 2; :::; S) choosing between candidates (c =
0; 1; :::; C). We allow for the possibility that multiple states may vote on the same
day; in particular, let t be the set of states voting on date t and let Nt 1 be the
size of this set. This nests the case of sequential elections, where t is nonempty for
multiple t, and simultaneous elections, where Nt = 0 if t > 1.
    Within a state, there is a continuum of voters with unit mass. Voter i residing
in state s is assumed to receive the following payo from candidate c winning the
election:
                                  ucis = qc + cs + cis                             (1)
where qc represents the quality of candidate c; cs represents a state-speci c pref-
erence for candidate c; and cis represents an individual preference for candidate c
that is assumed to be drawn independently from a type-I extreme value distribution
across both candidates and voters. We normalize utility from the baseline candidate
to be zero for all voters (u0is = 0):
     We assume the following information structure. Voters know their own state-
level preference ( cs ) but not those in other states. Voters do, however, know the
distribution from which these state-level preferences are drawn. In particular, we
assume that state-level preferences are drawn independently from a normal distrib-
ution [ cs N (0; 2 )]. We further assume that voters are uncertain over candidate
quality and are Bayesian. In particular, initial (t = 1) priors over candidate quality
(qc ) are assumed to be normally distributed with a candidate-speci c mean c1 and
a variance 12 that is common across candidates. Under the assumptions to follow,


                                          6
the posterior distribution will be normal as well. Before going to the polls, all voters
in state s receive a noisy signal ( cs ) over the quality of candidate c :

                                               cs   = qc + "cs                                                     (2)

where the noise in each state's signal is assumed to be drawn independently from a
normal distribution ["cs N (0; "2 )]. We assume that this signal is common across
all voters within a state. Finally, we assume that the signal is unobserved by voters
in other states.
    Given the state-level signal ( cs ); expected utility for voter i in state s from
candidate c winning can be written as follows:

                     E(ucis j    cs ; cs ; cis )         = E(qc j           cs )   +   cs       +   cis            (3)
Finally, regarding voter behavior, we assume sincere voting. In particular, given
the information available, voter i in state s at time t supports the candidate who
provides the voter with the highest level of expected utility.
    Then, for voters in state s observing a signal over quality ( cs ) and with a prior
given by ( ct ; t2 ); private updating over quality is given by:

                              E(qc j    cs )   =         t cs    + (1               t ) ct                         (4)

where the weight on the signal is given by:
                                                                 2
                                                                 t
                                               t    =        2          2
                                                                                                                   (5)
                                                             t   +      "

Plugging equation (4) into equation (3), we have that:

                E(ucis j   cs ; cs ; cis )   =       t cs     + (1                 t ) ct   +       cs   +   cis   (6)
Then, using the fact that cis is drawn from a type-I extreme value distribution, we
can write the vote shares for candidate c, relative to the baseline candidate 0, in
state s voting at time t as follows:

                       ln(vcst =v0st ) =            cs   +       t cs   + (1                t ) ct :               (7)
Using the fact that cs = qc + "cs we can say that transformed vote shares provide
a noisy signal of quality:
                      ln(vcst =v0st )        (1            t ) ct                       cs
                                                                     = qc +                     + "cs              (8)
                                         t                                                  t


                                                          7
where the noise in the voting signal includes the noise in the quality signal ("cs )
but also the noise due to the unobserved state preferences ( cs = t ); the combined
variance of the noise in the voting signal thus equals ( 2 = t2 ) + "2 : Given Nt   1
such signals, the posterior distribution is also normal and can thus be characterized
by its rst two moments:

                                              t =Nt   X
                      ct+1   =   ct   +                         [ln(vcst =v0st )   ct ]    (9)

where the weight on the voting signals is given by:

                                                  Nt t2
                                 t    =                                                   (11)
                                          Nt t2 + ( 2 = t2 ) +             2
                                                                           "



4     Normative Analysis
Using this model, we rst de ne voter welfare and then develop a public information
benchmark under which all voters have access to all relevant signals. Focusing on a
simple case of the model with two candidates and two states, we then compare elec-
toral outcomes under this public information benchmark to those under sequential
and simultaneous voting systems. Finally, we develop expressions for the welfare
gain associated with moving from a sequential system to a simultaneous system,
again focusing on the special case of two candidates and two states.


4.1    Voter Welfare
Our welfare measure is based upon average voter utility obtained under the winning
candidate:

                                C             S Z
                             1X              X
                      W =          1(c wins)         ucis f (ucis )di                     (12)
                             S c=1           s=1 i2s

where 1(c wins) indicates that candidate c received a plurality of votes and S is
                                                                R
the total number of states. Since cis is mean zero, we have that i2s ucis f (ucis )di =
qc + cs : Substituting this in, we have that:

                                        c=1                S s=1
Then, for a given electoral system, we have that expected voter welfare is given by:
                                               C
                                               X
                              E(W ) =                Pr(c wins)E(qc +                     c jc     wins)                         (14)
                                               c=1

                1   PS
where   c   =   S    s=1   sc   measures the average state-level preference for candidate c.


4.2     Public Information Benchmark
As a welfare benchmark, we next consider electoral outcomes under the case in
which voters have all of the relevant signals regarding candidate quality. That is,
under this counterfactual system, voters in each state have access to the full set of
signals and update over candidate c as follows:

                                                                     2        S
                                                                              X                                2
                                                                     1                                         "
                     E(qc j   c1;   c2; :::;   cS ) =            2           2        cs +               2             2    c1   (15)
                                                         S       1   +       " s=1               S       1     +       "

The exact order of voting does not matter in this case since voters do not gather
additional information from observing vote shares in other states, and we thus simply
consider the case in which all states vote simultaneously after updating. In this case,
vote shares in state s can be summarized as follows:

                                                                 2           S
                                                                             X                             2
                                                                 1                                         "
                      ln(vcs =v0s ) =           cs   +       2           2           cs   +          2             2       c1    (16)
                                                         S   1   +       " s=1                S      1   +         "



4.3     Electoral Outcomes
To illustrate the key trade-o s involved and to demonstrate how the simultaneous
and sequential systems compare to the public information benchmark, we next con-
sider a special case, which we refer to as the two-by-two model, with two candidates
(0 and 1) and two states (A and B). Without loss of generality, assume that state
A votes earlier than state B under the sequential system. With only two candidates
and normalizing candidate 0 to have quality of zero, we can drop all candidate sub-
scripts (e.g. 1t = t ): Further, without loss of generality, assume that candidate 1


                                                                     9
is not disadvantaged relative to candidate 0 ( 1 0): That is, candidate 1 can be
considered the front-runner and candidate 0 the dark horse candidate.
    With two candidates and two states, the rst thing to note is that, under any
of the three systems, simultaneous, sequential, or all-public information, the front-
runner is elected with the following probability:
                           "                                                                                                          #
                      0:5 exp(E(qjIA ) +                             A)    0:5 exp(E(qjIB ) +                         B)
               P = Pr                                                    +                                                    > 0:5              (17)
                      1 + exp(E(qjIA ) +                              A)   1 + exp(E(qjIB ) +                         B)

where Is represents the information set of voters in state s. Rearranging, we have
that the front-runner wins if a front-runner support index (z), which is linear in the
key expressions, is positive:

                  P = Pr[z = 0:5E(qjIA ) + 0:5E(qjIB ) + 0:5                                            A   + 0:5     B    > 0]                  (18)
Then, under simultaneous voting, we have that IA = f                                                        Ag    and IB = f              B g,   and,
using equation (4) above, we have that:

                P sim = Pr[0:5                  1( A        +   B)   + (1            1) 1      + 0:5        A   + 0:5     B   > 0]               (19)
Under the sequential system, we have that IA = f                                               Ag   and IB = f             B ; vA g   and, using
the positive analysis above, one can show that:


      P seq = Pr[(0:5                  1   + 0:5(1              2) 1) A         + 0:5      2 B      + (0:5(1               1)   + 0:5(1
                          2 )(1            1 )) 1       + 0:5   A    + (0:5 + 0:5(1                     2 )( 1 = 1 )) B         > 0]             (20)

Finally, under the public information benchmark, we have that IA = IB = f                                                                      A; B g
and thus:

                      "                         !                                              !                                           #
                                      2                                              2
      public                          1                                              "
  P            = Pr               2         2
                                                    (   A   +   B)   +           2         2        1   + 0:5     A   + 0:5      B    >0         (21)
                            2     1   +     "                               2    1   +     "

Thus, under all three systems, support for the front-runner can be summarized as a
linear index of signals ( A ; B ), the size of the advantage for the front-runner ( 1 ),
and the preferences of the two states ( A ; B ): That is,


        P = Pr[z = !(                 A) A      + !(        B) B     + !( )          1   + !(      A) A     + !(      B) B      > 0]             (22)

                                                                          10
Thus, in the two-by-two model, we can fully characterize these three systems ac-
cording to the relative weights that they place upon signals, priors, and preferences.

   As shown in the above table, neither the simultaneous nor the sequential system
implements the public information benchmark outcome in general. However, the
simultaneous system does share the feature of the public information benchmark
that the information and preferences of the di erent states are weighted equally.
This feature is not present in the sequential system. These di erences amongst the
systems are summarized in the following proposition:

Proposition 1. The sequential system places disproportionate weight on the pref-
erences and information of the early state while the simultaneous and public infor-
mation systems place equal weight on the preferences and information of the early
                          @z seq =@ A      @z seq =@ A         @z sim =@ A   @z sim =@ A
and late states. That is, @z seq =@
                                    B
                                      > 1, @z seq =@
                                                     B
                                                       > 1 and @z sim =@
                                                                         B
                                                                           = @z sim =@
                                                                                       B
                                                                                         =
@z public =@   A       @z public =@   A
@z public =@   B
                   =   @z public =@   B
                                          = 1:

   Thus, the sequential system has the disadvantage of providing disproportionate
in uence to the early state, both in terms of information and preferences. On
the other hand, under the sequential system, voters make better informed choices,
and this system thus has the advantage of placing more weight on information in
aggregate and less weight on the prior. This leads to the front-runner being overly
advantaged in the simultaneous election, relative to the sequential system. This
advantage of the sequential system is summarized in the following proposition:

Proposition 2. The weight placed on the prior is higher under the simultaneous sys-
tem than under the sequential system, which in turn places more weight on the prior

                                                                11
than the all-public system, i.e., ! sim > ! seq > ! public : Moreover, the front-runner has
a higher probability of winning the simultaneous election than the sequential election,
i.e., P sim > P seq :

    Proofs of all propositions are in the appendix. The intuition for the rst re-
sult in Proposition 2 (! sim > ! seq ) is as follows: Early voters place equal weight
on their signals in the sequential and simultaneous systems. Late voters, by con-
trast, have an additional piece of information, returns from the early state, in the
sequential election, when compared to the simultaneous election, and thus place less
weight on their prior. Thus, in aggregate, the sequential system places more weight
on the available information and less weight on the prior, when compared to the
simultaneous system.
    Regarding the second result in Proposition 2 (! seq > ! public ), early voters have
more information under the all-public system and thus place less weight on their
prior than in the sequential election. Late voters also have more information under
the all-public system since they observe the true signal of the early state. Under
sequential voting, late voters only observe voting returns, which are a noisy signal
of the state's information, and hence place more weight on their prior. Thus both
early and late voters place more weight on their prior under sequential voting.
    The third result (P sim > P seq ) follows from the three di erences between the se-
quential and simultaneous systems. First, the sequential system places more weight
on information in aggregate and less weight on the prior. Second, the sequential
system places more weight on the information from the early state, relative to the
late state. Finally, the sequential system places more weight on the preferences of
the early state, relative to the late state. All three of these factors contribute to
the sequential system having more variance, and hence being less predictable, than
the simultaneous system. Thus the front-runner has a smaller advantage under the
sequential system than under the simultaneous system.1
    To summarize, in the two-by-two model, the simultaneous system has the ad-
vantage of giving equal weight to state-level information and preferences, whereas

   1
     P sim > P public also holds because the simultaneous system places more weight on priors
than the public information benchmark. However, it is unclear whether the front-runner has a
higher or lower probability of winning under the sequential system than in the public information
benchmark since the sequential system places more emphasis on preferences in addition to more
heavily weighting priors. In the special case of no preference heterogeneity ( 2 = 0), this second
factor goes away, and P seq > P public .

                                               12
the sequential system has the advantage of allowing dark horse candidates of unex-
pectedly high quality to emerge from the eld of candidates. Complementing this
analysis, the next section provides a comparison of welfare under the two systems.

4.4    Welfare Comparison
We next compare welfare under the sequential system to welfare under the simulta-
neous system. In this two-by-two model, equation (14) simpli es to:

                               E(W ) = E(yjz > 0) Pr(z > 0)                            (23)

where y = q + 0:5 A + 0:5 B captures aggregate voter utility from the front-runner
winning o ce instead of the dark horse candidate. Using the properties of the
normal distribution, we then have that:

                                                                     1
                               E(W ) =       1P   +    y;z y                           (24)
                                                                     z

where P =      1
               z
                   captures the probability of the front-runner winning the election,
and y;z represents the correlation between aggregate voter utility from the front-
runner winning o ce and the index of support for the front-runner.
   Using this welfare expression, we then have that the di erence in expected welfare
between the simultaneous and sequential systems is given by:


                = E sim (W )       E seq (W )
                                                                     !
                             sim       seq       sim             1       seq       1
                =    1   P         P         +   y;z y         sim       y;z y   seq   (25)
                                                               z                 z


The rst term measures the expected bene t from electing the front-runner ( 1 )
multiplied by the di erence in the probabilities the front-runner will be elected under
the two systems. Since the front-runner is more likely to win under the simultaneous
system, this rst term is positive and can be interpreted as the reduction in risk
associated with the dark horse candidate winning less often under the simultaneous
system.
   The second term can be interpreted as the di erence between the informational
gain associated with implementing the simultaneous system instead of the sequential
system. This term can either be positive or negative and depends on sim             seq
                                                                           y;z and y;z ,


                                                  13
the correlations between aggregate voter utility (y) and the index of support for the
front-runner (z) under the two systems.
    To understand how this welfare di erence varies with the parameters of the
model, it is necessary to understand how the correlations between aggregate voter
utility (y) and the index of support for the front-runner (z), sim       seq
                                                               y;z and y;z , compare
under the two systems. This question is addressed in the following proposition:

Proposition 3. The correlation between aggregate utility and the index of support
for the front-runner is greater under the simultaneous system than the sequential
system, i.e., sim    seq
               y;z > y;z .


    The fact that the correlation between aggregate utility and the index of support
for the front-runner is greater under the simultaneous system than the sequential
system is due to how the two systems weigh the information and preferences of
the di erent states. Since the sequential system gives disproportionate weight to
the information and preferences of voters in the early state instead of weighing both
states equally, vote shares under the sequential system are not as strongly correlated
with aggregate utility as vote shares under the simultaneous system.
    We now use Proposition 3 to prove the main result about when the simultaneous
system is welfare-preferred to the sequential system:

Proposition 4. The simultaneous system is welfare-preferred when the front-
runner's advantage is small and the sequential system is welfare-preferred when the
front-runner's advantage is large. In particular, > 0 for su ciently small values
of 1 and < 0 for su ciently large values of 1 .

    To understand the intuition behind this result, note that when the front-runner's
advantage is small, the welfare comparison between the simultaneous and the se-
quential systems reduces to a comparison between which system has greater cor-
relation between aggregate utility and vote shares. Since we have seen that this
correlation is greater under the simultaneous system, the simultaneous system is
welfare-preferred when the front-runner's advantage is small.
    However, when the front-runner's advantage is large, this correlation di erence
becomes less relevant since the front-runner is very likely to win under either system.
Instead the most important factor becomes the fact that the sequential system gives
the dark horse candidate a relatively greater chance of winning in circumstances

                                          14
when this candidate is actually the better candidate. For this reason, the sequential
system is welfare-preferred when the front-runner's advantage is large.


5      Numerical Analysis
Returning to the more general case of many states and more than two candidates, we
next provide a quantitative evaluation of the welfare properties of the simultaneous
and sequential elections, when compared to the all-public information benchmark.
In particular, we aim to evaluate the welfare expression in equation (14) under
all three systems. In order to conduct this evaluation, we use the key parameter
estimates from the application to the 2004 Democratic presidential primary from
Knight and Schi (2010). This analysis focused on the three key candidates, Kerry,
Dean (D), and Edwards (E), where Kerry was considered the baseline candidate.
Estimates of the key parameters ( D1 ; E1 ; 1 ; " , and ) from this analysis are
summarized in Table 1. As shown, given his lead in the polls prior to the start
of the primary season, Dean can be considered the front-runner in this analysis,
followed by Kerry and then Edwards.
    Using these parameter estimates, the numerical analysis proceeds in the following
steps:

    1. Randomly draw a quality value, relative to Kerry, for Dean (qD ) and Edwards
       (qE ) from the normal distributions with means D1 and E1 , respectively, and
       common variance 12 :

    2. For each state s, randomly draw a signal noise value, relative to Kerry, for
       Dean ("Ds ) and Edwards ("Es ); from the normal distribution with mean 0 and
       variance "2 :

    3. Calculate the state-level signal for Dean (   Ds   = qD + "Ds ) and for Edwards
       ( Es = qE + "Es ):

    4. For each state s, randomly draw a preference, relative to Kerry, for Dean ( Ds )
       and Edwards ( Es ) from the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2 .

    5. Given these signals and preferences and using the models outlined above, com-
       pute the vote shares in each state s for Dean (vDst ); Edwards (vEst ), and Kerry


                                           15
      (1 vDst vEst ) under the sequential system, using the actual calendar from
      2004, the simultaneous system, and nally, the all-public information system.

  6. Compute the national vote shares as the average vote shares across states and
     identify the winner of the election as the candidate receiving a plurality of the
     vote.

  7. Compute voter welfare in equation (13).

    Finally, steps 1-7 are repeated 50,000 times and we estimate expected welfare, as
expressed in equation (14), under each of three systems as the average voter welfare
across these 50,000 replications.
    The results from this analysis are presented in Table 2. As shown, neither sys-
tem produces the expected welfare levels associated with the all-public information
benchmark, in which all voters have access to all signals. In particular, while the all-
public system generates voter welfare of 1.4150, the simultaneous system generates
welfare of 1.3978, and the sequential system generates welfare of 1.3952. Compar-
ing the simultaneous and sequential systems, we see that the simultaneous system
produces higher welfare levels than does the sequential system, suggesting that the
bene ts to the simultaneous system, the equal weighting of voter preferences and
information, outweigh any bene ts from the sequential system, which provides dark
horse candidates of unexpectedly high quality with an opportunity to emerge from
the eld of candidates.
    Given the nite number of replications, we next provide con dence intervals for
the welfare di erence of 0.0026. With 50,000 replications and a standard devia-
tion for the welfare di erence of 0.1113, as estimated across replications, we have
a 95-percent con dence interval of (0.0016 , 0.0036). Thus, using conventional sig-
ni cance levels, the number of replications is su cient to reject the hypothesis that
there is no di erence in welfare between the simultaneous and sequential systems.
    In terms of the magnitude of any welfare gains associated with moving from
our current system to a simultaneous system, there are several relevant bench-
marks. First, these welfare gains can be compared to the welfare di erence be-
tween the all-public and sequential systems. That is, we calculate [E sim (W )
E seq (W )]=[E pub (W ) E seq (W )]: This di erence, as expressed in the denominator,
can be interpreted as the maximal possible gains when starting from the sequential


                                          16
system. According to this measure, the di erence in welfare between the simulta-
neous and sequential systems represents about 13 percent of maximal gains that
can be achieved. Second, these welfare gains can be compared to the di erence
between the simultaneous system and a no-information system, under which Dean
would always be elected and expected welfare equals 0.938. That is, we calculate
[E sim (W ) E seq (W )]=[E sim (W )   D1 ]: This di erence, as expressed in the denom-
inator, can be interpreted as the maximal possible gains associated with moving
to the simultaneous system. According to this measure, the di erence in welfare
between the simultaneous and sequential systems is less than 1 percent of the maxi-
mal possible gains. This small gain re ects the fact that both systems, simultaneous
and sequential, substantially outperform to the no-information case. This in turn
follows from the fact that the noise in the signal, as estimated by Knight and Schi
(2010), is small ( 2 =1:197) relative to the variance in the initial prior ( 12 =3:577).
Thus, voters learn a substantial amount from a single piece of information.2
    Another natural benchmark for comparing the di erence in welfare between the
simultaneous and sequential systems is to note how this welfare di erence compares
to the welfare di erence that would arise if one happens to randomly draw a high
quality candidate from the distribution of candidate qualities rather than a low qual-
ity candidate. The variance in candidate qualities is 12 , so the standard deviation
in candidate qualities is 1 and di erences in random draws of candidate quality are
likely to a ect average voter welfare by an amount on the order of 1 . Since the
parameter estimates from Knight and Schi (2010) indicate that 12 is about 3:577
(and thus 1 is about 1:891), randomly drawing a high quality candidate rather than
a low quality candidate from the distribution of candidate qualities is likely to a ect
voter welfare by an amount on the order of a full unit of utility. By contrast, the
di erence in expected welfare between the simultaneous system and the sequential
system is 0:0026. Thus the bene t from randomly drawing a high quality candidate
to run for o ce instead of a low quality candidate is several hundred times greater
than the expected bene t from switching to a simultaneous system from a sequen-
tial system. This again indicates that the expected welfare di erence between the
simultaneous and sequential systems is small.
    To provide further context to these di erences in voter welfare, we provide a

   2                                                 2
     In particular, the precision in the prior (1/   q)   increases from 0.280 to 1.115 after observing
one signal.


                                                 17
quantitative evaluation, in the context of this simulation exercise, of the relative
advantages of the simultaneous and sequential systems. We rst compute the odds
of each of the three candidates winning the election. As shown in Table 2, the simul-
taneous system does give too much advantage to the front-runner, with Dean, who
led prior to Iowa, winning in 69 percent of cases. Under the full information system,
by contrast, Dean wins in only 61 percent of cases, and the sequential system, in
which Dean wins in 62 percent of cases, gives dark horse candidates a substantially
better chance of winning. Conversely, the simultaneous system disadvantages the
dark horse candidates, Kerry and Edwards, who win in just 23 and 8 percent of
cases, respectively. These candidates have signi cantly higher chances of winning in
the all-public and sequential systems. These probabilities highlight the advantage
of the sequential system.
    To illustrate and quantify the disadvantages of the sequential system, we next
provide quantitative evidence on the disproportionate in uence of early states.
While analytic expressions for the relative vote shares are not a linear function
of the players' private signals and preferences when there are more than two candi-
dates and more than two states, we can approximate the extent to which changes
in these signals and preferences a ect the relative vote shares via a linear regres-
sion. In particular, using each of the 50,000 replications as an observation, we relate
the cross-state average vote share of the front-runner, Dean, to the information and
preferences of states at di erent points in the sequence by estimating the parameters
of the following equation:

                                         t=22
                                          X                  t=22
                                                              X
                            vD
                     ln(        )=   +          !t ( ) t +          !t ( )   t    (26)
                           1 vD          t=1                 t=1
                   P                               P
where t = (1=Nt ) s2 t st and t = (1=Nt ) s2 t st represent the average signal
and preference, respectively, among the set of states voting at time t. For comparison
purposes, we run two additional regressions, both of which use the sequence from the
sequential system but the vote shares for the all-public and simultaneous systems,
respectively.
    Figures 1 and 2 plot the coe cients on the signals and preferences, respectively,
from these regressions. As shown in Figure 1, the sequential system does sub-
stantially overweight the information of early states, with the rst state having a
coe cient of 0.1148 and the nal state having a coe cient of 0.0025. Thus the
signal of the rst state has over 45 times the in uence as that of the last state.

                                           18
The simultaneous and all-public systems, by contrast, place equal weight on state-
level information. Comparing the weights under the simultaneous and all-public
systems, this gure also con rms the result that the simultaneous system places too
little weight on information in aggregate and thus too much weight on the prior.
     Figure 2 displays a similar pattern, with the preferences of the rst state to
vote having a weight of 0.1530 and the last state having a weight of 0.0171. Thus
the preferences of the rst state have roughly 9 times the in uence as those of the
last state in the sequence. This indicates that the sequential system more severely
overweights the information of early states relative to late states than it does the
preferences of early states relative to late states. This makes sense intuitively since
voters in later states have more of an incentive to ignore their private information
when they have information about how early states voted than they do to ignore
their private preferences. However, the simultaneous and all-public systems again
place equal weight on the preferences of each state.
     To provide further interpretation of these results, we consider three alternative
sequential systems. First, we consider the 2008 calendar, when nearly half of the
states moved their primary to the rst Tuesday of February, and the 2012 calendar.
As shown in Table 2, these alternative calendars still fall short of the simultaneous
election in terms of voter welfare and yield welfare levels that are slightly lower
than those using the 2004 calendar. We next consider a rotating regional primary
system, under which Iowa and New Hampshire maintain their status as the rst
states to vote. Following these two states, there are then four rounds of voting, with
12 states voting in round 1, 13 states in round 2, 12 states in round 3, and 12 states
in round 4. As shown, this system also falls short of the simultaneous system in
terms of voter welfare but dominates the 2004, 2008, and 2012 calendars. Finally, we
consider a pure sequential system, under which every state votes on a di erent day.
As shown, this system has the weakest performance of any system considered here,
presumably re ecting the fact that the disproportionate impact of early states is
particularly extreme in this case. Taken together, the results from these alternative
sequential calendars suggest that incremental steps towards a simultaneous system
tend to increase voter welfare.
     To illustrate the trade-o identi ed in Proposition 4, we calculate the welfare
gains associated with moving from the sequential system to the simultaneous system
under di erent alternative electoral advantages for the front-runner. In particular,


                                          19
while our baseline estimates are based upon ( D1 ; E1 ) = (0:938; 0:701); we next
consider ( D1 ; E1 ) = ( 0:938;    0:701) for = f0; 0:5; 2; 3; 4; 5g. Thus can be
considered a measure of the electoral advantage of the front-runner. As shown in
Figure 3, the welfare gains are positive and larger than the baseline ( = 1) when
the front-runner's advantage is small ( = 0 and = 0:5), re ecting the fact that the
advantage a orded to the front-runner under the simultaneous system is less salient
in these cases. For front-runner advantages greater than the baseline ( > 1),
however, the sequential system outperforms the simultaneous system. This welfare
di erence, however, grows small as the advantage grows larger, re ecting the fact
that the front-runner is increasingly likely to win under either system.
    Figure 3 also provides additional interpretation for the small size of the docu-
mented welfare gain. As noted above, the welfare gain under the baseline is smaller
than the welfare gain when the advantage of the front-runner is small ( = 0 and
   = 0:5). Moreover, the welfare gain under the baseline is smaller in absolute
value than the welfare loss when the advantage of the front-runner takes on moder-
ately larger values (i.e. = f2; 3; 4g): This suggests that, at the baseline, the cost
and bene ts associated with a movement from sequential to simultaneous elections
nearly o set one another, and the welfare gain is thus relatively small.
    Finally, we examine whether a movement to the simultaneous system would ben-
e t all states, or whether some states would prefer to retain the sequential system.
In Figure 4, we plot the state-speci c gains from moving to the simultaneous sys-
tem by voting period. As shown, the rst four states to vote prefer the sequential
system, with the remaining states having a preference for the simultaneous system.
The higher payo among early states under the sequential system is driven by the
fact that their preferences are overweighted relative to the late states but is not
in uenced by the overweighting of their information.
    To summarize, the numerical analysis demonstrates that the counterfactual si-
multaneous system would have outperformed the sequential system in the context
of the 2004 Democratic presidential primary. While the simultaneous election overly
advantages the front-runner, this is outweighed by the fact that the sequential sys-
tem gives disproportionate weight to early states. In particular, the sequential
system gives too much weight to both early information, with signals of the rst
state having 45 times the weight of those of the last state, and to early preferences,
with those of the rst state having 9 times the weight of those of the last state.


                                         20
This is not a general result, however, in the sense that the sequential system tends
to dominate as the advantage of the front-runner grows larger. Moreover, a move-
ment to simultaneous would not represent a Pareto improvement as early states fare
better under sequential.


6        Conclusion
While this analysis is meant to be a realistic description of presidential primaries,
we have abstracted from several institutional details of these systems, and future
work could thus extend the model in interesting directions. First, we have assumed
that all candidates stay in the race for all states under the sequential system, but
in reality some candidates may drop out if they have a poor early performance. It
would be interesting to analyze an alternative model which incorporates candidate
exit under the sequential system. While our analysis abstracts from exit, allowing
for exit may give further disproportionate in uence to early states if voting returns
force candidates to exit from the race.
    Second, we have not allowed for endogenous candidate strategies, which may
di er between the two systems. For instance, in a sequential election, candidates
typically focus their campaign e orts on early states,3 and as a result candidates
may focus on issues that are important to voters in early states. By contrast, in a
simultaneous election, candidates may try to run on issues that are more likely to
have a broad appeal to the average primary voter. Further research could reveal
exactly how this a ects the trade-o between simultaneous elections and sequential
elections.
    To summarize, this paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of voter
welfare under simultaneous and sequential voting systems. Using a model of voting
and social learning, we rst show that neither the simultaneous nor the sequential
system achieves the all-public information welfare benchmark. While the simultane-
ous system has the advantage of equally weighing the information and preferences
of the di erent states, the sequential system has the advantage of allowing dark
horse candidates of unexpectedly high quality to emerge from the eld of candi-
dates. These results imply that the simultaneous system is welfare-preferred if the
front-runner is initially only thought of as a slightly better candidate, but the se-

    3
        This is noted in Knight and Schi (2010).

quential system is welfare-preferred if the front-runner is initially thought of as a
signi cantly stronger candidate. Focusing on the 2004 calendar and associated pool
of candidates, we then conduct an empirical welfare analysis. While the results sug-
gest that the simultaneous system outperforms the sequential system, the di erence
in welfare is relatively small.

7     Appendix
Proof of Proposition 2: The proof consists of three parts. First, we show that
! sim > ! seq . Second, we show that ! seq > ! public : Third, we show that P sim > P seq :
    Part 1: To show that ! sim > ! seq , we need the following condition to hold:

                                    1            1   > (1               2 )(1       1)


We rst use the fact that:
                                         1           1                    1
                                         2
                                             =          2
                                                            +        2= 2)          2
                                         2              1       (       1       +   "

can be re-written as:
                                                         2    2   2   2
                                         2               1 [( = 1 ) + " ]
                                         2   =          2       2   2    2
                                                        1 + ( = 1) + "

                                                          ( 2 = 21 )+ "2
Next, we use that fact that 1                1   =       2 +( 2 = 2 )+ 2        and substitute in above as follows:
                                                         1          1    "



                                                   2            2
                                                   2    =       1 (1       1)

                            2    2               2
Given that (1      2)   =   " =( "       +       2 ),   we thus have that:
                                                                           2
                                                                           "
                                    (1            2) =          2        2
                                                                                                                (27)
                                                                "   +    1 (1       1)

And, the RHS of the original condition is thus given by:
                                                                           2
                                                                           " (1          1)
                            (1           2 )(1              1) =        2      2
                                                                        " + 1 (1              1)

Plugging this into the original condition and using the de nition of                                 1,   we require
that:
                                 2          2
                                 "          " (1  1)
                              2+ 2
                                     >   2 + 2 (1
                              "    1     "      1    1)

Cross-multiplying and re-arranging, we require that:


                            2       2                                                2         2
                            "   +   1 (1               1)    > (1               1 )( "   +     1)
                                                        2                          2
                                                        "    > (1               1) "


                                                                26
which establishes the result.
   Part 2: To show that ! seq > ! public , we need the following condition to hold:

                                                                             0:5 "2              0:5 "2
              0:5(1        1)   + 0:5(1           2 )(1            1)   >                   +
                                                                            2 12 +      2
                                                                                        "       2 12 +    2
                                                                                                          "

                                                        2
   Since it is clear that (1             1)   >   2
                                                        "
                                                      2+ 2    , we only need that:
                                                      1   "


                                                                                2
                                                                                "
                                  (1          2 )(1           1)   >        2       2
                                                                        2   1   +   "

   Using the result from equation (27) of part 1, we need that:
                                         (1     1)                              1
                                    2       2
                                                                   >        2       2
                                    "    + 1 (1             1)          2   1   +   "

   Cross multiplying and re-arranging, we require that:
                                                                        2
                                               (1          1)           "
                                                                 >      2
                                                       1                1

   Using, the de nition of          1,   we require that:

                                          ( 2=        2
                                                      1)   +       2
                                                                   "
                                                                            2
                                                                            "
                                                       2
                                                                       >    2
                                                       1                    1

   which establishes the result.
   Part 3: Note that P = Pr(z > 0): Since z is normal with mean and standard
deviation z , we have that P = ( / z ): Thus, to show that P sim > P seq , we only
need to show that zseq > zsim . First, note that z2 can be written as follows:

        2                           2 2                 2                 2 2                     2             2 2
        z   = [!(   A)   + !(   B )] q    + [!(       A)      + !(      B) ] "      + [!(       A)    + !(    B) ]


To establish the result, we show that each of the three components of z2 are higher
under the sequential system. Since we have previously shown that !( ) is higher
under simultaneous and given that !( A )+!( B ) = 1 !( ), it follows that [!( A )+
!( B )]2 is higher under sequential than under simultaneous. The second component
is also larger under sequential than simultaneous since !( s )2 is convex in !( s ) and
since !( A ) + !( B ) is higher under sequential than simultaneous. Finally, the third
component is larger under sequential than simultaneous since !( A ) is higher under
sequential than simultaneous and since !( B ) = 0:5 under both systems.

                                                           27
Proof of Proposition 3: Since z = !( A ) A + !( B ) B + !( ) + !( A ) A +
!( B ) B , we have z = (!( A ) + !( B ))q + !( ) + !( A ) A + !( B ) B + !( A ) A +
!( B ) B . Combining this with the fact that y = q+ 21 A + 12 B shows that Cov(y; z) =
(!( A ) + !( B )) 12 + 12 (!( A ) + !( B )) 2 .
                             (!( A )+!( B )) 12 + 21 (!( A )+!( B )) 2
   Thus y;z = p                     2 2         2          2 2         2 2 2
                                                                             , where y denotes
                            y   (!(   A )+!( B ))     1 +[!( A )   +!(   B)   ]   " +[!( A )    +!( B ) ]
                                                                                               1
the standard deviation of the random variable y = q +                                          2 A
                                                                                                    + 12 B .
   By substituting in the appropriate values for !( A ), !(                                          B ),   !(   A ),   and !(       B ),
                                 2 1 2
we then see that sim
                  y;z =
                          p 2 12 1 +1 22 1 2 2 and

ence between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the inequality in (3) is

the inequality in (4) holds, and from this it follows that                                                 y;z > y;z .

Proof of Proposition 4: First note that in the limit as                                                        1    ! 0,             ! [       y;z
 seq
 y;z ] y (0) > 0. Thus     > 0 for su ciently small values of                                                  1.
