The Effect of Medicare Part D on Pharmaceutical Prices and Utilization

                                              ABSTRACT

On January 1, 2006, the federal government began providing insurance coverage for Medicare recipients'
prescription drug expenditures through a new program known as Medicare Part D. Rather than setting
pharmaceutical prices itself, the government contracted with private insurance plans to provide this
coverage. Enrollment in Part D was voluntary, with each Medicare recipient allowed to choose from
one of the private insurers with a contract to offer coverage in her geographic region. This paper evaluates
the effect of this program on the price and utilization of pharmaceutical treatments. Theoretically,
it is ambiguous whether the expansion in insurance coverage would increase or reduce pharmaceutical
prices. Insurance-induced reductions in demand elasticities would predict an increase in pharmaceutical
firms' optimal prices. However, Part D plans could potentially negotiate price discounts through their
ability to influence the market share of specific treatments. Using data on product-specific prices and
quantities sold in each year in the U.S., our findings indicate that Part D substantially lowered the
average price and increased the total utilization of prescription drugs by Medicare recipients. Our
results further suggest that the magnitude of these average effects varies across drugs as predicted
by economic theory.

I. Introduction

        Health care expenditures currently account for 16 percent of gross domestic product in the U.S.,

with this share projected to increase to more than 20 percent by 2016 (Poisal et al, 2007) and to 35

percent by 2035 (CBO, 2007). Almost half of this spending is accounted for by federal, state, and local

governments, primarily through large-scale health insurance programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and

the Veterans Health Administration (CMS, 2007).

        The price that the government pays (either directly or indirectly) to providers for any health care

treatment will influence both the number of individuals who use the treatment and firms’ incentives to

develop potential new substitutes. If a price is suboptimally high, there can be over-utilization of the

treatment, with physicians and other health care providers potentially inducing the demand of consumers

(Evans, 1974), who are likely to be imperfectly informed about the treatment’s effect (Arrow, 1963).

Similarly, a price that is too high can lead to inefficiently high amounts of research and development

(Garber et al, 2006). The reverse would be true with respect to both treatment utilization and innovation

incentives if a price was suboptimally low.

        For several reasons, these issues are especially relevant for pharmaceutical treatments. First, the

vast majority of prescription drug expenditures are accounted for by products with patent protection,

which limits the sort of standard competition that reduces prices. Second, because the pharmaceutical

industry has low marginal costs and sunk fixed costs, the government is not constrained by the exit of

providers from the market should it set too low a price (in contrast to the case of a physician, for

example).1 The effect of pharmaceutical prices on most consumers’ incentives is limited because health

insurance partially or fully insulates them (Manning et al, 1987). And finally, physicians both have the

agency problems as discussed above, and are likely to be unaware of market prices of pharmaceutical

products. These forces potentially result in pharmaceutical prices that are not tightly linked to demand.

 Frank and Newhouse (2007) use the phrase “pennies a pill” to describe marginal costs while Dimasi et al (200?)
estimate the average cost of bringing a new drug to market at $802 million.


                                                        2
         Prescription drug expenditures represent the most rapidly growing component of health care

spending, increasing from 5 percent of health care spending in 1980 to more than 10 percent by 2005

(CMS, 2007). Further, almost 60 percent of all prescriptions in the U.S. are filled for beneficiaries of

Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs. The adoption of government procurement schemes

that create appropriate market forces to shift the pharmaceutical industry to a more efficient outcome is

therefore critically important both to government expenditure and to continuing technological progress.

        In this paper, we show that the institutions and mechanisms used by the government to purchase

prescription drugs can strongly affect market outcomes. By institutions, we have in mind large buyer

groups, incentives for patients to consume certain products, and the development and use of formularies.

A formulary is a formal mechanism that allows a buyer to identify a therapeutically–similar product as a

viable substitute for a patented product. When bargaining with the seller of a patented product, the ability

to shift demand to a substitute drug is a powerful negotiating tool.

        Our paper provides evidence for what we consider a surprising outcome: moving consumers

from cash-paying status to insured status lowers optimal prices for branded prescription drugs. This is

surprising because the standard effect of insurance is to create inelastic demand and therefore stimulate

higher prices from a seller with market power (Duggan and Scott Morton, 2006). However, the insurers

that we study bundle insurance with a formulary and other mechanisms to create elastic demand. Our

evidence leads us to conclude that the formulary and other mechanisms perform the special role of

allowing buyers to move market share among drugs with patent protection, thereby raising cross-price

elasticities, and lowering purchase prices for branded drugs. This result contrasts with the common

intuition that an uninsured consumer, paying at the margin for her own purchases, is the best tool with

which to create competition in the market and impose pricing discipline on sellers. Certainly, this is at

least part of the rationale behind many current policies in healthcare such as tax-free healthcare savings

accounts (Cogan et al, 2005). Our evidence suggests that this picture is incomplete; for maximum effect,

the consumer also needs to be part of a group that can substitute one provider for another.




                                                      3
           Our setting is the recent significant increase in government intervention in the pharmaceutical

industry represented by Medicare Part D. For the first forty years of its existence after its creation in

1965, the Medicare program provided virtually no coverage for beneficiaries’ prescription drug costs

outside of treatments administered in a doctor’s office or hospital.2 But as prescription drug expenditures

increased more rapidly than other health care spending during the last few decades, the political pressure

built for Medicare to cover prescription drugs. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug

Improvement and Modernization Act created Medicare Part D, which would begin providing coverage for

prescription drug costs in January of 2006 for those Medicare recipients who chose to enroll.

           Part D is the largest expansion of Medicare since the program’s inception and has been projected

to cost $780 billion over its first ten years (2006-15). This feature alone made the program controversial

at the outset. Not only is Part D a very large entitlement program, it significantly expands the role of the

government as a buyer of prescription pharmaceuticals. Governments outside the US use their power as

large buyers to pay relatively low prices for new, patent-protected medications. In contrast, Part D is set

up so that the government does not directly purchase drugs, but rather subsidizes participating private

prescription drug plans (PDPs), which then negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.

           One of the central criticisms of this legislation was that it would lead to higher prices than if the

federal government used its negotiating power on behalf of program participants to bargain for lower

prices. Part D can also be contrasted to Parts A and B of Medicare, in which the Centers for Medicare and

Medicaid Services (CMS) sets prices for each covered service3 and reimburses providers directly per

service; in Part D, CMS pays the participating plan a lump-sum per enrollee and has no control over the

prices paid to manufacturers by the plan or charged to enrollees by the plan. Instead, the legislation

creates competition among plans for the business of enrollees, which is intended to drive drug prices and

premiums to competitive levels. Each Medicare recipient can choose between the plans offered in her area

based on the drugs covered, the prices of those drugs, the monthly premium, and other plan parameters.

    Hospital inpatient reimbursement in Part A depends both on the patient’s diagnosis and on the treatment.

         In the empirical work below, we investigate the effect of Medicare Part D on the price and

utilization of branded pharmaceutical treatments. Theoretically, the program could either increase or

reduce prices paid to pharmaceutical companies. On the one hand, once enrolled in Part D, enrollees who

had previously been uninsured would have a lower elasticity of demand than before, leading to an

increase in the manufacturers’ profit-maximizing prices for drugs with market power.4 On the other hand,

Part D plans could exclude certain treatments from their formulary or steer their enrollees away from

certain treatments in response to the prices of those treatments, which a cash-paying individual could not

typically do on her own. This could give these plans a strong lever with which to negotiate price

reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers.

         We are also interested in the effect of the program on utilization.5 In addition to any ex-

manufacturer price effect, the insurance provided by Part D would lower beneficiaries’ out of pocket

prices, and therefore affect utilization (Gibson et al, 2005).

         Our estimation strategy exploits variation across branded drugs in their Medicare market shares to

estimate the effect of Part D on pharmaceutical prices and utilization. We measure this drug-specific

share using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Our key identifying assumption is that a

treatment’s Medicare market share is orthogonal to other unobserved factors that affect the change in

average prices or total utilization. With this assumption, we model the effect of Part D on the change in

average prices or utilization as a function of the pre-policy Medicare market share.

         Our first set of results strongly suggests that Medicare Part D led to a substantial relative decline

in average branded pharmaceutical prices.6 In other words, moving consumers into Medicare Part D plans

significantly reduced the per dose price paid to manufacturers. More specifically, our findings suggest

that each 10 percentage point increase in the pre-policy Medicare market share is associated with a 1.2-

1.4 percent decline in a drug’s average price increase relative to that of other drugs. If one assumes that

5
  Recent research by Yin et al (2008) and Lichtenberg and Sun (2007) suggests that Part D did increase utilization,
though the authors of both studies utilize data from just one pharmacy chain to estimate this.
6
  Pharmaceutical prices trend upwards throughout our period, but the impact of Part D is to reduce the increase.


                                                          5
all Medicare recipients enroll in Part D, this suggests a reduction of 12-14 percent caused by this group.

However, the actual impact of Part D enrollees is almost twice as large given that approximately half of

Medicare recipients either kept their existing prescription drug insurance coverage or elected to remain

uninsured. Our estimates imply that an enrollee who moves from paying cash to buying through Medicare

Part D pays 24% less for branded prescriptions before the mechanical effects of the insurance itself are

taken into account.

        Additionally, our estimates reveal the effect is driven by the consumption of drugs by Medicare

recipients without insurance before Part D. It appears to be the movement of Medicare recipients from

cash-paying uninsured status to insured under a plan that causes the decline in per unit prices. The most

plausible mechanism driving this result is not the insurance per se, but the activities of the insurer.

Enrollees join plans that can create competition for patented brands by identifying therapeutic substitutes,

and creating incentives to switch to those substitutes (known as “moving market share”). An individual

consumer typically does not have the knowledge of which drugs are acceptable therapeutic substitutes;

the consumer’s physician typically has poor knowledge of prices, especially negotiated prices; and any

one consumer is too small a share of demand to negotiate with a pharmaceutical company.

        A prescription drug plan can potentially surmount all three of these hurdles. The plan develops a

formulary, which is a list of drugs the plan “prefers” due to their therapeutic and cost profiles. The plan

encourages consumption of preferred drugs with either rules (prior authorization) or prices such as

smaller copayments. A pharmaceutical firm has an incentive to sell its brand at a lower price in exchange

for the market share the plan can deliver.

        However, for a small subset of “protected” therapeutic classes (such as HIV antiretrovirals) and

for classes with just one or two brands, plans would not be able to do this because legislation required

them to cover all drugs in the class. Consistent with this prediction, our analyses show that prices do not

decline in relative terms for brands with limited substitutes.

        Combining our results with the mechanical effect of Part D on out-of-pocket prices, we expect

that the average cost of prescription drugs for an uninsured Medicare recipient with average prescription


                                                       6
drug spending fell substantially.7 In light of this, it is not surprising that our results suggest a substantial

increase in utilization among Medicare-intensive drugs, although our estimated coefficients for utilization

are not as precise as are those for prices.

        The outline of the paper is as follows. In section two we provide background on the Medicare

program and on key features of Part D. In section three we develop a model that considers the effect of

Part D on pharmaceutical firms’ profit-maximizing prices. Section four describes our data and the

construction of our sample of drugs. In the next two sections we specify our empirical framework,

summarize our main results, and describe how our estimates vary across therapeutic categories. The final

section concludes.



II. Background on the Medicare Program and Part D

        A. Medicare Parts A, B, and C

        The federal government’s Medicare program currently provides health insurance to more than 43

million elderly and disabled U.S. residents (SSA, 2007). This program primarily covers the cost of

hospital inpatient and outpatient care as well as physician services, home health care, and some long-term

care. Beneficiaries share in the cost of this care through deductibles, copays, and a monthly premium; 85

percent of beneficiaries are in the fee-for-service version of Medicare.8 While the program began as

health insurance for the elderly, the eligibility criteria for the program were expanded in 1973. At that

time recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits were allowed to enroll in the

program following a two-year waiting period from the onset of their disability.9 By 2005 approximately

84 percent of Medicare enrollees were age 65 or older and the rest received Medicare through their SSDI

enrollment (SSA, 2006).


7
  Lichtenberg (2007) uses data from one pharmacy chain to estimate the effect of Part D on the number of
prescriptions and on out-of-pocket spending. His results suggest large reductions in out-of-pocket costs, though he
does not distinguish between mechanical effects of the plan co-pays and a change in gross pharmaceutical prices.
8
  The remaining beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare HMOs, which bear risk by accepting capitated payments.
9
  Recipients of Railroad Retirement benefits and those with end stage renal disease were also made eligible, though
they accounted for a much smaller number of Medicare recipients


                                                         7
        The design of Part A and Part B has remained similar throughout Medicare’s existence.10 Health

care providers are paid a fixed amount for each service provided to recipients that depends on the

patient’s treatment and/or diagnosis. Thousands of fee-for-service prices must therefore be set by CMS,

and then periodically updated. Both Parts A and B include substantial cost-sharing so that recipients

contribute to the cost of their medical care. For example, Part A requires the payment of a deductible for

each hospital admission while Part B incorporates both an annual deductible and a twenty percent co-pay

for covered services.

        Beginning in 1982, Medicare recipients could alternatively choose to receive their health care

coverage through a Medicare HMO or similar managed care plan. In contrast to Parts A and B, these

managed care providers are paid a fixed risk-adjusted amount per recipient per month that is independent

of care delivered and thus bear financial risk for the costs of their enrollees’ medical care. Plans are

required to cover a certain level of services, though they have the option to provide additional benefits as

well. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 changed the name of this part of the program to Medicare Part C,

but its current name is Medicare Advantage.



        B. Medicare Part D

        While Medicare has provided coverage for the costs of hospital care, physician services, and

many other types of medical care since its inception in 1965, the program provided very little coverage

for prescription drugs until recently. Only those pharmaceutical treatments administered in a physician’s

office or other institutional setting were covered by the program. This omission took on added

significance during the 1990s and early 2000s when prescription drug expenditures were growing twice as

rapidly as all other health care spending (Duggan, 2005). According to data from the Medical

Expenditure Panel Survey, per-person expenditures among Medicare recipients for prescription drugs




10
  One important change was the switch in 1984 to a DRG-based system of hospital reimbursement (Cutler, 1995),
in which hospital payments depended on both diagnosis and treatment.


                                                      8
were equal to $1789 in 2003, with more than half of this paid out-of-pocket and just 7.8 percent paid for

by the Medicare program.

        Perhaps partly as a result of this growth in pharmaceutical spending, the U.S. Congress passed the

Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act in December of 2003. While there

were several components to this legislation, the most important feature was the creation of Medicare Part

D, which would provide insurance coverage for prescription drug costs to Medicare recipients who

voluntarily enrolled in the program beginning in January of 2006. This legislation also created the

Medicare Discount Drug Card program, which took effect in early 2004 and was designed to help

Medicare recipients receive discounts on their prescriptions during the two-year window prior to the

commencement of Part D.

        In contrast to Parts A and B of the program, Part D benefits are provided through one of two

types of private insurance plans.11 The first type, known as a prescription drug plan (PDP), provides

coverage only for prescription drug costs while Medicare Advantage plans (MA-PD) insure all Medicare-

covered services, including hospital care and physician services as well as prescription drugs. A plan

sponsor contracts with CMS to offer a plan in one (or more) of the 34 defined regions of the US.

        Plans are allowed to develop a formulary that excludes certain drugs from coverage, though they

are required to have at least two drugs on the formulary for each therapeutic class.12 Furthermore, a plan

cannot exclude treatments from any of six protected classes (e.g. HIV antiretrovirals, cancer drugs) from

the formulary. The actuarial value of the benefits offered by a plan must be at least as generous as those

specified in the 2003 MMA legislation. In the 2006 calendar year this included a deductible of $250, a 25

percent co-pay for the next $2000 in spending, no coverage for the next $2850 (this is often referred to as

the “donut hole”), and a 5 percent co-pay once out-of-pocket expenditures reach $3600. These figures

change annually and are displayed graphically in Figure 1.



11
   For a detailed discussion please see Duggan, Healy, and Scott Morton (2008).
12
   See Huskamp et al (2003) for evidence on the effect of formularies on consumers’ utilization of pharmaceutical
treatments. The findings suggest that formularies can substantially alter treatment patterns.


                                                         9
         Plans are financed through a combination of enrollee monthly premiums and subsidies from the

federal government. Before the start of the year, each PDP and MA-PD must submit an estimate to CMS

of the plan’s average monthly revenue requirement for providing the basic benefit during the upcoming

year. This plan bid would include not only prescription drug expenditures by the plan but also

administrative costs and plan profits. These bids are then used to calculate a national average bid, which

is multiplied by a certain percentage (34 percent in 2007) to calculate the base monthly premium paid by

enrollees. If a plan’s bid differs from the average bid, its monthly premium will differ from the base

premium by the same dollar amount. Thus if a plan increases its bid (costs) by one dollar, its government

subsidy does not change and its monthly premium increases by one dollar.13 This stimulates price

competition at the margin because plans with low bids (costs) offer enrollees lower premiums.

         To enroll in Part D, a Medicare recipient can choose among those PDPs and MA-PDs offered in

her region of the country. When making this choice, a Medicare recipient would presumably consider

the plan’s monthly premium, the drugs included on the plan’s formulary, the prices of those drugs, and

service.14 To encourage current Medicare recipients to enroll in Part D early in 2006, monthly premiums

increased by 1 percent for each month that a person delayed beyond May of that year. Thus even an

individual with zero expected prescription drug costs during the coming year might enroll in the program

to keep her future premiums low.

         Medicare recipients with incomes below a certain level or who are dually enrolled in the

Medicaid program are eligible for subsidies for their PDP monthly premiums. Medicaid recipients are

required to enroll in a Part D plan and receive the largest possible premium subsidy. If they choose a plan

with average or below average costs, they pay no premium at all. Medicaid recipients also have no

deductible or coverage gap and their copayments are heavily subsidized. Other Medicare recipients with



13
   A portion of each plan’s subsidy is based on enrollee characteristics and thus to the extent that premium changes
influence the composition of beneficiaries it can influence plan subsidies. Also if a plan’s costs diverge by more
than 2.5 percent from their bid the government shares in the profit or the loss. See Merliss (2007) and Duggan,
Healy, and Scott Morton (2008) for more details on the bidding process.
14
   See Lucarelli and Simon (2007) for an examination of the determinants of plans’ monthly premiums.


                                                         10
incomes below the poverty line receive similarly large subsidies, with these subsidies phased out linearly

for those with incomes between 100 and 135 percent of the federal poverty line.

           By January of 2007, there were 17.3 million PDP enrollees and 6.7 million MA-PD enrollees.

This information is summarized in Appendix Table 1. Approximately 36 percent of PDP enrollees were

automatically enrolled in a PDP because they were also on Medicaid (6.3 million) and an additional 2.2

million were eligible for low-income subsidies because they had incomes at or below 135 percent of the

poverty line.

           To reduce the likelihood that Part D would crowd out15 existing prescription drug coverage to

retired workers by their former firms, CMS subsidized those firms that continued to provide this

insurance. To qualify for the subsidy, a firm’s coverage had to be at least as generous as the standard

benefit described above. In January of 2007 there were 6.9 million Medicare recipients whose coverage

was subsidized in this way. An additional 8.2 million Medicare recipients had coverage from some other

source, such as an existing employer, the VA, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits program.

           Given the significance of the changes in insurance coverage described above, and the particular

structure of drug procurement for this program, it seems plausible that Medicare Part D had an impact on

prices and quantities in the pharmaceutical sector. The next section presents an illustrative model to

consider the mechanisms through which these effects would be likely to operate.



III. Theoretical Model

           Here we provide some intuition and a formal illustration of the pricing changes that

pharmaceutical manufacturers will find optimal upon commencement of Part D. As a first approximation

of the environment, and because entry is fairly easy, we will assume that the market for Part D plans is

perfectly competitive. Plans set prices and service levels to attract consumers and also bargain with

manufacturers to buy drugs. In every region in the US there are at least 27 plans competing for local Part



15
     See Cutler and Gruber (1996) for an examination of the crowdout effects of Medicaid eligibility expansions.


                                                           11
D enrollees. While the market is more concentrated than this number would suggest16, we will

nevertheless abstract from the issue of whether plans have market power in the current paper, though this

represents an important topic for future research.

        Given that plans are effectively not setting the market price for a patented brand, it is the brand’s

manufacturer which is choosing prices before and after the Part D program. We assume throughout the

paper that generic drugs are competitively supplied. In our data, which we describe in more detail below,

we observe an average price derived from invoice prices across all sales except long term care and

hospitals; loosely speaking, all retail sales including mail order. This is comprised of sales to Medicare

Part D enrollees, other Medicare recipients, Medicaid enrollees, private insurance customers, cash-paying

customers, and all other consumers. Each of these types of buyers could purchase her drugs at the same

pharmacy, but the customer’s price and the pharmacy’s reimbursement would be determined by the set of

contracts in place for that buyer’s insurance scheme.

        For simplicity, assume that all Medicare enrollees have no coverage prior to Part D and must pay

cash for their prescription drugs. Further assume that all of them enroll when the plan begins. Consider a

linear differentiated products demand curve for product i (possibly) facing therapeutic substitutes j as in

Deneckere and Davidson (1985) or Shubik (1980):

                                                    j                 (1)




Here, consumers within a group are identical with valuation V for a product i. pi is the price of drug i, N is

the total number of products in the therapeutic area market, and qi is the quantity demanded of drug i.

Additionally, γg≥0 is the substitutability parameter for a customer group g while αg is the parameter

measuring the elasticity of demand of the customer group, g.


16
  The top three plans (UHC-Pacificare, Humana Inc., and Wellpoint, Inc.) accounted for 50 percent of Part D
enrollment in 2006 (Merliss, 2007).


                                                        12
         These latter two parameters will change when the members of the group move from cash

payment to Part D enrollment. First, when this group paid cash for prescription drugs, its members were

not able to create effective price competition between molecules by threatening to switch to a therapeutic

substitute. This is because a single physician and consumer, even if they are aware of prices, cannot offer

to move their demand in response to a discount under the current system of posted prices at drugstores.

However, PDPs can do exactly this to determine which of several substitutes j they will purchase. The

result of the change in institutional structure is an increase in the substitutability parameter γg.

         Optimal prices for firms (with marginal costs equal to c) are



                          ⎛ N −1⎞
               Vi + c(γ g ⎜       ⎟ +αg )
          pi =            ⎝  N ⎠                                         (2)
                                N −1
                   2α g + γ g (      )
                                 N



As γg rises, it can be shown that the optimal price for drug i falls (provided of course that the consumers’

valuation Vi exceeds the marginal cost of production c). A second effect of moving from cash payment to

a Part D plan is a change in the impact of price on demand. This group is now subsidized at

approximately 75% of the cost of the drug benefit in the main coverage region.17 αg falls as the level of

price that causes the consumer to drop out of the market (buy zero units) declines. The optimal price

increases with a decline in αg.18 As such, there are two effects working in opposite directions, and it is

thus ultimately an empirical question which dominates.

         The private pay consumers and the remaining cash-paying consumers do not experience either of

these structural changes upon the implementation of Part D. 19 If the average price that we measure in the


17
   As described above, the subsidy depends on an enrollee’s total prescription drug expenditures. An individual in
the first coverage area shares in just 25 percent of the cost whereas one in the “donut hole” bears the full cost and
someone in the catastrophic region bears just 5 percent.
18
   In this case, the condition V>c+1 provides the result.
19
   We cannot rule out the existence of some effect on the price to privately insured customers. For example, if the
same health insurer is covering both Part D and other customers, then the increase in their enrollment may
strengthen their bargaining power with pharmaceutical firms. However in our empirical work below, this would


                                                          13
data were comprised of only two groups, privately insured and cash/PartD, we would see a change at the

implementation of Part D that is equal to:



                                                                 cash / partD
         Δ pi = siprivate Δpi             + sicash / PartD Δpi
                                private

                                     cash / partD
                                                                                             (3)
         Δ pi = sicash / PartD Δpi



The first term is zero because there is no change in the optimal price for private patients due to Part D.

The change in the average price of drug i across all consumers will depend on the fraction of that drug

purchased by cash-paying but Part D eligible consumers as well as the change in price those consumers

pay. In our data we will have a measure of total revenues and units sold for each treatment in each year,

which allows us to calculate the average realized price per unit. Our regression methodology will

estimate the determinants of the price change. Note that the prices we use in our estimation are not the

posted prices at the drugstore but the revenues of each drug divided by units sold from invoice data.

         There is one possible spillover between Part D and the private market which might cause private

price changes to be non-zero in equation (3). When dual eligibles move from Medicaid to Medicare, they

shift from purchasing through a fairly inelastic purchaser (the state) to a more elastic purchaser (the

PDP).20 Because the inelastic Medicaid demand pays whatever market price is chosen by the

manufacturer, a reduction in Medicaid demand might lower the optimal price for the brand in the private

market (see Duggan and Scott Morton, 2006). If a drug’s dual share is zero, the equation above holds. We

can measure the share of prescriptions dispensed to duals for each drug in our sample, so we will be able

to explicitly take this effect into account for drugs with substantial dual shares.

         According to Part D regulations, there are six “protected” therapeutic classes in which PDPs must

be less aggressive with their formularies than in other therapeutic areas. All products in the HIV, anti-


tend to bias against our finding a large effect of Part D, as the spillover effect would be decreasing in the Medicare
market share.
20
   It is worth noting that many states were negotiating for supplemental rebates based on state-level Medicaid
formularies by 2005, so they are not completely unresponsive to price.


                                                                         14
cancer, anticonvulsant, immunosuppressant, antipsychotic, and antidepressant categories must be

included in all Part D formularies. While a PDP cannot exclude any drug in these categories, it can create

financial incentives or administrative hurdles to affect a patient’s choice of drug. However, dual eligibles

consume protected drugs disproportionately and do not face significant financial incentives given their

additional subsidies. Thus the PDP has lost two of its important tools to affect brand choice in these

classes. We do not know whether the restrictions applied to these classes have a measurable impact on the

behavior of PDPs because in the first year of the program it was not clear how much CMS would oversee

formularies. If restrictions are binding, their effect will be to reduce Part D’s effect on the substitutability

among drugs (lower γg) and therefore reduce the PDP’s ability to extract manufacturer discounts.

        Similarly, CMS required that all PDPs include at least two drugs in each therapeutic class and at

least one in each Formulary Key Drug Type (FKDT), which is a finer category than class. Any

class/FKDT with only one or two brands in it will create a challenge for PDPs bargaining for low prices.

The CMS regulations limit the PDP’s ability to substitute away from drugs in the class, and presumably

the manufacturers of these drugs are aware of their market power. We expect that drugs in these two

situations (protected or “small” categories) will have small or negligible change in γg. We modify our

specification to allow for different effects for drugs in this less competitive environment.



                            cash / partD                cash / partD
         Δ p i = s i Δp i                  + s i Δp i                  * Ι SubstLimited   (4)



        Taken together, our model suggests an ambiguous effect of Medicare Part D on average

pharmaceutical prices, with the sign depending on whether the policy-induced reduction in the elasticity

of demand more than offsets any plan-induced increase in substitutability across treatments. This latter

effect should be less important for brands in one of the six protected therapeutic categories and for those

brands that are one of just one or two treatments in a class/FKDT.




                                                                               15
         And to the extent that Part D reduces Medicare recipients’ out-of-pocket costs, it should lead to

an increase in the utilization that is increasing in the treatment’s Medicare market share. We will test for

an expansion of demand for “daily doses” in the empirical section of the paper. We now turn to an

examination of these issues using data on prices, quantities, and total sales for large-revenue branded

pharmaceutical treatments both before and after the enactment of Medicare Part D.



IV. Data and Constructing the Analysis Sample

         A. IMS Health

         To estimate the impact of Medicare Part D on our outcome variables of interest, we begin by

merging together data from two sources. The first was obtained from IMS Health and contains data on

total sales (excluding those to hospitals and long term care) in the U.S. for all pharmaceutical products in

each year from 2001 to 2006. The data also contains the number of standardized units of the product that

were sold and the average number of units per daily dose in each year. This allows us to calculate the

average price per day and the number of daily doses in each year for each product. According to our IMS

data, total sales increased from $162.6 billion in 2001 to $223.9 billion in 2006.21

         Each pharmaceutical product is assigned to one of fourteen major therapeutic categories.22 The

top three major categories accounted for 51.3 percent of U.S. sales in 2006 and include drugs used to treat

central nervous system disorders, cardiovascular conditions, and conditions of the alimentary tract. The

data are further divided into 260 subclasses23, with cholesterol reducers, antiulcerants, and antidepressants

accounting for the most sales in 2006.

         A related issue that we confront in the IMS data is that there are often multiple products for the

same drug. For example, in 2006 there are four different versions of the drug Prevacid that have strictly

21
   Expenditure figures cited here and elsewhere in the paper are adjusted to 2006 dollars using the Bureau of Labor
Statistics’ Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U).
22
   In some cases a product is assigned to more than one category, presumably because it can be used to treat more
than one condition. For these products, the data allows us to determine sales by category for the product. More
specifically, if a product has $200 in sales in category A and $100 in sales in category B, the data would include two
separate observations. By aggregating all observations for each product we can determine total product sales.
23
   These do not correspond perfectly with the categories that CMS uses to evaluate Part D plans.


                                                         16
positive sales. In this case and related ones we aggregate sales for all versions of the same drug in each

year. When doing this, we do not include any sales for generic competitors as the focus of the current

study is on branded drugs that currently have, or previously had, patent protection.



        B. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey

        Our second main source of data is the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a publicly available

data set that is constructed annually by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). In

carrying out this survey, AHRQ collects data on demographic characteristics, insurance coverage, health

care utilization, and many other variables for a nationally representative sample of the civilian non-

institutionalized population residing in the U.S. The survey is divided into several files with, for

example, one focusing on hospital inpatient care and another on emergency room visits.

        The file that is particularly relevant for the current study is the Prescribed Medicines file, which

provides information on household-reported prescriptions that were filled during the year. For each

reported prescription this file lists the drug name, the total amount paid, the amount paid out-of-pocket

and separately by each of ten possible sources of insurance, a person-level identifier, and a person-level

weight. In the 2003 MEPS data (the same year in which the Medicare Modernization Act was signed into

law), there are 304,324 prescriptions reported by 20,475 individuals. According to this survey data, the

top four drugs ranked in terms of 2003 sales are Lipitor, Zocor, Prevacid, and Nexium, which exactly

corresponds with the top four in 2003 from our IMS data described above.

        Using the person-level identifier, this data on the utilization of prescription drugs can then be

linked to the MEPS Full Year Consolidated Data File (CDF), which includes the person’s age along with

information about her health insurance coverage in each month during the year. The 2003 CDF includes

information for 34,215 individuals. Comparing this to the number of individuals in the Prescribed

Medicines file, there are no prescriptions reported for 40 percent of the individuals in the sample.

        One question summarized in the CDF portion of the survey asks whether the respondent was ever

enrolled in Medicare during the 2003 calendar year. The weighted fraction answering yes to this question


                                                     17
is 14.4 percent, which not surprisingly given the eligibility criteria described above is much greater

among those aged 65 and up (98.8 percent) than among the non-elderly (2.2 percent). Figure 2

summarizes the relationship between age and Medicare enrollment for individuals aged 40 or older. As

the figure shows, the fraction on Medicare increases relatively smoothly with age among the non-elderly

because of the increasing rates of SSDI enrollment. This fraction then increases sharply from 15 percent

at the age of 64 to 96 percent at age 65.

        Medicare recipients have substantially greater utilization of prescription drugs than their

counterparts not in the program. According to the MEPS, the average number of prescriptions in 2003

among Medicare recipients was 28.0 versus just 6.5 for those not in the program. Because of this, the

fraction of prescriptions accounted for by beneficiaries of this program (40.3 percent) is almost three

times greater than their share of the population (14.4 percent).

        The Prescribed Medicines file also has information on the source of payment for each

prescription. The first column of Table 1 summarizes this information for all prescriptions while columns

2 and 3 differentiate between those with and without Medicare coverage, respectively. As the first row of

the table demonstrates, the total amount paid for the average prescription is approximately $69.48 during

this year, with the average slightly higher for Medicare prescriptions ($69.90). Medicare recipients paid

approximately 51 percent of the cost out-of-pocket while those not on Medicare paid substantially less at

41 percent. The table also reveals that Medicare recipients received much less coverage from private

insurers in that year (20 versus 45 percent) but this was partially made up for by greater coverage from

Medicaid, the VA, and Medicare. Recall that Medicare did cover the cost for certain prescription drugs

such as cancer treatments in this time period.

        The model developed in Section 3 suggests that an important source of variation across drugs in

the impact of Medicare Part D is the fraction of individuals taking the drug who were eligible for Part D

prior to its enactment and subsequently may have enrolled in it. According to the 2003 MEPS, this

variation is substantial. For example Zoloft, an anti-depressant drug that is ranked 5th in terms of sales in

the IMS data, has a Medicare market share (MMS) of 27.1 percent. The corresponding value for Plavix,


                                                     18
which is used primarily by those at risk of heart attack or stroke and was ranked 16th in terms of sales in

that same year, is 72.9 percent.24



         C. Constructing the Analysis Sample

         The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act was signed into law on

December 8, 2003. However, Medicare Part D did not begin operation until more than two years later in

January of 2006. During that interim period, the federal government created the Medicare Discount Drug

Card Program. One stated goal of this program was to aid Medicare recipients in receiving lower prices

for their prescriptions. Thus MMA may have influenced both pharmaceutical prices and utilization before

Part D took effect in 2006. In addition, if the optimal price for a drug was going to change significantly

upon the initiation of Part D, a manufacturer may have wanted to adjust the drug’s price gradually over

time so as to avoid the publicity associated with a sharp price change. We therefore use 2003 as our base

year when estimating the effect of the program.

         We focus initially on the top 1000 drugs in the IMS data according to their 2003 sales, which

account for 97.2 percent of the $196.0 billion in total sales in that same year. In constructing this sample,

we took care to combine all versions of the same drug. Thus in the example above, sales and utilization

for all four versions of Prevacid would be aggregated into one drug. We then drop the 113 products that

are available over the counter in 2006, as these drugs would not be covered by Medicare Part D plans and

would also rarely appear in the MEPS Prescribed Medicines file that we use to construct Medicare market

shares. Thus a drug such as Tylenol, which ranked 86 in terms of 2003 sales in our initial sample of 1000

drugs, is not included in our analysis sample.

         We next drop the 194 remaining drugs that are generic, given that there will typically be many

manufacturers for each of these drugs and these firms would have significantly less pricing power. We


24
  These shares are equal to the weighted fraction of a drug’s prescriptions that are for individuals enrolled in
Medicare at some point in 2003. One could alternatively calculate this as the weighted fraction of a drug’s
spending, which for Zoloft and Plavix would be .278 and .736, respectively. The correlation between these two
shares for the 769 drugs out of the top 1000 that appear in the 2003 MEPS is 0.975.


                                                         19
will not ignore generic drugs in our analysis however, as we will control for the presence of generic

competition for the brand drugs remaining in our sample. The exclusion of generic and over-the-counter

products leaves us with a sample of 693 drugs that currently or previously enjoyed patent protection, with

these treatments accounting for $170 billion of the $196 billion (86.7 percent) in 2003 spending in our

IMS data.

        We then merge this IMS data on sales and utilization in each year from 2001 to 2006 to the

MEPS data on Medicare market shares. To increase our precision in measuring drug-specific Medicare

market shares and related explanatory variables of interest, we utilize both the 2002 and 2003 versions of

the MEPS Prescribed Medicines file.25 Of the 693 products remaining in our sample, 125 do not appear

in either the 2002 or the 2003 MEPS.26 One important reason for this is that the MEPS does not include

prescriptions that are administered in a physician’s office or in some other institutional setting. Thus the

drug Remicade, which is ranked 39th in total IMS sales and is used to treat autoimmune disorders by IV

infusion in a physician’s office, has zero observations in either the 2002 or the 2003 MEPS.

        An additional reason that some products are missing is that the MEPS captures approximately 1

out of every 10,000 prescriptions in a typical year and thus some products with small patient populations

will inevitably not be included. Consistent with this, the average number of daily doses is 16.2 times

greater for the 568 drugs that are in the 2002 or 2003 MEPS than for the 125 that are not.27 The 568

drugs that remain in our sample accounted for $155.0 billion of the $196.0 billion (79.1 percent) in total

2003 IMS spending.

        There is a close correspondence between IMS spending in 2003 and the estimate of total spending

from the 2003 MEPS. The correlation between these two is equal to 0.928, with this increasing to 0.981

when drugs are weighted by the number of prescriptions in the MEPS. However, there are some cases in

which drugs have very different rankings in the IMS and MEPS data. To shed light on this issue, Table 2

25
   This approximately doubles the number of prescriptions for the typical drug in our sample. The Medicare shares
in 2002 and 2003 are very strongly correlated, with a weighted correlation of 0.92.
26
   There are 544 products that appear in the 2003 MEPS and an additional 22 appear only in the 2002 MEPS.
27
   Similarly the 125 omitted drugs are much more expensive on average, with the average cost per daily dose in
2003 more than 47 times greater than for their counterparts that are in the MEPS.


                                                        20
lists drugs that are ranked in the top 20 in terms of 2003 spending in either IMS or the MEPS, with drugs

sorted in terms of their highest rank. The most notable disparity in this table is for the drug Epogen,

which is ranked 6th in the IMS data but just 435th in the MEPS, where it has only 19 prescriptions. Epogen

is administered by injection for the treatment of anemia brought on by kidney disease, so it not common

in MEPS. In our empirical analyses below, we weight our specifications by the number of prescriptions

in the MEPS to account for variation across drugs in the precision with which the Medicare market share

and other explanatory variables are estimated.

           A limitation to our focus on the top selling brand drugs in 2003 is that we will miss three

potentially important sets of drugs. First, any drug introduced in 2004 or later will not be included in our

analyses below. Similarly, any drug that had sales in 2003 but was not in the top 1000 sellers in that year

will also not be included. Third, we do not include generic drugs in our analysis. Thus to the extent that

Part D plans influenced the utilization of new products, generic drugs, or relatively low selling drugs, we

will not capture this effect in the analyses that follow.



           D. Identifying protected classes and therapeutic substitutes

           Our model predicts a different response to the program from both drugs in the protected classes

and drugs without substantial therapeutic competition. To identify the former we rely on IMS drug

classifications. IMS has a category named “cancer and immunomodulators” which covers the protected

classes of anti-cancer drugs and immunosuppressants. IMS also contains categories labeled

“antidepressants,” “antipsychotics,” “anti-epileptics,” and “HIV antivirals.” We use anti-epileptics to

proxy for the Part D class called anticonvulsants, but otherwise the matches are exact in terminology. To

determine which drugs were the only treatments or one out of just two in the therapeutic class, we

consulted a list of top-selling drugs and link it to the US pharmacopaeia and CMS therapeutic classes and

FKDTs.28 Recall PDPs are required to “cover” at least two drugs per class and at least one in each FKDT.

                                                        21
V. Empirical Framework and Main Results

          The IMS data described above provide us with total sales by product in each year from 2001 to

2006. We can also estimate the number of daily doses for each product by dividing the total quantity (in

standardized units) in each year by the corresponding average number of standardized units per daily dose

in each year. This allows us to form an estimate of the average price per day for each product. We use

these data to estimate specifications of the following type:



     ΔPj,2003-6 = α1 + β1MMS j,2003 + γ1ΔP j,2001-2 + μ1Yrs j,2003 + δ1AnyGenericj,2006 + ε1 j,2003       (5)

     ΔQj,2003-6 = α2 + β2MMS j,2003 + γ2*ΔQ j,2001-2 + μ2Yrs j,2003 + δ2AnyGenericj,2006 + ε 2j,2003       (6)



with j indexing drugs and ΔPj,2003-6 (ΔQj,2003-6 ) equal to the change in price (quantity) for drug j from 2003

to 2006. As described above, we focus on this three year change because the legislation that created Part

D was enacted in December of 2003 but plans did not start enrolling beneficiaries until January of 2006.

          The explanatory variable of particular interest in this specification is MMSj,2003, which represents

our estimate of the Medicare market share for drug j using the MEPS Prescribed Medicines files from

2002 and 2003. This is defined to be equal to the fraction of prescriptions filled in 2002 and 2003 for

individuals who were enrolled at some point in the program during the same year.29 This specification,

which uses one observation per drug, exploits the variation across drugs in their tendency to be used by

Medicare recipients. Given that total utilization and average prices for the same drug typically vary over

the lifecycle of the drug and can be affected by the presence of generic competition, we also control for

the number of years that the drug has been on the market (Yrsj,2003) and for whether the drug faces generic

competition (AnyGenericj,2006). To account for the possibility that drug prices, utilization, or sales may be

trending differentially for Medicare-intensive drugs prior to the policy change, we also include the pre-

existing trend (from 2001 to 2002) for the outcome variable of interest in each specification.
29
  In calculating this Medicare market share, we use the person weights in the MEPS. There is variation both across
and within therapeutic subcategories in this MMS measure. Specifically the correlation of a drug’s Medicare market
share with the average weighted Medicare market share of other drugs in its therapeutic subcategory is .697.


                                                          22
         Prices tend to move fairly steadily in our data, and tend to trend up. In contrast, quantities

fluctuate much more due to the entry of therapeutic substitutes, new generations of medicines, clinical

news, and other factors we do not observe. Thus in some of our quantity specifications, we include

interactions of the 2001-2 trend with the lifecycle stage of the drug to allow for accelerating or

decelerating sales of a drug depending on its age.

         To interpret our estimates for β1 and β2 as the causal effects of Medicare Part D on the outcome

variable of interest, we are assuming that there are no omitted factors that are correlated with the

Medicare market share and that also influence the change in the outcome variable of interest.30 Over the

short period of this study, that assumption seems reasonable to us. By taking first differences of average

prices or total utilization, we remove any unobserved time-invariant differences across drugs.

         A. The Impact on Average Prices

         An examination of the distribution of average price and the change in average prices for the drugs

in our analysis sample reveals that they are highly skewed to the right. This can be seen in Table 3, in

which we display various summary statistics for average prices and for the change in average prices in

our analysis sample. For example, the change in the average price from 2003 to 2006 for the drugs in our

sample has a skewness of more than 12. Thus following recent research for the effect of the Medicaid

program on pharmaceutical prices (Duggan and Scott Morton, 2006), we take the log of the average price,

which as shown in this same table is much more symmetrically distributed and has a skewness of

approximately zero. This has intuitive appeal as well, as prices are likely to change proportionally rather

than by a fixed dollar amount in response to common factors that affect prices in this sector. With this

transformation, we are essentially exploring whether the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices is

significantly greater for Medicare-intensive drugs following the enactment of Part D after controlling for

the pre-existing trend in the price.

  In this paper we will not consider insurance-induced changes in practice patterns of physicians, the introduction of
new drugs, and similar general equilibrium effects, as is done in Acemoglu et al (2006), Finkelstein (2007), and
Finkelstein and McKnight (2007), in which the authors looks at the effect of the introduction of Medicare. See also
Cutler (1995) and Dafny (2005) for related research on the effect of other important changes to the Medicare
program or Card et al (2007) and Khwaja (2008) for research on the effect of Medicare coverage.

         Table 4 summarizes the results from several specifications similar to equation (6) above. In this

equation, we exclude 50 of the 568 drugs described above because they either have no sales (and thus no

average price) in 2001 or 2002, no sales in 2006, or are missing the year of FDA approval.31 We weight

the observations in each specification by the number of prescriptions in the MEPS to account for the fact

that the precision of our estimate for the Medicare market share will vary across drugs.32 The estimate of

-0.128 for β1 in the first column, in which no other explanatory variables except a constant are included,

suggests that the introduction of Medicare Part D lowered pharmaceutical prices by approximately 13

percent for beneficiaries of the program. This estimate is significant at the five percent level.

         The magnitude of our estimate for β1 increases slightly in the next specification to -0.132, in

which we add the control variables described above. The estimate for μ1, the coefficient on the pre-

existing trend in the log price change, is also significantly negative in this specification. This suggests

that there is some regression to the mean, though the estimate for μ1 declines substantially and is no

longer significant in the third specification, in which we exclude outliers that are in the top one or bottom

one percent of the log price change (from 2003 to 2006) distribution. In this specification our estimate for

β1 increases slightly to -0.138 and remains significant at the five percent level.33

         As mentioned in the preceding section, the MEPS Prescribed Medicines files do not include

information for drugs administered in a physician’s office or clinic. One might therefore be concerned

that estimates for the Medicare market share for the cancer drugs that are in the sample are inaccurate. In

the fourth specification we exclude these 20 treatments and obtain a very similar estimate for β1.

         One potential concern with our estimate for the Medicare market share is that it weights all

prescriptions equally. If, for example, the number of days covered in the typical prescription for a

Medicare recipient is different than for those not on the program, this estimate may be misleading. We

32
   More specifically, we use Stata analytic weights.
33
   The results in this table suggest that generic competition has little impact on the price of branded pharmaceutical
treatments. Previous research provides conflicting evidence on this issue, with Frank and Salkever (1997) finding
an increase in prices after generic entry and Caves et al (1991) the opposite.


                                                          24
therefore introduce an alternative measure of the Medicare market share in the fifth specification that

represents the fraction of total spending accounted for by Medicare recipients. The statistically

significant estimate of -0.134 for β1 using this measure is virtually identical to the previous estimates. In

the next specification we consider only the top 200 drugs, as we did in our previous work for the

Medicaid program, and find that our estimate is essentially for β1 is unchanged at -0.128.

        Overall, our results show that the impact of Part D on average prices was significantly negative.

Absent a change in the optimal price for other segments of the market that is correlated with the Medicare

market share, this implies that the prices obtained by the PDPs serving Part D enrollees were significantly

lower than the prices those consumers paid prior to enrolling in the program.

        When interpreting these estimates, it is important to consider that many Medicare recipients

already had insurance for prescription drug costs prior to the enactment of Medicare Part D. To the extent

that the price effects were driven by those shifting into Part D plans as opposed to those remaining with

their previous coverage, the estimates for β1 will understate the average impact on pharmaceutical prices

for Part D enrollees. We explore this issue in more detail in Section Six.



        B. The Impact of Part D on the Utilization of Prescription Drugs

        The results presented in the preceding section suggest that the enactment of Part D reduced gross

pharmaceutical prices for Medicare recipients by an average of 12 percent. The program reduced the net

price of pharmaceutical treatments even further through an additional channel - the subsidies summarized

in Figure One. For example, the typical plan during the 2006 calendar year covered 75 percent of the first

$2000 in prescription drug costs once a person had reached their annual out-of-pocket deductible of $250.

Additionally, Medicare recipients enrolled in Part D pay just five percent of their costs once their out-of-

pocket spending reaches $3600, with the government covering 80 percent and the plan 15 percent.

        Because Part D reduced both the gross price of prescription drugs and the share of that price paid

by Medicare recipients, one would expect average utilization of these treatments to have increased. The




                                                     25
magnitude of this increase would presumably depend on several factors, including the elasticity of

demand for the affected treatments as well as the distribution of net price changes for these same

treatments. Note that the standard plan does require the enrollee to face the full marginal price of drugs

for a significant fraction of the expenditure range. To the extent that the utilization of prescription drugs

is very responsive to price, one would expect a substantial effect on utilization (Gibson et al, 2005).

        To investigate the effect of Medicare Part D on the total utilization of prescription drugs, in this

section we estimate specifications that are slightly different from those in the preceding section. We use

equation (6) rather than equation (5). In this case, the dependent variable is equal to the change in the log

of the number of daily doses from 2003 to 2006, with the mean and standard deviation of this variable in

the sample equal to -0.62 and 1.12, respectively.34

        The results from these specifications are summarized in Table Five. The estimate of 0.516 for β2

in the first specification, in which only the Medicare market share and a constant are included, is positive

but statistically insignificant with a p-value of .108. Even though the estimate is not statistically

significant, the point estimate suggests an increase of more than 67 percent in utilization among Medicare

recipients. In the next specification, we include the pre-existing trend from 2001 to 2002 in utilization,

the number of years that the drug had been on the market as of 2003, and a control for the presence of

generic competition. The estimates for the coefficients on the first two of these variables are statistically

insignificant, while the estimate for δ2, the coefficient on AnyGenj,2006, is significantly negative with a t-

statistic of -5.5. This is consistent with previous evidence that utilization of branded drugs declines

substantially once they face generic competition (Caves et al, 1991). The estimate for β2, the coefficient

on the Medicare market share variable, declines slightly to 0.488 and remains insignificant.

        The estimates for β2 in the next four columns are similar in magnitude, ranging from a low of

.374 to a high of .554, though in all cases the estimates are statistically insignificant. In the seventh

specification we interact the pre-existing trend in sales with two indicator variables. The first indicator is


34
   Utilization is on average declining because we are focusing on top selling drugs in 2003. Many of these
treatments will have seen declines in spending in the subsequent three years.


                                                        26
equal to 1 if the drug is “young” (less than 7 years since FDA approval) and 0 otherwise while the second

indicator is 1 if the drug is “old” (more than 15 years since FDA approval) and 0 otherwise.35 The

estimate of 0.452 for the effect of the Medicare market share is similar to the preceding ones.

Interestingly, the estimate for the pre-existing trend is now significantly positive at 0.841, though the

estimates for the two interaction terms are significantly negative. This suggests that the pre-existing trend

is a good predictor of utilization changes but not for very young or old treatments.

           The large estimates for δ2 in the first several specifications of Table 5 suggest that utilization

changes among drugs that face generic competition are substantially different from those that do not. To

increase the comparability of the drugs included in our sample, in specification 8 we focus on just the 291

drugs in our sample that did not face generic competition by 2006. While smaller in magnitude than the

previous estimates, the estimate of 0.252 for β in this specification is significant at the ten percent level.

           To gauge the plausibility of these results, it is instructive to obtain a back-of-the-envelope

estimate of the implied elasticity of prescription drug purchases for the 548 drugs in our sample. For a

Medicare recipient with average prescription drug spending, the effective co-pay would be 25 percent.

Adding to this a 12 percent average reduction in gross pharmaceutical prices suggests almost an 80

percent reduction in the out-of-pocket cost on the margin for purchases in the coverage area. This is

approximately twice as large as the median implied utilization effect from Table 5, suggesting an

elasticity of approximately 0.5.

           This estimate is comparable to the corresponding ones from most previous studies summarized in

Gibson et al (2005). But for many reasons the elasticities calculated here are not strictly comparable

because they are estimated for a different population, consider different drugs, and have a non-linear

relationship between out-of-pocket spending and total prescription drug costs. But taken together the




35
     Approximately 25 percent of drugs in our analysis sample are “young” and another 25 percent are “old”.


                                                          27
results strongly suggest that the average effect of Medicare Part D was to reduce the price and increase

the utilization of pharmaceutical treatments among the beneficiaries of the program.36



VI. Heterogeneity in Part D’s Impact on Pharmaceutical Prices and Utilization

        A. Differentiating between Insured and Uninsured Medicare Recipients

        Just prior to the enactment of the Medicare Modernization Act, a substantial fraction of Medicare

recipients already had insurance coverage for prescription drug costs. As shown in Table 1 and described

above, payments by private and public health insurers accounted for 20 and 29 percent, respectively, of

2003 prescription drug expenditures for this group.

        We begin this section by investigating whether the price effects estimated above also vary with

the baseline insurance coverage of Medicare recipients. The dual eligibles enrolled in both Medicare and

Medicaid were required to switch from Medicaid drug coverage to a Medicare Part D plan. As recent

research has demonstrated (Duggan and Scott Morton, 2006), the procurement rules used by Medicaid

distort prices upward, suggesting that a shift out of Medicaid may have reduced pharmaceutical prices.

And secondly, the shift from being uninsured to a Part D plan may have affected prices by placing

individuals paying with cash into a large group that could bargain over prices with brands in return for

market share, increasing their sensitivity to price differences.

        The specifications summarized in Table 6 shed light on this issue. In column (1), we report the

results from our baseline specification summarized in the preceding section, in which our estimate for the

coefficient on the overall Medicare market share is -0.137. Column (2) presents the results from an

analogous specification in which we differentiate between the Medicare self-pay and Medicare insured

market shares as follows:



        ΔYj,2006 = α + β1MMS_Self j,2003 + β2MMS_Ins j,2003 + γΔY j,2003 + μYrs j,2003 + ε j,2003    (7)


36
  This remains true when one considers that many Medicare recipients already had prescription drug coverage, and
thus our elasticity estimate is even larger.


                                                       28
in which Y is the outcome variable, price or quantity. The average values for these two variables in our

sample of 548 drugs are 0.217 and 0.135, respectively, and the latter share variable includes both private

and public insurance.

        The estimates for β1 and β2 displayed in column 2 suggest that the price effects of Medicare Part

D do vary with a particular drug’s level of pre-Part D insurance coverage on the part of Medicare

recipients. More specifically, the estimate of -.227 for β1 implies that the average (gross) price of

prescription drugs consumed by uninsured Medicare recipients fell by more than 20 percent from 2003 to

2006 relative to other drugs, and this estimate is significant at the one percent level. The magnitude of the

corresponding estimate for β2 has the opposite sign and is statistically insignificant. This suggests that the

price declines observed for Medicare-intensive drugs were driven by declines for drugs consumed

disproportionately by individuals without health insurance.

        In the next specification summarized in column (3), we differentiate between Medicare recipients

also enrolled in Medicaid and those with an alternative source of insurance. Given the price distortions

created by Medicaid’s procurement rules, one might expect the movement of duals into Part D to cause a

reduction in private market prices. If so, we will see the estimate of a drug’s dual share associated with

price reductions, rather than its estimate of MMS. The estimate of -.190 for the coefficient on the dual

eligible share is consistent with this hypothesis, though it is not statistically significant.37 Furthermore,

the estimate of -.247 for β1 remains of similar magnitude and statistically significant at the one percent

level. We thus conclude that the movement of duals is not responsible for the effect we measure.

        In the next three columns of this table, we summarize the results from an analogous set of

specifications for the utilization (in terms of number of daily doses) of the 548 drugs in our sample. To

the extent that the enactment of Part D reduced the net cost of prescription drugs by more for uninsured

Medicare recipients than for their counterparts who already had insurance, one would expect a larger

37
  Because the shift from Medicaid to Part D would have reduced Medicaid market shares, there could be a spillover
effect to Medicaid recipients not enrolled in Medicare. Because we have only aggregate data for the post Part D
period, we cannot yet investigate this possibility.


                                                       29
increase in utilization for drugs consumed by this group. Consistent with this, the estimate of .483 for β1

in specification (5) is substantially larger than the corresponding estimate for β2, though given the large

standard errors the difference is not statistically significant.

           The results in the final columns investigate the effect of Medicare Part D on total U.S. revenues.

Given that the policy intervention reduced pharmaceutical prices, relative to drugs consumed infrequently

by Medicare-eligibles, while increasing the quantity of these treatments that was consumed, it is

theoretically ambiguous whether the revenues of pharmaceutical products consumed by eligibles

increased or declined as a result of this legislation. The estimate of .334 for β1 in column (7) suggests that

the utilization effect more than offset the effect of declining prices, so that sales accelerated for Medicare-

intensive drugs, though this result is not statistically significant. However, because the marginal cost of

most pharmaceuticals is quite low, if utilization increased, it is plausible that manufacturer profits could

have risen despite the significant price declines.

           Taken together, the results presented in this section suggest that Medicare Part D reduced prices

for Medicare recipients who lacked insurance coverage for prescription drug costs prior to the enactment

of Part D. These individuals are presumably the ones who are much more likely to have enrolled in Part

D plans. We find little evidence to suggest that there was a corresponding effect on either price or

utilization for drugs sold differentially to Medicare recipients who already had prescription drug

coverage. This is consistent with our model above, which predicts no change in pharmaceutical prices for

those Medicare recipients who already had insurance for prescription drug costs.



           B. Protected Therapeutic Categories

           While private firms providing Part D benefits had considerable latitude in designing their

formularies, they were required to cover at least two treatments in each eligible therapeutic category.38

This requirement was introduced to reduce plans’ ability to “cream skim” the least costly patients by

excluding all treatments for certain conditions. The ability to exclude certain treatments from the

38
     Certain therapeutic categories were excluded from Part D coverage, such as weight loss drugs.


                                                           30
formulary provided plans with potentially important leverage when negotiating prices with

pharmaceutical manufacturers.

        The requirements for a plan providing Part D coverage were substantially more stringent for a

small subset of the 146 therapeutic categories defined by CMS. Specifically, plans were required to cover

“substantially all” drugs in the following six therapeutic categories: antiretrovirals, antidepressants,

antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants, and antineoplastics. Part D plans could still try to

steer patients toward certain treatments within these categories through differential co-pays, prior

authorization requirements, step therapy, or fail first provisions. However, plans are restricted in their use

of utilization tools in the protected classes. Further, dual eligibles (who differentially use treatments in

these categories) tend not to pay any marginal price (beyond just a dollar or two) for drugs, so plans

cannot create significant financial incentives for them.

        Thus all else equal, a plan’s leverage in negotiating low prices would be less than if they could

exclude the treatment altogether. The same would be true for categories with just one or two available

treatments. Note that this group is therefore missing one of the two effects we discussed above: while the

impact of insurance increasing optimal prices is present, the offsetting effect of therapeutic competition

on substitutes is likely to be very weak.

        To investigate whether the price effects of Medicare Part D were different for protected classes or

for those with just one or two treatments, in this section we summarize the results from specifications of

the following type:



 ΔYj,2006 = α + βMMS j,2003 + λProtj + σMMS j,2003 * Protj + μSmall + ρMMSj,2003 * Smallj + γΔY j,2002 + ε j,2006 (8)



(with the same additional interactions in the case of quantity specifications). In this equation, Protj is set

equal to one if drug j is in one of the protected categories and is otherwise set equal to zero. Similarly,

Small is set equal to one if drug j is in a therapeutic category with just one or two available treatments.

Both variables are then interacted with the Medicare market share defined above to explore whether the


                                                         31
average price effects estimated above differ for drugs in this category. To the extent that Part D plans

were less successful at negotiating price reductions in these two sets of categories, one would expect

positive estimates for σ and ρ.

        The results summarized in Table 7 shed light on this prediction. In the first three columns we

include all 488 drugs in the sample (after excluding the 10 outlier and 20 cancer drugs from our initial

sample of 518), with 48 of these treatments falling into one of the six protected classes and 22 of them

belonging to a category with just one or two available treatments. In the first specification we add only

the Protj indicator and its interaction with the Medicare market share to our baseline specification.

Consistent with our prediction, our estimate for σ is positive and at 0.183 is larger in magnitude than the

estimate of -0.142 for β, providing a hint that Medicare-intensive drugs in protected classes did not

experience price declines as did their counterparts in protected classes. However, this estimate is not

statistically significant. Standard errors are clustered by therapeutic subcategory given that the protected

class indicator varies at this level.

        In the specification summarized in the next column, we add the indicator for being in a “small”

therapeutic category and its interaction with the Medicare market share to our baseline specification.

Consistent with our theoretical predictions, the estimate for the coefficient on this estimate is positive and

it is statistically significant at the ten percent level. The magnitude of this estimate of .316 is more than

twice as large for the main effect estimate of -.143, suggesting that if anything, Medicare-intensive

treatments in these categories experienced price increases.

        These findings for price effects are similar when we include both indicators and their interactions

with the Medicare market share in specification three and when we focus only on treatments without

generic competition in column four. Taken together, our results suggest that Medicare Part D did not

reduce gross pharmaceutical prices for treatments in these categories. Returning to our model above, price

declines would be least likely for these treatments because Part D plans would be less well equipped to

“move market share.”




                                                      32
        The next four columns report the results from an analogous set of specifications for the utilization

measure defined above. In specifications five, six, and seven, the estimate for both σ and ρ are

significantly negative, suggesting that Medicare-intensive drugs in protected classes and in classes with

just one or two treatments experienced decreases in utilization following the enactment of Part D. The

first of these two estimates becomes small in magnitude and statistically insignificant in specification 8,

where we focus on just treatments that do not face generic competition. However, the significant negative

estimate for ρ remains, suggesting that perhaps Part D plans shifted away from these treatments. While

the CMS formulary discourages such shifting, plans are permitted to develop differentiated formularies,

provided they can justify their choices to CMS as both providing sufficient quality, and not attempting to

cream-skim. The combination of results suggests that brands given market power by the CMS formulary

raised their prices and saw some market share losses due to Part D formulary design. However, because

our quantity results are so imprecise, we do not put emphasis on this explanation.

        Taken together, the results in this section suggest that drug prices offered by Medicare Part D

plans grew with others in those therapeutic categories where their ability to move market share was most

limited. This provides some support for our model in section three, which predicted smaller price

declines (or larger price increases) for those treatments without good substitutes.



VII. Discussion

        The introduction of Medicare Part D is arguably the most significant change to the Medicare

program since its inception more than forty years ago. The procurement rules that are used by Part D

differ substantially from those used by Medicare for other health care services or by the federal-state

Medicaid program or by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for prescription drugs. One of the

central criticisms of Part D was that it would lead to increases in pharmaceutical prices, to some extent

offsetting the benefit of the additional insurance coverage.




                                                     33
        In this paper, we investigate this issue using price, quantity, and sales data for all pharmaceutical

brands in the U.S. for the period before and immediately following the enactment of Medicare Part D.

We combine this with information on the payment sources and age of each brand’s consumers, which

allows us to compare price and utilization changes as a function of each treatment’s pre Part D Medicare

market share. Our findings strongly suggest that Part D plans have succeeded in negotiating lower

pharmaceutical prices for Part D enrollees – more than 12% lower – with this effect augmenting the

mechanical effect of the program in subsidizing out-of-pocket prices. Our findings also suggest,

consistent with recent research that used data for one large pharmacy chain (Lichtenberg and Sun, 2007;

Yin et al, 2008), that Part D has led to an increase in the utilization of pharmaceutical treatments.

        Our findings do not support the hypothesis that Part D plans would pay higher than current prices

unless they were given the assistance of the federal government in negotiation. Further, in contrast to the

usual intuition that the uninsured customer is the most price-sensitive, we find that the insured customer is

more price-elastic. The most plausible explanation is that in Part D, insurance is bundled with group

purchasing and the implementation of a formulary. The impact of the PDP’s ability to negotiate on prices

paid by consumers indicates that a significant benefit of the program is the way it is organized, regardless

of the subsidy. For example, our results predict that elderly consumers would be better off in a Part D

plan with zero subsidy, compared to paying cash. The PDP’s ability to encourage the use of therapeutic

substitutes outweighs the classic insurance-induced increases in pharmaceutical prices and therefore leads

to an overall reduction in program expenditures. It is perhaps partly because of the price reductions

estimated in this paper that Part D expenditures by the federal government have been substantially lower

than the most widely cited estimates suggested (CMS, 2007b).

        When interpreting the results in this paper, a number of caveats should be mentioned. First, given

the available data, we can only investigate the effect of Part D in its first year. To the extent that plans

become more or less successful at negotiating prices in future years, the results may of course change.

Secondly, we are unable to measure any ex post rebates which PDPs may have been able to negotiate and

which affect net prices to PDPs. Such rebates do not appear on the invoice, which is the source of IMS


                                                      34
data, and might be causing prices to be even lower than those measured here. If rebates are present, our

estimates are a lower bound to the price reductions achieved by PDPs. The other rebates that we do not

measure are Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers to the Medicaid program.39 Dual eligibles’

pharmaceutical purchases under Medicaid automatically generated this rebate. Once dual eligibles move

into Medicare Part D plans, their pharmaceutical purchases occur at different prices, which is what we

document here, but they no longer trigger automatic rebates. Any study of the total cost of Part D to the

government would want to consider both sets of rebates. And finally, this paper is focused on brands that

were available in 2003 and thus we do not capture any effect on the price or utilization of more recently

released treatments or the rate at which new treatments are introduced. All of these issues as well as the

effects of Part D on the health and out-of-pocket expenditures of Medicare recipients, remain important

areas for future research.

Each column summarizes the results from specifications of the change in the log price per daily dose on the explanatory variables listed in the first column. The unit of
observation is the drug and the sample is constructed as described in Section 4C. Specifications 1 through 4 and specification 6 use the share of a drug's prescriptions
purchased by Medicare enrolled individuals while specification 5 uses the share of spending for that drug. Specifications 3 through 6 drop those observations with values of
the dependent variable in the top 1 percent or the bottom 1 percent of the distribution. Specifications 4 through 6 excludes 20 cancer and immunosuppressant drugs.
Specification 6 limits to just the top 200 drugs. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are included in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10th, 5th, and
1st percentile, respectively. The mean and standard deviation of the dependent variable are equal to .174 and .199, respectively.

Each column summarizes the results from specifications of the change in the log number of daily doses on the explanatory variables listed in the first column. The unit of observation is the drug and the
sample is constructed as described in Section 4C. Specifications 1 through 4 and specifications 6 through 8 use the share of a drug's prescriptions purchased by Medicare enrolled individuals while
specification 5 uses the share of spending for that drug. Specifications 3 through 8 drop those observations with values of the dependent variable in the top 1 percent or the bottom 1 percent of the
distribution. Specifications 4 through 8 excludes 20 cancer and immunosuppressant drugs. Specification 6 limits to just the top 200 drugs and specification 8 considers only those sample drugs that do not
face generic competition. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are included in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10th, 5th, and 1st percentile, respectively. The mean and standard
deviation of the dependent variable are equal to -0.62 and 1.11, respectively.

Specifications 1 through 4 and 5 through 8 summarize the results from specifications of the change in the log price per daily dose and in the log number of daily doses,
respectively, that use the explanatory variables listed in the first column. The unit of observation is the drug and the sample is constructed as described in Section 4C. All
eight specifications use the share of a drug's prescriptions purchased by Medicare enrolled individuals as the measure of Medicare market share. All eight specifications
drop those observations with values of the dependent variable in the top 1 percent or the bottom 1 percent of the distribution and exclude the 20 cancer and
immunosuppressant drugs. Specifications 4 and 8 drop those treatments that face generic competition in 2006 or earlier. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are
included in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at the 10th, 5th, and 1st percentile, respectively.
