     Stabilization Policies in the World Economy: Scope and Skepticism


                                 ABSTRACT




     Throughout the industrialized world, macroeconomic performance since

the mid-l970s has been very poor, and the prospects in the near term remain

bleak. While there is no consensus among macroeconomists regarding the

diagnosis (or cure) of these ills, the major competing schools of thought

have focussed most of their blame on macroeconomic policy. This paper

summarizes a series of studies, in collaboration with Michael Bruno,

suggesting rather that supply shocks coupled with real wage rigidities are

a central source of the poor macroeconomic performance. Various hypotheses

are mentioned as a source for the resistance to real wage cuts, and some

illustrations of the policy implications of supply shocks are provided.

               Throughout the industrialized world, macroeconomic performance since

the mid-1970s has been very poor, and the prospects in the near term remain

bleak. It is sobering to reflect that all 24 OEC[) economies suffered a slow-

down in aggregate econnmic growth after 1973 (comparing average growth rates

for 1965-73 with 1973-79); all but one (Switzerland) experienced an intensifi-

cation of consumer price inflation. Overall, the annual GNP growth of the

OECD slowed from 4.9 percent during 1965-73 to 2.7 percent during 1973-79, and

it has slowed further since then. The slow growth has translated into rising

unemployment, which stood at about 7 percent of the OECD workforce in 1981 as

compared with a mere 2 to 3 percent in 1970. In the European Economic Commu-

nity, the 1981 unemployment rate appears to have been a staggering 8 percent.

           Bright spots in this picture are few indeed, but their ]cssons may

be instructive. After the steep recession in the OECD during 1974-75, the

U.S. alone of the major economies staged a rapid recovery; the unemployment

rate fell significantly below its 1975 peak, while it continued to rise in

Europe. Unfortunatc'lv, U.S. performance on most measures has deteriorated

sharply (and relatively) since 1979. Japan provides a case of extremely suc-

cessful performance since the mid-1970s, after a very sharp jolt during 1973-75.

Among the smaller economies, the neighboring Nordic economies of Sweden and

Finland offer a vivid contrast of worsening and improving economic
                                                                       develop-
ments, respectively since the mid-1970s.

          There is no consensus among macroeconomists regarding the diagnosis

of these ills, the sources of relative success across economics, or most impor-

tant for the purpose here, the right policy mix for sustained recovery. The

interpretations offered here, which must he regarded as tentative, lay grct

 stress on the various adverse supply shocks that affected all of the OECfl

 economies during the past decade. The interpretations are based largely on
                                                                                     a

 economics of supply disturbances in open economies.



 I. The Central Role of Supj Pisturbances


            The major competing schools of macroeconomic thought have focused

 most of their blame for the current debacle
                                                on macroeconomic policy. For the
 Keynesians, recent policy has hocn too austere, overly directed against fight-

 ing inflation. For the monetarists, the case has been almost the opposite:

 that politicians have continued to drive up money growth to fight short-terr

unemployment, to the sacri lice of longer-term price stabi 1               for
                                                                ity. And         the new
classical macroeconomists,    the policies have simply been too erratic, with policy

"Surprises"   explaining the fluctuations in   output growth.

            Unfortunately, these important propositions have    been subjected to
almost   no systematic, cross-country scrutiny. No strong comparative evidr'nce
has been set .forth to show that high
                                        unemployment and slow growth have been
closely tied to more restrictive policies, or to more uncertain and volatile

policies, or that price stability has resulted from slow and stable money growth.

Recent tests of the "surprises" model, for
                                               example, failed on Japanese data
(see Jun'jchjro Seo and Wataru Takahashjj. There is little doubt that tight

policies can explain high unemployment at certain times and places (the Thatcher

experiment in the LJ.. is a case in point; see Willem Buiter and Marcus Miller),

but it is doubtful that they provide
                                        a general explanation for the recent ex-
perience. The almost universal slowdown in growth and rise in unemployment in

the OECD has characterized both activist and passive, as well as expansionary
                                          -3-
 and contractionary policy regimes. To cite just two
                                                     cases, neither the aus-
 tere Barre policies in France nor the
                                            expansionary Keynesian policies in Sweden

 restored high employment or rapid growth to their economies.

           I would suggest three lessons on macroeconomic performance and policy

 from the tangled comparative record.       First, it is not the policy choices hut

 rather the policy options that worsened in the l970s, with supply shocks driv-

 ing the stagflationary process. Second, the appropriate policy response to

 high unemployment or slow growth depends on the source of the unemployment, with

 "Supply-generated" unemployment less tractable then the
                                                             garden-variety Keynesian
 unemployment. And third, since national economic structures
                                                                  differ, particu-
 larly in labor market and financial institutions, the
                                                           same policy is likely to
 have very different effects across economies.

           Various "supply-side" shocks were of dominating importance in the

 l970s. All industrial countries faced a massive rise in the real price of raw

materials inputs after 1970, following two decades of falling real input prices.

The oil price increases (in 1973-74, 1979-80) were the most stunning, hut by no

means the only majoi hikes in real commodity prices. Overall, the index of non-

fuel primary input prices rose sharply relative to prices of final manufactured

goods in the 1970s (see Robert Lipsey and Trying Kravis). Accompanying thec

shocks was a persistent slowdown in total factor productivity growth in almost

all of the OLd). The synchronization of the slowdown with the raw material price

increases suggests a causal linkage running from prices to output (as suggested

by Martin N. Baily and Bruno, for example) but this linkage rcmdins an open ques-

tion. Many,   such   as David   Grubb, Richard Jackman, Richard Layard, and William

Nordhaus, take the productivity slowdown to be an independent event. A third
supply shock, from the point of view of the OECD, has been the
                                                                    rapid expansion
of the newly ind&istri.Iizing countries (NICs) into traditional export sectors
                                          -4-
of    the OECD economics (e.g. steel, shipbuilding, electronic components). This

import-competing growth of the NICs has worsened the OECI) terms of trade, and

perhaps more importantly, has shifted the locus of new world investment in key

industries decisively away from the developed economies. It is forecast, for

example, that about half of the world's capacity expansion in steel during

1980-1985 will be made in the developing economies, up from             percent in the
1970s.

               On a theoretical level, the economics of supply shocks are fairly

well understood (see l3runo and Sachs (1981a, 1981b) and Sachs (1980b) for

general equilibrium analyses in the case of output-market clearing, and

Edmond Malinvaud and Robert Solow for the non-market clearing case).           Consider,

for example, a rise in real input prices. In a competitive, full-employment

economy a permanent input price shock reduces output on impact, and mo;t likely

sets in motion a path of capital decumulation, along which output and produc-

tivity grow more slowly than trend. For a given money supply, the nominal

price   and wage leve] S   may either   rise or fall after the   shock; if the output

effect    of the shock is small, the rise    in real input prices probdbly requires
the    fall of other   nominal wages and prices. And very importantly, the real

wageconsistent with full employment (hereafter, the "full-employment real
wage") must fall on impact, and then must grow more slowly than trend as the
process   of   capital accumulation proceeds.
            From the point of view of macroeconomic equilibrium, then, there are

two problems. After the supply shock, the nominal price vector may be inap-

propriate given the existing money stock and exchange rate. If nominal prices

and/or wages are sticky, a standard demand management problem arises (with the

standard short-run inflation-unemployment tradeoffs, if they exist). Edmund Phelps

has described this demand-side issue of supply shocks in detail. The second,
                                               -5-

 and more novel policy issue           involves   the need to reduce real wages to their

 new full-employment path. Most recessions up until 1973 signalled little about

 the need for long-term real
                                   wage adjustment, while the resolution of post-1973

 recessions has depended on the deceleration of real wages from an earlier

 trend. And for reasons that we shall see, such a deceleration is only likely

 after a transitory phase of high unemployment, and is also likely to he hard to

 bring about with standard macroeconomic policy tools.

              For a number of years after 1973 (at least two years in most countries;

 four to five in others) OECD real
                                              wage growth remained strong relative to produc-

 tivity growth, and profitability was sharply squeezed (see Sachs (1979) and Bruno

 for details). The rate of return
                                              on manufacturing capital fell steeply between
 1973 and 1978 in most ecc•nomies. Only in the
                                                          U.S., where unionization rates are

extraordinaril>; low, was the profit squeeze largely avoided.             The evidence is
not strong on whether the real wage behavior reflects union wage-setting
                                                                                            se
or more general outcomes in the labor market. It is
                                                                 significant though, that
in both the U.K. and U.S. there was a sharp rise in the union-non-union wagc

differential over the course of the 1970s.

             The profit squeeze was closely linked to output, investment, and

growth behavior      after   1973, with the relatively favorable U.S. profit position

inducing a more rapid recovery (see Sachs (1979)). The links of wages to un-

employment    in   this   period are   best   documented for the U.K. (see James Symons
for a detailed presentation; R. Morley; Bruno and Sachs (1981h)), and econo-
metric   work supports this link for Japan (flavid Lipton and Sachs). Indeed,

Japan provides a revealing comparison of adjustment to the first and second
oil shocks.     in the first, real wage growth remained high, and profits and

output were sharply squeezed; in the second, there was a dramatic drop in real

wage   growth for 1979-SO, which made          room for .Japan's terms-of-trade loss.

 Output growth hardly dipped in the second episode (see Sachs (198Ic) and

 Yoichi Shinkai for supporting evidence).

              Real wages may fail to adjust for many reasons, and each of these

 reasons has different implications for policy. We can divide the possible ex-

planations into categories which emphasize:           (a) uncertainty, timing, or mis-

perception; and (b) union bargaining power. Most directly, sonic wages may be

predetermined by contract at the time of an unanticipated supply disturbance,

so   that real wages are       unexpectedly driven above full-employment levels. If

renegotiation     is   costless, the profit squeeze would soon disippear, but other-
wise   the squeeze must persist until the next bargaining round.           Herbert Giersch
has suggested such a view for the high real wage settlements in Germany in 1974

 (in Germany, the misperception was twofold, involving both oil prices and tight

Bundesbank policy).

              A related argument holds that unions, or both employers and unions,

failed to understand the link of higher oil prices and wage moderation, and

the ordeal of unemployment was necessary to "clarify" that link.            This simple

argument probably holds enormous weight. The supply shocks were a novel

phenomenon.      There was no way prior to the late 1970s to evaluate        the partial

elasticity     of labor demand    with respect   to real energy   prices, or to verify
that   a persistent slowdown in      productivity   growth had occurred. An assev-
erat..on   by employers   to   employees of the need for real wage declines     is, in

general,     of little avail, for employers have reason to dissimulate and        employees
have cause to ignore their employer's importunings. The inability of employers

to convey credibly to workers the need for real wage moderation has been ele-

gantly     captured by Sanford Grossman and Olivcr Hart. Adverse shocks in         their
model bump against partial real wage rigidity, and therefore cause unemployment.

Their results directly transfer to our case. If this hypothesis is maintained,
                                              -7-


  we should expect to see a gradual process of wage moderation after a supply

  shock, as workers gain evidence (through the
                                                          Persistence of unemployment) that
  the adverse demand shift against labor has in fact occurred. Moreover,
                                                                         we would
 expect learning between the first (1973-74) and second oil
                                                                            shocks (1979) re
 garding union wage setting. According to Shinkai, Japan is a vivid illustra

 tion of such learning, for formerly militant union federations explicitly

 called for wage moder,tion in 1980, in
                                                 light of Supply-side developments. One
 federation's     "offensive white   paper" declared: "Our wage demand (in 1980) is
 based on our assessment of the impact of oil-price rise and
                                                                             growth prospect,
 and aims at a real wage increase lower than
                                                       the real GNP growth." (p. 19)

               The previous explanations all apply in a basically competitive labor

market setting. More        troubling cases     emerge once we recognize the extent of
monopoly union power in OECD labor markets,
                                            particularly throughout Europe.
 In the U.S. we often forget that much        of   European wage setting occurs in a
highly centralized, highly       unionized context.        And when powerful unions face

off against employers, supply shocks may well redound on unemployment rather

than wage reductions. To our benefit, Tan McDonald and Solow have recently

offered a smorgasbord of models that make that very point. There is simply

no     presumption   that an Optimi Zing Union will substantially cut reil wigcs,

rather     than employment, following a supply shock; indeed, it may even raise
th em!

              From the very
                        aggregative standpoint then, supply shocks may raise
the "typical" problem that the nominal price and wage are out of line with
money supply and the exchange rate, and the novel case that real
                                                                 wages exceed
their    full employment   level.   If output   markets     do not clear, we may adopt
                                           -8-
 Malinvaud's     typology: the first problem would push the economy into the re-

 gime of Keynesian unemployment, and        the   latter towards classical unemploym('nt.

 Demand stimulus is effective in the first case (subject to Mundell-Flemixig

 limitations) but not in the latter, unless the demand stimulus itself (say an

exchange rate depreciation) can reduce real wages by accelerating inflation.

                       In recent models, particularly Sachs (1980b) and Bruno and

Sachs (1981a), I hate investigated these policy issues under a variety of labor

market assumptions (in these models, the output market is assumed to clear con-

tinuously, so that the economy is always at the boundary of Keynesian and

classical regimes). Consider one useful specification, which distinguishes

between the "bargained" real wage             the actual real wage w, and the full-

employment real wage w' (see Grubh,Jackman, and Layard for a similar formulation).

We assume that unions and firms bargain for a real wage (w), but set a nominal

wage that is only partially indexed (or perhaps fully indexed with a lag).

Actual wages (w) can deviate in the short run from B, because of unantici-

pated or accelerating inflation. The bargained wage itself is assumed to re-

spond only to unemployment, in order to capture the partial real wage rigidity

I have discussed above.

              Now, we can envision various relations among B, w, and              Generally,
unemployment will result when w >             hut this can occur with high or low real-
wage bargains.      If w >   w=   w',   unions and firms would settle on a lower real

wage, but because of partial nominal wage rigidity, they do not achieve it. This

is a case where a money supply increase or exchange rate devaluation can readily

reduce unemployment (at the cost of a higher price level).             Unemployment is

basically a monetary problem.

              On the other hand, if w =       >       the   wage bargain is intentionally
set   above       (as discussed earlier, unions may misperceive           or may choose
                                           -9-


unemployment in return for higher wages). In this case, a monetary expansion

can temporarily reduce w, and increase employment, but only in the short run.

Long-run, fu1l-ap1oyment equilibrium requires that w8 he reduced to                        (or
        f            .                                            B
that w be raised). For concreteness, suppose that Lw =
                                                                       c(Ut),   where Ut

the unemployment rate.          '1 cn, 1/a(w - w   )   measures the cumulative unemploy-

ment that must be experienced before long-run equilibrium is restored. The

unemployment may he postponed through rising inflation, but it cannot he avoided

in the long run through expansionary monetary policy. Simulation exercises

show that expansionary policy very often results in higher inflation and deeper

unemployment along the adjustment path than does a passive policy.

              It should he pointed out that a fiscal expansion may raise               and

thus moderate unemployment by favorably shifting the economy's terms of trade

(see Sachs (1980) for an example). Moreover, direct supply-side measures may
                 f
also raise w .           Space prevents elaboration of these two poss]bllltIes here.

              I close with a talc of two countries, Sweden and Finland, that vividly

confirms the difficulty of preventing, rather than merely postponing, supply-

shock unemployment.

Sweden      utilized very expansionary policies during 1974-76 to "bridge" the
world recession (see OLCD Economic Surveys for Sweden and Finland for recent
policy history), and indeed open unemployment did not develop               in the early

years    of the 1)01 icy (t bough hi &lden unemployment, such as work ers in government
job-training         programs, did). But neither did real wages moderate. A wage boom

and severe profit squeeze ensued, which ushered in a number of years of
                                                                        very

poor growth. Moreover, the expansionary policies left a legacy of a greatly

expanded government sector. In Finland, the decision to abandon reflatjon

was taken much earlier (1975), with a view towards restoring profitability

and competitiveness in       Finland's   export sector. The output drop in Finland in

1975-76 was far more severe than in Sweden, and Finland's real wage gap (itS

measured by the OECD) was eliminated in 1976. The growth since 1977 has been

far   higher.



111. Conclusions and Fxtc'nions


              The recessions in the 1970s were inherently more painful than pre-

vious episodes since they         signalled   the need for real wage moderation and a

period of slow economic growth. In some countries, the need for real wage

moderation      was accepted by   workers   without the ordeal of unemployment (e.g.
Japan, 1979-80), while in others, the adjustment process seemed to require a
recession.      In such countries, expansionary demand policies serve mainly to
postpone rather than prevent an economic          downturn.

              Of course a   variety of additional issues should be rai seti   in   a com-
plete treatment of the recent supply shocks. Higher energy prices and competi-
tion from the NICs call for sectoral reallocation of resources, as well as
overall wage and price adjustments. One suspects that in a booming economy,

sectoral shifts of the       requisite   magnitude could be handled in   stride.    In

the   present environment, though, policy makers have supported moribund indus-
tries   and   protective labor legislation has slowed down the flow of workers to
more prothictive enterprises. These inefficiencies have magnified Iurope's

adjustment    probleni significantly.
