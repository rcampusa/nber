Skill Biased Heterogeneous Firms, Trade Liberalization, and the Skill Premium
James Harrigan and Ariell Reshef
NBER Working Paper No. 17604
November 2011, Revised June 2012

                                                ABSTRACT

We propose a theory that rising globalization and rising wage inequality are related because trade liberalization
raises the demand facing highly competitive skill-intensive firms. In our model, only the lowest-cost
firms participate in the global economy exactly along the lines of Melitz (2003). In addition to differing
in their productivity, firms differ in their skill intensity. We model skill-biased technology as a correlation
between skill intensity and technological acumen, and we estimate this correlation to be large using
firm-level data from Chile in 1995. A fall in trade costs leads to both greater trade volumes and an
increase in the relative demand for skill, as the lowest-cost/most-skilled firms expand to serve the
export market while less skill-intensive non-exporters retrench in the face of increased import competition.
This mechanism works regardless of factor endowment differences, so we provide an explanation
for why globalization and wage inequality move together in both skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries.
In our model countries are net exporters of the services of their abundant factor, but there are no Stolper-
Samuelson effects because import competition affects all domestic firms equally.

               We propose a theory that rising globalization and rising wage inequality are related because trade liberalization
           raises the demand facing highly competitive skill-intensive …rms. In our model, only the lowest-cost …rms participate

               Two of the most striking trends in the global economy since 1970 are globalization and increasing wage
           inequality. For example, in the United States, the premium that college graduates earn over high school
           graduates grew by 35 percentage points between 1971 and 2005 (Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2008)). Over
           the same period, the ratio of trade to GDP in the U.S. grew 15 percentage points.2 Similar trends are
           apparent around the world, including in many developing countries (Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007)). This
           raises an important but di¢ cult question for applied economics: has increased globalization contributed to
           growing wage inequality? More precisely, have reductions in the costs of cross-border transactions led to
           both greater globalization and increased wage inequality?
               There is a large, fascinating, and inconclusive literature on this question. The primary alternative
           hypothesis is technological: skill-biased technological change, especially when embodied in information and
           communications technology investment, has led to an increased relative demand for more educated workers
           (see, for example, Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003)). In this view, globalization is a sideshow, having only
           a small e¤ect on the skill premium, at least in the United States.
               In this paper we revisit this question using a novel approach. In our model, …rms are heterogeneous
           in their productivity, and only the lowest-cost …rms participate in the global economy, exactly along the

lines of Melitz (2003). In addition to di¤ering in their productivity, …rms in our model di¤er in their
skill intensity. We model skill-biased technology as a correlation between skill intensity and technological
acumen, a speci…cation strongly supported by both data and theory. There is a large body of work that
indicates that throughout the 20th century newer and more e¢ cient technologies have typically demanded
more skilled (or better educated) workers; see Goldin and Katz (2008) and references therein. Acemoglu
(2002) provides a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon, as well as the acceleration in the bias in
favor of skilled labor post 1979 in the U.S. New technologies are embodied in new goods, and Xiang (2005)
shows that new goods have higher skill intensity. Abowd, Haltiwanger, Lane, McKinney, and Sandusky
(2007) …nd a strong positive correlation between advanced technology and skill (both measured in various
ways) in a cross-sectional analysis of U.S. …rms.
    Skill-biased technological heterogeneity implies that, on average, the most competitive …rms are also the
most skill-intensive. As a consequence, a fall in trade costs leads to both greater trade volumes and an
increase in the relative demand for skill, as the lowest-cost/most-skilled …rms expand to serve the export
market while less skill-intensive non-exporters retrench in the face of increased import competition. Thus,
trade liberalization leads directly to both greater trade volumes and an increase in the demand for skill. Cru-
cially, as long as productivity and skill intensity are positively correlated around the world, this mechanism
works regardless of factor endowment di¤erences. Thus, we provide an explanation for why globalization
and wage inequality move together in both skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries.
    Some other models also predict that trade liberalization may increase the skill premium globally, including
Feenstra and Hanson (1985), Acemoglu (2003), Zhu and Tre‡er (2005), and Burstein and Vogel (2010).
What is new in our model is the interaction between skill intensity, factor endowment di¤erences, and …rm
heterogeneity. This means that our model is consistent with the evidence on …rm-level heterogeneity and
exporting (see Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007) for a lucid discussion of this evidence).
    In our numerical analysis, we calibrate the model to …rm-level data from a small open economy, Chile in
1995. Using the calibrated model, we show how multilateral trade liberalization raises average productivity
and real GDP, and also increases the skill premium in both skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries.
    Our paper builds on a large theoretical and empirical literature in international trade and labor economics.
Two recent papers are most closely related to ours. Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007) connect the Melitz
model to the classic 2 2 2 Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model, and thereby integrate factor endowment
di¤erences with …rm-level productivity and factor intensity di¤erences. The model of Bernard, Redding, and
Schott (2007) delivers a Stolper-Samuelson-like theorem, and as such does not predict that relative factor
prices will move in the same direction in both trading countries. Burstein and Vogel (2010) work in a perfect
competition framework that has no role for …rm heterogeneity, but their elegant treatment of skill-biased
technology and its interaction with factor proportions o¤ers an explanation for the rising skill premium in
North and South that is similar to our explanation.
    Two other closely related papers are Yeaple (2005) and Vannoorenberghe (2011). These two models of
…rm heterogeneity and trade feature skilled and unskilled workers, and …nd that trade liberalization raises
the relative demand for skill and thus the skill premium. The mechanism in Yeaple (2005) operates purely
within …rms, and thus rules out the empirically important between-…rm compositional e¤ects that we study.
Most importantly, both Yeaple (2005) and Vannoorenberghe (2011) analyze trade between identical countries
only, and thus does not address the e¤ects of factor endowment di¤erences that are a key feature of our
model and of the global economy.
    Models in the Heckscher-Ohlin tradition connect preferences to production technology, in the sense that
the elasticity of substitution in demand is greater within goods of the same factor intensity. For example,
in the canonical 2 2 2 model, goods with the same factor intensity are homogeneous and therefore have
an in…nite elasticity of substitution across "varieties". We depart from this tradition, instead treating goods
symmetrically in demand, so that the elasticity of substitution in demand is independent of the skill intensity
of goods’ production. This is an intuitive assumption (why should preferences and production technology
be related a priori ?) which has striking implications. In particular, it implies that changes in import
competition a¤ect all import-competing …rms symmetrically. This contrasts with the Stolper-Samuelson
mechanism that is a feature of all Heckscher-Ohlin models, where the factor content of imports changes
relative demands for import competing goods. In our model the connection between trade liberalization and
factor prices operates through an entirely di¤erent channel.
    Our model treats each …rm’s production technology as …xed, with the factor market e¤ects of trade


                                                       2
liberalization due to a composition e¤ect: high-skill …rms gain market share globally at the expense of less
skill-intensive …rms. A complementary mechanism, which is not incorporated in our model, is that highly
productive …rms increase their skill intensity when faced with new export opportunities. This channel has
been studied in a partial equilibrium framework by Bustos (2011), who …nds that Argentinian exporters
invested in skill-upgrading in response to liberalized trade with Brazil, with liberalization leading to about
a two percentage point increase in the skill share for big relative to small …rms.3 Verhoogen (2008) …nds
that peso devaluation raised within-plant wage inequality in Mexican manufacturing, and that this e¤ect
was stronger for initially more productive …rms. Verhoogen (2008) plausibly interprets this result as sup-
port for within-plant quality and skill upgrading. A closely related general equilibrium theory of exporters
endogenously adopting more skilled technologies is developed by Yeaple (2005). As noted above, however,
Yeaple’s model only considers trade between identical countries, and thus does not address the interactions
between technology, trade and factor endowment di¤erences that are our concern.
    Other empirical studies have failed to …nd large e¤ects of trade liberalization on …rm-level or plant-level
skill upgrading. In their in‡uential early work, Bernard and Jensen (1997) and Bernard and Jensen (1999)
…nd that the export-related skill-upgrading of U.S. manufacturing was predominantly due to employment
shifts that favor skill-intensive plants, rather than di¤erentially rapid skill-upgrading by exporters. Similarly,
Tre‡er (2004) …nds that more skilled Canadian manufacturing plants expanded their relative employment
shares after trade liberalization with the United States, but did not engage in skill upgrading. We show below
that more skilled Chilean manufacturing plants are more likely to be exporters, but their skill intensity is not
a¤ected by the export decision. This empirical evidence for the United States, Canada, and Chile is consistent
with the mechanism in our model. Incorporating the partial equilibrium theoretical insights of Bustos (2011)
and Verhoogen (2008) into our general equilibrium framework would render our model intractable, so we
focus exclusively in what follows on between-…rm rather than within-…rm e¤ects of trade liberalization on
relative skill demand. It is clear that within-…rm skill upgrading in response to trade liberalization will have
e¤ects on the equilibrium skill premium that are complementary to the channel we analyze.

                                                         2.   THEORY


    In the Melitz model, there is one factor of production, and …rms are identical up to a Hicks neutral
productivity parameter ' that shifts marginal cost. In an important paper, Bernard, Redding, and Schott
(2007) combine the Melitz model with the classic 2 2 2 Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model, which yields
rich interactions between …rm heterogeneity and factor proportions di¤erences across sectors and countries.
Our model takes a di¤erent approach to combining …rm heterogeneity with factor proportions di¤erences: we
assume that …rms di¤er continuously in two dimensions, productivity and skill intensity. Just as Melitz’as-
sumption of heterogeneous …rm productivity was motivated by the evidence, our assumption of heterogeneity
in skill intensity is motivated by the fact that skill intensity varies at least as much within conventionally-
de…ned industries as it does between. Dunne, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Troske (2004) …nd this for the United
States (see their Figure 1), and we …nd it in our Chilean …rm dataset (see below).
    In incorporating a continuum of skill intensities we depart from the assumption, common to the entire
Heckscher-Ohlin tradition in trade theory, that the elasticity of substitution in demand is higher between
varieties produced with a common factor intensity than it is between goods produced with di¤erent factor
intensities. Instead, we assume that the elasticity of substitution between all goods is the same. This implies
that there are no Stolper-Samuelson e¤ects because import competition a¤ects all domestic …rms equally.
    In this section, we …rst develop the basic structure of our model, and then analyze equilibrium in two
cases. The …rst case considers trade between two identical countries, and the second introduces di¤erences
in aggregate factor endowment across countries.

                                       2.1.    Skill biased heterogeneous …rms
   As in Melitz (2003), …rms in our model must incur a sunk cost before discovering their variable cost
function. Production requires both skilled and unskilled labor, which are paid s and w respectively. We

                                                                3
assume that variable cost functions are Cobb-Douglas and di¤er in two dimensions, the skill share in marginal
cost and productivity in marginal cost ',

                                              cv ( ; '; s; w) = s w1                '   1
                                                                                            :                           (1)

Applying Shepard’s Lemma, it follows that skilled labor demand in variable cost per unit output is
                                                           s              s         1

Similarly, unskilled labor demand in variable cost per unit output is
                                                       s                        s               1

                                                       w                        w
Because ' is a Hicks-neutral productivity shifter, factor intensity in variable cost does not depend on pro-
ductivity,

                                          l      w    1        s
Inverse marginal cost, which we will refer to as "competitiveness" is
                                                                            '
                                                  ( ; '; s; w) =                        :                               (4)
                                                                          s w1
The technology parameters and ' are drawn simultaneously from a joint distribution function G ( ; '). As
will be seen below, …rms that have the same value of but di¤er in will be alike in almost every respect
(revenue, pro…tability, export status, etc.) except for their factor demands. Thus, while in Melitz (2003)
and Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007) …rms within an industry are indexed only by their productivity
', in our model the relevant index will in most settings be competitiveness .4
    There are three …xed cost activities in our model: entry, production for domestic sale, and exporting.
While factor intensity in variable costs di¤er across …rms in our model, we assume that factor intensity in
…xed costs are common across …rms. The …xed cost functions are

                                                 cfe (s; w) = ! (s; w) fe                                               (5)
                                                  cf (s; w) = ! (s; w) f                                                (6)
                                                cfx (s; w) = ! (s; w) fx ;                                              (7)
where fe , f , and fx denote …xed costs associated with entry, domestic production, and exporting respectively.
The factor cost term ! (s; w) is the same for all …rms and …xed cost activities. Furthermore, we assume that
the factor intensity of …xed costs is constant, and equal to the economy’s overall factor abundance,

                                                ! (s; w) = s + (1                   )w                                  (8)
                                                                          H
                                                                      =     ;                                           (9)

where H and L are the economy’s inelastic aggregate supplies of skilled and unskilled workers respectively.
An implication of (8) is that the average wage in …xed cost activities is the economy’s average wage. Because
we want to restrict the heterogeneity of …rms to di¤erences in their variable costs, we assume that and
' do not a¤ect productivity in …xed costs. As will be seen below, the …xed factor proportions assumption
neutralizes the e¤ect of variations in entry on aggregate relative factor demands.

   Preferences are given by a standard symmetric CES utility function with elasticity of substitution > 1.
The assumed market structure is monopolistic competition. As is well-known for this setup, …rms charge
a price p which is a constant markup over marginal cost. Marginal cost is 1= for sales in the domestic
market d and = for sales in the export market x, where > 1 is an iceberg transport cost factor, so
                                                                          1

    Our assumptions on demand imply that consumer preferences over goods have no connection to the factor
intensity of goods’production. This is a natural speci…cation, since preferences and production techniques are
logically separate concepts, and there is no particular empirical reason to think that they are linked. However,
this assumption is in sharp contrast to the Heckscher-Ohlin tradition in trade theory. In the canonical 2 2 2
model, the two homogeneous goods di¤er in their factor intensity, there is a …nite elasticity of substitution
between the goods, and an in…nite elasticity of substitution across "varieties" within goods. In their
integration of monopolistic competition into the 2 2 2 model, Helpman and Krugman (1985) maintain
this ranking of elasticities of substitution in less extreme form: there is a …nite elasticity of substitution
  > 1 across varieties produced with a given factor intensity, and a smaller elasticity of substitution across
varieties produced with di¤erent factor intensities. The same assumptions on preferences are made by
Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007) and Burstein and Vogel (2010). Like our model, the model of Romalis
(2004) features monopolistic competition and Cobb-Douglas production where the factor cost shares vary
continuously. Following Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1980), Romalis identi…es goods with their
factor intensity, and assumes that the elasticity of substitution across goods is one while the elasticity across
varieties within goods is greater than one. As will become clear in what follows, our decision to break with
this Heckscher-Ohlin tradition and sever the link between preferences and production technology has major
implications for how factor markets respond to trade liberalization.

                                    2.3.    Equilibrium with identical countries
    In this section, we consider trade between two countries that are identical in every way, including their
factor endowments H and L and the distribution G ( ; ') from which entering …rms draw their technology5 .
Generalizing our analysis to more than two symmetric countries is trivial. Entering …rms must pay a …xed
cost ! (s; w) fe to learn their technology, a …xed cost ! (s; w) f if they wish to sell in the domestic market,
and a …xed cost ! (s; w) fx if they wish to export. Much of this section is based closely on Melitz (2003), so
we move quickly.

2.3.1.    Firm behavior
   With monopolistic competition and CES preferences, …rm-level demand depends on aggregate nominal
income R and the aggregate price index P: Since prices depend only on each …rm’s competitiveness ;
revenue and sales will di¤er across two …rms if and only if they di¤er in . Standard computations show
that the associated sales revenue r and pro…ts from domestic sales d and exporting x are

Note that we have de…ned x ( ) as the pro…t from exporting only. If a …rm sells in both export and domestic
markets, then its aggregate pro…ts will be d ( ) + x ( ).
   Firms will sell in a market only if pro…ts from doing so are non-negative. Thus, equations (14) and (15)
implicitly de…ne the minimum levels of for which …rms will choose to sell at home and abroad,

Dividing (17) by (16) and substituting using (12) and (13) implies
                                                                                  1

the expected value of entry is equal to the …xed entry cost. To develop this free entry condition, we follow

Although the factor cost terms ! (s; w) associated with the …xed costs do not appear in (27), factor prices do
enter the equation because they help determine the boundaries of the sets D and X. Thus, unlike Bernard,
Redding, and Schott (2007), it is necessary to solve for factor prices jointly with the cuto¤ .

2.3.3.    Labor Market Equilibrium
    The labor market equilibrium conditions in our model are quite di¤erent from the corresponding condi-
tions in Melitz (2003) and Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007). The reason is that in our model, each
…rm’s demand for skilled and unskilled labor depends on its technology draw ( ; ') as well as factor prices.
In particular, two …rms that have the same level of ; and thus the same prices, revenues, etc. may have
di¤erent demands for labor.
    From the expressions for inverse marginal cost, prices and revenue (equations 4, 10, 11, 12, and 13), we
obtain total output for domestic sale and for export,

Total labor demand for exporters is the sum of labor used for domestic and export sales.
   The mass of …rms in the economy in equilibrium is M , and the mass of exporters is Mx = M: To
compute aggregate labor demand in variable cost we integrate over the per-…rm labor demands for all active
…rms, and multiply by the mass of …rms.6 This gives aggregate labor demand
  6 The   densities for domestic and exporting …rms equal g ( ; ') divided by the probablities                          and         respectively.

Next we develop aggregate labor demand in …xed cost activities. Let the number of prospective new …rms
at each moment be Me ; of whom a fraction d will produce after discovering their technology. In steady
state equilibrium, the number of new …rms per unit time equals the number of dying …rms, d Me = M .
Thus for each active …rm, there are = d entrants, of whom a fraction are also exporters. Using (5), (6),
and (7) gives total …xed costs per active …rm7

                                                                            fe

By Shepard’s lemma, skilled and unskilled labor demand in …xed cost activities are

                                                                    fe

                                                                            d

Dividing (38) by (39) gives aggregate relative skill demand in …xed cost activities as
                                                          Hf
                                                             =                      :                                     (40)
                                                          Lf   1
By our parameterization of in (9), it immediately follows that Hf =Lf = H=L. Thus variations in the level
of …xed cost activities do not a¤ect the aggregate relative skill supply available for variable cost production.
This allows us to state the relative labor market clearing condition using (36) as

                                                     Hv (s; w;              )   H
                                                                              =   :                                       (41)
                                                     Lv (s; w;              )   L
At this point we choose the unskilled wage w as our numeraire, w = 1; so s is the skill premium.8 The relative
labor market clearing condition (41) and the free entry condition (27) constitute a two equation system in
two endogenous variables, s and       : As will be seen in the next section, all the rest of the endogenous
variables in the model are functions of    and s; so equations (27) and (41) are the key equations for solving
the symmetric country version of our model.
  7 See    Baldwin (2005) for more on this treatment of …xed costs in the Melitz model.
  8 To    ensure that s 1; we assume that skilled workers can work as unskilled workers if they choose, but not vice versa.




                                                                    8
2.3.4.     Aggregation and equilibrium
   To close the model we need to determine the aggregates M, R and P. Although w is our numeraire, we
continue to write it out explicitly in what follows for clarity and to prepare for the analysis of the model
with factor endowment di¤erences in the next section.
   As in Melitz (2003), the free entry condition implies that pro…ts equal the expenditure on …xed costs,
which in turn is paid to labor. Thus all revenue goes to labor, so

                                                              R = sH + wL :                                                       (42)
Revenue of the average …rm is related to the pro…t of the average …rm by                                     = r=   ! (s; w) (f + f ) :
Substituting from the free entry condition (26) gives

                                                                                    fe
                                                r = ! (s; w) f + f +                         :                                    (43)

This allows us to determine the mass of …rms,9

The price index comes from the CES utility function, and depends on the prices of domestically produced
and imported goods. Using the pricing equations (10) and (11) in the standard formula for the CES price
index gives
                                                                                                     1

                                                          d                     x


This completes the description of the model in the case of identical countries. Equations (27) and (41) solve
for     and s. Equation (18) then determines x ; which allows computation of ~ d and ~ x using (23) and
(24). The aggregates R, M, and P can then be computed using equations (42), (44), and (45). All …rm
level variables are functions of s, R, and P.

2.3.5.     Trade liberalization and the skill premium
    In our model, as in Melitz (2003), exporters are low cost …rms. In the data, a common …nding is that
exporters are more skill intensive than non-exporting …rms, even within industries. We will present data
below that illustrates the skill bias of exporters for Chile, and the same is true for the United States (see
for example Table 3 in Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007)). In this section we show the factor
market consequences of trade liberalization in the empirically relevant case of skill-biased technology. We
also analyze the case where there is no relationship between technology and skill intensity.,

    Skill biased technology. If the skill premium is positive (s=w > 1) ; then skill intensive …rms will have
higher costs, controlling for productivity '. Therefore, in our model the only way for exporters to be more
skill-intensive than the average is if skill intensity and productivity ' are positively correlated when …rms
draw their technology parameters. In such a case, high skill intensity is on average associated with high
competitiveness . For now we simply assume such a correlation in the ex ante technology distribution
G ( ; '), and we will calibrate the correlation in the numerical analysis below.
    What does our model imply about the labor market e¤ects of opening to trade? Holding factor prices
…xed for the moment, our model works exactly like Melitz (2003): opening to trade reduces revenue in the
domestic market because of import competition, and creates opportunities for extra revenue in the export
market. In the new equilibrium, the survival cuto¤        rises, and with costly trade the export cuto¤ x is
higher than . For new exporters, labor demand rises, while for non-exporters labor demand falls. By our
assumption on G ( ; ') ; the exporting …rms are more skill intensive on average than the non-exporting …rms,
so the expansion of the former and the contraction of the latter means a shift up in the relative demand for

                                                                     9
skill, equation (36).    To satisfy the relative labor market clearing condition (41), the skill premium must
rise. We thus have
    Proposition 1. Opening to trade between identical countries with skill-biased heterogeneous …rms leads
to a increase in the skill premium in both countries.

    Proof: See Appendix 1.

The e¤ects on the sets of surviving and exporting …rms are illustrated in Figure 2.
    The result that trade liberalization may raise the skill premium appears in other models, as noted in
our introduction. What is new in our model is the integration of relative labor demand e¤ects with …rm
heterogeneity, as well as the ability of the model to match key moments in the data (see Section 3 below).10
Our model predicts that exporters are both more skill-intensive and more productive than non-exporters,
and it is this interaction that generates the increased skill premium with trade liberalization.
    There are aggregate welfare gains from opening to trade in our model, but the factor price e¤ects leave
open the possibility that unskilled workers may see real wage losses from opening to trade. We investigate
this issue in our numerical analysis below.

    No skill bias in technology. We now consider the case where the skill share and productivity ' are
independent, so that the the ex ante technology distribution can be written as the product of the marginal
distributions, G ( ; ') = G ( ) G' ('). There are no analytical results for this case in general. However,
if the distribution of ' is Pareto and the distribution of is uniform, we show in Appendix 1 that trade
liberalization increases the survival cuto¤ for competitiveness      and reduces the export cuto¤ x but has
has no e¤ect on the skill premium. The intuition for this result is straightforward: opening to trade has the
standard pro-competitive e¤ects, but the resulting changes in …rm-level relative labor demand are not biased
in favor of either skilled or unskilled labor. We also show that relative factor prices depend only on relative
factor endowments. We collect these results in
    Proposition 2. When skill intensity and productivity ' are independent, with ' distributed Pareto
and distributed uniform, and countries are identical, relative factor prices depend only on relative factor
endowments. Trade liberalization raises the survival cuto¤    and reduces the export cuto¤ x and has no
e¤ ect on the skill premium.
    Proof: See Appendix 1.

    Though Proposition 2 only holds for particular choices for the distributions of and productivity ', in
our numerical analysis below we show that trade liberalization between identical countries with no skill bias
in technology has very close to zero e¤ect on the skill premium. Propositions 1 and 2 together illustrate
the point that it is skill-bias in technology which leads to factor market e¤ects of trade liberalization in our
model.

                           2.4.    Equilibrium with factor endowment di¤erences
    In this section we extend our model to consider trade between countries that di¤er in their relative factor
endowments. We continue to assume that countries have the same cost functions and ex ante technology
distributions G ( ; '). This is an interesting and relevant case, and the basic logic of the model is very
similar to the identical country case. However the need to keep track of two countries (who we denote by
A and B superscripts) complicates the notation considerably. Where possible we closely follow Bernard,
Redding, and Schott (2007), who develop an elegant approach to analyzing non-identical countries in a
Melitz-style model.
  1 0 Vannoorenberghe (2011) gets the same result in a simpler model, with one-dimensional …rm heterogeneity and no free entry

of …rms. Vannoorenberghe (2011) does not move beyond the symmetric country case, however, which we do next.

It is instructive to compare these expressions to equation (18). Unlike in the identical country case, the
endogenous variables Rc and P c enter the relationship between c and xc ; so we can not ensure c < xc
simply by a choice of parameters. Nonetheless, since exporters are generally found to be larger and more
productive than non-exporters in the data, we will focus exclusively on equilibria where c 1:
    The cuto¤s de…ne regions of active and exporting …rms as in equations (19) and (20), with c superscripts
as appropriate. The same is true for the de…nitions of entry and export probabilities given by (21) and (22).

2.4.2.   Free entry
   The free entry condition in each country is virtually the same as in the identical country case. With
                                                          c       c
appropriate c superscripts, the competitiveness averages e and ex are de…ned as in equations (23) and (24),
and the free entry conditions are given by (27). A complication relative to the identical country case is that
the the aggregates Rc and P c enter the free entry conditions, through equations (53) and (54).




                                                                               11
2.4.3.   Labor market equilibrium
    In our development of the relative labor market clearing condition (41) in the identical country case,
it was convenient that the aggregates Rc and P c cancelled out when forming (41). This is no longer the
case because of asymmetries in market sizes. In most instances the correct expressions can be obtained by
replacing 1 with c .
    With appropriate country superscripts on s; w; P; and R, the equations relevant for labor market equi-
librium are changed only slightly. Physical output for sale in the domestic market is as given by equation
(28). Output for the export market is given by equation (29), except that 1               is replaced by c : The
…rm-level labor demand equations (30) and (31) are the same as before. Equations (32), (33), (34) and
(35) are the same except that 1 is replaced by c . Because c now enters each aggregate labor demand
equation, terms involving the aggregate variables Rc and P c no longer cancel when dividing (34) by (35).
The signi…cance of this is that it is no longer possible to solve for factor prices separately from the aggregates
Rc and P c : Instead, factor market equilibrium requires setting labor demand in variable cost equal to labor
supply minus labor used in …xed costs:
                                                                     c
                                                Hvc (sc ; wc ;           ) = Hc             Hfc                           (55)
                                                                     c
                                                Lcv (sc ; wc ;           ) = Lc            Lcf :                          (56)
The treatment of labor used in …xed costs is unchanged, except that we introduce a technological di¤erence
across countries by letting the parameter c = H c =Lc be country speci…c. As in the identical country model,
the purpose of this assumption is to neutralize any e¤ects of entry on aggregate relative factor demand.

2.4.4.   Aggregation and equilibrium
    The determination of R and M follow equations (42) and (44), which are unchanged despite di¤erences
                                                                           c      c

This completes the description of the model with non-identical countries.
   Although the underlying economics of the model is unchanged, solution is more challenging when countries
are not identical because all the endogenous variables in both countries need to be solved simultaneously.
                                                                                               1
The economics behind this complexity is that each country’s per-…rm demand shifter Rc (P c )     enters the
other country’s productivity cuto¤s. We sketch our solution method here, with more details in Appendix 2.
   De…ne the following vector of seven equilibrium variables
                                                                         A           B

where we set wA = 1 as our numeraire. Given an arbitrary , the remaining equilibrium values can be
determined as follows. First we determine Rc from (42). Then we can determine xc by (53) and (54).
                                                                                           c       c
Given all cuto¤s and factor prices we compute cd and c using (21) and (22), as well as ~ and ~ x using (23)
and (24). Then we can compute M c from (44).          is indeed an equilibrium if it satis…es seven equations:
three factor market clearing conditions (equations (55) and (56) for each country, with one equation discarded
as redundant), two free entry conditions (equation (27) for each country), and two price indices (57) and
(58).

2.4.5.   Trade liberalization and the skill premium
    What e¤ects do trade liberalization have in the asymmetric country version of our model? Full analysis
can only be done numerically, but some insight can be gained through analytical reasoning. In all of what
follows, we assume that country A ("North") is more skill abundant than country B ("South").
    Consider the two countries in autarky. If skilled labor is su¢ ciently scarce, the skill premium will be
positive in both countries, and higher in B,

                                               s B       s A
                                                    >         >1:                                      (59)
                                               w         w
We consider two cases. The …rst is the "no skill bias" case, where ' and are uncorrelated. The second,
and empirically relevant, "skill biased" case is where ' and are strongly positively correlated. Skill bias
implies that unit costs and skill intensity are negatively correlated.

    No skill bias in technology. In the no bias case when (59) holds, in autarky there is a negative average
relationship between unit costs and factor intensity, with more skill intensive …rms having higher unit costs.
In short, having a high skill share is bad news for a …rm: it means that they have higher labor costs without,
on average, any associated technological advantage.
    Now consider an opening to costly trade. Holding factor costs …xed, this will lead to an expansion of the
lower-cost …rms in both countries, and contraction or exit for higher cost …rms. Because the low-cost …rms
are less skill intensive, this will lead to an increased relative demand for unskilled workers in both countries.
So we have

   Conjecture 1 If ' and         are uncorrelated, and autarky skill premiums satisfy (59), then opening to
costly trade leads to a fall in the skill premium in both countries.

    We are emphatically no longer in a Heckscher-Ohlin world. The reason is simple: in our model there is
no connection between factor intensity and preferences. As a result, an increase in import competition in our
model, whatever the skill content of the imported goods, a¤ects demand for all domestically produced goods
symmetrically. In models with a Heckscher-Ohlin structure, by contrast, an increase in import competition
changes the relative demand for domestically produced goods. Because relative goods demand is directly
linked to relative factor demands, Stolper-Samuelson type results follow. In our model the factor price e¤ects
of opening to trade have nothing to do with demand and everything to do with supply: since skill-intensive
…rms have higher costs, opening to trade reduces the relative demand for skilled workers.

   Skill biased technology. We now turn to the empirically relevant case, where skill intensity is associated
with higher factor costs but also better technology on average. We focus on the case where the technology
e¤ect is dominant, so that on average more skill intensive …rms have lower unit costs. Now consider an
opening to costly trade. Holding factor costs …xed, this will lead to an expansion of the lower-cost …rms in
both countries, and contraction or exit for higher cost …rms. This will lead to an increase in the relative
demand for skill in both countries. To restore factor market equilibrium, the skill premium must rise in
both countries. We summarize this reasoning as

    Conjecture 2 If productivity ' and are strongly positively correlated, then opening to costly trade
leads to a rise in the skill premium in both countries.

   We demonstrate below that Conjectures 1 and 2 hold in our numerical simulations.

   The inisght that opening to trade raises the skill premium globally is similar to what we showed for
identical countries in Proposition 1, and the mechanism is the same here.




                                                       13
    Trade patterns. Although the factor price e¤ects of opening to trade in our model are very di¤erent
from what is found in Heckscher-Ohlin models, the trade patterns are broadly in line with Heckscher-Ohlin
predictions, although the mechanism is di¤erent. Because the skill premium remains lower in A than in
B after liberalization, A will have a comparative advantage in high skilled goods, and production in each
country will shift toward comparative advantage goods. In our model, what we mean by comparative
advantage is that high-skill exporters are more likely to come from A, while low-skill exporters are more
likely to come from B. The specialization pattern is illustrated in Figure 3, which is drawn on the assumption
that the overall level of competition is less intense in B than in A (this is not essential, but it is what we
…nd in our numerical analysis below).

                  2.5.    Quality competition: an alternative interpretation of the model
    Our model assumes two-dimensional heterogeneity in …rms’ technology, combined with symmetry in
demand. Firms’revenue and pro…ts are indexed by their inverse unit cost ; and larger …rms charge lower
prices because they have lower unit costs (see equation 10). A way to summarize this is that in our model (as
well as in the models of Melitz (2003), Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007), and others) …rms "compete on
cost." This con‡icts with evidence amassed by many authors, including Verhoogen (2008) and Baldwin and
Harrigan (2011), that exporters more often "compete on quality", with more successful …rms actually having
higher costs and prices than less successful …rms. In this subsection we show that our model can easily be
converted into a model of quality competition, with quality being positively correlated with skill intensity.11
For readers uninterested in the details, the punchline is simple: none of the implications of our model for
trade, gains from trade, or factor prices are a¤ected by rewriting it as a model of quality competition.
    Suppose that ' is not a parameter of cost but of demand. In particular, let the utility function be
                                                   Z h           i                   1

                                                          ' (i)

In this framework, ' (i) is a demand shifter which we will call "quality", and the price index is a symmetric

                                             cv ( ; s; w) = s w1  :
Pricing is also independent of quality,

                                                                      s w1

Substituting price into demand and multiplying by price leads to expressions for revenue and pro…ts which
are the same as equations (12) through (15). As in our main model, all that matters for revenue and pro…ts
is competitiveness. In the main model competitiveness is simply inverse unit cost, while here it is inverse
unit cost times quality '. The development of the zero pro…t cuto¤s is the same as before, which leads to
 1 1 This   correlation is exactly what Kugler and Verhoogen (2010) …nd for Colombia.


                                                              14
de…nitions of the regions D and X which are the same as those given by (19) and (20), except that ' is
              1
replaced by ' : Substituting the de…nition of competitiveness (4) into (12) gives the following expression
for domestic revenue as a function of quality,
                                                                 1           1
                                  rd ( ; '; s; w) = R ( P )          s w1        '    1
                                                                                          :

The corresponding expression in the main model is identical.
    Expressions for labor demand are also unchanged. Following the same steps as in section 2.3.3 leads to
expressions for …rm-level labor demand which are identical to equations (30) and (31) above.
    We see that in both the main model and the quality-competition variant employment and revenue have
the same elasticity with respect to '. Thus, anything that a¤ects the revenue distribution (such as a trade
liberalization) will have the same e¤ects on labor demand in either model. It is straightforward to close the
quality-competition model in exactly the way we proceeded above for the main model.
    The …nal step is to suppose that after paying their sunk entry costs, …rms jointly draw their skill intensity
and quality from G ( ; '). As argued by Kugler and Verhoogen (2010), producing high quality is likely to
require a more skilled labor force, which implies that Cov ( ; ') > 0; just as in the main model. With this
assumption, all our results about the labor market e¤ects of trade liberalization go through unchanged.
    Our conclusion from this subsection is simple: the quality competition variant of our model of skill biased
heterogeneous …rms has the same workings and implications as the main model. With this point established,
we put aside the quality competition variant for the remainder of the paper.

                                3.   EMPIRICAL AND NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

    In this section we bring numbers to bear on our model in three ways. First, we examine a plant-level data
set from a small open economy, Chile 1990-1995, and show that key features of the Chilean data match the
key assumptions of our model. Second, we use the Chilean data in 1995 to calibrate our identical country
model. Lastly, we use the numerical version of our model to illustrate its workings, with a focus on the
e¤ects of trade liberalization on the skill premium.

                                          3.1.    Chilean plant level data
    Our data source is the Annual National Industrial Survey of Chile (Encuesta Nacional Industrial Annual,
or ENIA).12 The ENIA is conducted annually by the Chilean government statistical o¢ ce (Instituto Nacional
de Estadistica, or INE). The ENIA covers the universe of Chilean manufacturing plants with 10 or more
workers. Pavcnik (2002) indicates that in 1979-1986 more than 90% of Chilean manufacturing …rms had
only one plant, so the distinction between plants and …rms is unlikely to be very important. Our concept of
a skilled worker is captured in the ENIA by white collar workers.13 For each of these plants we construct
the following variables:

      log revenue
      export intensity = export revenue / total revenue
      log average wage

      white collar employment share
      white collar wage bill share
      export status (1 if export revenue > 0).
 1 2 We thank James Tybout for generosly providing us this data.
 1 3 Proxying  skill by "white collar" is problematic, though it is (by necessity) common practice in studies that use plant
level data. Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994) show that for the United States, the production/non-production worker
classi…cation is a good proxy for skilled and unskilled workers.




                                                            15
    Standard regression-based methods (such as Olley-Pakes) of computing plant-level total factor productiv-
ity (TFP) are not applicable here. The reason is simple: regression-based TFP calculations need to assume
that factor shares are constant across all plants. This is both empirically false (as we show immediately
below) and contradicts the mechanism of our theory. The absence of plant-level TFP is not a drawback for
our purposes, as our minimum distance estimator (discussed below) identi…es all the necesary parameters
using the data moments that we do have.

3.1.1.   The 1995 Chilean plant cross section
    5,112 plants were surveyed in 1995. We eliminated 163 plants that did not report positive revenues. We
also eliminated 346 plants that had either white collar employment share or white collar wage bill share
equal to 0 or 1 (these coincide 93% of the times). These plants account for 5.3% of total revenue in the
sample and are 30% smaller on average, but their distribution of revenues is not very dissimilar from the
rest, so that this elimination does not a¤ect much the overall distribution of revenues. However, only 4.6%
of these plants export, compared to 24.3% of the other plants.
    Thus, we use a cross section of 4,603 plants in 1995, of which 24.3% are exporters. Table 1 shows that
exporting plants are larger and more skill-intensive than non-exporters. The distribution of log revenues for
exporters is less skewed to the right, i.e. the largest exporters are closer to their respective mean than the
largest …rms that do not export. As with log revenues, we see that the distribution of the skill employment
and wage bill shares for exporters are less skewed to the right. Figure 4 shows the wage bill shares for
white collar workers among exporters and non-exporters. The most interesting aspect of Figure 4 is not the
di¤erence in median skill shares (which is well known) but the variability: many exporters have low skill
shares, and conversely for non-exporters. In fact, the variation of the skill share within the exporter/non-
exporter categories is essentially the same as the overall variation.14 Table 2 shows that the correlation
between log revenues and the white collar wage bill share is positive, and slightly more so for exporters.
Figure 5 illustrates this relationship, and the variability in this …gure motivates the key feature of our model:
the positive but imperfect correlation between skill intensity and size. We exploit these di¤erences when
choosing parameter values for the joint distribution of skilled labor share and productivity in the model.
    In addition, the …rm-level skill share varies both within industries and across industries, but the within
variation is much larger: between 4-digit ISIC industries, the standard deviation of the skill share is 0.11,
while within industries the standard deviation is more than half again as big, at 0.17.

3.1.2.   The 1990-1995 Chilean plant panel
    In principle there are at least two mechanisms that can account for a correlation between export status
and skill intensity: skill-intensive plants select into exporting, or exporters choose to become more skill
intensive. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In our model we focus on the …rst mechanism,
though as noted in our introduction there is evidence in some data sets for the latter mechanism as well. In
this subsection we brie‡y investigate this question in our Chilean data.
    Our tool is a series of very simple panel regressions with plant and year …xed e¤ects, along with indicators
of export status:
                                                                        0
                                               yit =    i   +   t   +       xit + "it ;
where yit is an outcome of interest (log revenue or wage bill share of skilled workers), xit is a vector of
export participation indicators, and "it is interpreted simply as the prediction error from a linear projection.
Estimation is by OLS with standard errors clustered by plant.
    Table 3 shows our results. The Panel A tells a simple and utterly unsurprising story: entering into
exporting leads to big increases in revenue. Panel B, which investigates within-plant variation in the skill
share over time, shows no statistically signi…cant evidence of skill upgrading when plants enter into exporting.
We get virtually the same results when the regressand is the skilled employment share. As noted in the
introduction, this result is consistent with the evidence for the U.S. (Bernard and Jensen (1997), Bernard
and Jensen (1999)) and Canada (Tre‡er (2004)). Our conclusion from this simple exercise is that the Chilean
  1 4 The overall standard deviation of the skill share is 0.197. Within exporters the standard deviation is 0.205, while within

non-exporters it is 0.185. The R2 of a regression of the skill share on an indicator for export status is just 0.07.


                                                                16
plant level data set is a reasonable source of information for calibrating some of the key parameters of our
model, and we turn to this next.

                3.2.   Modelling the correlation between skill intensity and productivity
   A key innovation in our model is that we allow for positive but imperfect correlation between skill intensity
  and productivity ': This is motivated by the cross-sectional evidence that is vividly illustrated in Figures
4 and 5. To implement this we …rst specify the marginal distributions of          and ', and then model the
correlation between them.
   It is standard to model variation in productivity with a Pareto distribution, and we follow this practice
here. Since the skill share lies in the unit interval, we model it as following a Beta distribution. These
densities are respectively15
                                                                           k 1

                                                 g ( )=                                :                                   (61)

To ‡exibly allow correlation between ' and while maintaining their marginal distributions, we apply the
theory of copulas from mathematical statistics (the standard reference is Nelsen (2006)).16 The theory of
copulas was …rst used in international trade theory by Davis and Harrigan (2011), also to accommodate two
dimensions of heterogeneity in a Melitz-type model. Letting the marginal distribution functions for and
' be G ( ) and G' (') respectively, our parameterization of G ( ; ') uses the Plackett copula,
                                                  p

                                                                       1         2 log

and positive correlation when > 1: There is no expression available for the correlation between ' and :
In our simulations we use = 11, which gives Corr( ; log ') = 0:48.

                                         3.3.     Estimation and Calibration
    We use a minimum distance estimator to estimate four distributional parameters:

        k –the Pareto shape coe¢ cient in (60).
        a; b –two parameters of the beta distribution in (61).
            –the Plackett copula association parameter in (62).

We hold constant all other parameters of the model. For comparability with the literature, we use the
following parameters that are used by Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007):

            = 3:8 (estimated by Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003))
  1 5 For                                                                                                        (a) (b)
          the Pareto distribution, we normalize the lower bound to one. For the Beta distribution, B (a; b) = (a+b) ; where
  (:) is the gamma function.
  1 6 In the simplest case, a copula is a function that binds two marginal distribution functions to create a joint distribution

function, with the degree of association between the marginal distributions governed by the parameter of the copula.



                                                              17
      fe = 20
      f = fx = 1
        = 0:025

Changing these parameters a¤ects the estimation results below, but we do not investigate this systematically.
The aggregate labor force is set at 100 workers, with skill abundance H=L as in the Chilean data: 0.26
(roughly 20% are skilled workers).
    For the sake of estimating the remaining distributional parameters, we must calibrate the variable trade
cost parameter as well. To do this, we exploit the fact that in the symmetric country model export intensity
(ratio of export revenue to total revenue) is 1 = 1 + 1        . The average export intensity in the Chilean
data for 1995 is roughly 0.28. Given the parameterization of = 3:8, this gives roughly = 1:4.
    Estimation proceeds as follows. Given a guess of parameter values we simulate the model for the sym-
metric open economy case and calculate a vector of moments, (k; a; b; ). We choose (k; a; b; ) to minimize
                                                         d 0                       d
                                         (k; a; b; )           W    (k; a; b; )        ;
where    d
          are corresponding moments from the Chilean plant data and W is a weighting matrix.17
   We use the following moments to estimate these parameters, with the model moments calculated by
simulation:

      Overall correlation between log revenues and white collar wage bill share. This moment largely identi…es
       .
      The di¤erence between average log revenues for exporters versus non exporters.
      Proportion of exporters. Together with the previous one, this moment identi…es k. Even though we
      have a functional relationship between     and x , it does not determine the percent of exporters, which
      is in‡uenced by how fat the right tail of the Pareto distribution is.
      The 5, 25, 50, 75 and 95 percentiles of the white collar wage bill share distribution, separately for
      exporters and non exporters (10 separate moments). These moments identify a and b, and also help
      to identify .

   In order to specify the weighting matrix we make some arbitrary choices: we multiply the deviations
from the percent of exporters by four; and we multiply the deviations from the empirical percentiles by
two. These weights are chosen to avoid a large spike in the distribution of for …rms who serve only the
domestic market. Since we do not have a priori information about which moment is more important, this
seems to be a reasonable choice.
   The estimates are

      k = 3:6
      a = 2; b = 3:53
        = 11.

These are what we use throughout all numerical exercises, and they imply a correlation of 0.48 between the
skilled wage share and productivity ', or 0.6 between and log '.
    One remarkable result is that simulation of the model using the estimates yields distributions of log
revenue and the wage bill share that match the shape of the empirical distributions very closely, in particular
Figure 4. Although …rms with a high skilled workers wage bill share have higher factor costs (given a
positive skill premium), we see relatively more such exporters versus non exporters. The estimation captures
this feature, because it assigns a positive correlation with productivity, = 11.
  1 7 See Cameron and Trivedi (2005) for the relevant econometric theory. Using simulation to calculate model moments intro-

duces some additional error, in addition to sampling error. This error vanishes with the number of draws used to compute the
moments. We use one million draws, so this type of error is likely to be very small. See Stern (1997) for a clear exposition of
simulation based estimation.


                                                               18
    The estimate k = 3:6 is not far from what Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007) use, 3:4, and it obeys
k>       1, which is a requirement for convergence of integrals in Pareto-Melitz type models (see e.g. Baldwin
(2005)). Although the distribution of is not identically Pareto, it is rather close to Pareto, especially for
exporters, i.e. in the upper tail of the distribution. The log           log (rank ( )) scatter (not reported) is
virtually a straight line for all active …rms and for exporters. For strictly domestic …rms, which have a much
smaller (and bounded) range of , the in‡uence of variation in is much more important, and therefore
the distribution of for this subset of active …rms is far from Pareto: the log         log (rank ( )) scatter is a
curved line.


                                   3.4.    Equilibrium with identical countries
    In this section we simulate the identical country version of our model, using the parameters described
above. Both countries have relative skill endowments of H=L = 0.26, and the exercise lowers variable trade
costs from autarky, = 1; to costless trade, = 1.18 Results are illustrated in Figure 6 and the …rst
column of panel A of Table 4.
    The purely Melitz side of the model is illustrated in the four panels of Figure 6a. Trade liberalization
leads to heightened competition, which is manifested in progressively higher survival cost cuto¤s and lower
export cost cuto¤s. The result is less equilibrium entry, and the mass of …rms is smaller. Unlike in Melitz
(2003), the weighted average productivity of active …rms is not a useful summary statistic, since it is unit
cost, rather than productivity per se, that determines …rm success in our model. Instead, we focus on real
GDP (nominal GDP divided by the aggregate price index) as a summary of the economy-wide e¤ects of
trade liberalization. As expected, real GDP rises substantially as trade barriers are reduced, with the move
from autarky to costless trade raising real GDP by 19 percent.
    The novelty in our model comes from the factor market consequences of trade liberalization, which are
illustrated in the three panels of Figure 6b. The skill premium rises substantially as trade barriers fall, from
2.84 in autarky to 2.98 for moderate trade costs ( = 1.4), an increase of 5 percent. Complete elimination
of variable trade costs raises the skill premium by 7.7 percent compared to autarky. Real skilled wages
rise by almost ten percent in the move from autarky to moderate trade costs, while unskilled workers see
more modest real wage increases of 4 percent. It is notable that all workers share in the gains from trade
despite the rise in relative skill demand. The reason for this is the improvement in aggregate e¢ ciency
caused by trade liberalization, with high-cost low-skill …rms exiting or contracting and low-cost, high-skill
…rms entering the export market.19
    The second column of Panel A of Table 4 summarizes how our results di¤er when we nearly double skill
abundance, from 0.26 (the level in our Chilean data set) to 0.5. The gains from trade are slightly higher, and
the increase in the skill premium is much smaller, rising just 3.5 percent in the move from autarky to costless
trade. The increase in real wages is 22 percent for skilled workers and 18 percent for unskilled workers. The
explanation for this contrast is that skill bias puts a premium on skilled workers when trade is liberalized:
when they are much more abundant, the economy as a whole gains more, with the gains from trade more
evenly shared between skilled and unskilled workers.

                           3.5.    Equilibrium with factor endowment di¤erences
    Next we turn to trade liberalization between countries that di¤er in their factor endowments. The
                                        A                B
relative factor endowments are (H=L) = 0:5 and (H=L) = 0:1, and we scale country B’s population so
that real GDP is the same in both countries in autarky. These factor abundances are chosen to roughly
match the skill abundance of the United States and low-income developing countries respectively, and real
GDP in autarky is equalized to neutralize market size e¤ects. In all other respects the two countries are
identical, most importantly in their ex ante skill-productivity distributions G ( ; '). As in the previous
exercise, we lower variable trade costs from = 1 to = 1. Results are illustrated in Figure 7, and in the
  1 8 We maintain …xed costs for exporting that are equal to the …xed costs of entering the home market throughout. For brevity,

we say that trade is "costless" when variable trade costs are zero.
  1 9 Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007) …nd a similar result in their model: the aggregate e¢ ciency e¤ect implies that the

scarce factor may gain in real terms from opening to trade. In their quantitative exercise they …nd that the real return to the
scarce factor does indeed increase when trade opens.



                                                              19
…nal three columns of Panel A of Table 4. In computing the equilibria, we choose global nominal GDP as
our numeraire, so nominal values are in units of a common currency.
    In this numerical exercise we are not attempting to fully calibrate the model to any particular pair
of countries or trade liberalization episode. By abstracting from di¤erences in autarky country size and
technology distributions, we isolate the mechanisms which are new to our model, which are the interactions
between trade liberalization, factor proportions di¤erences, and skill biased heterogeneous …rms. Thus the
quantitative results here should be interpreted as plausible numerical examples rather than estimates of the
e¤ects of an actual trade liberalization episode.20
    The four panels of Figure 7a illustrate the expected Melitz-type mechanisms: as trade is liberalized,
entry becomes more di¢ cult, the mass of …rms falls, and the share of exporters gets monotonically higher.
Aggregate gains from trade are shown by rising real GDP in both countries. Country B is a somewhat less
competitive market than A, which is seen in the higher cost cuto¤s for A and the associated higher probability
of entry in B. The reason for this is an interaction between skill bias and the higher skill premium in B:
skill bias implies that the lowest cost …rms are the most skill-intensive on average in both countries, but
because of the higher skill premium in B the cost advantage for the best …rms is smaller in B than in A.
This di¤erence in the ex ante cost distributions in the two countries is illustrated in Figure 8: B has more
low-end and fewer high-end …rms than does A; in both autarky and costless trade equilibria. Thus high cost
…rms in B earn more revenue than high cost …rms in A, which makes survival easier. A ‡ip side to this is
that A gains a bit more from trade: trade puts a premium on skill, and A’s greater skill abundance and
lower skill premium means it can better take advantage of trade liberalization than can skill-scarce B.
    The four panels of Figure 7b illustrate Conjecture 2: trade liberalization raises the skill premium in both
countries, and in our numerical exercise this e¤ect continues all the way to costless trade. As can be seen in
Table 4, the increases in the skill premium are fairly modest: in the move from autarky to moderate trade
costs of = 1:4, the skill premium increases by 2.1 percent in A and 5.7 percent in B, with increases of 3.5 and
8.5 percent respectively when moving all the way to costless trade. An implication is that our example world
economy features relative factor price divergence as trade is liberalized, with the skill premium in B relative
to A increasing from 2.30 to 2.41. This result is very much at odds with the factor price equalization forces
in Heckscher-Ohlin models. This factor price divergence result need not hold in all numerical simulations.
    While the factor price implications of our model are completely at odds with Heckscher-Ohlin models,
our model does feature trade in factor services that is predicted by factor abundance. This is illustrated in
Figure 9, which shows that the net factor content of trade increases quite rapidly with falls in variable trade
costs.21
    To illustrate the key importance of skill bias in generating our results, in panel B of Table 4 we report
results when there is zero ex ante correlation between skill intensity and productivity. To compute these
results, the only change we make is to the copula parameter : Di¤erences in factor abundance still generate
di¤erences in the skill premium, but the level of the skill premium is much lower than in panel A. Trade
liberalization leads to gains from trade which are comparable to the skill-bias case, but relative factor prices
are virtually unchanged despite large net trade in factor services (similar to what is seen in Figure 9 but not
shown in the interest of space). The skill premium does fall very slightly in each case as trade is liberalized,
so our numerical results are consistent with Conjecture 1. This illustrates again the absence of Stolper-
Samuelson forces in our model: when factor intensities are unrelated to preferences, trade liberalization does
not raise the skill premium unless there is skill-bias.
    As a …nal exercise, we consider convergence in relative factor endowments. We consider our base case
of skill biased technology ( = 11) and moderate trade costs ( = 1:4), and both countries have the same
                                    B
population. We begin with (H=L) = 0:1; and increase human capital in B until it reaches the level in A.
Table 5 reports the results. Interestingly, A is essentially indi¤erent to human capital accumulation in B,
with tiny increases in real wages and the skill premium. At …rst glance the tiny e¤ect that human capital
accumulation in B has on factor markets in A might seem puzzling, since net trade in factor services are
changing quite dramatically. The reason is the absence of Stolper-Samuelson e¤ects in our model: though the
  2 0 The quantitative exercises in Burstein and Vogel (2010) and Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007), for example, should in
our view be interpreted in the same way.
  2 1 We calculate the factor content of trade as follows. For exports, we use the exporting country’s unit factor requirements.

For imports, we use the exporting country’s factor requirements, de‡ated by the iceberg transport cost factor : This explains
why the two panels of Figure 9 are not quite mirror images. When = 1; the net factor contents sum to zero exactly.



                                                              20
average good imported by A from B is becoming more skill intensive as B develops, this has no direct e¤ect
on the relative demand for more and less skill-intensive goods produced in A. In contrast, B experiences a
precipitous drop in the skill premium as real GDP rises, with real skilled wages falling and more than all of
the 28 percent increase in GDP going to unskilled workers. The response in B of the skill premium to factor
accumulation is consistent with a long-run labor demand elasticity of about -2, which is within the range
found in the labor economics literature (see for example Autor and Katz (1999)).22

                                                    4.   CONCLUSION

    In this paper we propose a new model that explains why trade liberalization can be associated with a
rising skill premium in both rich and poor countries. Our model has two dimensions in which …rms di¤er,
skill intensity and productivity, and our assumption that these two attributes are positively correlated is
veri…ed using Chilean …rm-level data. Because of this correlation, opening to trade shifts up the relative
demand for skilled workers, as low-cost, skill-intensive …rms expand to seize new export opportunities and
high-cost, low-skill …rms contract or exit in the face of greater import competition. In equilibrium, the skill
premium rises when trade is liberalized between identical countries. It is possible that less skilled workers
will see their real wages fall in such a scenario if their nominal wages fall by more than the reduction in the
price level, though this does not occur in our simulations: all workers gain from liberalization even as the
skill premium rises.
    When countries di¤er in their relative factor endowments, opening to trade also leads to an increase in
the skill premium in both countries, and in our example economy there is relative factor price divergence,
with the skill premium rising by more in the skill-scarce country. This result is at odds with the Stolper-
Samuelson theorem, which predicts that trade liberalization should lead to a fall in the skill premium in
the skill-abundant country and the opposite in the skill-scarce country. The reason is that our model makes
a simple and intuitive departure from one of the key assumptions in the Heckscher-Ohlin tradition: we
assume that the elasticity of substitution in demand is common across goods, rather than being higher for
goods with the same factor intensity. Although our model has a Heckscher-Ohlin ‡avor in its focus on the
interaction between goods with di¤erent factor intensities and countries with di¤erent factor endowments,
this seemingly small change in assumptions means that the model works quite di¤erently than models in the
Heckscher-Ohlin tradition.
    Quantitatively, the factor price e¤ects we …nd are small relative both to the size of gains from trade in
our model and to the changes in the skill premium in the United States and around the world. Thus we see
our results as consistent with the view that trade liberalization can lead to large welfare gains without being
a major contributor to growing wage inequality.

   This appendix proves Propositions 1 and 2 in the text. First we show that equilibrium is unique, and
then we show that the movement from autarky to costly trade leads to an increase in the skill premium (in
the skill-biased case) or no change in the skill premium (in the no-bias case). Throughout this appendix,
we take the unskilled wage as our numeraire, so the skill premium s is the relative wage of skilled versus
unskilled workers.

    Finding equilibrium requires simultaneously solving the labor market equilibrium and free entry condi-
tions for the equilibrium values of s and :

    Our approach to uniqueness is to show that (63) and (64) de…ne two curves in (s; ) space, which we’ll
call the LME and FE schedules. Since these curves have opposite slopes, their intersection de…nes a unique
solution. We show

The terms in brackets are strictly positive, while (1 ) < 0, so both derivatives are strictly negative. We
have thus con…rmed the slope of the FE schedule given by (68).


5.1.2.   The slope of the LME schedule


    A direct calculus approach to establishing the slope of the LME schedule (63) is infeasible, so we proceed
heuristically. We begin by re-writing the left hand side of (63) as an unskilled labor weighted average of each
active …rms skill intensity. The de…nitions of H~ dv and L

For …rms that export, their total unskilled labor share is ( ; '; s; )     1+ 1       : Equation (74) is useful
because it shows that the aggregate skill ratio is a weighted average of the …rm-level skill ratios.
    Now consider an incremental increase in the cuto¤ : By de…nition, this will lead to exit of the highest
cost …rms, with their weight in relative skill demand going to zero. By the assumption that technology is
skill-biased, these …rms are less skill-intensive than the …rms that do not exit, causing an incipient relative
excess demand for skilled labor. Thus to maintain relative labor market equilibrium, the skill premium s
must rise when       rises. Thus we conclude that the LME schedule is upward sloping in (s; ) space. This
concludes the demonstration that equilibrium is unique.


                                           5.2.   Proof of Proposition 1


   Our proof of Proposition 1 proceeds by analyzing shifts in the LME and FE curves in the movement from
autarky to costly trade. Since both curves shift up, the equilibrium skill premium must rise (see Figure A1).

5.2.1.   Opening to trade causes shift up in FE curve


   Consider the free entry condition (64). Under autarky, X = ? so (64) reduces to

where we have written out the limits of integration corresponding to the set of active …rms D. Since the right
hand side of (64) does not change in the move from autarky to costly trade, while we add a strictly positive

to shift up of the FE curve (see Figure A1).

   In autarky, (74) reduces to

                                  Z1 Z1

                                  0 s

At the autarky equilibrium values of s and , consider an opening to costly trade. Two e¤ects are immediate.
First, because of …xed and variable export costs, only the most competitive …rms will export, increasing their
labor demand weights by the factor 1 + 1         relative to the weights of non-exporters. Second, because of
skill bias, newly exporting …rms are more skill intensive on average than non-exporters. As a consequence
of these two e¤ects, relative skill demand increases when costly trade opens up. At the autarky equilibrium
cuto¤ , s must increase to satisfy (74), which corresponds to an upward shift in the LME curve.

    When there is no skill bias, we can write the joint density as g ( ; ') = g ( ) g' (') : The marginal
distributions are assumed to be uniform on [0; 1] and Pareto on [1; 1) respectively
                                                                                                          (k+1)

H=L 1; s = 1 by our assumption that skilled workers can perform unskilled jobs but not vice versa.

    We take all the parameters, as well as the primitive distribution G ( ; '), as given. We solve for three
endogenous variables:     , w and s. All other endogenous variables and aggregates are functions of those
variables. We solve for both nominal wages using gold as the numeraire. This makes the search for the
equilibrium more e¢ cient and robust. In addition, using gold as numeraire makes interpretation of changes
of nominal values straightforward.

    Draw I …rms (technologies) from G ( ; '), denoted f( ; ')i gi=1 . This set is …xed throughout the search

     …rms: f j gJj=1 and the commensurate f( ; ')j gJj=1 . Collect exporters such that i > x ; this leaves
     us with T exporters: f t gTt=1 and the commensurate f( ; ')t gTt=1 . Finally, set d = J=I (probability
     of entry) and = T =J (export probability conditional on entry).

   Equilibrium is found when all are all equal to zero. We search for ( 0 ; w0 ; s0 ) such that these conditions
are met. We use the numerical solver fsolve in Matlab to do this.
   The numerical equilibrium relationships are written di¤erently from those in the main text to re‡ect the
computation methodology; however, they are the same as in the main text. All averages are approximations
of means, and take into account the truncations and correct distribution functions. For example,

because f j gJj=1 and the commensurate f( ; ')j gJj=1 are both in D by construction and are both distributed
according to g ( ; ') = d . So while the free entry condition and relative labor equilibrium equation in the
main text do not involve d or , here we must correct the means by the relevant probabilities to match
these relationships in the text.

   The solution of the model for an economy in autarky is very similar to the solution for the symmetric
open economy case with one di¤erence: we do not have a set of exporters. We solve for three endogenous
variables:   , w and s. All other endogenous variables and aggregates are functions of those variables. The
three deviations from autarky equilibrium relationships are

f involves three factor market clearing conditions (equations (55) and (56) for each country, with one equation
discarded as redundant), two free entry conditions (equation (27) for each country), and price indices (57)
and (58). g involves aggregate revenue equations (42), the relationships between entry and exporting cuto¤s
(53) and (54), probability equations (21) and (22), average competitiveness (23) and (24), and …rm mass
equations (44).
    Consider g ( ; ) = 0. By the implicit function theorem, there exists a function = ( ) such that
g [ ; ( )] = 0. The function ( ) exists because (a) g is continuously di¤erentiable; and (b) given the
particular partition we chose, the Jacobian matrix [@g=@ 0 ] is nonsingular for all admissible values of . We
use ( ) in

are functions of those variables. We solve for all nominal variables using gold as the numeraire. This
makes the search for the equilibrium more e¢ cient and robust. In addition, using gold as numeraire makes
interpretation of changes of nominal values straightforward.

   Equilibrium is found when all   are all equal to zero. We search for 0 such that these conditions are
met. We use the numerical solver fsolve in Matlab to do this.
   Some of the numerical equilibrium relationships are written di¤erently from those in the main text to
re‡ect the computation methodology; however, they are the same as in the main text. All averages are
