                                              ABSTRACT

We study the empirical determinants of intertemporal choice by analyzing a unique decision Croatian
retirees made recently about whether to accept an immediate pension payment or a larger stream of
delayed payments. Individual decisions are correlated in sensible ways with income, liquidity constraints,
longevity expectations, and other covariates. Attitudes toward government also matter: those less confident
that the government will honor its commitments are more likely to take the immediate stream of payments.
Those who believe it is important to receive “the full amount due, no matter how long it takes” are
substantially more likely to take the delayed payments.

       The canonical consumption-based model, dating back to at least Samuelson

(1937), captures the determinants of intertemporal decisions primarily through a single

parameter—the discount rate. Discount rates are not directly observable, and many

studies have attempted to measure implicit discount rates, with widely varying results.

For example, whereas several efforts to measure discount rates from surveys and

experiments have found evidence of very low (and even negative) discount rates,1

several econometric studies of actual behavior have estimated discount rates that are

extremely large.2 Barsky et al. (1997) note that “one possible explanation of the finding

of high subjective discount rates in the econometric work is the difficulty of controlling

for features of the economic environment facing agents, such as liquidity constraints

and the need for precautionary savings.” A closely related focus of this literature is to

examine how discount rates vary with various demographic characteristics such as

income, education, and race.3 Many of these studies, however, have been hampered by

methodological concerns, ranging from sample selection, the hypothetical nature of the

choice (in the case of some surveys and experiments), and a host of omitted variables.

       In this paper, we provide new evidence on the empirical determinants of inter-

temporal decisions and how they vary across the population. We examine an

exogenously imposed and economically large intertemporal decision made by a large

1 See, for example, Barsky et al. (1997), Loewenstein (1987), Loewenstein and Prelec (1991, 1992), and
Loewenstein and Thaler (1989).
2 Warner & Pleeter (2001) find discount rates from 0 to more than 30 percent. See also Hausman (1979)

and Lawrence (1991). Sawmick (1998) estimates the distribution of rates of time preference from wealth
data and finds wide dispersion, ranging from negative to more than 20 percent.
3 Studies that have examined how discount rates vary across the population include Gilman (1976), Black

(1984), and Lawrance (1991). These studies find that discount rates decline with income, education, and
age, and that blacks have higher discount rates than whites do. Samwick (1998) shows that the
distribution of rates varies with age and income. Warner and Pleeter (2001) find that military officers
exhibit lower discount rates than enlisted personnel do, that blacks exhibit a higher discount rate than
whites do, and that discount rates decline with education.


                                                                                                      1
fraction of the entire retired population of Croatia. As the result of a 1998 ruling by the

Constitutional Court of Croatia, the government was ordered to make substantial

payments to retirees, and thereby compensate them for an unconstitutional benefit cut

that had occurred during, and immediately after, the war in the former Yugoslavia in

the early- to mid-1990s. In late 2005, eligible retirees were offered a one-time,

irrevocable choice (described in more detail below) between a more immediate and a

more deferred payment stream. Although the deferred payment option offered a

nominal internal rate-of-return in excess of 26 percent relative to the more immediate

payment option, approximately 70 percent of retirees chose the latter.

      We empirically examine the determinants of this choice using micro data from a

nationally representative survey that we designed and fielded for this purpose in the

period from late 2008 to early 2009. This setting has several advantages over the prior

literature. First, like Warner and Pleeter (2001), who examine the separation choices

made by about 65,000 U.S. military personnel in the early 1990s, we are able to examine

actual choices over an amount of money large enough to be quite meaningful to the

typical retiree (on average, the monetary value of the settlements was roughly

equivalent to a year of household income for the average Croatian retiree). Thus, our

study does not suffer from the bias that may arise when studying hypothetical decisions

over small stakes, an issue that plagues many experimental studies.

      Second, because the policy decision about the size of this repayment and the

population to receive it was determined by a Constitutional Court decision and a

subsequently passed law, we have a fairly clean experimental setting that is not

contaminated by concerns about self-selection. This is in contrast to Warner and Pleeter


                                                                                         2
(2001), who analyze the intertemporal decision made only by those who opted to

separate voluntarily from military service, a group that may differ from those who

chose to continue military service.4

          Third, we examine a much broader range of determinants than any prior study.

Through data collected from a comprehensive survey, we combine economic,

demographic, preference, and attitudinal variables, while also controlling directly for

factors that have hampered many previous studies, such as liquidity constraints. Past

studies have found, for example, that younger individuals and individuals with less

income are less likely to defer consumption (i.e., they exhibit a higher discount rate).

However, factors such as liquidity constraints, bequest motives, health, and financial

literacy (often not available in the data used in prior studies) are correlated with age

and income, and are also potentially important factors in intertemporal decisions in

their own right. Our data allow us to disentangle carefully the effects or many

correlated, though distinct, characteristics and attitudes upon intertemporal choice.

          Fourth, we use our setting to measure the extent to which survey-based

measures of inter-temporal preferences can predict an important, real-world

intertemporal choice. In particular, we test how a hypothetical choice between money

today and money in the future is correlated with an individual’s actual choice, and

whether the predictive power of that hypothetical choice varies with the individual’s

financial sophistication and experience.

          Finally, our survey also allows us to explore a number of potential explanations,

including respondents’ beliefs about the economic environment and attitudes toward


4   Warner and Pleeter (2001) did account for this sample selection in their empirical methodology.


                                                                                                      3
government, neither of which would have been observable from administrative data

alone. As we show below, several of these factors are quantitatively quite important.

Gauging the importance of these economic-environment and attitudes-toward-

government variables is an essential step toward understanding how individuals might

respond to an intertemporal tradeoff of cash flows offered by the government.

      We find that the willingness to defer payments in this setting correlates with a

number of demographic characteristics in sensible ways. For example, we find that

individuals are more likely to take the deferred payment (and thus exhibit a lower

discount rate) if they are younger, have children, express a bequest motive, and are in

good health. We also show that they are more willing to defer if they have higher

income and are not liquidity-constrained. We further show that individuals take the

broader macroeconomic environment into consideration: those more concerned about

future inflation and those more concerned about the possible devaluation of the Kuna

(the Croatian currency) were more likely to take the immediate payment option.

      We also find that, at least in this choice setting, hypothetical choices like those

used in many survey settings are not predictive of the actual choices for most of the

population. Specifically, we elicit from the respondents the rate of return they would

require to be willing to invest their money with a highly reputable bank if it meant not

being able to access the money for one year. Responses to this question are not

significantly correlated with the actual payment choice, except for those individuals

who are not liquidity constrained and who are more financially sophisticated

(measured as having savings, particularly savings in foreign currencies). Put differently,




                                                                                        4
our proxy for the rate of time preference is informative of the actual behavior only for

the subset of individuals who have had actual experience with saving decisions.

       We then turn to an analysis of factors related to attitudes toward government.

We begin with an analysis of political risk, a factor several authors document in the

context of the U.S. Social Security system (e.g., Luttmer and Samwick, 2011; Shoven and

Slavov, 2006). Our results are consistent with a role for political risk: individuals who

exhibit a lower level of confidence in the government are substantially more likely to

choose the more immediate payment option. We find this using both a positively

framed and a negatively framed question about the likelihood of the government

making good on its payment commitments.

       Working in the opposite direction (i.e., in favor of encouraging individuals to

take the delayed payout) is a strong desire to receive the “full amount they were owed

no matter how long it takes.” Consistent with the psychological importance of reference

points in the decision-making process (Shefrin and Statman, 1979), these individuals

appear to have harbored strong feelings about the importance of getting back the full

nominal amount due.5 Our results indicate that individuals who believed it is important

to get the full amount due no matter how long it takes were 27 percentage points more

likely to accept the deferred payment option, and that most of them reported that they

would have chosen the deferred option even if payouts were hypothetically extended to

a 10-year (rather than a 6-year) horizon. To address concerns about measurement error

and endogeneity, we show that this finding is robust to using an individual’s region of



5 The focus on nominal amounts is also in line with the findings of Odean (1999), who finds that stock
investors seem to exhibit loss aversion around the nominal amount paid for a stock.


                                                                                                    5
birth as an instrument for the desire to be made whole.6 The economic importance of

this desire is quite substantial. Our results suggest that, if no one had regarded “being

made whole” an important consideration, the fraction choosing the delayed payout

option would have fallen from 31% to only 12% of the affected population.

        Although the institutional details of our setting are specific to Croatia, the

findings are of much more general interest. Nearly every developed country faces long-

term shortfalls in the financing of old-age entitlement programs. This has led some

countries to consider ways of allowing participants voluntarily to opt out of a portion of

their benefits in exchange for a private account.7 Knowing which individual

characteristics are correlated with a willingness to accept a substantial reduction in the

present value of benefits in order to receive payments early is important for

understanding both the fiscal and distributional implications of such proposals. This is

also true at the sub-national level: the underfunded status of many of the U.S. public

defined benefit pension plans has led to an erosion in confidence that benefits will be

paid. For example, Novy-Marx and Rauh (2009) calculate that state public pensions are

under-funded by $3.23 trillion. The presence of political risk in such systems may lead

participants in these systems to discount future benefits at a higher rate (e.g., Luttmer

and Samwick, 2011; Shoven and Slavov, 2006). If so, the cost of these programs may

exceed the perceived value to the participants, and offering lump-sum options in return


6 Our instrument is motivated by Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004) and Brown et al. (2008), both of
which show that an individual’s region of birth can have long-lasting effects on attitudes later in life—in
our context, attitudes toward the government. Our instrument is also motivated by work in the public
administration and organizational behavior literatures.
7 In the U.S., for example, the 2001 President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security proposed

allowing individuals to redirect part of their payroll taxes into personal accounts in exchange for a future
reduction in their defined benefit income from Social Security.


                                                                                                          6
for a substantial actuarial reduction in the present value of benefits may be a plausible

path to reform. Indeed, exactly this approach has been taken over the past year by a

number of large private sector defined benefit plans, including General Motors.

Understanding the distributional implications of such options requires an appreciation

of who is most likely to choose the expedited payout.

      This paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 provides background on the Croatian

pension repayment plan. Our research methodology and summary statistics are

presented in Section 2. Section 3 presents empirical results, and Section 4 concludes.


1. Background on the Croatian Pension Choice
      After declaring its independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, Croatia

became embroiled in a war until it signed the Dayton peace agreement with Bosnia &

Herzegovina and Serbia in 1995. During this period, the Croatian government operated

under considerable pressure and with a scarcity of resources as it faced the need to

finance the war effort, the effects of war destruction, a severely challenged economy, as

well as a simultaneous transition toward a market economy and democracy in the post-

communist era. Under these circumstances, one of the steps the government undertook

at the time to secure additional resources was altering the manner in which public

pension benefits were calculated. Essentially, the change in the benefit took the form of

a switch from wage-indexing to price-indexing of benefits, which had the effect of

lowering the amount of money retirees had received. This alteration was in place from

late 1993 to the end of 1998, at which point wage-indexing resumed.




                                                                                         7
       Shortly after the Dayton peace agreement was signed in 1995, organized groups

representing the interests of affected pensioners filed a series of lawsuits questioning

the constitutionality of this pension change. In 1998, the Constitutional Court of Croatia

agreed that the benefit change was unconstitutional and ruled that the government

must reimburse retirees for the benefit shortfall. However, the Court did not prescribe

how this remediation program was to be implemented. Six years of political

negotiations followed, with legislation finally being passed on July 21, 2004.

       The 2004 legislation stipulated that retirees should receive the difference between

what they were owed under the law and what they had actually received, along with

interest. The payments were to be made from an investment fund established solely for

this purpose, with funding guaranteed by the state. The amount of payment owed to

most retirees was substantial: for a large share of retirees, it was roughly a year or more

of household income. Table 1 shows the distribution of the pension repayment amount

for the full sample, as well as by income groups (both the pension repayment amount

and the income level are self-reported). We find that, as expected, higher-income

individuals are owed a higher pension-repayment amount because they likely had

bigger pensions to begin with. Further, the pension repayment amount roughly equates

to a year of household income for the typical respondent. For example, among

respondents in the 2,000-4,000 Kuna monthly income bracket (annual income of 24,000

to 48,000 Kuna), both the median and mean pension repayment amounts are around

36,000 (about $7,000 U.S. dollars, as measured at the time of the survey).

       Another year had passed before the manner of the payment and the payment

options were fully developed. Finally, in December 2005, approximately 430,000


                                                                                         8
individuals (about one-tenth of the overall population of Croatia) were given a choice

between two payout options. Individuals who chose option A were promised four

semi-annual payments—totaling 50% of the nominal value of the calculated amount

owed—that were to commence in mid-2006 and terminate in December 2007. Those

who chose option B were promised six annual payments—totaling 100% of the nominal

calculated amount owed—that were to commence in December 2007 and terminate in

December 2012. Table 2 presents the breakdown and timing of the payments that would

be made under option A (the more immediate payments) and option B (the more

deferred payments) for someone with a pension repayment amount of 60,000 Kunas.

        As shown in the bottom row of Table 2, the break-even discount rate that equates

these two payment streams is approximately 26.6%. Despite the high nominal return

from choosing option B, about 71% of participants chose option A, the earlier, smaller

stream of payments.8 To put this nominal 26.6% return into perspective, we consider

how this relates to inflation and to other rates of return available to Croatian citizens at

the time. Post-war inflation has been relatively stable, reaching a high of approximately

8% in 1998, and hovering around 4% for much of the past decade. However, this period

of relatively low and stable inflation is coming on the heels of a period of extremely

high inflation. Thus, while the 26.6% nominal return corresponds, ex post, to a very high

real return, it will be important to control for heterogeneity in individual views about

inflation risk (accomplished by using our survey instrument, as discussed below). The

26.6% return is also quite high in comparison with other savings instruments (Figure 1).


8 As reported by Večernji List on June 27, 2007, 299,910 retirees received their third payment under
Option A in late June 2007. As reported by Večernji List on December 16, 2008, 123,321 retirees received
their second payment under Option B in mid-December 2008.


                                                                                                      9
In the years around the time of the pension choice, rates on certificates of deposit (CDs),

savings, and government bonds—be they denominated in Kunas or in foreign

currencies—were substantially below 26.6%. Thus, by virtually any measure, the

internal rate of return provided by delaying pension payments was substantial.9


2. Research Methodology and Summary Statistics
        Fielding our own survey of retirees was both necessary and desirable for two

primary reasons. First, Croatia does not have a nationally-representative, household

data set that could be used for this purpose, and Croatian privacy laws rendered

administrative data unavailable. Second, all of the data needed for this study (e.g.,

pension choice, demographic data, and, particularly, data on liquidity constraints,

preferences, attitudes toward government, and the like) would not have been included

in standard data sets even if they had existed.

        We hired a Croatian survey agency PULS (affiliated with the U.S. Gallup polling

organization) to conduct our own survey of retirees concerning their pension choice.

This survey was fielded from mid-November 2008 to mid-January 2009, at a time the

pension choice was still fresh in the respondents’ minds: those who had chosen option

A (the more immediate payment option) would have just about received their final

payment, whereas those who had chosen option B would have been early in the

repayment process. The survey, designed to be representative of the affected population

9 Given the high internal return on deferral, a natural question is why a formal market for financial
intermediation of these benefits did not arise. A more patient investor (such as a financial institution)
would have had an incentive to provide pensioners with money up front in return for receiving the
deferred payments, thus earning this exceptionally high return. Such institutional arrangements were
explicitly outlawed in the legislation creating this program. Of course, retirees could have made such
arrangements informally and privately with family members (such as children), suggesting that it is
important to control for whether the pensioner had children in our regression analysis.


                                                                                                      10
and fielded accordingly, asked the respondents detailed questions about their pension

choice, demographics (e.g., age, income, gender, family status), and a range of questions

to assess knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about economic and financial matters.

        We collected 2,619 survey responses. Of these, 1,818 respondents, or 69.4% of the

sample, had selected option A, whereas 801 respondents, or 30.6% of the sample, had

selected option B. These proportions match the division of choice within the population

almost exactly (69.4% of the sample opting for option A, compared to 70.9% of the full

population). This suggests that our sampling was representative and that individuals

reported their pension choices truthfully.

        The primary dependent variable for our analysis is a binary variable,

“OptionPicked,” set equal to one if the respondent selected option B (the larger, more

deferred payouts) and equal to zero is the respondent selected option B (the smaller,

more immediate payouts). If one were to interpret the choice of the repayment plan as

driven solely by a comparison of one’s discount rate to the internal-rate-of-return (an

interpretation that, as discussed below, is an over-simplification), those with the

dependent variable value of 1 (i.e., those who chose option B) should be viewed as

having a discount rate below 26.6%, whereas those with the value of 0 (i.e., those who

chose option A) should be viewed as having a discount rate in excess of 26.6%.

        We regress this binary variable against a range of covariates.10 Given our

definition of the dependent variable, a positive coefficient associated with a covariate

should be interpreted as an increased willingness to defer consumption (i.e., a lower



10For ease of interpretation, we report the coefficients from a linear probability model. Non-linear binary
choice models yield very similar marginal effects.


                                                                                                        11
discount rate), whereas a negative coefficient should be interpreted as a decreased

willingness to defer consumption (i.e., a higher discount rate).

        In Table 3, we report the summary statistics for the key covariates that we

include in our regressions of the pension repayment choice (our regressions also

include 24 indicator variables depicting the individual’s county of residence within

Croatia, as well as 10 indicator variables for the ethnicity of the individual, none of

which we tabulate in the table). For purposes of this summary table, as well as our later

regressions, we group variables into seven categories and present them in distinct

panels: (A) rate of time preference and risk aversion; (B) income, wealth, and liquidity

constraints; (C) education, financial literacy, and financial self-assessments;11 (D) family

structure and other demographics; (E) health and longevity; (F) views about

macroeconomic factors; and (G) beliefs concerning attitudes toward government.12

        The tabulations presented in the table suggest that our survey respondents

exhibit substantial heterogeneity in terms of their attitudes towards risk, their financial

condition, their education and financial literacy, health status, and their views about

inflation and exchange rate fluctuations. For example, just over two-fifths of individuals


11 The three questions at the bottom of Panel C measure the respondents’ numeracy. We asked a Simple
Interest Compounding Question: how much will be in the bank account at the end of two years if the initial
balance is 10,000 and the interest rate is 5% with no withdrawals. An answer of “More than 11,000” is
recorded in the tables as “Correct”, while a response of “Exactly 11,000” is recorded in the tables as
“Almost Correct.” We also asked a Simple Inflation Question: how much they can buy a year from now if
the interest rate is 2% and inflation is 3%. An answer of “Less than today” is recorded in the tables as
“Correct”, while a response of “Exactly as much as today” is recorded in the tables as “Almost Correct.”
Finally, we asked a “Doubling” Compounding Question: how long it takes an account to double in value at
an annual interest rate of 10%. We group answers to this question in the tables as either a response of 5-10
years or “Wrong” (responses of less than 5 years or more than 10 years).
12 Individuals were asked to respond to most questions on a scale of “1” to “5,” with “1” typically

representing “not at all important” and “5” typically representing “extremely important.” We collapse
these five potential responses into three categories: “Not Important” (responses “1” or “2”), “Moderately
Important” (response “3”), and “Very Important” (responses “4” or “5”).


                                                                                                         12
have savings (defined as owning a savings account or a certificate of deposit) either in

the local currency (Kuna) or a foreign currency (e.g., Euro), and just over one-quarter

have more than a high-school education. Roughly one-half of respondents reported an

immediate need to pay for something as a very or extremely important factor in their

repayment decision, while one-quarter reported that it was not important.

       There is substantial heterogeneity in terms of attitudes toward government. For

example, whereas 32% of respondents state that they were very confident at the time of

their choice that the government would make all payments, 36.9% were not at all

confident. Roughly 3 of 5 individuals felt it was very important that they receive all the

money owed no matter how long it takes, while one out of five placed no importance on

this factor. Given the myriad of factors involved in making an intertemporal choice, we

turn to regression analysis to sort out their relative importance.


3. Empirical Analysis of the Determinants of Intertemporal Choice
       In this section, we regress the pension repayment choice against a large number

of variables of interest. Our dependent variable is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the

respondent selected pension repayment option B (the more deferred payment stream)

and 0 if the respondent picked option A (the more immediate payment stream). We

estimate a linear regression by OLS with robust standard errors (effects are nearly

identical if we use a Probit with marginal effects evaluated at the mean of the

independent variables). For convenience, we multiply all coefficients in the table by 100

so that they can easily be interpreted as percentage points. All of the variables presented

in the summary statistics table (Table 3) are included in the regression, with explanatory




                                                                                        13
variables organized into the same seven groups for ease of readability and exposition.

In addition, we include in the full-specification regression 24 indicator variables

capturing the respondents’ county of residence,13 as well as 10 indicator variables for

the respondents’ ethnicity (e.g., Croat, Serb, Muslim/Bosniak). Results of our primary

specification are reported in Table 4.14


3.1 Rate of Time Preference and Risk Aversion
        We begin by discussing the correlation between whether an individual decided

to defer consumption (i.e., selected repayment option B) and a proxy measure of an

individual’s pure rate of time preference. We next estimate a time preference parameter

in a manner similar to Kirby et al. (1999) and Chabris et al. (2008).15 We describe a

situation in which the individual has received 20,000 Kunas16 and is given a choice

between keeping the money and doing with it as they please, or depositing the money

with an “extremely reputable bank as a CD for one year, so that you will be promised a

certain annual interest rate, but will not be able to touch the money until the year

expires.” We then ask “If you would be willing to make such a deposit, what interest

rate would the extremely reputable bank need to offer to pay you so that you would

prefer to deposit the 20,000 Kunas as a CD for one year, rather than keep it and do with

it as you please?” If respondents did not provide a meaningful response (i.e., they


13 The county-of-residence indicators are jointly statistically significant in the regression at the 1% level.
14 We lose a total of 129 observations from our original sample of 2,619 because of missing values for
certain variables included in our regression, resulting in a final sample size of 2,490.
15 Kirby et al. (1999) and Chabris et al. (2008) ask subjects to choose between “smaller, immediate reward

(SIR) and a larger, delayed reward (LDR)” (e.g., “Would you prefer $54 today, or $55 in 117 days?”).
Additional questions vary the reward sizes and the time period of delay.
16 At the time of the survey, this amount was worth just under $4,000 U.S. dollars. Also, it is equal to

approximately one-third of the average annual wage in Croatia, and to about three-quarters of the
average annual pension in Croatia.


                                                                                                           14
responded that they did not know), we took them through a branching series of

responses, asking whether they would deposit the money at various rates (5%, 10%,

15%, and 25%) to approximate their rate of time preference for a one-year bank deposit.

Respondents were also allowed to answer that “[T]here is absolutely no way I would do

it,” that is, that there is no rate at which they would take out the one-year CD.

       Indeed, 29% of the respondents indicated that there was “no rate” at which they

would be willing to give up current access to the money for a higher future return,

suggesting that these individuals had a very high rate of discount. Of the 71% of

respondents who provided a rate (initially or through the “branching” questions), the

mean and median rates were 8.7% and 7%, respectively, with a quarter of this group

demanding an interest rate of 10% or more and a tenth of this group demanding an

interest rate of 15% or more. Therefore, there is substantial heterogeneity: whereas a

large fraction of the respondents report having a very high discount rate (i.e., would not

save at any rate), one-quarter of the respondents would postpone consumption for a

year for a bank-deposit return of 5% or less, while about one-third would do so for a

return in the 6-10% range. Thus, for those who provided a one-year interest rate, most

of the responses received were in the range of the actual Kuna-denominated CD rates

present in the decade preceding the pension-repayment choice (Figure 1).

       As indicated in Panel A of Table 4, this proxy for the pure rate of time preference

is not significantly correlated with the choice of pension payments (the coefficient is

small in magnitude, -0.1, and is not statistically significant). There are at least two

possible reasons for this lack of significance: (1) because of the context of our question

(investing in a bank CD), our time preference measure may be very noisy for those with


                                                                                       15
limited investment experience, and (2) liquidity constraints may have confounded our

measure, as had been hypothesized in the context of understanding the difference in

estimated rates of time preference between the experimental and empirical literatures.

       Further analysis is supportive of both of these reasons. In Figure 2, we report the

coefficients from a modified version of our baseline regression in which we interact the

time preference question with variables that capture these effects. The first bar

represents the coefficient from Table 4, that is, the baseline coefficient on our rate of

time preference question that shows the change in likelihood of selecting option B

resulting from a one-percentage point change in the rate of time preference. Subsequent

bars show the effect of the rate of time preference for various subgroups, each obtained

from a separate regression.

       To test for liquidity constraints, we ask respondents to rate on a scale from 1 (not

at all important) to 5 (extremely important) the importance of the following statement

in influencing their decision: “An immediate need for money to help pay some

expenses, such as debts, medical expenses, bills, home or apartment repairs or

renovation, replacement of major appliances, or similar, for self, family, or friends.” One

quarter of the respondents answered that liquidity constraints were not important

(answers “1” or “2”), while one-half of the respondents answered that liquidity

constraints were very or extremely important (answers “4” or “5”). For individuals who

rated liquidity constraints as not important, the coefficient on our measure of their

subjective rate of time preference is significant, although the economic magnitude is

small. A higher rate is associated with a lower likelihood of picking the deferred

payment option; a one-percentage point increase in the subjective rate of preference is


                                                                                        16
associated with a 0.4 percentage-point decline in the likelihood of picking option B

(statistically significant at the 10-percent level). For the more liquidity constrained

respondents, the thought of deferring the pension repayment may not be considered a

possibility under any rate of return and, therefore, their rate of time preference is not

correlated with their decision (we discuss the direct effects of liquidity constraints, as

well as the interaction of liquidity constraints with other factors, below).

       For respondents who have savings, a trait shared by just over two-fifths of the

sample respondents, we find that having a higher discount rate is also associated with a

significantly lower probability of choosing the more deferred payout option (option B).

As shown by the third bar in Figure 2, a one percentage-point increase in the discount

rate is associated with a statistically significant 0.6 percentage-point reduction in the

likelihood of choosing option B. For those who do not have savings (and, thus, for

whom our question is less salient), there is no relation. If we condition on individuals

who have savings in a foreign currency (such as Euro) and, thus, are likely to be more

financially sophisticated, a one percentage-point increase in the discount rate is now

associated with a highly significant 0.9 percentage-point reduction in the likelihood of

choosing option B. As shown in the final bar, the coefficient increases further to a 1.1

percentage-point reduction for the subsample of those who have savings in a foreign

currency and for whom liquidity constraints are not important. Although these effects

are all statistically significant, they are fairly small in magnitude in light of the

important role that the rate of time preference plays in theoretical models of

intertemporal choice.




                                                                                       17
      In short, we find that our proxy for the pure rate of time preference is modestly

informative only for those individuals for whom it is most salient. These findings are

reminiscent of other research that has indicated the importance of focusing on the sub-

population for which a particular measure may have more meaning. For example,

Malloy, Moskowitz, and Vissing-Jørgensen (2008) show that consumption-based asset

pricing models perform better when focused on the consumption risk of stockholders,

rather than that of the overall population. In a different context, Brown (2001) shows

that forward-looking utility-based measures of the value of guaranteed income are

significantly correlated with annuity choice for individuals with longer planning

horizons, but not for those who are more myopic.

      We also control for risk aversion in Panel A of Table 4, but do not find any

significant correlation with the pension payment choice.


3.2 Income, Wealth, and Liquidity Constraints
      In Panel B of Table 4, we report the effects of various economic factors, many of

which are very consistent with the predictions generated by standard models of

intertemporal choice. We find that, consistent with prior research, respondents with

higher income and more wealth exhibit lower discount rates (as manifested by a greater

likelihood to accept the deferred payments). Specifically, we find evidence of income

and wealth gradients: middle- and higher-income individuals are each almost 7

percentage points more likely to defer payments than low-income individuals are.

      For reasons of cultural sensitivity, we did not ask directly for measures of overall

net worth. Instead, we asked a series of “yes/no” questions about ownership of specific

types of assets. While many of these measures (e.g., ownership of real estate, mutual


                                                                                       18
funds, bonds) are not significant, we do find that individuals who own stocks are more

likely to defer payments, as are individuals with higher pension repayment amount

(i.e., more money at stake in the option A/B decision). Stock owners are 4.7 percentage

points more likely to pick the deferred payment option than those who do not own

stock are, while a doubling of the pension repayment amount is associated with a 1.7

percentage-point increase in the likelihood of selecting the deferred payment stream

(given the coefficient of 2.5 on the log of the pension repayment amount).

      In   discussing    the   fact   that   econometric   studies   of   behavior   and

experimental/survey results come to very different conclusions regarding discount

rates, Barsky et al. (1997) note that “one possible explanation of the finding of high

subjective discount rates in the econometric work is the difficulty of controlling for

features of the economic environment facing agents, such as liquidity constraints and

the need for precautionary savings.” The fact that our income measures and stock

ownership measure are negatively correlated with discount rates is consistent with such

a liquidity-constraint explanation. We also measure liquidity constraints through the

direct question described in Section 3.1. The bottom part of Panel B of Table 4 suggests

that individuals who rate liquidity constraints as very important are 18.6 percentage

points more likely to take the immediate payment option than the individuals who rate

it as unimportant are.


3.3 Education, Financial Literacy, and Self-Assessments
      As shown in the first row of Panel C, education, a potential proxy for financial

literacy, is only weakly related to payout choice. Specifically, individuals with more

than a high school education are 3.1 percentage points more likely to choose option B


                                                                                      19
than those with a high school education or less are, although this effect has a p-value of

0.11 and, therefore, is not significant at conventional levels.

       The literature has emphasized that overall education is not a perfect proxy for

financial literacy, and that financial literacy has a direct effect on influencing financial

decision-making (e.g., Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a, 2007b). Thus, in addition to the

overall education level, we also include numerous measures of financial literacy drawn

from the extant literature. None of these measures (e.g., education or work experience

in accounting, economics, or finance; self-reported assessment of numeracy; simple

compound interest and inflation questions) are significantly correlated with the deferral

decision, nor are they jointly significant (p-value = 0.50).


3.4 Family Structure and Other Demographics
       We find that family structure matters. As shown in Panel D, there is a high

degree of within-couple correlation in the choice. For those couples in which both

spouses had made a pension choice, there is a 51 percentage-point difference in the

probability of choosing option B depending on whether one’s spouse chose A or B. Of

course, the high within-couple correlation should not be interpreted as a causal relation,

but, rather, as the likely outcome of a joint household decision. Nonetheless, we control

for this in all specifications, although the coefficients on other variables are virtually

unchanged if we exclude the spouse’s choice.

       We also find that the presence of children in the household makes it 8.5

percentage points more likely that one will choose the higher-return, deferred payment

option. There are at least two possible reasons for this finding. First, this is consistent

with a view that those with children may have bequest motives (and thus the higher


                                                                                         20
total payments are more attractive, especially given that children are qualified to receive

the payments if the pensioner dies before the full series of payments has been received).

Consistent with this notion, we further find that those who indicated that leaving

money to heirs is very important to them were 8.5 percentage points more likely to pick

option B relative to those for whom this was not an important consideration in their

choice. Second, because of the inheritability of these payments, children and parents

could engage in an informal exchange whereby the children could loan to the parents

the amount promised through option A (or an even higher amount) early on, and then

get paid back from the deferred payments, thus earning the high internal return.

       We also note that among those for whom receiving the most money while they

were still alive was very important were 5.2 percentage points more likely to take the

more immediate payment option (less likely to pick option B) relative to those for

whom this was not important.


3.5 Health and Longevity
       Individuals rationally discount the future not only because of the pure rate of

time preference, but also because they recognize that they may not live long enough to

receive payments. This is a particularly relevant consideration in a sample of elderly

individuals such as pensioners. Indeed, in standard consumption models, one can think

about discounting by the sum of the pure discount rate and the mortality rate.

However, in most studies of discount rate behavior, researchers have not had access to

information about longevity expectations aside from a respondent’s age, which does not

encapsulate within-cohort heterogeneity in mortality expectations.




                                                                                        21
      In our survey, we find that beliefs about health and life expectancy (as reported

in Panel E of Table 4) are quite important determinants of the intertemporal choice.

First, for each additional year of age at the time the pension repayment choice was

made, an individual is one percentage point less likely to defer consumption. Even after

conditioning for age, individuals who rated their own health as good or excellent

relative to peers were significantly more likely to defer payments. In addition, those

who were not confident at the time of the choice that they would live at least 7 years

(the time required to receive all payments under option B) were 8-9 percentage points

more likely to take immediate payments. This suggests that there is substantial

heterogeneity in health and longevity expectations within age groups, and that this

heterogeneity is important for understanding intertemporal decision-making.


3.6 Macroeconomic Factors
      Given Croatia’s political and economic history, a natural concern that pensioners

might have had was whether the government would be committed to maintaining the

purchasing power of the promised future stream of benefits. Simply put, in their

lifetimes, Croatian retirees eligible for compensation have “seen it all”—war and its

related destruction (twice), high inflationary periods lasting several years, featuring

years with annual inflation exceeding 100% and accompanied by “stabilization”

attempts and recession (multiple times), and hyperinflation during the pre-war and war

period of the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, as discussed earlier, the decade prior

to the pension repayment choice was marked by fairly mild inflation.

      Our survey asked individuals “at the time you were making your A or B choice,

how high did you think that annual inflation would be (that is, by how much would


                                                                                      22
prices rise each year) over the period of the next several years from that time?” They

were given several choices (0–4%, 5-8%, 9-12%, 13-16%, more than 16%), which we

collapsed into three ranges (0-8%, 9-16%, more than 16%). Whereas only 2% of sample

respondents expected inflation to be more than 16% per year, these individuals were

10.3 percentage points less likely to choose the deferred payment option than those who

believed it will be 8% or less per year were.

       Croatia is a relatively small, open economy, and even average citizens are aware

of the importance of maintaining the Kuna’s purchasing power relative to other

currencies (especially the Euro). Thus, we also asked “at the time you were making

your A or B choice, what was your opinion about the movement of the Kuna relative to

the Euro over the period of the next several years from that time?” Those who thought

that the Kuna would decline relative to the Euro were 4.5 percentage points less likely

to take the deferred payment option.


3.7 Attitudes Toward Government
3.7.1 Confidence that the Government will Honor its Payment Commitment
       Croatia’s political history, including the very event that led to this study (the

government’s decision to renege partially on pension promises), makes Croatia a

fruitful environment in which to study political risk. Through our informal discussions

with Croatian retirees prior to fielding our survey, it became clear that there were

important differences in the population regarding the extent to which they had

confidence that the government will actually “make good” on its commitment to make

all future payouts. Such skepticism is understandable because the initial basis of the

Constitutional Court decision that led to the pension choice in the first place was that


                                                                                     23
the government essentially had reneged on part of its promised pension payments to

retirees in the early- and mid-1990s. Thus, some retirees continued to express a degree

of skepticism about whether the government would be willing or able to follow through

on these payments for the life of the program.

       To the extent to which individuals did not exhibit strong confidence that future

payments indeed will be made, they may have behaved as if they were discounting the

future more steeply. Such behavior would have numerous economic and policy

implications, especially in closely related contexts, in which future pension benefits for

current workers are perceived as risky. For example, if political risk prompts

individuals not to fully value future benefits, then public services could be more

expensive to provide because the political risk would limit the extent to which the cost

of pension benefits is offset by lower wage costs. A political discount could also increase

labor supply distortions and thus create efficiency costs if it reduces the perceived

linkage between current taxes paid and expected future benefits (Summers, 1989).

Another implication of a “political risk premium” is that a public pension system might

be able to reduce its long-run liabilities by offering individuals an opportunity to

exchange future benefits for (more steeply discounted) near-term benefits. Luttmer and

Samwick (2011) provide evidence of a willingness to accept reduced benefits in the U.S.

context where, using survey data, they estimate that, on average, U.S. households

would be willing to forego 4 to 6 percent of their scheduled Social Security benefits to

remove the associated political uncertainty. Our study advances this idea by examining

the extent to which these factors related to a real and economically meaningful choice

that was exogenously imposed on the entire eligible retiree population in Croatia.


                                                                                        24
      We tested for the influence of political risk in two ways that differ primarily in

terms of whether the issue was raised in a more positive or a more negative frame. In

the more positive frame, we asked individuals “at the time you were making your A or

B choice, how confident were you that the government would make all of the payments

to all the retirees who selected option B?” They were given a 5-point scale, where 1 was

“not at all confident” and 5 was “extremely confident.” We find that this has a

quantitatively and statistically important effect on people’s decisions. Those who rated

this factor as a 4 or 5 on the confidence scale (grouped into the “very confident”

category in the table) were 14.7 percentage points more likely to choose the delayed

payout option than those who expressed little confidence in the Croatia government’s

ability to make all the payments it promised were.

      We also asked a more negatively-framed question. Specifically, in our list of

factors that respondents were asked to rate in terms of importance in their decision-

making (a 5-point scale, on which 1 is “not at all important” and 5 is “extremely

important”), we asked respondents to rate the importance of a “concern that the

government might not honor its commitment to pay out all of the money owed.” We

find that, even after controlling for the confidence question above, the importance of

this factor also has a significant effect. Those who rated this concern as a 4 or 5 on the

importance scale (grouped into the “very important” category in the table) were 7.5

percentage points more likely to choose the more immediate payment option than those

who rated it as not an important factor were.

      A natural concern about these two political-risk questions is that individuals may

have answered them on the basis of the beliefs they held at the time of the survey, rather


                                                                                       25
than at the time of the choice (as we asked them to do). The evidence, however, is

consistent with respondents taking the “at the time you were making your A versus B

choice” request seriously while responding to our survey. We are able to test this

hypothesis because approximately one-half of our respondents had been interviewed

before the Croatian Postal Bank (HPB), the entity that administered the payments,

announced and paid out the second B payment, and the other half of our respondents

were interviewed after the second B payment had been deposited.17 If individuals’

responses reflected their beliefs at the time of the survey, the reported confidence in

receiving all the payments should have increased after the second payment of the six

payments had been announced and deposited (i.e., when surveyed, respondents who

had seen 1/6 of all payments under option B made would likely have had less

confidence in all of the payments being made than those who had seen 2/6 of payments

made). However, a comparison of the distribution of responses to the questions

regarding confidence in all the B payments made and concern about government

reneging on its promises offered by those interviewed before the announcement of the

second payment to those interviewed after the second payment reveals no change.18

This is consistent with individuals answering based on their confidence in government

at the time of choice.


17 The Croatian Postal Bank (HPB) announced the second payment under Option B on December 16, 2008
and deposited it in retirees’ accounts on December 17, 2008; 46.3% of the sample was interviewed before
December 16 and 48.6% of the sample was interviewed after December 17.
18 Of those interviewed after only one B payment had been made, 30.5% were very confident all six of the

B payments would be made, while 38.0% were not confident this would happen. Of those interviewed
after two of the B payments had been made, 33.6% were very confident all six of the B payments would
be made, while 36.0% were not confident (with none of these figures statistically different across the two
groups). Similarly, of those interviewed after only one B payment had been made (two had been made),
43.6% (44.8%) rated the concern that government might not honor its commitment as very important,
with 26.4% (26.0%) rating that concern as not important.


                                                                                                       26
         A second concern is that individuals might have engaged in ex-post

rationalization of their decision to take the early payment. That is, after seeing the

government follow through on the earliest payments of the deferred-payment option,

individuals may have come to believe they had made a mistake in choosing the more

immediate payment option and thus, ex post, have rationalized their decision by

blaming a lack of trust in government. This ex-post justification hypothesis could

potentially explain the coefficients obtained on our two political-risk variables: Choice

Time Confidence All B Payments Will Be Made and Concern Gov’t Might Not Honor Its

Commitment. There are two reasons, however, why we do not believe this possibility is

driving our results. First, if embarrassment about making the “wrong” choice were a

factor, one might expect some of the individuals who had chosen option A simply to

state incorrectly that they had chosen option B instead. However, as noted earlier, the

sample proportion matches nearly exactly the proportion of the population that chose

option A versus option B (and this further holds whether people were interviewed

before or after the second B payment was announced and deposited). Second, if

individuals were more likely to regret their decision and blame the government as it

became clearer that all the deferred payments would actually be made, we would

expect that the magnitude of the coefficient on our confidence in government measures

would increase after the second payment was made. However, this is not the case: in

unreported analyses, the coefficients on Choice Time Confidence All B Payments Will Be

Made and Concern Gov’t Might Not Honor Its Commitment are virtually indistinguishable

between those who took the survey before or after the second payment was made.19


19   Among survey respondents interviewed before the second B payment was announced, those who


                                                                                           27
3.7.2 The Importance of Receiving “What is Owed No Matter How Long It Takes”
       Another issue that came out of our pre-survey qualitative research was that a

sizeable fraction of respondents expressed a strong desire to be “made whole no matter

how long it takes.” Qualitatively, it appeared that these individuals were placing

tremendous weight on receiving the full nominal amount they were owed, suggesting

that the nominal value owed served as an important reference point. Averting this

sense of loss seemed more important to these individuals than the specific timing of the

payments or the present value of the payments. Our qualitative research, carried out

prior to our survey, suggests that this factor is tightly linked with the fact that it was the

government who had originally failed to pay people what they were due, and the fact

that they now wanted the government to make them “whole” again.

       To test for this possibility, we asked individuals to rate on a 5-point scale the

relative importance of the factor “desire that the full amount of the debt that you were

due would be paid out, no matter how long it took.” Three-fifths of the population

ranked this factor as very important (4 or 5 on a 5-point scale), while less than one-fifth

rated it as not important to them (1 or 2 on a 5-point scale).

       As shown at the bottom of Table 4, Panel G, those who believed that receiving

the full amount due no matter how long it takes is very important were 27 percentage

points more likely to take the deferred payment relative to those who believed this is


expressed they were very confident at the time of choice that all B payments would be made were 16.6
percentage points more likely to select option B than those who were not confident of this, while that
figure was 13.3 percentage points for those interviewed after the second B payment was made. The p-
value of the difference between these two coefficients is an insignificant 0.40. The difference in the
coefficient on Concern Gov’t Might Not Honor Its Commitment, based on when the individual was
interviewed, is also small in magnitude and highly insignificant. These results were obtained from
augmenting our baseline regression in Table 4 with an interaction of our political-risk variables with
whether the individual was interviewed after the second B payment was made.


                                                                                                   28
not important. To give a sense for the economic magnitude of this attitude, if the entire

population had shifted from their current beliefs regarding the importance of receiving

the full amount due no matter how long it takes (i.e., 61% believing this is very

important and 13% believing this is moderately important) to everyone believing this is

not an important consideration, the selection of the deferred-payment option B would

have fallen from 30.6 percentage points to 11.7 percentage points (the light grey portion

of the leftmost bar in Figure 3). Put another way, a move from everyone believing

“being made whole” is not important to the actual distribution of beliefs observed in the

sample (i.e., 61% believing it is very important and 13% believing it is moderately

important) increases the selection of option B by 18.9 percentage points. Indeed, this

effect is larger than virtually any other variable in our regression.

       To the extent that this focus on the full amount owed is important, it ought to be

the case that the individuals for whom this was an important factor are fairly insensitive

to the internal return offered by the choice of option B over A. Even if the payments

were spread out over a longer period of time, thus lowering the internal rate of return,

the individuals focused on receiving the full nominal amount should still desire option

B. A confounding factor, of course, is that the median age of the individuals our sample

is 68 and, if the payment were spread out over too long of a period, they might be

concerned that they would not receive the full amount due while still alive. The

remaining bars of Figure 3 illustrate these effects by also making use of a question that

asks individuals what pension choice they would have made if the payments had been

spread over 10 years instead of 6 years (which implies a 16.6% rate of return, down

from 26.6%).


                                                                                       29
       In this hypothetical, 10-year deferral scenario, 17.4% of individuals would pick

the deferred money (the “being made whole” component, calculated as above, accounts

for 12.2 percentage points or 70% of this total). Part of the decline in the selection of the

deferred-payment stream likely reflects that many of our respondents might be

concerned about whether they would still be alive at the end of the payment stream. To

help account for this, the right-half of Figure 3 shows the results of the actual 6-year

deferral and the hypothetical 10-year deferral for respondents who would be no more

than 70 years old when they would receive their final payment under the deferred-

payment stream. For this younger population, 39% actually selected option B, and

31.6% would have selected option B even if payments had been spread out longer. The

“being made whole” component, calculated from regression estimates in the same way

it was in the leftmost bars, is nearly identical in the two scenarios, even though the

second scenario (i.e., deferred payments spread out over 10 years) results in a much

lower implicit return from deferring payments. Thus, for this segment of the

population, the nominal reference point is a very important factor in explaining the

choice of option B.

       We recognize that our question is a noisy proxy for whether the individual is

focused on the nominal reference point. As a result, that measurement error may cause

attenuation bias. Potentially biasing in the opposite direction is the possibility that we

may have the causality reversed, that is, that individuals who chose the delayed option

subsequently report their desire to be made whole as an ex-post rationalization

(although, given that their choice appeared to have provided a 26% return, it is not clear

why they would feel the need to rationalize it).


                                                                                          30
       To address both of these potential concerns, we turn to an instrumental variables

strategy. Our strategy builds on the work of Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2004) and

Brown et al. (2008). These studies show that an individual’s region of birth can have

long-lasting effects on attitudes later in life. Our instrument is also motivated by the

“paradox of distance” in the public administration literature. Frederickson and

Frederickson (1997, 187) define this paradox by stating that “while people trust and

even revere those government officials who are near at hand, they believe that

government officials who are far away are lazy, incompetent, and probably dishonest.”

Consistent with this, Schminke, Cropanzano, and Rupp (2002) find that proximity to the

highest level of the organization affects one’s sense of the fairness of the decisions made

by that organization.

       We make use of the fact that individuals born in Central Croatia (the part of the

country centered around the capital, Zagreb) would likely have different views about

the importance of receiving what they are due from the government than individuals in

outer regions of Croatia would. The use of this instrument is grounded in the

administrative division of Croatia, as well as the Croatian historical linguistic map (i.e.,

Central Croatia has a different dialect than the outlying areas do). Our conjecture is that

this physical and cultural separation from the center of government in Zagreb causes

more of a concern about being “wronged” by the government and a greater focus on

wanting to get back everything they are owed in nominal terms (i.e., to “be made

whole”). With the plethora of characteristics we already include in our regression of

payment choice, including controls for county of current residence, measures of income

and wealth, education and financial literacy, age and bequest motives, ethnicity and


                                                                                         31
religiosity, and health status, our identifying assumption is that birth region affects the

choice of whether to defer pension repayment only through the attitudes toward the

government nurtured there.

       Thus, we construct a simple binary instrument based on whether individuals

were born in Central Croatia or in the outlying areas (Figure 4). For perspective, 44% of

Croatians in our survey were born in Central Croatia.

       In Panel A of Table 5, we report the results of our first-stage regression of a

binary indicator variable for whether “receiving the full amount due no matter how

long it takes” is rated as very important against our binary indicator of region of birth.

The results show that individuals born in Central Croatia were 7 percentage points less

likely to indicate that it is important to receive the full amount owed than individuals

born outside of Central Croatia were. This coefficient is virtually unchanged when we

include the full set of other explanatory variables from our earlier regression, including

a full set of 24 indicator variables for the county in which the respondent currently lives,

underscoring that this effect is orthogonal to all the other factors influencing the

pension choice. In the second stage, we find that the instrumented effect of “being made

whole” is statistically significant, with a coefficient of 57, even larger than our baseline

case (consistent with measurement error biasing our estimates downwards).

       The 2SLS results provide confirming evidence that a desire to receive the full,

nominal amount due has a very strong effect on the pension choice. As it turned out, in

this case, this factor works in the direction of pushing individuals toward what might

plausibly be considered, at least ex post, the better financial choice. In other words, a

focus on the nominal amount owed, rather than the recognition of the high internal rate


                                                                                         32
of return, is arguably the most powerful explanation offered by those who chose the

delayed payout, yet this focus on the nominal amount owed is not observable in the

usual household data sets.20


3.7.3 How Government Attitudes Interact with Liquidity Constraints
        We have shown in earlier sections that the liquidity-constrained individuals are

more likely to take the early payment option. Taking this notion further, however, one

might expect that if a person is highly liquidity constrained, then it may simply be an

“unaffordable luxury” to be concerned about trust in government or being made whole.

If so, the regressions estimated on the entire sample may have overstated the effect of

government attitude variables in the liquidity-constrained population, and understated

the effects on those who were unconstrained. We address this possibility through the

addition of interactions of the government attitude variables with our measure of

liquidity constraints described in Section 3.1.21 As a reminder of the importance of the

direct effect of liquidity constraints, we note that only 22 percent of liquidity-

constrained individuals choose the deferred-payment option B (these individuals

represent 51% of the sample that cited liquidity constraints as a very important factor in

their pension repayment choice), whereas option B was selected by 40 percent of




20 The inclusion of variables concerning macroeconomic expectations (Panel F in Table 4) and government
attitudes (Panel G in Table 4) into the specification increases the overall explanatory power of our
regressions by nearly one-third (the adjusted R-squared increases from 0.24 in a regression that includes
only Panels A through E to 0.31 in the regression that also includes Panels F and G). Although these
variables add substantial explanatory power, their exclusion does not create significant omitted variable
bias for the variables typically included in standard data sets. Specifically, the inclusion or exclusion of
these macroeconomic and political variables does not substantially change the coefficients on the
variables in Panels A through E across the two specifications.
21 In the interest of space, we do not report an entire new table with these interactions, but instead report

the relevant new coefficients in the text to follow.


                                                                                                          33
unconstrained individuals (the portion of the sample who considered liquidity

constraints to be of only moderate or of no importance in their decision).

        The results of these interactions indicate that many of the attitudes toward

government have a much stronger effect on the pension-repayment choice for

individuals who are not liquidity constrained. For example, a concern about

government not honoring its commitment has no relation with the pension-repayment

choice for liquidity constrained individuals, but is highly significant and large in

magnitude for those who are not liquidity constrained (with the difference between the

two groups significant at the 1-percent level).22 The interaction term on the other

political-risk question, confidence that all B payments will be made, is not significant,

although a joint test clearly indicates that the combination of these two political-risk

measures differs between constrained and unconstrained individuals (p-value = 0.05).

        Turning to a desire to be made whole no matter how long it takes, we find that

the interaction term with liquidity constraints is also highly significant. For the

population that is not liquidity constrained, a very strong desire to be made whole is

associated with a 34.2 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of selecting the

deferred payments. This point estimate falls to 19.4 percentage points for the liquidity-

constrained subsample (with the difference in coefficients statistically significant at the

1-percent level).

        Thus, liquidity constraints are not only a direct determinant of intertemporal

decisions, but also affect the relative importance of attitudes toward government. In

22Among the population that is not liquidity constrained, those who expressed that a concern that the
government might not honor its commitment is very important are 13.4 percentage points less likely to
take the deferred payment option (coefficient = -13.4, SE = 3.0). For those who are liquidity constrained,
this coefficient is an insignificant 0.6 percentage points (SE = 3.6).


                                                                                                       34
essence, these results suggest that liquidity constraints severely limit the ability of an

individual to take deferred payments, even when an exceptional rate of return of 26

percent is offered and the individual expressed no concern about government reneging

on its commitment.


4. Summary and Conclusions
       In this paper, we empirically examine the determinants of individuals’ discount

rates. We exploit a unique policy change in Croatia whereby retirees were given the

choice between two payment streams to compensate them for past underpayments

from the pension system. One option offered more immediate payments, while the

other offered a more deferred payment structure (with an internal rate of return of more

than 26% compared to the first option). Our use of micro-level survey data enables us to

examine a wide range of possible determinants of this choice, including proxies for

beliefs about various types of political risk.

       We find that the payment stream choice is strongly correlated with a wide range

of explanatory variables. As one might expect, those with higher income and wealth,

and those not facing liquidity constraints exhibited lower discount rates and, thus, were

more willing to accept deferred payment from the government. Family structure and

health were also important in this intertemporal tradeoff. Those with children and self-

reported strong bequest motives were much more likely to accept a deferred pension

repayment option, while those who were older and reported poor health were more

likely to accept the significantly lower amount of money up front.




                                                                                       35
      Unique to this study, we also examine the role beliefs concerning various types

of political risk play in individuals’ decision-making. In particular, we find that the

individuals with low confidence in the government’s ability to make all the payments

promised are much more likely to select a more immediate, reduced payment stream.

      Another important consideration the respondents expressed is the desire to “be

made whole,” that is, to receive the full (nominal) amount owed, no matter how long it

takes. Three-fifths of pensioners regarded this consideration as very important to them.

The prevalence of this desire, and the intensity with which it was felt, is estimated to

have increased the proportion of the population opting for the deferred-payment plan

by the government (which paid out the exact nominal amount owed to the pensioners,

but spread it out over many years) from only 12% of the affected population to 31%.

      Although Croatia’s recent political history differs from that of the U.S. and many

other nations, the findings of this study have direct relevance for debates over public

pension systems in the U.S. and elsewhere. The presence of political risk may lead

participants in these systems to discount future benefits at a higher rate than would be

predicted otherwise by the standard socioeconomic determinants of intertemporal

decision-making. This suggests that many retirees may view as attractive a government

program offering pensioners a lump-sum payment rather than a promised stream of

benefits (even if offered at a substantial discount in present-value terms from the

government’s perspective). An important offsetting factor, however, is the extent to

which individuals assign importance to the nominal value of the promises made.

    The dependent variable is an indicator variable for whether the respondent selected
    pension repayment option B (the more deferred payment option). This variable is
    expressed as 0 if the respondent picked option A (more immediate payment) and 1 if
    the respondent picked option B. The linear regression is estimated by OLS, with robust
    standard errors. For convenience, we multiply all coefficients in the table by 100, so that
    they can easily be interpreted as percentage points. Ten indicator variables for ethnicity
    and 24 indicator variables for residence county are also included in the regression. The
    regression is estimated on 2,490 observations and the adjusted R-squared of the
    regression is 0.31. ***, **, * denote statistical significance at the 1-percent, 5-percent, and

Table 5: IV Regression of Pension Repayment Choice, Instrumenting for the
Importance of “Receiving the Full Amount Due No Matter How Long it Takes” with
whether was Born in Central Croatia
This table presents the two-stage least squares regression of the pension repayment
choice in which the importance of “receiving the full amount due no matter how long it
takes” is instrumented with the birth region of the respondent (the first-stage
regression). Precisely, in Panel A, whether “receiving the full amount due no matter
how long it takes” is very important or not very important is related to whether the
respondent was born in Central Croatia (that is, born in the capital, Zagreb, or
surrounding counties—the region identified as Central Croatia). See Figure 4 for further
details on the definition of Central Croatia. The first-stage regression in column (1)
includes no other controls and the regression in column (2) includes all of the other
explanatory variables included as determinants of the pension repayment choice (i.e.,
all of the other controls used in the regression from Table 4). In Panel B, the dependent
variable of the second-stage (IV) regression is an indicator variable for whether the
respondent selected pension repayment option B (the more deferred payment option).
This variable is expressed as 0 if the respondent picked option A (more immediate
payment) and 1 if the respondent picked option B. In column (3), the importance of
receiving the full amount due is not instrumented for with being born in Central
Croatia, whereas in column (4) it is. The linear regressions are all estimated by OLS or
2SLS, with robust standard errors. For convenience, we multiply all coefficients in the
table by 100 so that they can easily be interpreted as percentage points. The regressions
are all estimated on 2,490 observations. ***, **, * denote statistical significance at the 1-
percent, 5-percent, and 10-percent levels, respectively.

         Associated with a One Percentage-Point Increase in the Individual’s Stated Rate of
         Time Preference, by Subgroups.

         This figure reports the coefficients from a modified version of our baseline regression in
         which we interact the rate of time preference question with indicator variables for
         various subsamples. The first bar represents the coefficient from Table 4, that is, the
         baseline coefficient on our rate of time preference question that shows the change in
         likelihood of selecting option B (the deferred payments) resulting from a one-
         percentage point change in the rate of time preference. Subsequent bars show the effect
         of the rate of time preference for various subgroups, each obtained from a separate
         regression. The effect of the rate of time preference for the full sample is statistically
         insignificant from zero for the full sample, and is statistically different from zero for
         each of the various subsamples (p-values lower than 0.10).

                    Figure 3: Actual Likelihood of Selecting Option B (More Deferred Payment) and
                    Hypothetical Choice if Payments Spread Out Over 10 Years (Rather Than 6 Years).

                    This figure provides a decomposition of how important the factor of “receiving the full
                    amount due, no matter how long it takes” (i.e., “being made whole”) was in the
                    selection of option B (the more deferred payment schedule). The “being made whole”
                    component in the selection of option B is calculated as the difference between the
                    percent selecting option B minus the percent that would have been predicted to select
                    option B if the entire population had shifted from their current beliefs regarding the
                    importance of receiving the full amount due no matter how long it takes to everyone
                    believing that this is not an important consideration (using the Table 4 regression
                    results). We perform this calculation for both the actual pension repayment choice, the
                    first bar, as well as for responses to the hypothetical scenario of the B payments being
                    spread out over 10 years, rather than the actual 6 years (the second bar). These
                    decompositions are then repeated for a subsample of individuals who would be no
                    more than 70 years old at receipt of the last B payment (the two rightmost bars).
