Spurring Job Creation in Response to Severe Recessions: Reconsidering Hiring Credits

                                               ABSTRACT

The continuing adverse labor market effects of the Great Recession have intensified interest in policy
efforts to spur job creation. In periods when labor demand and supply are in balance, either hiring
credits or worker subsidies can be used to boost employment – hiring credits by reducing labor costs
for employers, and worker subsidies by raising the economic returns to work. Historically, both types
of policies have been used in pursuit of distributional goals as well, with hiring credits targeting employment
of disadvantaged workers, and worker subsidies targeting low-income families. Hiring credits targeting
the disadvantaged have generally been regarded as ineffective at both creating jobs and increasing
incomes of low-income families, whereas worker subsidies have been viewed as more successful at
both. However, in the context of the Great Recession – and severe recessions more generally – hiring
credits may be particularly effective at spurring job creation, but only if they are designed quite differently
from past hiring credits targeting the disadvantaged. Moreover, establishing a national hiring credit
that kicks in during and after recessions may be an effective countercyclical measure – a useful addition
to the “automatic stabilizers” already in place, and one that specifically targets job creation.

I. Employment Problems in the Short Term and the Longer Term, and Possible Policy Responses

        The adverse effects of the Great Recession on U.S. labor markets are hardly news. Figure 1

shows the decline in job creation (net job growth) beginning in 2006 followed by sharp declines in jobs in

2008 and 2009, and the corresponding dramatic changes in unemployment rates. The continued

stagnation of job growth since the Great Recession formally ended has made “job creation” the prevailing

mantra in both Washington, DC, and state capitals.

        This paper considers policies that could be used to boost job growth during and after a severe

recession by changing labor demand incentives for employers or labor supply incentives for workers.

Specifically, the paper focuses on subsidies to employers to hire workers (“hiring credits”), and subsidies

to individuals to enter the labor market (“worker subsidies,” in the form of the Earned Income Tax Credit,

or EITC, in the United States). Both types of policies have been used extensively in the past, at both the

federal and state level, although a central motivation of hiring credits targeting the disadvantaged can also

be viewed as redistributing jobs, and the EITC has the explicit distributional goal – quite distinct from job

creation – of increasing incomes of low-income families.

        Viewed as job creation policies, most of the existing research literature fails to provide support

for the use of hiring credits. Hiring credits have numerous problems, including stigmatizing eligible

workers and low participation by firms – which substantially reduce or eliminate employment effects –

not to mention poor targeting of low-income families. In contrast, the EITC, aside from achieving its

distributional goals, is more effective at increasing employment among affected groups and overall

(Dickert-Conlin and Holtz-Eakin, 2000).

        The negative conclusions about hiring credits, which are echoed in standard labor economics

textbooks (e.g., Borjas, 2010, and Ehrenberg and Smith, 2009) as well as recent research (Hamersma,

2005, 2008, 2011), might suggest that hiring credits are not a useful response to the Great Recession or

future recessions: If hiring credits fail even at boosting relative employment of targeted groups, how can

they increase aggregate employment? And how can they achieve a secondary goal of hiring credits in the

current context – helping lower-income families weather the recovery from the Great Recession?


                                                      1
         However, this negative assessment of hiring credits is based on evaluations of credits targeting

the disadvantaged. Drawing on other evidence, this paper argues that hiring credits can be much more

effective at countering the kind of stagnant employment growth experienced in the recovery from the

Great Recession. In particular, a broadly-based hiring credit that does not specifically target the

disadvantaged could avoid many of the problems with hiring credits, and prove effective at creating jobs.

Moreover, during recovery from the Great Recession and other severe recessions, expansions of worker

subsidies are unlikely to do much to spur job creation, insofar as these recessions are characterized by

deficient demand for labor. Thus, reconsidering the broader body of evidence, and placing potential

policies in the appropriate macroeconomic context, suggests that hiring credits, if well-designed, can be

effective at helping spur job creation in the recovery from the Great Recession, and also at mitigating the

effects of future severe recessions.

II. How to Evaluate Job Creation Policies

         For the purposes of evaluating job creation policies to recover from the Great Recession,1 the

alternative job creation policies should be evaluated based on – first and foremost – the net cost per job

created, taking account of direct and indirect costs and benefits. Because these policies are potentially

plagued by large inefficiencies with respect to net job creation, and there may be a variety of longer-term

benefits of employment, estimation of these costs and benefits is difficult and entails some guesswork.

But there is research that provides information on plausible ranges of costs, and that identifies some ways

to make the policies more cost effective.

         Evaluation criteria besides cost also come into play. One is the strength of the evidence for job

creation effects of alternative policies; if the evidence on the effects of a particular policy is less

compelling, the case for that policy must be viewed as weaker. A second is distributional effects.

Although the evaluation of policies on distributional grounds is subjective (for an economist, dependent

on the social welfare function), at a minimum the distributional effects and tradeoffs need to be elucidated

for policy decisionmaking, and in some cases there may be broad agreement on the intended beneficiaries

1
 Much of the discussion from here refers specifically to the Great Recession, but the general issues raised would
carry over to future severe recessions, insofar as they are primarily demand driven.

of policy.

        Finally, the details of implementation introduce an added layer of uncertainty – in particular

whether policy goals and hence effectiveness are likely to be undermined by individual behavioral

responses (e.g., unintended consequences or fraudulent abuse of a program) or political pressure.

Anticipating whether the effectiveness of a policy is likely to be undermined and what might be done to

avoid this is also important in choosing among and designing policies. After outlining the scope of the

analysis this paper presents, each of these issues bearing on the evaluation of hiring credits and worker

subsidies is discussed in the sections that follow.

III. Hiring Credits, Worker Subsidies, and Alternative Policies

        The job losses experienced during the Great Recession, and the stagnant recovery, have led to a

wide variety of policies – some enacted, and others proposed – to encourage short-term job creation. At

the federal level, the principal tools have been stimulative fiscal and monetary policy. And at the state

level the list is almost endless. Just in one state (California), for example, proposals include sales and use

tax exemptions for manufacturing, tax reductions for small businesses, corporate tax reductions and

reforms, tax credits for costs of job training and education, a research and development tax credit,

mandated economic impact analysis of new regulations, regulatory reform, caps on compensatory

damages, a homebuyer tax credit, reducing the capital gains tax, lowering sales tax for new cars, state tax

deductions for Health Saving Accounts, barriers to establishing cap-and-trade to implement climate-

change legislation, creation of another state enterprise zone, repeal of penalties for corporations that

understate tax liabilities, allowing sale of out-of-state health plans, development of High Speed Rail,

expedited public school construction, distributing federal transportation funds for “shovel ready” projects,

promotion of in-state renewable energy resources, and repairs of levees and other flood control

investments.2

        The analysis in this paper focuses instead on policies that directly change labor demand or labor

supply incentives to try to create jobs. In contrast, the policies listed above are likely to deliver only

second-order effects, because they do not directly change the labor demand incentives of firms or the

labor supply incentives of workers. For example, policies such as enterprise zones target employment

growth in particular locations, and thus may act largely to substitute employment in one place for

employment in another, or to lead employers to substitute employees eligible for the credit for those who

are not (Neumark and Kolko, 2010). Policies that subsidize other business activities, such as investment

in machinery, may lead firms to substitute away from labor by lowering the relative price of capital.

Policies that favor particular industries may be more reflective of political influence than job creation

potential. And policies that favor businesses generally – such as reducing taxes or regulatory costs –

should help those businesses become more profitable and expand their workforces; but because such

policies do not necessarily reduce the relative price of labor, the cost per job created may be quite high.

           One potential job creation policy that has received little attention, and correspondingly is not

emphasized in this paper, is increases in public employment – direct job creation by the government.

There is a history with such programs in the United States, including both countercyclical efforts – most

notably the Works Project Administration (WPA) during the Great Depression – and, more recently,

efforts targeting the disadvantaged – such as the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA),

which was in effect from 1974 through 1982. Currently, there are two types of public employment

programs in the United States: youth summer employment programs, sometimes funded by federal grants

(such as the Summer Youth Employment Program funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment

Act, or ARRA); and community-service jobs that are funded and required as part of welfare reform, such

as Wisconsin’s W-2 program.3

           Public employment could be quite expensive relative to hiring credits and worker subsidies. The

latter policies try to spur job creation or increase employment by changing the marginal cost or benefit of

work, whereas public employment requires paying the entire cost of employing the worker. This may

well explain why there is essentially no movement toward creating publicly-funded jobs to help with

recovery from the Great Recession, with the exception of youth programs.4 On the other hand, as

discussed below, it is hard to design hiring credits or worker subsidies that pay only for the increment to

hiring, so the cost comparison with public employment may turn out to be less favorable than it might

appear at first blush. Moreover, the estimates of the cost of job creation via ARRA, as discussed below,

are very high. A final reservation about public employment that has been raised previously is the

potentially low value of the output (Bishop and Haveman, 1978), although it is not necessarily the case

that public employment would create less valuable output than other government spending. In contrast,

incentivizing private-sector hiring should increase derived demand for labor that produces output that is

valued in the market.

        Fairly recent and extensive reviews of public-service employment in the United States are

provided by Bartik (2001) and Ellwood and Welty (2000). These reviews argue that public-service

employment programs have more merit than commonly thought. They argue, in particular, that: the jobs

are not strict “make-work” but produce services that are valued; the programs do displace some public-

sector workers, but if well-designed this displacement effect can be kept to around 25 percent;

administrative costs and barriers are not overwhelming, citing rapid start-up and job creation of some past

programs;5 and there is little evidence of private-sector crowd-out through competition for workers.

However, there are also some important cautions; in particular, there are examples of public-service

employment programs that were “wasteful, inefficient, displacing, and counterproductive” (Ellwood and

Welty, 2000, p. 300).6


4
  Nonetheless, a prominent economist has called for just such a response (Schiller, 2010).
5
  The reviews disagree on some of the specifics regarding this issue. Bartik notes that politics may delay job
creation through these programs, and specifically cites the fact that CETA started in 1974, but did not reach peak
public employment until 1978, “well after employment growth and economic growth had resumed” (p. 177). On the
other hand, referring to the same program, Ellwood and Welty conclude that “There is some evidence from the
recession of 1975 that countercyclical programs can come up to speed quickly” (p. 348). These differing
assessments appear to be mainly different subjective views of the same evidence.
6
  Finally, Lower-Basch (2011) describes subsidized job programs using money from the TANF Emergency Fund
created as part of ARRA. Many states (39, plus the District of Columbia) used these to heavily subsidize jobs –
sometimes up to 100 percent for several months – mainly with private employers. These subsidies targeted low-
income people. There is not really evidence regarding longer-term employment effects, but Lower-Basch argues
that these kinds of subsidies “can help severely disadvantaged workers stay economically active” (p. 7). Although
one might view these kinds of job subsidies as a private-sector substitute for public employment, Lower-Basch
focuses on them as an alternative to the WOTC hiring credit.

                                                        5
         In focusing on hiring credits and worker subsidies, the intention is not to argue that public

employment should necessarily be dismissed. Rather, the focus is on hiring credits and worker subsidies

because, given the widespread concerns about increasing public employment, and severe constraints on

the ability of the federal government to engage in major new spending, using public employment to help

with recovery from the Great Recession is almost surely politically infeasible.7 More generally, this

paper is not intended to be a comprehensive survey or analysis of all policies that could potentially spur

job creation; that would be the task of many papers covering a far wider number of topics. Rather, it

focuses more narrowly on policies that directly affect incentives to hire or to work, and in particular

emphasizes the potential value of hiring credits – properly designed and implemented – in countering the

effects of the Great Recession.

         There may also be alternative policies that lower other costs associated with the employment of

workers – such as taxes on labor, labor market regulations, or minimum wages. Such policy changes

might be expected to have effects in the same direction as hiring or worker subsidies. However, their

effects on job creation would likely be more muted. Reducing taxes on labor generally will reward

businesses even if they do not expand employment. Relaxing labor market regulations will not

necessarily increase employment.8 And minimum wages do not affect many workers.

         Finally, to put this policy analysis in perspective, the comparison of hiring credits and worker

subsidies that this paper presents is not a direct response to alternative policy proposals to use these two

policies to spur job creation during recovery from the Great Recession. Short-term proposals

emphasizing job creation have focused more on hiring credits,9 whereas calls for an expanded EITC have

emphasized either the extra income a more generous EITC can provide to families suffering from the




7
  One could argue, though, that the willingness to engage in “tax expenditures” through lowering taxes or providing
credits, but the unwillingness to increase direct government expenditures, is difficult to rationalize.
8
  In some cases this can have the opposite effect, depending on whether the regulation affects fixed or variable costs.
For example, a lower overtime premium reduces employment as long as the elasticity of the demand for labor (with
respect to the wage) is less than one in absolute value, which is the consensus in the empirical literature
(Hamermesh, 1993); see Cahuc and Zylberberg (2004, Chapter 4).
9
  Most recently, there is a hiring credit for the long-term unemployed in President Obama’s proposed American Job
Act (http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/08/fact-sheet-american-jobs-act, viewed May 11, 2012).

Great Recession (e.g., National Community Tax Coalition, 2010),10 or the longer-employment run

problems for the disadvantaged that they might help address (e.g., Edelman et al., 2009).

         However, because the existing research literature provides a negative assessment of hiring credits,

but a much more positive assessment of worker subsidies, it is useful to reconsider this prevailing view in

the context of the Great Recession. In contrast with the existing assessments of these alternative policies,

this paper argues that during recovery from the Great Recession, a hiring credit targeting job creation

generally, and with other specific elements discussed below, could be particularly effective at spurring job

creation in the short run, while worker subsidies are unlikely to prove useful. Moreover, the same is

likely to be true in countering future severe recessions.

IV. Evaluating Hiring Credits and Worker Subsidies as Job Creation Policies

IV.A. Theory

         Economic theory demonstrates that, in principle, employment can be increased by either

subsidizing employers (with a hiring credit) or employees (through an EITC or other worker subsidy).

The effects of a hiring credit are depicted in Panel A of Figure 2. Because a hiring credit reduces the

effective wage paid by employers, the credit will shift the labor demand curve up and increase

employment. In the figure, the hiring credit (c) shifts the demand curve to D’, so employment increases

from E to E’.11 The wage paid to workers increases from w to w’, although the wage cost of labor to

employers declines to w’(1−c).

         Figure 3 instead illustrates a worker subsidy (e). In this case labor supply shifts out from entry of

workers into the labor market, resulting in an increase in employment from E to E’’. The market wage

paid by employers fall from w to w’’, but workers earn a higher wage because they get w’’ plus the
10
   In fact the ARRA temporarily raised the EITC for families with three or more children, with the goal of helping
working families, rather than encouraging employment (http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=205666,00.html
http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=3361, and
http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/staff_report_ARRA-FINAL.pdf, viewed October 5, 2011),
11
   Note that the figure simplifies in that the hiring credit pays a constant percentage of the wage, rather than, as is
more common, some percentage of wages paid to a worker up to a certain amount. A similar simplifying
assumption is made regarding worker subsidies. Note also that, as the label on the horizontal axis indicates, the
figure (and later figures) are drawn for the level of employment, instead of hours. The figure could represent either,
but depicts employment effects because hiring credits are usually focused on the number of workers employed
(although, as discussed below, the hiring credit in the American Jobs Act proposed by President Obama would
reward payroll increases through higher employment, hours, or wages).

                                                           7
subsidy, or, in the figure, a wage of w’’(1+e). The graph makes clear that both policies are predicted to

increase employment. Moreover, there are values of e and c that can be chosen such that, at least in this

simple, stylized case, the quantitative effects on employment (and wages) of hiring credits and worker

subsidies are equal.

IV.B. Macroeconomic Considerations

           The economic story described above, as the figures indicate, pertains to labor markets initially at

equilibrium (and moving to a new equilibrium). But most economists view severe recessions like the

Great Recession as periods when the (aggregate) labor market is not in equilibrium because demand has

fallen and wages are downwardly rigid, for the simple reason that if labor markets clear like other

markets, then it is hard to explain why we end up with high unemployment, rather than having wages get

bid down to clear the labor market owing to the pressure of workers competing for jobs.

           The question of the nature of economic recessions is a deep and long-standing question in

macroeconomics. Putting things (too) simply, one view is that even though in a period like the current

one, unemployment is very high, labor markets are in fact in equilibrium. In much research the model

corresponding to this view is one in which because of shocks that have hit the economy, worker

productivity is sufficiently low that at the wages currently offered workers choose to be unemployed

rather than to work (Lucas and Rapping, 1969). This requires interpreting measured unemployment as

failing to capture employment prospects for workers at current wages given their skills. In this view,

because the labor market is in equilibrium, policies that shift out the labor supply curve would increase

employment. The more widely held view of recessions, however, is that they are caused when aggregate

demand in the economy declines and short-run rigidities prevent wages from falling to clear the labor

market.

           In the case of the Great Recession, the productivity shock story fits the facts poorly, as

productivity remained high during the recession and afterwards.12 In contrast, there is no doubt that the

Great Recession was caused mainly by a large negative demand shock owing to the collapse of the


12

                                                         8
housing market. In this case, where the labor market is at disequilibrium with deficient demand, pushing

out the labor supply curve, as an EITC or other worker subsidy does, will do little to increase

employment.13 This is made clear by reference to point U in Figure 3, which is meant to depict a labor

market in disequilibrium in which the wage is fixed at a value above its equilibrium level and labor

supply exceeds demand. Because in this case employment is determined solely by the intersection of the

labor demand curve and a horizontal line through the wage, shifting the labor supply curve – as a worker

subsidy would do – does nothing to increase employment. In contrast, as reference to the same point U in

Figure 2 shows, hiring credits have their maximal effect in this case; equilibrium employment increases

by the full horizontal shift of the demand curve, and increases to the greatest extent possible because

wages do not get bid up from the increased demand for labor.14

         Thus, macroeconomic considerations favor hiring credits over an expanded EITC as a policy for

spurring job creation in the recovery from the Great Recession, and the same would apply to future

recessions that are demand-driven. As a consequence, we next turn to a detailed discussion of hiring

credits, before returning briefly to touch on related issues regarding worker subsidies.

IV.C. Hiring Credits15

         In the United States, there is a long history of using hiring credits targeting hiring from specific

disadvantaged groups. In the past, Job Opportunities in the Business Sector (JOBS) targeted hiring of

13
   Another way to think of this is that firms could hire all the workers they want at the going wage, because of
excess supply, which implies that the supply of labor is infinitely elastic (perfectly horizontal) (Katz, 1998, p. 25),
and when the supply curve is horizontal shifting it to the right has no effect on employment. This is strictly true in
the simple supply and demand framework. But in other models a labor supply shift can have some effect. In an
efficiency wage model, for example, higher labor supply will raise the unemployment rate, lowering the efficiency
wage.
14
   One perspective that allows for some potential role for worker subsidies is that policy and other responses to the
Great Recession contributed to the slow recovery by increasing the implicit taxation of income (Mulligan,
forthcoming). Mulligan documents increases in eligibility for safety net programs during the Great Recession and
increases in benefits available under these programs, as well as mortgage restructurings that are often tied to
earnings. He argues that these raised the relative value of not working through higher implicit taxation of earnings,
leading to labor supply reductions. Mulligan’s view is strongly contested; for example, see
http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/the-general-theory-of-anti-mulliganism/ (viewed May 8, 2012.)
Regardless, as long as deficient aggregate demand caused the Great Recession and continues to plague the recovery
– even if it is no longer the only factor – then hiring credits would still be effective.
15
   When hiring credits are designed to encourage job creation – that is, net new hiring – they are sometimes referred
to as “job creation tax credits.” This paper uses the more generic label “hiring credit,” but later on emphasizes the
importance of designing hiring credits to encourage new hiring, rather than simply subsidizing hiring that would
have occurred without the credit.

                                                           9
young (and older) disadvantaged workers, and the Work Incentives Tax Credit (WINTC) targeted AFDC

recipients. The Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC), in effect from 1979 through 1994, targeted these

groups and others, before being replaced by the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which similarly

targets multiple groups. Under the Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA), temporary wage subsidies

went to firms providing long-term employment for recipients of on-the-job training; this was the key

wage subsidy for economically-disadvantaged adults who were not on welfare. JTPA was replaced by the

Workforce Investment Act (WIA) in 2000, which does not include wage subsidies (except for some wage

costs during training).

        In contrast, hiring credits to counter the business cycle have been rarer. The federal New Jobs

Tax Credit (NJTC) was enacted to counter the recession of the mid-1970s; it was unique among federal

efforts in that it was “non-categorical” rather than targeting specific groups.16 The recently enacted

Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act included an exemption from the employer’s share

of Social Security taxes due for March-December 2010, plus an additional $1,000 credit per worker. The

HIRE Act targets those entering employment from unemployment or out of the labor force. And the

American Jobs Act (AJA) proposed in 2011 by Obama Administration would offer payroll tax

exemptions for increments to payroll and a hiring credit for those unemployed more than six months.

        Table 1 provides information on current federal hiring credit policies. There is also a wide variety

of state hiring credit programs, and the table provides examples. Some (Florida and Maryland) focus on

the unemployed, like the HIRE Act, while others couple hiring credits with requirements to invest in

facilities (Delaware) or training (Iowa). Some states tie credit eligibility or amount to what the new jobs

pay.

Predicted effects of hiring credits – theory and reality

        Panel A of Figure 2 illustrated the theoretical prediction that a hiring credit increases employment

by reducing the effective wage paid by employers. There are, however, important complicating factors.

Dickert-Conlin and Holtz-Eakin (2000) incorporate these issues into the standard analysis to show how

16
  Still, the NJTC created stronger incentives to hire low-wage workers by applying only to the first $4,200 of wages
per employee (in 1977 and 1978).

                                                        10
these complications can reduce – perhaps substantially – the incentive effects of hiring credits; see also

Katz (1998). These complications stem from the two key issues that arise in designing hiring credits:

creating incentives for employers to engage in net job creation; and targeting workers eligible for the

credit.

          To create the strongest incentives for employers to create jobs they would not otherwise have

created, a hiring credit has to identify and reward net (positive) changes in employment that would not

have occurred absent the credit. The potential problem is illustrated in Panel B of Figure 2. The

employment gain from the hiring credit is E’ – E. If the subsidy is paid only on the new employment

generated by the hiring credit, then the subsidy cost is given by the rectangle B. But, at the other extreme,

if the subsidy is paid on all employment, then there is an additional cost given by the rectangle A, which

clearly can be far bigger.17 It might seem unreasonable to think about a hiring credit designed so poorly

that it pays the credit for all workers employed prior to the implementation of the credit. However, this

graph fails to capture the dynamics of employment. For a given level of employment there are always

many accessions to jobs and separations from jobs – more so for the unskilled. Thus, even if a hiring

credit succeeds in paying only for new hiring, a good deal of the credit could pay for hiring that occurs as

firms simply maintain employment at their initial levels – that is, for gross rather than net job creation.

          The literature on hiring credits makes clear that efforts to avoid payments for hiring that would

have occurred anyway – referred to as “windfalls” for employers – are largely unsuccessful. Estimates of

the amount of wastage, characterized as the share of credits paid for hiring that would have occurred even

without the credit, are often well over 90 percent (Bartik, 2001).

          Moreover, efforts to design hiring credits that reduce windfalls can lead to unintended

consequences that undermine the job-creation goals of these credits. Paying credits only for new hires

rather than net job growth can create incentives for churning employees, continually firing some and

hiring others to collect more credits. Incentives for churning can be reduced by barring hiring credits to

firms that do not retain subsidized workers, but the requisite record-keeping can pose large administrative

17
   And in reality B would be a much smaller fraction of A + B; in the figure the effect of the hiring credit is large for
illustrative purposes.

                                                           11
costs.18 An alternative approach is to estimate other determinants of employment growth, and pay the

credit for net positive changes that would not have otherwise occurred. In principle this can eliminate

incentives for churning and only pay for jobs created by the credit, but it imposes the need for a good deal

of information from firms and accurate use of this information by administrators. Even then, this

approach is subject to substantial error, it likely entails large administrative burdens on firms, and it could

generate incentives for employment variation since increases are subsidized but reductions are not

penalized.

           For all of these reasons, concerns about windfalls tend to lead hiring credit policies to impose

reporting requirements that are costly for firms. The administrative costs to firms of obtaining hiring

credits for new workers effectively reduce the wage subsidy that the hiring credit generates, hence

diminishing the impact of the wage subsidy and discouraging utilization of the credits.

           Turning from the issue of incentives, the second issue that usually complicates the design of

hiring credits is the targeting of specific groups of workers – for example, the targeting of disadvantaged

workers by federal credits. The motivation for this targeting is twofold. First, hiring credits, like many

other policies, often have distributional goals. And second, lower employment rates among less-skilled,

disadvantaged workers often make them eligible for costly public benefits if non-employed. The cost of

targeting, however, may be that workers who are eligible for hiring credits can become “stigmatized.”

Their eligibility can provide information to employers that they have been unsuccessful in the labor

market, which can lead employers to regard eligible workers as risky or as less productive, offsetting the

potential impact of the hiring credit.

Evidence on effects of hiring credits

           Empirical research addresses the employment effects of hiring credits, as well as the distortions

of firms’ incentives they can induce, and administrative and stigma costs. Reflecting the predominant

experience, most of this research focuses on credits targeting the disadvantaged. However, research on

hiring credits used to counter the business cycle – in particular, the NJTC – may be more relevant in


18
     These and many other issues with the design of hiring credits are discussed in Bishop and Haveman (1979).

                                                          12
thinking about policy responses to the Great Recession, and hence after a brief review of evidence on

targeted hiring credits, the discussion focuses on studies of the NJTC.

        Confirming concerns about low utilization because of administrative costs involved with claiming

hiring credits, Katz (1998) emphasizes the small share of potential hiring credits claimed by employers

under the JOBS and WINTC programs. Similarly, Hamersma (2005) estimates that for the WOTC and

Welfare-to-Work (WtW) tax credits, national participation in 1999 among eligible workers was between

10 and 33 percent for welfare recipients and even lower for other groups.

        Reflecting the problem of large windfalls, Lorenz (1995) suggests that a good deal of claiming of

the TJTC was spurred by management assistance companies or consultants that helped employers file

claims retroactively for workers they had hired. This does not necessarily imply that the credit was

ineffective, as it may have spurred extra hiring even if the credit was not always claimed

contemporaneously. But it is reasonable to interpret a high degree of retroactive claiming as reflecting

substantial windfalls in the form of credits paid to employers who would also have engaged in hiring

anyway.

        There is also evidence suggesting that narrow targeting of hiring credits stigmatizes the intended

beneficiaries, dissipating the effects of the credits. A striking example is an experimental program for

welfare recipients in Dayton, Ohio, under the TJTC (Burtless, 1985). One group received vouchers that

they could present to employers for direct cash rebate subsidies, a second group received vouchers that let

employers claim hiring credits under one of two existing programs, and a third group was eligible for the

same credits, but neither received vouchers to give to employers nor were they told that they were

eligible. The third group had the most success in finding employment. Given that assignment to groups

was random, so that the only difference was the information given to employers and workers, it is

plausible to interpret the worse outcomes for those with vouchers as indicating adverse stigma effects that

reduced the effect of the hiring credits.

        Finally, evidence of positive employment effects is modest at best. The TJTC appears to have

boosted employment of disadvantaged youths, but only modestly (Katz, 1998). Evidence from JTPA,


                                                    13
which targeted economically-disadvantaged adults who were not eligible for the TJTC, indicates positive

and persistent program impacts for adults (measured in terms of post-program earnings) when the

program was combined with job search assistance,19 although no benefits for out-of-school disadvantaged

youths (Bloom et al., 1994). Recent evidence from Wisconsin on the WOTC and WtW credits is more

pessimistic (Hamersma, 2008). Employment effects are small or non-existent, and at best there are

positive short-run effects but no longer-run effects.

        A final criticism of hiring credits targeting disadvantaged, low-wage workers, is that they may do

relatively little to increase incomes of low-income families. As Dickert-Conlin and Holtz-Eakin (2000)

document, the overlap of low-wage workers with poor families is often rather weak, because there are

many non-poor families with low-wage workers, and many poor families have no workers.20

        The NJTC differed from most hiring credits in being non-categorical rather than targeting the

disadvantaged. It was in effect only briefly, from mid-1977 to the end of 1978, to help spur recovery after

the recession earlier in the 1970s (Katz, 1998). The NJTC relied on a simple way of rewarding hiring that

would not have otherwise taken place, offering the credit to firms in which employment increased by

more than two percent, and paying up to 50 percent of the first $4,200 in wages per new hire, up to a

maximum of $100,000 per firm in a year. The broader nature of the NJTC is more similar to other credits

recently used or proposed as countercyclical policy. For example, the recent federal HIRE Act was

similarly non-categorical. And many state hiring credits adopted to help spur employment growth in the

recovery from the Great Recession were either non-categorical or focused broadly on the unemployed.

        In contrast to targeted hiring credits, the NJTC was likely to be claimed by employers; according

to Bartik (2001, p. 210), under the WINTC program fewer than 15 percent of hires eligible for the credit

resulted in the credit being claimed, vs. 50 percent for the NJTC. One possible explanation for the

difference was that the WINTC program was aimed at disadvantaged workers, whereas the NJTC was not

targeted at particular social or demographic groups and may therefore have entailed less administrative

19
   Bartik (2001, Ch. 1) suggests that other efforts in support of hiring credit programs may help overcome stigma
effects by providing some information to employers that the workers are more productive than their “stigmatizing
characteristics” might suggest.
20
   The WOTC may be better in this regard because it targets, in part, long-term TANF recipients.

burden for employers.

           Turning to the evidence on employment effects, Perloff and Wachter (1979) study variation in

whether firms reported that they knew about the NJTC. They found that although one-third of all firms

reported such knowledge, a much higher share of large firms did, and firms that knew about the NJTC

had significantly higher employment growth. Their conclusions are (appropriately) cautious, because any

inference comes from the relationship between employment growth and knowing about the credit, which

is not random. Rather, it is conceivable that “firms with growing employment had a much greater

incentive to learn about the program” (Katz, 1998, p. 31). On the other hand, the NJTC could have been

more effective at larger firms because administrative costs are important, but have a large fixed

component that can be spread over more workers at large firms.

           Evidence from Bishop (1981) suggests that the NJTC increased employment in construction,

trucking, retail trade, and wholesale trade by about 400,000 jobs, or about 0.5 percent of economy-wide

employment, a sizable increase. Bishop suggests that these industries are particularly sensitive to hiring

credits (or changes in input prices generally) because capital equipment depreciates quickly and labor

turnover is high (p. 210), which is relevant to the Great Recession given that is was characterized by

dramatic declines in construction employment. Bishop also uses knowledge about the NJTC as the

“treatment” variable, but rather than individual firm-level variation, he studies a common variable applied

to all firms that captures the time-series variation in the proportion of firms reporting knowledge of the

NJTC. As such, the effect of the NJTC is hard to distinguish from other time-series changes, although an

advantage of this approach is that the identifying information is less likely to be endogenously driven by

which firms are growing.

           Katz (1998) suggests that, overall, the evidence supports the conclusion that this kind of

“temporary, noncategorical, incremental employment subsidy has some potential for stimulating

employment growth” (p. 31).21 This echoes the cautious conclusions in the original papers. Perloff and

Wachter (1979) conclude that “the New Jobs Tax Credit may have shifted the distribution of the rate of


21
     The term “employment subsidy” in this quote is the same as the term “hiring credit” used throughout this paper.

                                                           15
growth of employment” (p. 178), but note that, because “most firms either did not know of the program or

were not influenced by it,” the short-run NJTC was “an imperfect countercyclical tool” (p. 179).

Similarly, Bishop (1981) notes that “Perhaps the NJTC variable is capturing other exogenous forces that

are inducing contemporaneous employment increases … in the sectors studied” so that “the conclusion

that NJTC is having major effects on employment and prices must remain tentative until better data or

more periods of observation become available” (p. 240).

        Bishop (2008) and Bartik and Bishop (2009) interpret the evidence more strongly in advocating

for a federal hiring credit to counter the Great Recession, arguing that “Tax credits for new jobs have

been tried before, and they worked well” (Bartik and Bishop, 2009, p. 9), and that “the NJTC probably

generated at least a million jobs by the end of 1978” (Bishop, 2008, p. 5).22 Based on the evidence,

however, the more cautious summary of the evidence along the line of Katz’s is probably more

defensible.23 Moreover, there is uncertainty in extrapolating to the present results from the NJTC, which

was implemented over 30 years ago.

        State hiring credits are less likely to target the disadvantaged. Most state hiring credits, in some

form or another, try to ensure that the credits are paid for new job creation (see Table 2). For example,

many states tie payment of the credit to the creation of new jobs (e.g., Colorado and Connecticut), and

some have provisions to “recapture” some of the tax credit if net job creation falls below the job creation

for which credits were received. Despite the plethora of state hiring credit programs, the existing research

is nearly exclusively about federal programs. One exception is Bartik and Erickcek’s (2010) evaluation

of the MEGA Tax Credit Program in Michigan, which is quite different from the other hiring credits.

Finally, a very recent paper (Chirinko and Wilson, 2010) estimates the effects of state hiring credits,

finding some modest evidence of positive effects.

        To summarize, the relatively pessimistic conclusions about the effectiveness of hiring credits

apply to programs targeting the disadvantaged. There is reason to believe that more broadly-focused

22
   In this, they echo Hamermesh’s earlier summary of the same evidence, concluding that “The evidence on the
effect of the NJTC on employment growth is both positive and convincing” (1993, p. 192).
23
   Indeed, earlier they described the evidence more cautiously. Bishop’s (1981) reservations were noted above. And
Bartik (2001) wrote that “The NJTC may have created as many as 700,000 new jobs” (p. 226, emphasis added).

                                                       16
hiring credits intended to counteract a severe recession may be more effective.

Costs of hiring credits per job created

        Some of the costs of hiring credits are simple to calculate, such as the amount of hiring credits

paid. Other components of costs are trickier to assess, such as the value of other public services that may

be reduced if tax revenue is diverted to pay for hiring credits, or the costs of tax increases if these are used

to finance the credits. The most difficult and substantively important part of the cost calculation – and

one that cannot be avoided – is the estimate of how many jobs were created as a result of the credit,

because this number, and not the number of jobs credited, is needed to estimate the cost per job created.

Owing to these difficulties and others discussed below, estimates of the net costs of creating jobs via

hiring credits have to be viewed as suggestive calculations rather than as rigorous evidence.

        Even in the context of a very positive assessment of a hiring credit program in Michigan, Bartik

and Erickcek (2010) estimate that the credit is decisive in 8 percent of cases, or that 92 percent of credits

are paid for jobs that would have been created anyway. More typically, the authors suggest, the

corresponding numbers are 4 and 96 percent. The implication is that we need to multiply the hiring credit

cost per worker for whom a credit is claimed by 12.5 to 25 (using the 8 percent or 4 percent figure) to

arrive at the cost per job created. As an example, California’s current New Jobs Credit (NJC) pays a

credit of $3,000 for a worker employed all year. If this particular credit creates jobs at a rate consistent

with the windfall rates suggested above, then the adjusted figure yields a cost per job created of $37,500

to $75,000.

        In a high unemployment economy with little aggregate job growth, it might be easier to pay

hiring credits for new hiring, and hence reduce windfalls. At the same time, even during recessions the

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey shows that many firms are

growing while others are shrinking, so that some hiring would be occurring even at the trough of a

recession, and even absent the incentives. Nonetheless, Bartik’s (2001) very positive assessment of the

NJTC – which recall was enacted to help in the recovery from a steep recession – claims a windfall

wastage rate of only 67 percent. Applying that rate to the $3,000 per worker under California’s NJC


                                                      17
would substantially lower the cost per job created, to about $9,100. In the context of the NJTC, which

paid a larger credit, Bartik calculates, based on an upper bound estimate of job creation as a result of the

NJTC of 700,000, that the cost per job created by the NJTC could have been as low as $13,500 per job

created (in 1998 dollars, or $17,765 in 2009 dollars). Finally, in a recent proposal for a new hiring credit

of 15 percent of additions to payroll subject to Social Security taxes, Bartik and Bishop (2009) estimate a

cost per job created of about $28,000 – a bit higher than some of these other estimates.

         These estimated costs are gross costs of creating jobs through hiring credits. The net costs would

be lower if the increased employment from hiring credits lowered other government costs and increased

economic activity. The most obvious cost offsets from job creation are reductions in Unemployment

Insurance payments and increases in tax receipts – likely to be only a fraction of the cost per job created,

but probably a non-trivial fraction. Benefits may also come from multiplier effects. Even if financed

from taxes, if hiring credits transfer income to those with a higher marginal propensity to consume out of

income, a hiring credit can have short-run stimulative effects.24

         The considerable uncertainty associated with these effects makes it impossible to pin down how

much lower the net costs of hiring credits are compared to gross costs – although clearly they are lower.

Nonetheless, Bartik and Bishop’s (2009) calculations are noteworthy – at least as an illustration that the

gross cost numbers could overstate many-fold the actual cost of hiring credits once these other offsets are

taken into account. Combining their high presumed success rate in creating jobs, with the other estimates

they make of extra GDP and hence government revenue produced by their hiring credit, the net cost per

job created falls to a range of $4,700-$6,300. Even if these figures should be two to four times higher,

they would still be well below some of the gross cost figures cited above, more so if a hiring credit when

the unemployment rate is high is particularly effective at creating net job growth.

         There may also be other benefits from the increased employment from hiring credits, including

the longer-run beneficial effects of the employment induced by hiring credits on affected individuals’

24
  Bartik and Bishop (2009) estimate large effects via this channel that offset more than 75 percent of a hiring credit.
They assume that each new job generates an addition to GDP equal to economy-wide average labor compensation
($62,000), although a lower compensation figure at the level of workers likely to benefit from hiring credits seems
more reasonable.

                                                          18
employment and earnings through the accumulation of labor market experience and skills. Evidence on

whether hiring credits have effects that persist is sparse and ambiguous. Thus, there is probably little

justification for assuming large gains from longer-term effects that extend past the time a worker is

employed because of a hiring credit, although the effects are almost surely in this direction.25

         Bringing all of the evidence together suggests a range of costs per job created using hiring credits

focused on the unemployed of $9,100 to $75,000. The costs are more likely at the lower end of this

range, and perhaps lower still if multiplier effects are significant.

IV.D. Worker Subsidies

         Given the macroeconomic considerations discussed earlier, the potential for using worker

subsidies to increase employment in response to the Great Recession and future severe recessions is

probably quite limited, and the discussion here is correspondingly much briefer. Moreover, the EITC has

broader goals than job creation, which reduce its effectiveness in achieving this more limited goal.

         First, the original intent of the EITC in the United States was not to increase employment, but to

boost incomes of low-income families. As described in Eissa and Hoynes (2011), when the EITC was

first enacted in 1975, the goal was “to offset the Social Security payroll tax for low-income families with

children” (p. 691). At the same time, it was enacted in a period of debate over alternative ways to help

low-income families, including a Negative Income Tax, and according to Eissa and Hoynes it was chosen

as a means of encouraging rather than discouraging work. Moreover, the main reason for the popularity

and increasing generosity of the EITC in recent decades is probably this pro-work incentive that the EITC

generates, which, along with welfare reform, has shifted the nation’s income-support programs towards

those that encourage work (see Blank, Card, and Robins, 2000). As the ensuing discussion explains,

however, the broader goal of increasing incomes for a large number of low-income families with

25
   Bartik (2001, Ch. 5) suggests that long-run increases in employment and earnings based on temporary increases in
labor demand are on the order of 10-20 percent (p. 148). However, these stronger conclusions come mainly from
evidence other than that generated by hiring credits (such as the general evidence from labor economics of a positive
effect of experience on the wage). Indeed the only hiring credit program from which estimates like this emerge is
the Supported Work Program (studied by Couch, 1992). But this program involved far more extensive kinds of
supports (such as mentoring, counseling, or training) than a typical hiring credit program would include – especially
if the program focused on the unemployed rather than the disadvantaged. (In fact, Couch describes the Supported
Work Program as an employment training program.)

                                                         19
employed workers substantially interferes with the effectiveness of the EITC as a job creation policy.

        Second, because of the EITC’s broader income-support goals, its effects are considerably more

complicated than the simple worker subsidy depicted in Figure 3, leading to more complicated predictions

for employment and labor supply. The top panel of Table 2 presents the parameters of the federal EITC

program, as of 2010. In 2010, the federal credit rate for a family with two qualifying children was 40

percent over the “phase-in” range, as earnings climbed from $0 to $12,590. For families with one child,

the incentives were weaker, and there was a very small EITC available to those without children (since

1993).26 However, to cap benefits there was a maximum amount the credit could reach – $5,036 in 2010

for a family with two qualifying children. The benefit then stayed fixed at this maximum over some

range, called the “plateau” (from $12,590 of income to $16,450). Finally, the benefit was phased out at a

rate of 21.06 percent, until it was eliminated at $40,363. Many states have their own EITC’s, which

typically specify a percentage supplement to the federal EITC that is provided to families by the state,

although state EITC’s can differ along a number of dimensions. The states with their own EITC as of

2009 are listed in the bottom panel of Table 2.

        The structure of the EITC generates complicated labor supply incentives. The EITC creates

incentives for increased employment, with one possible exception, but also creates incentives for many of

those already working to reduce their hours. For an individual initially not working, there is no

ambiguity. The higher effective wage in the phase-in range generates a positive substitution effect, but

there is no income effect because the person initially has no earnings. For those already working, in

contrast, the predicted labor supply effects differ. For those employed but in the phase-in range the EITC

raises the wage, with effects that could go in either direction depending on the strengths of the

substitution and income effects. For those on the plateau there is only an income effect, which should

reduce labor supply. And for those in the phase-out range there is still a negative income effect, plus a

higher tax on earnings as benefits are phased out, creating even strong labor supply disincentive effects.

These contradictory incentives are unavoidable given the need to phase out EITC benefits as income rises.

26
  The phrase “without children” means that there are not children that qualify the family for the higher EITC
payment.

                                                         20
Finally, in families with multiple workers an EITC could conceivably lead one spouse to leave the labor

force in response to the higher income paid to the other spouse.

        A third limitation of the EITC as a job creation strategy is that it is also prone to windfalls.

Because of the structure of the EITC, benefits go to a large number of people who would be employed

regardless of the policy – paralleling the problem of windfalls with hiring credits. Indeed these windfalls

could be viewed as consonant with the central goal of the policy, which is to increase incomes among

low-income families with employed people, rather than narrowly targeting those initially out of the

workforce. As a result, there are likely to be even higher windfall costs for worker subsidies, which is

reflected in the cost estimates discussed below.

        Offsetting these limitations, the EITC might have some advantages in trying to increase jobs.

First, the EITC does not generate stigma effects, since the employer typically has no idea whether an

employee is eligible for or receiving the EITC.27 And second, the EITC is easily administered through the

tax code. At the state level it is a simple matter to “piggyback” a state EITC onto the federal EITC

calculation on the federal tax return.28 In contrast, state hiring credits are heterogeneous, and there appear

to be no state hiring credit programs that function as simply add-ons to federal credits, which likely

implies larger administrative and compliance costs.

        The labor supply effects of the EITC have been studied extensively, most recently by Eissa and

Hoynes (2011) and Meyer (2010).29 The empirical research has focused on single mothers, for whom

there is overwhelming evidence of positive employment effects, with an elasticity of employment with

respect to the net income provided by the EITC generally in the 0.7 to 1.2 range. Research on labor

supply reductions among those already working usually finds negative, if modest, labor supply effects

(Eissa and Hoynes, 1998; Hoffman and Seidman, 2003). The EITC appears to increase total hours of

27
   Most EITC recipients choose to take their payment as a lump sum at the end of the year rather than in each
paycheck. (The latter was an option that ended after 2010.) This choice to take the lump sum may have been to
avoid stigma effects.

http://forms.marylandtaxes.com/current_forms/resident_booklet.pdf, p. 9 (viewed August 3, 2010).
29
   Most of the evidence comes from changes in the generosity of the federal EITC, although some also uses variation
in state supplements to the federal EITC (Neumark and Wascher, 2011).

                                                        21
work among women (Keane and Moffitt, 1998; Meyer and Rosenbaum, 2001), and Dickert, Houser, and

Scholz (1995) estimate an overall net positive labor supply effect of the EITC, although it is not large

relative to total labor supply. This calculation captures the essence of the EITC. It does increase labor

supply, because of its strong effect on the employment margin. But it also raises incomes for many

workers, diluting its cost effectiveness as a job creation policy – even putting aside the issue of its

effectiveness during recovery from the Great Recession.

         The wide diffusion of EITC benefits is reflected in calculations of the costs per job created by the

EITC. As for hiring credits, the evidence on costs per job created via worker subsidies is only suggestive

because we do not have readily-quantifiable measures of some of the costs and benefits. In addition,

uncertainty about the negative labor supply effects, and the potential for many families to reap benefits

without changing their behavior, lead to higher cost estimates and a considerably larger range of

estimates.

         Bartik (2001) estimates very high costs of job creation based on the major expansion of the EITC

in the 1980s and 1990s, with the estimated cost per job created ranging from $123,000 to $3.3 million

dollars. However, these estimates are almost surely too high. First, Bartik uses the largest negative

estimate from a study of the effect of the EITC on married women’s labor supply (Eissa and Hoynes,

2004). Other estimates suggest no negative employment effect for married mothers – or at least not one

that is statistically detectable (Eissa and Liebman, 1996). Second, Bartik’s cost estimate uses estimated

employment changes from expansions to the program, but to calculate costs per job created he divides the

cost of the entire program, rather than the cost of the expansion, by the number of jobs created. The

expansions studied by Eissa and Hoynes (2004) and Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001) cover the 1990-1996

period, when federal EITC expenditures increased by about $21 billion (in 1999 dollars). Using this

increase instead of the overall spending figure and assuming no disemployment effect for married women

reduces the cost per job created to about $50,000 to $117,000.30


30
  There is additional uncertainty because the evidence on employment (and hours) effects has focused on two
groups – single mothers and married women with children. These groups make up the lion’s share of EITC
beneficiaries and benefits – 86.8 percent of benefits, and 66.2 percent of families that benefit, in 2007 (Meyer,

                                                          22
          The EITC has an important advantage relative to hiring credits, in that it is well-targeted to low-

income families (Scholz and Levine, 2001; Meyer, 2010). In addition, the evidence on the employment

effects of worker subsidies is more compelling. The conclusions about the employment effects of worker

subsidies are based on well-accepted, convincing research designs usually entailing difference-in-

differences estimators or difference-in-difference-in-differences estimators that control for many

confounding factors. In contrast, the evidence on hiring credits – and in particular, the NJTC – has

limitations, most importantly the difficult of identifying the effect of the NJTC given that it was a national

policy.

          Nonetheless, viewed as a job creation strategy, the estimates of cost-effectiveness suggest that the

cost of creating jobs with the EITC could be very high relative to the cost of creating jobs via hiring

credits. And these costs are lower bounds during recovery from the Great Recession, when deficient

aggregate demand renders worker subsidies particularly ineffective. In contrast, subject to the

qualifications just mentioned regarding the strength of the evidence on countercyclical hiring credits, the

latter are more likely to prove effective at speeding recovery from the Great Recession, and likely also

future recessions.

V. Using Hiring Credits to Boost Job Creation in Recovering from Severe Recessions

          The evidence discussed to this point indicates that hiring credits could be useful in spurring job

creation, especially in response to severe recessions. This section and the next discuss a number of issues

regarding the effectiveness of hiring credits in this context – including how to make them more effective.

The conclusions, including those from the preceding section, are summarized in Table 3.

V.A. Why Hiring Credits Might be Particularly Effective in Countering Severe Recessions

          There are a number of reasons why hiring credits may be particularly effective in countering the

lingering effects of the Great Recession (and other severe recessions). In the short term, the overriding

concern of policymakers is surely putting more people back to work after the Great Recession, and


2010). But absent information on whether EITC benefits for other groups (single men with children, and individuals
and couples without children) increase employment, we cannot do a full accounting of the costs of creating jobs via
the EITC.

                                                        23
lowering the unemployment rate. As a result, hiring credits would focus on the unemployed, rather than

narrower disadvantaged groups. Negative conclusions about the effects of hiring credits (e.g., Dickert-

Conlin and Holtz-Eakin, 2000) are based on evidence on the effects of hiring credits on employment of

disadvantaged workers, for whom hiring credits are quite ineffective. In contrast, the evidence suggests

that a hiring credit that is non-categorical or perhaps focused broadly on the unemployed has greater

potential to create jobs.

        Second, during the recovery from the Great Recession or other severe recessions such a hiring

credit might be maximally effective, as stigma effects should be minimal. For example, with national

unemployment currently hovering above 8 percent, eligibility for a hiring credit based on current

unemployment may not send employers much of a bad signal; everyone understands that many people

have become unemployed in the current downturn through no fault of their own.

        Third, it is likely easiest to get the incentives for new hiring right when using hiring credits to

counter severe recessions. In a period when employment growth is falling or largely stagnant, it should

be a simpler matter to reward hiring that would not have occurred but for the credit, reducing windfalls

for firms that would be hiring anyway. For the same reason, it may be easier to keep administrative costs

low. For example, in the current environment, making eligibility based simply on whether a firm’s

employment is growing might pose acceptable windfall costs, and such a simple rule for establishing

eligibility would impose smaller costs on firms, making the credit more effective. Perhaps tying a credit

to firms whose employment is growing in industries that have had employment declines could reduce

windfalls further while keeping administration simple. Similarly, a credit targeting the recently

unemployed should be simple to administer, as it is easy to verify unemployment status.

        Finally, although a non-categorical hiring credit would be unlikely to have good distributional

effects in normal times, the distributional effects may be more favorable in the short-term. The Great

Recession has had substantially more adverse effects on men than on women, as Figure 4 shows, owing to

substantial employment declines in industries with a large share of males, in particular construction and

manufacturing. Thus, although policies channeling resources towards men typically do not have the best


                                                      24
distributional effects, a hiring credit that directs more of the benefits towards men would help those who

have been hit hardest by the Great Recession (and who would likely be harder hit by future severe

recessions as well, given the cyclical sensitivity of the industries in which men are concentrated). As a

consequence, such a hiring credit would in many cases help families whose incomes are temporarily low

because of an unemployed male.

V.B. Hiring Credits vs. General Fiscal Stimulus as a Short-Term Policy Response

         The earlier discussion suggests a range of costs per job created using hiring credits focused on the

unemployed of $9,100 to $75,000, with costs at the lower end more likely, and perhaps lower if we take

account of multiplier effects. It is informative to compare these cost estimates to estimates of the costs

the United States incurred for job creation via the fiscal stimulus – the American Recovery and

Reinvestment Act (ARRA) – passed to counter the Great Recession. The Congressional Budget Office

(CBO) estimated that through the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 total ARRA stimulus expenditures

were $570 billion and increased employment by 1.4 to 3.6 million jobs (CBO, 2010). These figures,

which account for multiplier effects, imply costs per job created of $158,000 to $407,000.31

         The estimated ranges of costs suggest that the costs of creating jobs via hiring credits could be

much lower than the costs of job creation via the federal stimulus. For example, using the midpoints of

the cost ranges of hiring credits and the ARRA implies that hiring credits would produce jobs at about 15

percent (1/6.7) of the cost of the ARRA. And even using the lowest estimate for the costs under the

ARRA and the highest estimate for hiring credits, hiring credits are more than twice as effective per dollar

spent.

         There are, though, a number of issues that arise in thinking about whether this cost comparison is

valid. First, given that ARRA spending was ramped up and then winded down, at one point should job

creation be measured in a way that is comparable to the estimated costs per job created via hiring credits?

The CBO estimates cited above pertain to a period when the ARRA was likely having a very large effect,

31
  The $570 billion figure comes from the report’s estimate that 70 percent of the total $814 billion impact would
have been spent by the end of fiscal year 2010, which ended in September 2010. And the employment figures come
from the report’s Table 1, which shows employment created through the third quarter of 2010 (that is, September,
2010) of 1.4 to 3.6 million.

                                                       25
rather than later quarters when spending (and the effects) of ARRA had waned (CBO, 2011).

Reinforcing this point, a 2009 report from the White House also emphasized that 2010 was the peak year

for projected job creation under the ARRA, precisely because of when the stimulus spending was slated

to occur (Council of Economic Advisors, 2009). Given that much of the information used to estimate

costs per job created by hiring credits comes from either the NJTC or studies of these costs in the midst of

the Great Recession or early in the recovery, the comparison periods are appropriate.

        A second question is whether the jobs created under the different policies are comparable, given

that jobs are not permanent. The CBO estimates the amount by which employment was

contemporaneously higher because of ARRA, without regard to how long the jobs last. The estimates for

hiring credits based on the NJTC pertain to similar short-term, countercyclical efforts, and likely also

similar workers when those targeted by a broad-based hiring credit would be those who are cyclically

unemployed. Thus, again, to a first-order approximation the ARRA vs. hiring credit cost figures compare

apples to apples

        On the other hand, the comparison may be less fair because one could argue that the goal of

ARRA was not simply job creation, but also the building up of public infrastructure. Investment in

infrastructure is necessary, and it may be most efficient to do this when the economy is operating below

full employment (The Department of the Treasury with the Council of Economic Advisers, 2010),

offsetting the likelihood that public spending on infrastructure is not the most efficient way to create jobs

in the short term. Nonetheless, the ARRA was clearly touted as a means to create and save jobs (Council

of Economic Advisors, 2009), so a comparison on the grounds of job-creation costs is at least to some

extent warranted.

        Moreover, in thinking about additional policy efforts to help with recovery from the Great

Recession, infrastructure investment would likely loom less large, and job creation be an even more clear

priority. Viewed through this lens, the estimates suggest that there may be scope for a significant federal

job creation hiring credit that could have effects on the scale of ARRA, at much lower cost. For example,

using the midpoints of the cost estimates of the alternative job creation policies (which imply that hiring


                                                     26
credits are 6.7 times more effective), a $50 billion hiring credit program would create almost 1.2 million

jobs – nearly the lower range of the CBO estimate of the effect of the ARRA as of late 2010 – with

expenditures less than one-tenth of what ARRA spent. Thus, if additional job creation policies are to be

adopted, the federal government can get a great deal more bang for its buck by focusing on hiring credits.

        Turning this around, because a hiring credit policy might deliver a great deal of bang without

spending a prohibitive amount of bucks, it may be far more politically feasible than additional general

stimulus. And it might be easier to obtain political agreement on an aggressive hiring credit than on

additional general stimulus spending, as a hiring credit lowers costs for businesses and relies on the

private sector to generate job growth.

V.C. Making Hiring Credits More Effective

        The research literature points to a number of ways to make a non-categorical countercyclical

hiring credit more effective. First, hiring credits are likely to be more effective if they are temporary.

Reducing the cost of hiring for a short, predefined period is more likely to shift hiring into that period –

exactly the goal of countercyclical policy.

        Second, although hiring credits have sometimes focused on smaller employers, this may not be

optimal. The basis for designing hiring credits this way is, presumably, because smaller firms contribute

(moderately) disproportionately to net job growth (Neumark, Wall, and Zhang, 2011). But this fact does

not imply that small firms are more responsive to hiring credits than are large firms, and earlier evidence

suggests that it is primarily large firms that take advantage of hiring credits (Perloff and Wachter, 1979),

perhaps because fixed administrative costs deter small firms. In addition, recent research shows that the

disproportionate contribution of small firms to job growth comes solely from newer firms (Haltiwanger,

Jarmin, and Miranda, 2009), so targeting small firms per se may not be effective.

        Finally, an important issue is whether hiring credits should subsidize only new employment, or

increases in hours for existing employees as well (as, for example, in the hiring credit proposed by Bartik

and Bishop, 2009). A large research literature on labor supply concludes that labor supply on the

intensive margin (adjustments of hours conditional on working) is quite inelastic, while labor supply on


                                                      27
the extensive margin (the employment decision) is more elastic (Heckman, 1993). The elasticity of the

labor supply curve plays a key role in determining the effects of a hiring credit. To take an extreme case,

suppose supply is completely inelastic (Figure 5, Panel A). In this case when the labor demand curve

shifts there is no employment increase, and only a wage increase; workers’ wages increase by the full

amount of the credit, and firm’s labor costs are unchanged. Thus, when labor supply is relatively

inelastic, hiring credits result mainly in higher wages for existing workers, and fail to create many jobs.

In contrast, when labor supply is very responsive to wages, a hiring credit pushes out the labor demand

curve against a relatively flat labor supply curve, generating a large employment increase but not much

wage increase (the extreme case is shown in Figure 5, Panel B).

         Thus, a credit that subsidizes the extensive margin will lead to larger effects on total hours of

work. So even if we are agnostic about the merits of creating more “full-time equivalent” employment

through employment of more people or increased hours, a hiring credit that creates incentives for new

employment is likely to be more effective.32 One potential qualification to this conclusion is that during

the recovery from the Great Recession, when part-time work is more prevalent,33 there could be a bit

more labor supply responsiveness on the intensive margin than is suggested by the broader labor supply

literature.

         Note that the two federal hiring credits enacted or proposed to counter the Great Recession fail to

meet some of these criteria for the most effective hiring credits, although both are – to their credit –

largely non-categorical. In particular, the HIRE Act did not explicitly target job creation by, for example,

rewarding hiring only in growing businesses. And the recently-proposed AJA would subsidize hiring in

two ways: exempting employers from the payroll tax for increases in payroll, whether via employment,

hours, or wages; and providing a $4,000 credit for hiring those unemployed more than six months. The

payroll tax exemption would only create incentives for added jobs if we assume that payroll expansions

primarily occur as new hires rather than increased hours of work (or wages). However, as currently


32
   On the other hand, a credit that targets employment per se could encourage part-time hiring. If that is viewed as
undesirable, the value of the credit could be tied to hours worked by new hires.

   See http://data.bls.gov/pdq/querytool.jsp?survey=ln (viewed June 26, 2012).

                                                         28
structured, the AJA’s payroll tax holiday also applies to businesses that increase hours without necessarily

increasing the number of employees. As just noted, because labor supply on the employment margin is

much more responsive to wages than is labor supply on the hours margin, limiting the AJA’s payroll tax

holiday to increases in employment would enhance the likelihood that it would create a substantial

number of new jobs.

         Finally, the current, broader temporary cut in the payroll tax rate on workers from 6.2 percent to

4.2 percent should probably be viewed as general tax relief intended to provide fiscal stimulus, rather than

a policy to promote hiring.34 If it is viewed as a policy to promote hiring, it is a particularly poorly-

designed policy, as the credit is paid for all employees, without trying to target new hiring.

VI. Monitoring, Implementation, and Thinking Ahead

VI.A. Keeping Hiring Credits Effective

         It is important to design hiring credits to minimize windfalls to employers and create strong

incentives for job creation. But research on the political economy of hiring credits also points to the

importance of ensuring that the longer-term implementation of the credit is not distorted to increase

windfalls. Lorenz’s (1995) discussion of the TJTC is instructive. The policy was intended to minimize

windfalls by mandating ongoing program evaluation, with reporting to Congress on the credit’s

effectiveness in increasing employment among targeted groups. Lorenz argues, however, that via the

oversight process interest groups distorted the credit into “a windfall for businesses that hire large

numbers of low wage workers” (p. 270). Thus, even when a hiring credit was designed in recognition of

the problem of windfalls, and mechanisms were built into the policy to minimize these windfalls,

policymakers had difficulty resisting efforts that increased the value of the hiring credit to businesses

while reducing its effectiveness and increasing its costs.

         Some steps that have been adopted or proposed with respect to other hiring credits may help. For

example, Bartik (2001) suggests that to avoid claiming credits for retroactive claiming, under the WOTC

and the WtW tax credits employers and applicants are required to fill out and sign a form on or before the

34
  This is the case despite the name of the legislation that most recently extended the payroll tax cut – the Middle
Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.

                                                          29
data of hire including information indicating that the hire is probably eligible. Similarly, recent proposals

regarding California’s enterprise zone program (a geographically-targeted hiring credit) would have

eliminated retroactive claiming of credits (Brown, 2011).

           Of course these are steps that are designed, ex ante, to reduce the distortions of hiring credits that

can increase their cost and reduce their effectiveness. Given the strong incentives for businesses to

expand the scope of hiring credits that reduce their tax bills, and notwithstanding the best efforts at policy

design, continued evaluation of countercyclical hiring credits is necessary to verify whether credits have

beneficial effects at reasonable cost.

VI.B. A Better Policy Response to Future Severe Recessions

           Experience from policy responses to the Great Recession indicates that enacting new hiring

credits in the midst of or following a severe recession can prove difficult because of budgetary

constraints, resulting in too little, too late – or in nothing at all. Indeed it is likely that the period when

aggressive hiring credits could have had the greatest impact in helping with recovery from the Great

Recession is already behind us. As indicated in Figure 1, we are well past the trough of the recession,

yet policymakers are still debating hiring credits (e.g., in the AJA proposed by President Obama in late

2011). This is not to say that hiring credits would not still have considerable impact; indeed, it is

possible that the marginal incentives created by hiring credits are stronger further from the trough.

Nonetheless, enacting hiring credits much closer to the beginning of a recession runs little risk, if the

credit is well-designed, as the cost of the credit is incurred when the hiring occurs. As salient examples

of the failure to enact hiring credits in a timely manner, the HIRE Act was only enacted in 2010, and the

AJA was only proposed in 2011, while the recession began in late 2007 and the trough was reached in

mid-2009.35

           The experience of the Great Recession suggests that the federal and state governments would

likely be better prepared to counter future recessions if they enacted hiring credits that remain on the

books permanently, but which more aggressively reward hiring unemployed workers during economic


35
     See http://www.nber.org/cycles.html (viewed May 7, 2012).

                                                        30
downturns and “turn off” during better economic times. To provide certainty to employers, and to avoid

political decision-making interfering with the credits taking effect, these might be triggered by pre-

established criteria such as a particular level of the unemployment rate or a specific number of months at

or above that level. Like with Unemployment Insurance benefits, a federal credit could use criteria that

are determined at the state level, to target the credit towards states where the impact would be greater.

         A countercyclical hiring credit, like other “automatic stabilizers,” could help cushion the blow

from future recessions. It might be particularly valuable because it creates direct incentives for the

creation of jobs, in contrast to the less direct effects of other automatic stabilizers – like the income

support provided by Unemployment Insurance or the lower tax payments generated when incomes

decline in a progressive tax system. And finally, automatic rules for hiring credits taking effect, and also

ending, could help avoid the distortion of these credits, over time, into general tax relief that does less to

incentivize job creation.36

         At the same time, it is important to re-emphasize that the arguments in favor of broadly-based

hiring credits are based partly on theoretical conjecture, and partly on evidence – from the NJTC – that is

quite old. The simple fact is that we do not have much experience or depth of knowledge – from either

the research or the policy side – with the design and implementation of effective countercyclical hiring

credit programs, given that we have had only one large-scale program like this (the NJTC), it was decades

ago, and the evidence is less conclusive than what we now expect from the most rigorous empirical

analyses of policy effects.

         We therefore need more evidence on the effects of these types of hiring credits. Some of this

may be available from past experience in the many states that implemented broadly-based hiring credits.

But even more important, newly-established hiring credits should be coupled with ongoing efforts to

evaluate their effectiveness – fine-tuning them in ways that are found to increase effectiveness, and being

willing to scrap them if they prove ineffective. Lest we be too cautious, however, it should be

36
   This proposal has parallels to other automatic stabilizers – in particular temporary income transfers and temporary
consumption tax cuts – proposed by Seidman (2003). Indeed he also proposes using such “pre-enacted” automatic
stabilizers to overcome potential political problems – ensuring that these stimuli are implemented quickly when the
economy slows down, and avoiding growing debt by ensuring that they are eliminated when the economy recovers.

                                                         31
recognized that U.S. policymakers have tried a wide variety of policies to counter the Great Recession –

many at much greater cost than even an ambitious hiring credit policy – with a less solid basis of

evidence for establishing that these policies would work than exists with regard to broadly-based hiring

credits. This experience illustrates that policymakers may not have the luxury of holding policy efforts

hostage to exacting standards of evidence when there is a strong need for policy intervention – a

perspective that should be kept in mind in contemplating the enactment of hiring credits.
