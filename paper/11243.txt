                                             ABSTRACT

We investigate several possible links between psychological factors and trading performance in a
sample of 80 anonymous day-traders. Using daily emotional-state surveys over a five-week period
as well as personality inventory surveys, we construct measures of personality traits and emotional
states for each subject and correlate these measures with daily normalized profits-and-losses records.
We find that subjects whose emotional reaction to monetary gains and losses was more intense on
both the positive and negative side exhibited significantly worse trading performance. Psychological
traits derived from a standardized personality inventory survey do not reveal any specific “trader
personality profile”, raising the possibility that trading skills may not necessarily be innate, and that
different personality types may be able to perform trading functions equally well after proper
instruction and practice.

1     Introduction
The rationality of financial markets has been one of the most hotly contested issues in the
history of modern financial economics. Recent critics of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis ar-
gue that investors are generally irrational, exhibiting a number of predictable and financially
ruinous biases such as overconfidence (Fischoff and Slovic, 1980; Barber and Odean, 2001;
Gervais and Odean, 2001), overreaction (DeBondt and Thaler, 1986), loss aversion (Kah-
neman and Tversky, 1979; Shefrin and Statman, 1985; Odean, 1998), herding (Huberman
and Regev, 2001), psychological accounting (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981), miscalibration
of probabilities (Lichtenstein, Fischoff, and Phillips, 1982), and regret (Bell, 1982; Clarke,
Krase, and Statman, 1994). The sources of these irrationalities are often attributed to
psychological factors—fear, greed, and other emotional responses to price fluctuations and
dramatic changes in an investor’s wealth. In response to the mounting evidence of departures
from market efficiency, a growing number of economists, psychologists, and financial-industry
professionals have begun to use the terms “behavioral economics” and “behavioral finance”
to differentiate themselves from the standard orthodoxy.
    However, recent research in the cognitive sciences and financial economics suggest an im-
portant link between rationality in decisionmaking and emotion (Grossberg and Gutowski,
1987; Damasio, 1994; Elster, 1998; Lo, 1999; Loewenstein, 2000; Peters and Slovic 2000),
implying that the two notions are not antithetical, but in fact complementary. For exam-
ple, in a pilot study of 10 professional securities traders during live trading sessions, Lo
and Repin (2002) present psychophysiological evidence that even the most seasoned trader
exhibits significant emotional response—as measured by elevated levels of skin conductance
and cardiovascular variables—during certain transient market events such as increased price
volatility or intra-day breaks in trend. In a series of case studies, Steenbarger (2002) also
presents evidence linking emotion with trading performance.
    In this paper, we continue this research agenda by investigating role of emotional mecha-
nisms in financial decisionmaking using a different sample of subjects and a different method
for gauging emotional response. In particular, we recruited 80 volunteers from a five-week
on-line training program for day-traders offered by Linda Bradford Raschke, a well-known
professional futures trader (see Schwager, 1994). Subjects were asked to fill out surveys that


                                              1
recorded their psychological profiles before and after their training program, and during the
course of the program—involving live trading through their own personal accounts—subjects
were asked to fill out surveys at the end of each trading day which were designed to measure
their emotional state and their trading performance for that day.
    The results from this experiment confirm and extend those of Lo and Repin (2002) and
Steenbarger (2002)—we find a clear link between emotional reactivity and trading perfor-
mance as measured by normalized profits-and-losses. Specifically, the survey data indicate
that subjects whose emotional reaction to monetary gains and losses was more intense on
both the positive and negative side exhibited significantly worse trading performance, imply-
ing a negative correlation between successful trading behavior and emotional reactivity. Also,
contrary to common intuition regarding common personality traits of professional traders,
the psychological traits derived from a standardized personality inventory survey instrument
do not reveal any specific “trader personality type” in our sample. This raises the possi-
bility that different personality types may be able to function equally well as traders after
proper instruction and practice. Alternatively, it may be the case that individual differences
pertinent to trading success lies below the level that can be assessed through personality
questionnaires, and may become visible only at deeper physiological and neuropsychological
levels, or with a larger or more homogeneous sample of traders.
    In Section 2, we provide a brief review of the literature on emotion, personality, and deci-
sionmaking under risk. We describe our experimental protocol in Section 3, and summarize
our findings in Section 4. We conclude with some discussion of future research directions in
Section 5.


2     Background and Literature Review
Risk-taking as an attribute or characteristic of personal preferences has been investigated
extensively from both psychological and economic perspectives. Psychologists have asked
whether risk propensity exists as a stable personality trait and how the tendency to take
risks manifests itself across different domains of social and personal life. They have also
attempted to determine a persistent connection between the biological basis of personal-
ity and risk-taking (Kuhlman and Zuckerman, 2000). Economists have put forward the


                                               2
notion of risk aversion, and considerable research has been devoted to parametrizing and
estimating its value for individuals and for various demographic, social, and age groups. Un-
fortunately, neither psychologists nor economists have been particularly successful in these
respective endeavors. In particular, no single psychological questionnaire predicts risk-taking
behavior across multiple domains, or explains why someone highly risk-averse in financial
decisionmaking contexts would pursue extremely dangerous sports (Nicholson et al., 2002).
Similarly, the scant differences in risk aversion coefficients that financial advisors are able to
collect from their clients seem to lose much of their value in the face of naive asset-allocation
rules—dividing wealth equally among all available assets, or the so-called “1/n” heuristic—
that Benartzi and Thaler (2001) have documented among individual investors. Moreover,
there has been little direct evidence of correlation between hypothetical financial decisions
made on paper versus real financial decisions involving live market transactions.
   These limitations suggest that risk-taking may be context-dependent, and that charac-
terizing the context along some standardized dimensions may be a more productive line of
inquiry. We propose that the emotional or affective state of the decision-maker and certain
affective properties of the environment are plausible candidates for such a characterization.
In various studies, risk preferences have been linked to the affective state of the subject
and/or affective characteristics of the task. For example, more risk-taking is reported for
negatively framed situations than for positively framed ones (Sitkin and Weingart, 1995;
Mittal and Ross, 1998). When in a positive mood, people tend to be more risk-averse (Isen
and Geva, 1987; Isen et al., 1988). When positive affect is induced, people report losses
to be worse than when no affect is induced (Isen et al., 1988). When the affective state is
manipulated through artificially generated outcome histories, a history of success leads to
higher risk-taking in gambling experiments (Thaler and Johnson, 1990) and in assumed-role
decision experiments (Sitkin and Weingart, 1995).
   Mano (1992, 1993) suggests that a two-dimensional representation of affect—valence
(positive/negative emotion) and arousal (strength of emotional response)—leads to better
understanding of the interaction between affect and risk-taking (see Section 2.2 below for
further details). In particular, Mano (1994) demonstrates that higher arousal is correlated
with more risk-taking in willingness to pay for lotteries and insurance experiments. Recently,
Lerner and Keltner (2002) observe that most of the previous risk studies (e.g., Johnson and

                                                3
Tversky, 1983; Wright and Bower, 1992) have taken a valence-based approach, focusing
exclusively on positive versus negative affective states. Lerner and Keltner (2002) propose
a more subtle differentiation for negative affect, arguing, for example, that fear and anger
influence judgments of risk in opposite ways: whereas fearful individuals make pessimistic
judgments about future events, angry individuals seem to make optimistic judgments instead.
   With respect to the role of emotion in the context of real-time financial risk-processing, Lo
and Repin (2002) demonstrated a clear link using psychophysiological measurements—skin
conductance, breathing rate, heart rate, blood volume pulse, and body temperature—for 10
professional traders during live trading sessions. However, an important limitation of their
study was the lack of any information about the traders’ financial gains and losses because of
confidentiality requirements at the participating financial institution. Therefore, they were
unable to relate psychophysiological responses directly to trading profits-and-losses, and had
to settle for indirect inferences using price data for the instruments being traded by the
subjects. We remedy this shortcoming in the current study, where the subjects do provide
their daily profits-and-losses as well as the number of trades executed.
   The specific emotional context of an individual is often influenced by external factors
such as market events, family history, and even weather and other environmental conditions.
In particular, the non-specific influence on the emotional states of market participants—as
reflected in the systematic depression of stock prices—has been documented with respect to
the amount of sunshine (Hirshleifer and Shumway, 2003), the duration of daylight (Kamstra,
Kramer, and Levi, 2003), and even geomagnetic activity (Krivelyova and Robotti, 2003).
These findings suggest the possibility of gauging the aggregate affective state of the market
through indirect means, and may provide yet another motivation for multi-factor asset-
pricing models where certain common factors are affect-related.

2.1    Emotion, Personality, and Preferences
There is substantial evidence from the personality and social-psychology literature that
preferences are fairly heterogeneous across the general population. Several studies have
established links between specific personality traits and performance in experimental eco-
nomics paradigms. For example, higher extraversion and emotional stability—the opposite of
neuroticism—appear to be related to a higher level of stability in intertemporal consumption

                                               4
patterns (Brandstatter and Guth, 2000). In Dictator and Ultimatum games, higher benevo-
lence as a personality trait facilitated more equitable choices in offers to powerless opponents,
and reciprocity orientation induces powerful recipients to set higher acceptance thresholds
(Brandstatter and Guth, 2002). Greater internal locus of control, better self-monitoring abil-
ity, and higher sensation-seeking have all been linked to higher levels of cooperative behavior
in Prisoner’s Dilemma experiments (Boone et al., 1999).
       In securities trading, the heterogeneity of preferences implies potential differences in
attitudes toward risk-taking across individuals. Various personality assessment methods de-
veloped by social psychologists have been used to examine the relationships between specific
personality traits and risk-taking in different domains. In particular, Nicholson et al. (2002)
examine the relation between personality dimensions from a five-factor personality model
and risk propensity in recreational, health, career, finance, safety, and social domains. In
a study with over 1,600 subjects, they use the NEO PI-R personality inventory (McCrae
and Costa, 1996),1 and find that sensation-seeking, which is a subscale of the Extraversion
dimension, was found to be highly correlated with most risk-taking domains, while overall
risk propensity was higher for subjects with higher Extraversion and Openness scores and
lower for subjects with higher Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness scores. 2
The five-factor model has been independently developed by several investigators, e.g. Gold-
berg (1990) and Costa and McCrae (1992), and is currently the most widely accepted theory
of personality traits. Meta-analytic studies by Barrick and Mount (1991), Tett, Jackson,
and Rothstein (1991), and Hurtz and Donovan (2000) suggest that the personality dimen-
sions from the five-factor model may provide some utility for selecting employees. Barrick
and Mount (1991) aggregate results from 117 studies using meta-analysis and find that
Conscientiousness exhibits consistent relationships with all job-performance criteria for five
occupational groups, and other dimensions were related to job performance for certain types
of occupations. In a cross-cultural study, Salgado (1997) conducts a similar meta-analysis us-
   1
     The NEO PI-R consists of 240 items each rated on a five-point scale, and can usually be completed
within 40 minutes. The five dimensions or factors of personality captured by this instrument are: (see
Costa and McCrae, 1992 for details): Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness,
and Conscientiousness. A shorter version containing 120 items has also been developed and calibrated, and
we use the public-domain version of this shorter survey. See Goldberg (1999), International Personality Item
Pool (2001), and the IPIP website http://ipip.ori.org/ for further details.

     In their study, “risk propensity” is defined as in Sitkin and Pablo (1992), i.e., as “the tendency of a
decision-maker either to take or avoid risks”.

                                                     5
ing European data, and his findings indicate that Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability
were valid predictors across job criteria and occupational groups.

2.2    Measuring Emotional Response
Historically, emotion has been one of the most intriguing and challenging psychological
concepts to define and study. After the seminal work of William James (1884) and Wilhelm
Wundt (1897), emotion became a bona fide subject of investigation among psychologists.
Measuring emotion is an inherently complicated task for a number of reasons. By nature,
emotion is a highly subjective experience, and imposing a common scale across individuals
is likely to yield a fair amount of estimation error. If an introspective or an instantaneous
report is used to assess an individual’s emotional state, the very act of asking the individual
about his or her feelings may change those feelings in some way.
   Laboratory studies have some advantages over field studies because one can employ in-
direct measures such as physiological responses of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)
(Cacioppo, Tassinary, and Bernt, 2000). The ANS innervates the viscera and is responsible
for regulation of internal states that are mediated by internal bodily as well as emotional and
cognitive processes. ANS responses are relatively easy to measure since many of them can
be measured non-invasively from external body sites without interfering with cognitive tasks
performed by the subject. ANS responses occur on the scale of seconds, which is essential
for investigation of real-time risk-processing. In fact, using sensors attached to a portable
data acquisition unit and a laptop computer, Lo and Repin (2002) have demonstrated the
feasibility of conducting psychophysiological field studies of real-time trading activity, in
which five types of physiological data are collected: skin conductance, cardiovascular data
(blood volume pulse and heart rate), electromyographic (EMG) data, respiration rate, and
body temperature. A related set of techniques for measuring emotional response is to employ
some method of facial-expression recognition by an independent observer or through facial
EMG sensors.
   However, despite the advantages of indirect measures of affect, none of these approaches
has been shown to work reliably for an arbitrary emotional expression except for cases
where a well-defined finite set of specific emotions is experienced by the subject during the
course of an experiment (Davidson and Ekman, 1994; Cacioppo et al., 2000; Collet et al.,

                                              6
1997). Moreover, although generally non-invasive, physiological measurements are still fairly
difficult to obtain and properly calibrate, and may not be feasible for many larger-scale field
studies such as the on-line training program of this current study.

   Table 1: UWIST Mood Adjectives Checklist, grouped into eight emotion categories.

   A more traditional method for measuring emotional response is the University of Wales
Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST) Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL), a survey
instrument developed by Matthews, Jones, and Chamberlain (1990) consisting of 42 adjec-
tives that a subject must rate on a seven-point scale (1 = “not at all true” to 7 = “very true”)
as to how well each describes his or her mood at that moment (see Table 1). The UWIST
MACL measures the emotional state of the subject along the lines of a two-dimensional
emotion representation, the circumplex model of Russel (1980). In this model, each specific
emotion is characterized along two dimensions: “valence”, which indicates how pleasant or
unpleasant the emotional state is, and “arousal”, which characterizes how activated or deac-
tivated the person experiencing the emotion feels. For example, feeling bored would imply
a low-activation unpleasant emotional state, whereas feeling excited would imply a highly
activated pleasant emotional state. The scores for eight emotion categories that comprise
different sectors in the emotion circumplex—summarized in Table 1—are calculated based on
UWIST MACL responses: (1) Pleasant, (2) Unpleasant, (3) Activated, (4) Deactivated, (5)
Pleasant Activated, (6) Pleasant Deactivated, (7) Unpleasant Activated, and (8) Unpleasant


                                                          7
Deactivated.
    The accuracy of the valence/arousal representation of emotion is not universally accepted
in psychological literature (e.g., Ekman and Davidson, 1994). Moreover, factors such as the
specific process for eliciting emotion, insufficient emotional intensity in a laboratory setting,
and the purity of emotional experience (i.e., experiencing only one emotion at a time) all
contribute to the challenges of distinguishing individual emotions (Parkinson, 1995). How-
ever, distinguishing specific emotions is significantly more difficult than identifying valence
and arousal (for a discussion see Davidson, 1999; Levenson, 1994), hence the UWIST MACL
often serves as a useful first-order approximation.


3     Experimental Protocol
For this study, we recruited participants from Linda Bradford Raschke’s (LBR) five-week
on-line training program for day-traders. This program was centered around the Observe-
Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) paradigm developed by Col. John R. Boyd as an efficient frame-
work for aiding decision-making processes in a combat environment (Steenbarger, 2002). The
notable aspects of this paradigm are the emphasis on the speed of information processing by
the trader and frequent drills of the OODA loop applied to a given trading context multiple
times during the trading day. The LBR training program was conducted through a series of
on-line lessons and chat sessions conducted by Raschke and her colleagues. Each participant
was expected to complete a daily set of specific paper-trades, i.e., hypothetical trades, but
were also free to engage in actual trades through their personal accounts. The program was
completely anonymous: all communication was done through anonymous e-mail addresses of
the type tr1234@yahoo.com, where “tr1234” served as a unique identifier for each trader.
    Volunteers for our study were recruited through an on-line announcement during one the
initial LBR training program sessions. The subjects were told that a study independent of
the LBR training would be conducted by the MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering. All
interested traders then received an e-mail inviting them to participate in the “Emotions and
Personality in Trading” study, and were promised personalized results after the completion
of the study; no other incentives were provided. The timeline of the study and subject
consent form were provided in the invitation e-mail. The study began on July 7, 2002 and


                                               8
was completed on August 9, 2002 for a total of 25 trading days.
     Because our subjects were geographically dispersed throughout the United States, and
because the duration of the study was several weeks, the most practical methods for as-
sessing emotional state and psychological profile were on-line questionnaires. Therefore, we
asked the participants to complete several survey instruments prior to, during each day of,
and after the training program. Subjects filled out all questionnaires on-line using our web-
site (http://www.riskpsychology.net), using their trading identifiers to obtain authorized
access.
     At the start of the training course, all participants in our study were asked to complete
the following three questionnaires:

A1     Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale
       (SDS). The SDS and SAS insruments are widely used 20-item depression and anxiety
       scales, respectively (Zung, 1965; 1971). SDS is aimed to assess “psychic-active”, physi-
       ological, psychomotor, and psychological manifestations of depression, and is useful for
       discriminating between depressed and non-depressed individuals (Shaver and Brennan,
       1991). SAS measures affective and somatic symptoms of the anxiety disorder; scores
       above a cutoff value suggest presence of a clinically meaningful anxiety. These instru-
       ments are used only to screen out subjects with clinical levels of depression and/or
       anxiety, and none were eliminated by this filter.
A2     International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) NEO. This is the shorter (120-item)
       public-domain version of the McCrae and Costa (1996) NEO IP-R five-factor person-
       ality inventory instrument, which can typically be completed within 15–25 minutes.
       Responses from over 20,000 individuals have been used to calibrate this questionnaire.
       See Goldberg (1999), International Personality Item Pool (2001), and the IPIP website
       http://ipip.ori.org/ for further details.
A3     Demographics and Strengths and Weaknesses. The demographics component
       includes basic background information for each subject such as age, trading experience,
       account size, educational background. Each subject is also asked to report, as free-
       form text, his or her trading-related strengths and weaknesses. These reports are then
       analyzed by the experimenters and similar strengths and weaknesses are grouped into
       categories with a single common underlying theme. Each subject may report several
       or no strengths and weaknesses. See Table 3 for a summary.

Then, at the end of each trading day during the duration of the training program, each
subject was asked to provide the following information:

B1     UWIST Mood Adjective Checklist. This is a 42-item questionnaire, each item
       rated on a seven-point scale, that is meant to capture the emotional state of the subject

                                               9
          at the end of the trading day. The responses are then converted into the eight-category
          emotional circumplex model of Russel (1980) to reduce estimation error (see Section
          2.2 and Table 1). The score for each of the eight emotion categories is calculated as
          the sum of raw scores for individual mood adjectives in that category.
B2        Daily Trading Information. Each subject is asked to report: (1) the total profit/loss
          on paper-trades for the day; (2) the total profit/loss on actual trades for the day; and
          (3) the number of actual trades for the day.

In their daily routine, the subjects first reported their trading results followed by the emo-
tional state questionnaire. During the course of the study, the subjects were reminded several
times that they had to fill out daily emotion and trading reports. The web interface allowed
users to fill out daily reports only for the current day or the day before, which facilitated
late-night reporting and accommodated subjects living in different time zones, but ensured
timely responses.
        Finally, at the end of the five-week program, subjects were asked to complete the following
concluding questionnaires:

 C1 Internality, Powerful Others, and Chance (IPC). The IPC questionnaire (Lev-
    enson, 1972) measures personality traits related to the locus of control, which is a
    term from social psychology that reflects “a generalized expectancy pertaining to the
    connection between personal characteristics and/or actions and experienced outcomes”
    (Lefcourt, 1991). This 24-item questionnaire consists of three subscales consisting of
    eight questions each, rated on a 6-point scale. The Internality Scale (I) measures how
    much of the control of their lives subjects attribute to themselves; the Powerful Others
    Scale (P) measures the extent subjects believe that their lives are controlled by other
    people; and the Chance Scale (C) is related to how much people believe that pure
    chance influences their experiences and outcomes.
C2        Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale
          (SDS). We asked participants to complete these questionnaires again to check for any
          changes in their levels of anxiety and depression. No significant differences were found.


4         Results
During the course of our study, the U.S. stock market experienced a significant decline of over
20%.3 Therefore, it was not surprising that a number of traders dropped out of our study,
expressing their frustration with trading in general. Of the 80 participants that initially
enrolled in our study, only 33 subjects provided valid responses to the final questionnaires.

        For example, from June 20 to July 23, 2002, the S&P 500 Index dropped from 1006,29 to 797.70.

In addition to demographic information, we asked traders to identify the main strengths,
weaknesses, and mistakes in their trading. Their responses clearly indicated that their
primary motivation for participating in the LBR program was to eliminate trading mistakes
and improve on their weakneses. We assume that a similar motivation applied to their
participation in our study. Moreover, many of the subjects did not explicitly distinguish
between our study and the LBR program, often asking us questions that pertained exclusively
to the LBR program.

   Table 2: Summary statistics for subject demographic profiles and personality traits.

   Table 2 provides a summary of the demographics and personality traits of our sample of
80 participants, each of whom acknowledged that he or she was engaged in high-frequency
securities trading, i.e., day-trading, for his or her own personal account. The personality-
profile data reflect raw scores for the five main scales of the IPIP NEO five-factor model,
and the IPC scores reflect raw scores assessed through the IPC Locus of Control instrument.

Figure 1 contains histograms of each of the five IPIP NEO personality dimensions for the
entire sample of subjects.
   Table 3 shows that account sizes varied from $200 to $1,800,000 with a mean of about
$116,000 and a median of $35,000. Subjects’ reported trading experience varied from vir-
tually none to 44 years, with an average of 5.75 years and a median of 3 years. More than
half of the subjects indicated that trading was their full-time occupation. When asked to
rate their own trading performance, 20 subjects indicated that they “mostly break even”;
for 16, trading was “mostly profitable”; for 14, “mostly unprofitable”; for 10, “consistently
profitable”; and for 4 subjects, trading was “consistently unprofitable”. Among the 64 sub-
jects who provided their demographics, 57 were males and 7 were females, with ages ranging
from 24 to 70 and a mean age of 45. 34 subjects were college educated, 17 held graduate
degrees, and 13 completed high school only.

                     Figure 1: Histogram of personality traits for all subjects.

   Figure 1 contains a few interesting regularities. Our sample of subjects scored quite low

                                                       12
in the Agreeableness dimension, and the histograms for Neuroticism and Openness are also
skewed to the left, though not nearly to the same degree. These patterns may seem to
suggest a certain “personality type” for traders, but such a conclusion is unwarranted for
several reasons. First, our sample of day-traders is quite heterogeneous—even with respect to
trading experience—as Table 2 illustrates. Second, these histograms are “point estimates” of
the true distribution of personality traits in the population, and estimation error is likely to
be quite significant in such a small sample. Finally, we do not have a benchmark distribution
for the general population that is matched by age, gender, and education to compare with the
personality scores distribution in our sample of traders, hence there is no way to determine
whether the histograms in Figure 1—even if measured perfectly—are distinct from those of
non-traders.
   Table 3 contains a summary of the self-reported strengths and weaknesses reported by
the subjects, stratified by account size and trading performance. A number of common
traits and behavioral patterns emerge from these strengths and weaknesses. Persistence,
tenacity, perseverance, and commitment were common among 14 subjects; good technical
analysis or “tapereading” skills among 9 subjects; enthusiasm or desire to succeed among 6
subjects; discipline among 5 subjects; intuition or market “feel” among 4 subjects; ability to
cut losses among 3 subjects; and focus or concentration among 3 subjects. Among the most
common weaknesses reported were: lack of discipline, overtrading or unplanned trades (12
subjects); being too emotional or impulsive (11 subjects); lack of confidence, procrastination
or inability to “pull the trigger” (9 subjects); lack of patience (5 subjects); lack of knowledge
or experience (5 subjects); and unwillingness to accept or fear of losses (4 subjects).
   In Section 4.1 we consider links between personality traits and trading performance for
our sample, and in Section 4.2 we turn to the relation between emotional state and trading
performance.

4.1    Personality Traits and Trading Performance
Four out of the five major personality dimensions exhibit small negative correlation with
self-reported and actual trading performance, with Extraversion exhibiting small positive
correlation, but none of these correlations are statistically significant. Older subjects tend to
perform worse, or at least more of them report mostly or consistently unprofitable trading
(−34%, p < 1%). Account size is positively correlated with better trading performance (31%,
p < 5%). Women tend to trade less than men, while older subjects tend to trade less than
younger subjects (all with p < 10%).

4.2    Emotional States and Trading Performance
Table 4 contains summary statistics for the emotional scores of the 69 subjects who filled
out daily UWIST and trading-performance questionnaires, yielding a total of 755 usable
individual daily reports over the five-week period. For each individual daily report, the score
for each emotional category was calculated as the sum of raw scores for the individual UWIST
mood adjectives in that category. Table 5 contains the correlation matrix for emotional
categories, calculated with the raw scores for each emotional category across all days and
all individuals. And for those subjects completing meaningful daily reports for three or
more days, we computed the correlation coefficients between each emotion category and
daily trading performance normalized by the standard deviation of daily profits-and-losses,
reported in Table 6.

   The correlations in Table 5 show that valence and arousal are related, but do capture

                                               15
some independent characteristics of emotion. The highest correlations are between Un-
pleasant and Unpleasant Activated (78.3%) and Pleasant and Pleasant Activated (73.4%),
underscoring the importance of valence as a common factor, but also demonstrating the fact
that the correlation is not perfect, hence arousal is responsible for additional variation. As
expected, Pleasant and Unpleasant are negatively correlated (−45.0%), and the only other
two correlations greater than 50.0% in absolute value are between Pleasant Activated and
Pleasant Deactivated (64.0%) and Activated and Pleasant Activated (59.5%).

Table 5: Correlation matrix of emotion categories, in percent, derived from aggregate emo-
tional scores for all subjects, all days.

   Not surprisingly, we see from Table 6 that normalized daily performance is highly pos-
itively correlated with Pleasant (37.5, p < 0.01%) and highly negatively correlated with
Unpleasant (−31.7, p < 0.01%) emotional states, but not as highly correlated with the Acti-

vated or Deactivated categories. When viewed from the valence/arousal standpoint, trading
performance exhibits correlation with all four combinations of Pleasant/Unpleasant and Ac-
tivated/Deactivated categories. Given the low correlations for the arousal categories, these
higher correlations for the interacted categories may be attributed primarily to valence. A
substantially smaller, but still statistically significant correlation is observed for the trad-
ing performance of paper-trades for the Pleasant category, suggesting that paper-trading
provides some of the same emotional stimuli of live trading, but is not a perfect simulacrum.

Table 6: Correlation between profits-and-losses and eight emotion-category scores for all
subjects, and those in the top and bottom cumulative profits-and-losses terciles, in percent.

    Table 6 also shows that for traders in the top trading-performance tercile, the correla-
tions between profits-and-losses and Pleasant and Unpleasant categories are lower than for
the bottom tercile. This suggests that emotional reactivity may be counterproductive for
trading performance, but the differences are not large enough to render this conjecture con-
clusive. However, subjects whose emotional states exhibited higher correlations with their
normalized daily profits-and-losses (Pleasant with gains, Unpleasant with losses), do tend to
have worse overall profits-and-losses records, supporting the common wisdom that traders
too emotionally affected by their daily profits-and-losses are, on average, less successful.


5     Conclusions
The results of our study underscore the importance of emotional state for real-time trading
decisions, extending previous findings in several significant ways. In particular, although
Lo and Repin (2002) document significant emotional response among the most experienced


                                                         17
traders, our results show that extreme emotional responses are apparently counterproductive
from the perspective of trading performance.
       Contrary to common folk wisdom that financial traders share a certain set of personality
traits, e.g., aggressiveness or extraversion, we found little correlation between measured traits
and trading performance. Of course, this may be due to a lack of power because of our small
sample size and the heterogeneity of our subject pool. In a larger sample, or perhaps in
a more homogeneous sample of professional traders, certain personality traits may become
more pronounced. For example, in a recent study by Fenton-O’Creevey et al. (2004) of 118
professional traders employed at investment banking institutions, they find that successful
traders tend to be emotionally stable introverts who are open to new experiences.
       These findings suggest that typical emotional responses may be too crude an evolutionary
adaptation for purposes of “financial fitness”, and as a result, one component of successful
trading may be a reduced level of emotional reactivity. Given that trading is likely to in-
volve higher brain functions such as logical reasoning, numerical computation, and long-term
planning, our results are consistent with the current neuroscientific evidence that automatic
emotional responses such as fear and greed (e.g., responses mediated by the amygdala)
often trump more controlled or “higher-level” responses (e.g., responses mediated by the
prefrontal cortex).4 To the extent that emotional reactions “short-circuit” more complex de-
cisionmaking faculties—for example, those involved in the active management of a portfolio
of securities—it should come as no surprise that the result is poorer trading performance.
       A number of open research questions remain to be addressed. The lack of correlation
between personality traits and trading performance begs for additional data and a more
refined analysis, particularly in light of Fenton-O’Creevey et al.’s (2004) tantalizing results.
The specific interaction between emotional state and trading performance also deserves fur-
ther investigation, particularly the dynamic aspects that involve the sequence of emotional
and financial states. Finally, the large body of neuro-imaging research provides a wealth
of information about where certain types of decisions and actions originate in the brain. A
more detailed analysis of the neuroanatomical origins of financial risk-processing may yield
significant insights into the individual and aggregate behavior of market participants and

market rationality. Ultimately, we hope to provide a scientific basis for the kind of recom-
mendations for trading success made by Gilbert (2004) in his summary of Fenton-O’Creevey
et al. (2004):

      Be an introvert. Keep your emotions stable. Stay open to new experiences. Oh,
      and try not to be misled by randomness, stop thinking you are in control of the
      situation, and don’t expect any help from your boss.
