                                                ABSTRACT

In this paper, we examine the impact of China's growth on developing countries that specialize in manufacturing.
Over 2000-2005, manufacturing accounted for 32% of China's GDP and 89% of its merchandise exports,
making it more specialized in the sector than any other large developing economy. Using the gravity
model of trade, we decompose bilateral trade into components associated with demand conditions
in importing countries, supply conditions in exporting countries, and bilateral trade costs. We identify
10 developing economies for which manufacturing represents more than 75% of merchandise exports
(Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and
Turkey), which are in theory the countries most exposed to the adverse consequences of China's export
growth. Our results suggest that had China's export supply capacity been constant over the 1995-2005
period, demand for exports would have been 0.8% to 1.6% higher in the 10 countries studied. Thus,
even for the developing countries most specialized in export manufacturing, China's expansion has
represented only a modest negative shock.

1. Introduction

       The explosive growth of China’s economy has been extraordinary. Between 1990 and

2005, China’s exports increased by 25 times in real terms, compared to an increase of about four

times in the 12 largest exporting nations (Table 1). As of 2005, China’s exports accounted for

25% of the total exports of all countries outside of the top 12.1

       What has made China’s emergence potentially disruptive is that the country is highly

specialized in manufacturing. Over the period 2000 to 2005, manufacturing accounted for 32%

of China’s GDP and 89% of its merchandise exports, making it more specialized in the sector

than any other large developing economy (Table 2). In consumer goods and other labor-

intensive manufactures, China has become a major source of supply, pushing down world

product prices. Meanwhile, China has contributed to a boom in demand for commodities,

leading to increases in the prices of metals, minerals, and farm goods.

       The impact of China’s emergence on other developing countries is just beginning to be

appreciated (Devlin, Estevadeordal, and Rodriguez-Clare, 2005; Eichengreen and Tong, 2005;

Lopez Cordoba, Micco, and Molina, 2005). In the 1980s and 1990s, international trade became

the engine of growth for much of the developing world. Trade liberalization and market-oriented

reform in Asia and Latin America steered the regions toward greater specialization in exports.

There is a popular conception that for non-oil-exporting developing countries expanding export

production has meant specializing in manufacturing. But in actuality there is considerable

heterogeneity in the production structures of these economies, which means there is variation in

national exposure to China’s industrial expansion.

  This share excludes Hong Kong and Singapore, which are entrepot economies and whose exports contain a
substantial share of re-exports.


                                                                                                     1
       Even excluding oil exporters and very poor countries, there are many countries that

specialize in primary commodities. In Chile, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, and Peru, for instance,

manufacturing accounts for less than 25% of merchandise exports (Table 2). One might expect

this group to have been most helped by China’s growth, with the commodity boom lifting their

terms of trade. Other countries have diversified export production, spanning agriculture, mining,

and manufacturing.      In Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, and Vietnam,

manufacturing accounts for 30% to 55% of merchandise exports. For this group, China may

represent a mixed blessing, increasing the prices of some of the goods they produce and

decreasing the prices of others.       A third group of countries is highly specialized in

manufacturing.   In Hungary, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Turkey, manufacturing

accounts for more than 80% of merchandise exports. This last group includes the countries most

likely to be adversely affected by China, as it has become a rival source of supply in their

primary destination markets. Between 1993 and 2005, China’s share of total imports rose from

5% to 15% in the United States and from 4% to 12% in the European Union.

       In this paper, we examine the impact of China’s growth on developing countries that

specialize in export manufacturing. Using the gravity model of trade, we decompose bilateral

trade into components associated with demand conditions in importing countries, supply

conditions in exporting countries, and bilateral trade costs. In theory, growth in China’s export-

supply capabilities would allow it to capture market share in the countries to which it exports its

output, possibly reducing demand for imports from other countries that also supply these

markets. We calculate the export demand shock that China’s growth has meant for other

developing countries, as implied by gravity model estimation results.




                                                                                                 2
        To isolate economies that are most exposed to China’s manufacturing exports, we select

developing countries that are also highly specialized in manufacturing. After dropping rich

countries, very poor countries, and small countries, we identify 10 medium-to-large developing

economies for which manufacturing represents more than 75% of merchandise exports:

Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Sri Lanka, Thailand,

and Turkey.2 This group includes a diverse set of countries in terms of geography and stage of

development, hopefully making our results broadly applicable.                  We focus on developing

countries specialized in manufacturing, as for this group the impact of China on their production

activities is largely captured by trade in manufactures. Manufacturing is also a sector for which

the gravity model is well suited theoretically.

        In section 2, we use a standard monopolistic-competition model of trade to develop an

estimation framework. The specification is a regression of bilateral sectoral imports on importer

country dummies, exporter country dummies, and factors that affect trade costs (bilateral

distance, sharing a land border, sharing a common language, belonging to a free trade area, and

import tariffs). When these importer and exporter dummies are allowed to vary by sector and by

year, they can be interpreted as functions of structural parameters and country-specific variables

that determine a country’s export supply and import demand.                  Changes in import-demand

conditions can be decomposed into two parts, one of which captures changes in income levels in

import markets and another of which captures changes in sectoral import price indices for those

markets, which are themselves a function of other countries’ export-supply dummies.

        In section 3, we report coefficient estimates based on our framework. The data for the

analysis come from the UN COMTRADE database and the TRAINS dataset, which cover the

  In Table 2, it is apparent India would also satisfy our criteria. We exclude India because its recent growth
represents another potentially important global economic shock for other developing countries.


                                                                                                            3
period to 1995 to 2005. We estimate country-sector-year import dummies, country-sector-year

export dummies, and sector-year trade cost elasticities using data on a large set of trading

economies that account for much of world trade. We begin by reporting estimated sectoral

exporter dummy variables for the 10 developing-country exporters vis-à-vis China. For 9 of the

10 countries, export supply dummies are strongly positively correlated with China’s, suggesting

that their comparative advantage is relatively similar to that of China. The results also describe

how each country’s export-supply capacities have evolved over time. Relative to each of the 10

countries, the growth in China’s export supply capabilities has been dramatic.

       The main results, presented in section 4, suggest that had China’s export-supply capacity

been constant over the 1995 to 2005 period, export demand would have been 0.6% to 1.8%

higher in the 10 countries studied. The impact is somewhat larger when excluding resource

intensive industries or when focusing on industries in which China’s revealed comparative

advantage appears to be strongest (apparel, footwear, electronics, toys).        For developing

countries highly specialized in manufacturing, it appears China’s expansion has represented only

a modest negative shock.

       It is important to note that our results do not represent a general equilibrium analysis of

China’s impact on other developing economies. China’s export growth may have increased the

number of product varieties available to these countries, thereby improving consumer welfare

(Broda and Weinstein, 2005), or had positive effects on the demand for non-manufacturing

output. Our approach does not account for changes in consumer welfare associated with changes

in product variety or non-manufacturing prices. Nevertheless, the results give a sense of the

extent to which China is in competition with other large developing country exporters for market

share abroad.




                                                                                                4
        By way of conclusion, in section 5, we discuss what China’s continued growth may mean

for manufacturing-oriented developing countries.



2. Empirical Specification

        Consider a standard monopolistic model of international trade, as in Anderson and van

Wincoop (2004) or Feenstra (2004). Let there be J countries and N manufacturing sectors,

where each sector consists of a large number of product varieties. All consumers have identical

Cobb-Douglas preferences over CES sectoral composites of product varieties, where in each sector

n there are In varieties of n produced, with country j producing Inj varieties. There are increasing

returns to scale in the production of each variety. In equilibrium each variety is produced by a

monopolistically-competitive firm and In is large, such that the price for each variety is a constant

markup over marginal cost. Free entry drives profits to zero, equating price with average cost.

        Consider the variation in product prices across countries. We allow for iceberg transport

costs in shipping goods between countries and for import tariffs. The cost-including-freight (c.i.f.)

price of variety i in sector n produced by country j and sold in country k is then

                                          ⎛ σ ⎞
                                  Pinjk = ⎜ n ⎟ w nj t nk (d jk ) γ n ,                 (1)
                                          ⎝ σn − 1 ⎠

where Pinj is the free-on-board (f.o.b.) price of product i in sector n manufactured in country j; σn is

the constant elasticity of substitution between any pair of varieties in sector n; wnj is unit production

cost in sector n for exporter j; tnk is one plus the ad valorem tariff in importer k on imports of n

(assumed constant for all exporters that do not share a free trade area with importer k); djk is

distance between exporter j and importer k; and γn is the elasticity of transport costs with respect to

distance for goods in sector n.




                                                                                                       5
        Given the elements of the model, the total value of exports of goods in sector n by exporter j

to importer k can be written as,

                                                              1− σ n      σ −1
                                        X njk = µ n Yk I nj Pnjk       G nkn     ,                     (2)

where µn is the expenditure share on sector n and Gnk is the price index for goods in sector n in

importer k. Equation (2) reduces to


                                                  (                       )
                                                                          1−σn

                                         H                                 1−σn
                                                                  γ

                                        h =1   ⎣                     ⎦

which can be written in log form as

ln X njk = ln µ n + ln

                                             Yk

                                                                    + ln Injw nj n + (1 − σ n ) ln τnjk + γ n (1 − σn ) ln d jk
                          ∑ Inh ⎡ w nh τnhk (d hk ) n ⎤
                         h =1   ⎣                     ⎦
                                                                                                       (3’)

Regrouping terms in (3’), and allowing for measurement error in trade values, we obtain

                 ln X njk = θn + m nk + s nj + β1n ln τ jk + β2n ln d jk + ε njk .                     (4)

In equation (4), we see that there are five sets of factors that affect country j’s exports to country k

in sector n. The first term ( θn = ln µ n ) captures preference shifters specific to sector n; the second

                          H                               1−σn
term ( m nk = ln(Yk / ∑ Inh ⎡ w nh τnhk (d hk ) γ n ⎤            ) ) captures demand shifters in sector n and
                         h =1     ⎣                      ⎦

importer k (which are a function of importer k’s income and supply shifters for other countries that

                                                   1−σ
also export to k); the third term ( s nj = ln(I njw nj n ) ) captures supply shifters in sector n for

exporter j (which reflect exporter j’s production costs and the number of varieties it produces in the

sector); the fourth and fifth terms (where β1n = 1 − σn and β2n = γ n (1 − σn ) ) capture trade costs




                                                                                                                      6
specific to exporter j and importer k (which in the empirical analysis we measure using import

tariffs, bilateral distance, whether countries share a common language, whether countries share a

land border, and whether countries belong to a free trade area); and the final term ( ε njk ) is a

residual. Exporter j’s shipments to importer k would expand if importer k’s income increases,

production costs increase or the number of varieties produced decreases in other countries that

supply importer k, exporter j’s supply capacity expands, or bilateral trade costs decrease.

        Our first empirical exercise is to estimate equation (4). Then, we use the coefficient

estimates to examine the role of China in contributing to changes in import demand in other

countries. To motivate this approach, consider import-demand conditions in country k, as embodied

in the importer dummy variables in (4). In theory,

                                          ⎛ H                 −σn βn ⎞
                        m nk = ln Yk − ln ⎜ ∑ I nh w1nh−σn τ1nhk d hk ⎟ ,              (5)
                                          ⎜                           ⎟
                                          ⎝ h =1                      ⎠

which captures average expenditure per imported variety by country k in sector n. Import demand

conditions in k are a function of income in k, export supply conditions in k’s trading partners

(embodied in the number of varieties they produce and their production costs), and k’s bilateral

trade costs. Average expenditure per variety in country k would decrease if the number of varieties

produced globally increases (since a given sectoral expenditure level would be spread over more

varieties) or production costs in other countries increases (which would deflect expenditure away

from their varieties). Using (4), we can write (5) as,

                                            ⎛ H ŝ βˆ 1n βˆ 2n   ⎞
                        m nk   = ln Yk − ln ⎜ ∑ e nh τnhk d hk   ⎟⎟ ,                  (6)
                                            ⎜
                                            ⎝ h =1                ⎠




                                                                                                 7
where ŝ nh , βˆ 1n , and βˆ 2n are OLS coefficient estimates from (4).3                         Over time, import-demand

conditions in k will change as its income changes, its bilateral trade costs change, or export-supply

conditions in its trading partners change. As China’s export supply capacity in sector n improves

(due either to increases in the number of varieties it produces or decreases in its production costs),

average expenditure per imported variety in country k would fall, leading to a decrease in the

demand for imports from k’s trading partners.

         Following this logic, we construct the implied change in demand for imports by country k

associated with changes in China’s export-supply capacity. Actual import demand conditions in

sector n for country k at time t are

                                        ⎛ H ˆ ˆ 1n βˆ 2n                ˆ      ˆ ⎞

  One might imagine estimating (4) subject to the constraint in (6). In practice, imposing such nonlinear constraints
would greatly complicate the regression analysis. As a simple check on whether the constraints on the value of mnk
appear to be satisfied in the data, we estimate equation (6) using OLS (after first estimating (4)), the results for
which are reported in Table 4. In most specifications, the coefficient on log income ranges between 0.5 and 1.0 and
the coefficient on the import price index (constructed from the coefficient estimates) is -0.3 to -0.5. These
coefficient signs and magnitudes are roughly consistent with theory.


                                                                                                                                    8
which shows the amount by which import demand in k would have differed at time t had China’s

export supply capacity remained unchanged between time 0 and time t.

           We refer to the quantity in (9) as the counterfactual change in import demand in country k

and sector n. For each of the 10 developing country exporters, we calculate the weighted average of

(9) across importers and sectors. The resulting value is the difference in the demand for a country’s

exports implied by growth in China’s export-supply capacity. An exporter will be more exposed to

China’s growth the more its exports are concentrated in goods for which China’s export-supply

capacity has expanded and the more it trades with countries with which China has relatively low

trade costs. Obviously, this counterfactual exercise is not general-equilibrium in nature, and should

be interpreted with caution. Still, it may be useful for gauging which export producers have been

more exposed to export competition from China.

           One problem with estimating (4) is that at the sectoral level there is zero trade between

many country pairs.4 Tenreyro and Santos Silva (2005) propose a Poisson pseudo-maximum

likelihood (PML) estimator to deal with zero observations in the gravity model. In our application,

this approach is subject to an incidental-parameters problem (Wooldridge, 2002). While in a

Poisson model it is straightforward to control for the presence of unobserved fixed effects, it is

difficult in this and many other nonlinear settings to obtain consistent estimates of these effects.

Since, at the sectoral level, most exporters trade with no more than a few dozen countries, PML

estimates of exporter and importer country dummies may be inconsistent.

           Our approach is to estimate (4) using OLS for a set of medium to large exporters (OECD

countries plus larger developing countries, which together account for approximately 90% of world

manufacturing exports) and medium to large importers (which together account for approximately

90% of world manufacturing imports). For bilateral trade between larger countries, there are

    Zero bilateral trade values further complicate estimating (4) subject to the constraint in (6).


                                                                                                      9
relatively few zero trade values. Since we do not account explicitly for zero bilateral trade in the

data, we are left with unresolved concerns about the consistency of the parameter estimates, which

the trade literature has only recently begun to address.5



3. Gravity Estimation Results

        The trade data for the analysis come from the UN COMTRADE database and cover

manufacturing imports over the period 1995 to 2005. We examine bilateral trade at the four-

digit harmonized system (HS) level for the union of the 40 largest manufacturing export

industries in each of the 10 developing-country exporters.6 The 40 industries account for the

majority of manufacturing exports in the 10 manufacturing exporters, ranging from 71% to 90%

for 7 of the 10 countries (the Philippines, Mexico, Turkey, Malaysia, Romania, Sri Lanka,

Pakistan) and from 48% to 62% in the 3 others (Hungary, Poland, Thailand). The tariff data,

which are based on Robertson (2007), come from the TRAINS database and are the simple

averages of available tariffs at the 10-digit HS level within each four-digit industry. We use the

tariffs that are most applicable to each sector-country pair. For some country pairs, these are the

importer’s MFN tariffs, for other pairs (e.g., NAFTA members) it is tariffs governed by a

regional trade agreement, and for others (e.g., U.S.-Israel) it is tariffs governed by a bilateral

trade agreement.7

        We estimate the gravity equation in (4) on a year-by-year basis, allowing coefficients on

exporter country dummies, importer country dummies, and trade costs to vary by sector and

year. The output from the regression exercise is for each sector a panel of exporter and importer

country dummy variables, trade-cost coefficients, intercepts, and residuals. The country-sector

  We replace missing tariff data with interpolated values based on non-missing tariff data. See Robertson (2007).

dummies are the deviation from U.S. sectoral mean trade by year (as the U.S. in the excluded

country in all regressions). For these coefficients to be comparable across time, the conditioning

set for a given sector (i.e., the set of comparison countries) must be constant. For each sector, we

limit the sample to bilateral trading partners that have positive trade in every year during the

sample period.8



3.1 Summary of Coefficient Estimates

           To provide some background on the industries included in the sample, Table 3 shows the

5 largest industries in terms of manufacturing exports for each of the 10 developing-country

exporters. For 9 of the countries (all except Hungary), manufacturing exports are concentrated in

a handful of industries, with the top 5 industries accounting for at least 20% of merchandise

exports, and for 5 of the countries, the top 5 industries account for at least 30% of merchandise

exports. For 7 of the countries, at least one of their top 5 export industries is also one that

accounts for at least 2% of China’s manufacturing exports.

           The regression results for equation (4) involve a large amount of output. In each year, we

estimate over 10,000 country-sector exporter coefficients and country-sector importer

coefficients and over 200 trade-cost coefficients. To summarize exporter and import dummies

compactly, Figures 1a and 1b plot kernel densities for the sector-country exporter and importer

coefficients (where the densities are weighted by sector-country exports or imports). Figure 1a

shows that most exporter coefficients are negative, consistent with sectoral exports for most

countries being below the United States. Over the sample period, the distribution of exporter

coefficients shifts to the right, suggesting other countries are catching up to the United States.

    This restriction may introduce selection bias into the estimation.


                                                                                                  11
Vertical lines indicate weighted mean values for China’s exporter coefficients in 1995 (equal to

0.44) and 2005 (equal to 1.78), which rise in value over time relative to the overall distribution of

exporter coefficients, suggesting China’s export-supply capacity has improved relative to other

countries over the sample period. Evidence we report later supports this finding. In Figure 1b,

most importer coefficients are also negative, again indicating sectoral trade values for most

countries are below those for the United States.

         To provide further detail on the coefficient estimates, Table 4 gives median values of the

trade cost elasticities by year, weighted by each sector’s share of world trade. The estimates are

in line with results in the literature (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2004). The coefficient on log

distance is negative and slightly larger than one in absolute value; adjacency, common language,

and joint membership in a free trade agreement are each associated with higher levels of bilateral

trade; and the implied elasticity of substitution (given by the tariff coefficient) is close to 3.



3.2 Export Supply Capabilities in Developing Countries vis-à-vis China

         Of primary interest is how the 10 countries’ export-supply capacities compare to those of

China.     Figures 2a-2c plot sectoral export coefficients for each country against exporter

coefficients for China over the sample period (using sectoral shares of annual manufacturing

exports in each country as weights). For each country, there is a positive correlation in its

sectoral export dummies with China, with the correlation being strongest for Turkey (0.63),

Romania (0.59), Hungary (0.48), Thailand (0.48), Malaysia (0.47), Poland (0.45), Sri Lanka

(0.45); somewhat smaller for the Philippines (0.33) and Pakistan (0.32); and weakest for Mexico

(0.12). The correlation for Mexico appears to be driven by industries related to petroleum, which

began the period as major export sectors for the country but have since declined in importance.




                                                                                                     12
       The positive correlation in sectoral export coefficients with China suggests that most of

the large developing countries that specialize in manufacturing have strong export supply

capabilities in the same sectors in which China is also strong. In other words, the comparative

advantage of these countries is closely aligned with that of China. To the extent that the major

trading partners of these countries are the same as those of China, they would be exposed to

export-supply shocks in China, meaning that growth in China would potentially reduce demand

for the manufacturing exports that they produce and lower their terms of trade.

       To see how export supply capacities have evolved over time, Figures 3a-3c plot the year-

on-year change in country-sector export dummies for each of the 10 developing countries against

those for China, weighted by each country’s sectoral trade shares. Immediately apparent is that

the range of growth in China’s export-supply capacities is large relative to that of any other

developing country. Changes in China’s export dummies take on a wide range of values, while

none of the 10 countries shows nearly as much variation. As a consequence, the correlation

between changes in sectoral export dummies between each country and China is weaker than the

correlation in levels. The strongest correlations in changes are for Romania (0.50) and Malaysia

(0.47); followed by Thailand (0.32), Sri Lanka (0.31), Hungary (0.30), the Philippines (0.30),

Poland (0.22), and Turkey (0.21); and then by Pakistan (0.16) and Mexico (0.14).



4. Counterfactual Exercises

       In this section, we compare the change in import demand conditions facing each of the 10

developing-country exporters under two scenarios, one in which import demand evolved as

observed in the data (as implied by the coefficient estimates from the gravity model) and a

second in which we hold constant the change in China’s export-supply capabilities.         This




                                                                                             13
exercise allows us to examine whether China’s growth in export production has represented a

negative shock to the demand for exports from other developing countries.

         According to the theory presented in section 2, sectoral import demand in a country is

affected by its GDP and by its sectoral import price index. Its price index, in turn, is affected by

export supply conditions in the countries from which it imports goods, weighted by trade costs with

these countries. From equation (8), this yields the following relationship:

                                                   ⎛ H ŝ βˆ 1n βˆ 2 n ⎞

                                                   ⎝ h =1               ⎠

      ˆ nht , sˆ nht , βˆ 1n , and βˆ 2n are OLS coefficient estimates of the sectoral importer dummy, the
where m

sectoral exporter dummy, the tariff elasticity, and the distance elasticity from equation (4). In

theory, it should be the case that α1=1 and α2=-1.

         To verify that the relationships posited by theory are found in the data, Table 5 shows

coefficient estimates for equation (10). Departing from equation (10) slightly, we also include

log population as an explanatory variable (to allow demand to be affected by market size and

average income), though it is imprecisely estimated in most regressions. We show specifications

under alternative weighting schemes and for three sets of industries: all manufacturing industries,

excluding core resource-intensive industries,9 and excluding all resource-intensive industries.10

Demand conditions in resource-intensive industries may differ from other manufacturing

industries due to their reliance on primary commodities as inputs. Coefficients on GDP (α1 in

equation (10)) are all positive and precisely estimated, ranging in value from 0.52 to 1.05.

Coefficients on the import price index (α2 in (10)) are all negative and precisely estimated,

   At the two-digit HS level, these industries are beverages, cereals, animal oils and fats, sugar, meat and seafood
processing, fruit and vegetable processing, tobacco, non-metallic minerals, mineral fuels and oils, and inorganic
chemicals.

   In addition to those industries mentioned in note 9, this excludes organic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers,

ranging in value from -0.31 to -0.53. While the coefficient estimates do not exactly match the

theoretically predictions, they are broadly consistent with the model.

         The next exercise is to use the coefficient estimates to examine the difference in demand

for exports faced by the 10 developing country exporters that is associated with the growth in

China’s export supply capacity. The first step is to calculate for each importer in each sector the

value in equation (9), which is,

                  ⎡ ⎛ H             ˆ      ˆ              ˆ      ˆ      ⎞       ⎛ H sˆ βˆ 1n βˆ 2n              ˆ      ˆ ⎞⎤

                                                   ˆ        1n
                                                               dβck2n   ⎟⎟ − ln ⎜⎜ ∑ e nht τnhkt d hk + esnct τβnckt
                                                                                                         ˆ        1n
                                                                                                                     dβck2n ⎟ ⎥ .

This shows the amount by which average import demand in country k and sector n at time t

would have differed had China’s export supply capacity (which reflects the number of product

varieties it produces and its production costs) had remained constant between time 0 and time t.11

                                                               nkt − m nkt for each of the 10
The second step is to calculate the weighted average value of m

developing country exporters, using as weights the share of each importer and sector in a country’s

total manufacturing exports (where these shares are averages over the sample period).12

         Table 6 shows the results from the counterfactual calculation where year 0 corresponds to

1995 and year t corresponds to 2005.13 The first column shows results in which we set α2 from

equation (10) equal to -1, as implied by theory. In 2005, the difference in export demand ranges


11
   An alternative to the counterfactual exercise we propose would be to examine the change in China’s exports
implied by the change in tariffs facing China over the sample period. Were China’s economy in steady state, then
the change in tariffs would be the primary shock affecting the country’s exports. However, over the sample period
China very much appears to be an economy in transition to a new steady state, associated with a sectoral and
regional reallocation of resources brought about by the end of central planning. Thus, focusing on tariffs alone
would miss the primary shock to China’s export growth.
12
   In taking this weighted average across industries, we are approximating for the percentage change in imports with
the log change. This approximation becomes less precise as the growth in imports becomes larger. In unreported
results, we experimented with using the percentage change. The findings are similar to what we report in Table 6.
13
   Because we do not estimate equation (4) subject to the constraint in equation (6), one needs to be careful in
interpreting our results. The counterfactual exercises we report apply to changes in demand conditions rather than
changes in trade. Absent imposing the equilibrium conditions implied by the model, we cannot interpret the
counterfactual exercises as implying how trade would change.


                                                                                                                                    15
from 3.3% in Romania to -1.1% in Sri Lanka, with the Philippines and Mexico among the most

affected countries and Pakistan and Turkey also among the least affected. The mean difference

across countries is 1.6%. Thus, in the developing countries we consider, demand for exports on

average would have been 1.6% higher had China’s export-supply capacity remained constant from

1995 to 2005. The negative difference for Sri Lanka indicates that China’s export-supply capacities

declined in the country’s primary export industries (which include tea). The second column shows

results in which we set α2 equal to -0.5, which is at the upper end of the coefficient estimates for

Table 5. The mean difference in export demand across countries drops to 0.8%. For no country

does China represent a negative export demand shock of greater than 1.7%.

       Columns (3)-(6) repeat the results, excluding resource-intensive industries from the sample.

China’s comparative advantage appears to lie in labor-intensive activities rather than industries that

use oil, minerals, timber, or foodstuffs intensively. In column (3), the mean difference across

countries is 2.7% (compared to 1.6% in column (1)), indicating that China’s impact is indeed larger

for industries that do not use resources intensively. The most affected countries are Pakistan,

Romania, Mexico, Malaysia, and the Philippines. In column (4), in which the value of α2 is set to -

0.5, the mean difference across countries is 1.3%.

       Finally, columns (7) and (8) show results when we limit the industries to apparel, footwear,

electronics, and toys. These include labor intensive industries (or, in electronics, industries with

labor intensive stages of production), in which one might imagine that China’s comparative

advantage is strongest. For these industries, China’s impact is indeed larger, at least for some

countries. The counterfactual increase in export demand would be 3.0% across all countries, with

       The counterfactual exercises indicate that had China’s export-supply capacities remained

unchanged demand for exports would have been modestly larger for other developing countries that

specialize in manufacturing exports. To repeat, across all manufacturing industries, the average

difference in export demand is 0.8% to 1.6%; for non-resource-intensive industries, the average

difference is 1.3% to 2.7%. These are hardly large values, suggesting that even for the countries

that would appear to be most adversely affected by China’s growth it is difficult to find evidence

that the demand for their exports has been significantly reduced by China’s expansion.



5. Discussion

       In this paper, we use the gravity model of trade to examine the impact of China’s growth

on the demand for exports in developing countries that specialize in manufacturing. China’s

high degree of specialization in manufacturing makes its expansion a potentially significant

shock for other countries that are also manufacturing oriented. Of the 10 developing countries

we examine, 9 have a pattern of comparative advantage that strongly overlaps with China, as

indicated by countries’ estimated export-supply capacities. Yet, despite the observed similarities

in export patterns, we find that China’s growth represents only a small negative shock in demand

for the other developing countries’ exports. While there is anxiety in many national capitals over

China’s continued export surge, our results suggest China’s impact on the export market share of

other manufacturing exporters has been relatively small.

       There are several important caveats to our results. Our framework and analysis are

confined to manufacturing industries. There may be important consequences of China for

developing-country commodity trade, which we do not capture. The counterfactual exercises we

report do not account for general-equilibrium effects. There could be feedback effects from




                                                                                               17
China’s growth on prices, wages, and the number of product varieties produced that cause us to

misstate the consequences of such shocks for other developing countries.           There are also

concerns about the consistency of the coefficient estimates, due to the fact that we do not account

for why there is zero trade between some countries.

Notes: This table shows regression of country-sector import dummies on log GDP, log
population, and the log import price index. Standard errors (clustered by industry and year) are
in parentheses. The sample spans 1995-2005 for one of three groups of industries (all
manufacturing, excluding core resource intensive industries, excluding all resource intensive
industries). All regressions include sector-year dummy variables. Weighted regressions use the
share of a sector in a country’s manufacturing exports as weights.
