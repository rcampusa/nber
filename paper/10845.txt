Emerging markets do not handle adverse shocks well. In this paper, we lay out an argument about
why emerging markets are so fragile, and why they may adopt contractual mechanisms -such as a
dollarized banking system- that increase their fragility. We draw on this analysis to explain why
dollarized economies may be prone to dollar shortages and twin crises. The model of crises
described here differs in some important aspects from what is now termed the first, second, and
third generation models of crises. We then examine how domestic policies, especially monetary
policy, can mitigate the adverse effects of these crises. Finally, we consider the role, potentially
constructive, that international financial institutions may undertake both in helping to prevent the
crises and in helping to resolve them.

        There is a strong correlation between the stoppages of capital flows to a country, the extent

of dollarization of the country’s banking system, and the prevalence of banking crises. Between

1974 and 2003, 56 percent of all episodes where capital flows underwent a “sudden stop” ended in

a banking crisis; the same proportion rises to 75 percent in those episodes where the country also

had a high level of dollarization, and to no less than 100 percent, if, in addition to a high level of

dollarization, the country had in place a fixed exchange rate (see IADB (2004)). What accounts for

these correlations? Are there domestic policies that can mitigate such risks? How can international

financial institutions (IFIs) help their member countries avoid, or diminish the consequences of

such a predicament? We address these questions in this paper.

        We review, first, why emerging markets may adopt contractual mechanisms -such as a

dollarized banking system- that accentuate rather than lessen their vulnerabilities. We argue that

weak institutions in emerging markets tend to make it harder for them to cope properly with

economic adversity. The burden of downturns, instead of being shared in predictable ways, is

spread in a haphazard manner, through, for example, selective defaults and high inflation. In such

an environment, and with limited contract enforcement, the best protection for investors against

risks may well be a domestic deposit denominated in foreign currency (following the convention in

this literature, we will call the foreign currency “dollars”).

        Enough dollars at all times is critical to the functioning of a dollarized banking system. We

argue that an incipient dollar shortage, brought about by excessive government borrowing, or an

external “liquidity” shock, or an overvalued exchange rate, can be magnified by a dollarized

banking system, into a total collapse of the financial system, the exchange rate, and other asset

prices. Our explanation of crisis differs in some important aspects from what is now termed the

first, second, and third generation models of crises.

        The links between the government and the banking system can come about simply because

both dip into a common pool of dollars. Difficulties for one may create difficulties for the other

even if the banking system does not hold significant amounts of government debt, or the


                                                                                                         1
government does not bear the contingent liabilities of the banking system. Similarly, the collapse in

the exchange rate and the collapse in the banking system can occur close together, not just because

the corporate or banking system’s liabilities explode in value after depreciation, but also, because

the depreciation is a result of the banking system’s desperation for dollars. While dollar shortages

can cause banking system crises, the reverse is also possible. By no means do we imply that any of

the other channels already identified in the literature are unimportant (see Burnside, Eichenbaum,

and Rebello (2001) or Aghion, Bachetta, and Banerjee (2001) for models that emphasize these

other channels). Rather, we focus on one particular channel, the banking system’s need for dollar

liquidity, which can tie many of these effects together.

          Then, we explore various possible policy interventions to mitigate the effects of dollar

shortages, including whether the multilateral financial institutions have a role to play. If

dollarization arises primarily from institutional infirmities rather than a distorted incentive to take

on risk, it may be costly to legislate it away. Countries may have to learn to live with dollarization

for a while. At the same time, if poor institutions rather than poor incentives are to blame,

interventions to mitigate the effects of dollarization need not exacerbate typical sources of moral

hazard.

          In the rest of the paper, we lay out first the basic argument, and provide evidence for some

of its assumptions. We then examine various interventions domestic authorities could undertake,

and end with a discussion of possible interventions by the multilateral institutions.

                                           I. A Framework

1.1. Why are emerging markets different?

          A growing number of economists identify the quality of institutions as producing important

differences between emerging markets and developed economies. Broadly speaking, economic

institutions may be basic or narrow. By basic, we understand fundamental institutions, such as

those that ensure the security of property including through the prevention of arbitrary taxation, or

those that help enforce contracts. Basic institutions create the broad enabling environment for


                                                                                                          2
transactions between private agents and the state, and between private agents themselves. By

narrow, we understand more detailed features of the institutional environment, such as whether the

central bank is de-facto independent or whether there is a functioning bankruptcy code. Although

not without exceptions, a country with weak basic institutions also finds it difficult to build

effective narrow institutions.

        One important role played by basic institutions is to mediate the process and outcome of

social conflicts, particularly so in times of adversity. Typically, in a growing economy differences

between social actors may be papered over. A downturn, though, usually brings out, or sharpens

latent social tensions.

        Why growth seems to be easier to share than adversity is no trivial question. If

consumption is shaped by habit, an income loss is much harder to swallow, while satisfaction from

additional gains less important to fight for. Individual aversion to losses in wealth is well-

documented in behavioral science. On the other hand, conflict may dissipate growth opportunities

more easily than it may worsen an already stagnant situation. For example, squabbling between

workers and management may drive investors away, chasing away the chance to start new projects;

but if there are no new investment opportunities on the horizon, squabbling is less costly as the

existing plant and machinery is already sunk investment.

        Regardless of why conflicts are greater in times of economic adversity, how a society deals

with them depends on the kind of institutions of conflict management it has. In a comprehensive

study of failed states, Collier et al. (2003) find that years of poor economic growth precede civil

war. Even after concluding a peace, the probability of these states lapsing anew into war is high.

Not surprisingly, these states typically have weak institutions of conflict management such as

patchy enforcement of the law, limited adherence to democratic principles, and few meaningful

checks and balances on the government. Similarly, Rodrik (1999) finds that the countries that

experienced the sharpest drops in growth after 1975 were those with divided societies and weak




                                                                                                       3
institutions of conflict management (as proxied for by indicators of the quality of government

institutions, rule of law, democratic rights, and social safety nets).

        Acemogulu, Johnson, et al. (2003) find that countries with poor institutions have the

highest volatility of growth and higher levels of inflation. Satyanath and Subramanian (2004) show

that over and above the effect of policies, the quality of political institutions affects the extent of

nominal macroeconomic instability in a country.

        Societies with well functioning institutions allocate burden sharing in times of distress in

predictable ways. For example, those who suffer the most adversity can fall back on an explicit

social safety net – a minimum level of unemployment insurance. Debtors and creditors can appeal

to bankruptcy proceedings to determine their relative shares. With an explicit and contingent

institutional sharing mechanism dictating the division of pain in place, there is no need to take to

the streets, the backrooms, or to the money printing press to settle outcomes.

        By contrast, when institutions are too weak to offer predictable and acceptable settlements,

or protect existing shares, everyone has an incentive to jockey for a greater share of the pie.

Outcomes will be mediated more by the relative bargaining power of actors than by pre-existing

implicit or explicit contracts.

        Often, bargaining will break down. Then, a government without the institutional capacity

to allocate the burdens of adversity among its citizenry fairly will be tempted to spread it through

the easiest means available, inflation. Nominal instability will accompany real instability in

countries with weak institutions, lending support to the view that while the proximate cause for

inflation may be monetary expansion, inflation is always and everywhere a political phenomenon!

1.2. Evidence for the link between inflation and poor growth.

        We want to establish two facts here, which are a little different from the work cited so far.

First, we want to test whether the inflation “tax” is higher in downturns, and second, whether this

phenomenon is particularly acute for countries with poor institutions. To check this, we have data

on the value of the inflation tax, which is measured as ∆CPI /(1+ ∆CPI) where ∆CPI is the change


                                                                                                          4
in the Consumer Price Index in the country over the year. This is computed every year from 1965

to 2002 for 165 countries. In Table 1, we present summary statistics and cross-correlations for the

inflation tax, the standard deviation of the inflation tax computed over the preceding five years, the

growth rate in GDP, and the quality of institutions measured by four different indices: government

efficiency, rule of law, quality of regulation, and control of corruption. These indices are from the

Governance Matters III database (Kaufman, et al. (2003)). We also report an index of institutional

quality constructed using the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) indicators; this second

institutional index approximates the one used by Knack and Keefer (1995).

         In Figure 1, we plot the real growth of a country’s GDP, averaged over 1980 to 1995

against average inflation tax over the same period, separately for countries with below median

levels of government effectiveness and countries above median. The negative slope is steeper in the

former, suggesting that slower growth is correlated with more inflation in countries with weak

institutions.

         Rather than average correlations, we are interested in the time series patterns across

countries. In Table 2 we use a panel of yearly observations between 1965 and 2002 where the

dependent variable is the inflation tax in a year in a country. In column (1), we estimate a random

effects GLS model where the explanatory variables are a constant and the growth rate in GDP. The

coefficient of the GDP growth rate is negative and highly significant suggesting that the inflation

tax is highest in periods of low GDP growth. A standard deviation increase in the growth rate is

associated with a reduction in the inflation tax by .0241, which is 20 percent of its sample standard

deviation. In column (2), we include the index of government efficiency (the results with the other

“Governance Matters” institutional variables are qualitatively similar) and the interaction of GDP

growth with the index. As the prior literature has found, countries with a better institutional

environment tend to experience lower inflation tax. Particularly interesting is that the positive

significant coefficient of the interaction term suggests, as predicted, that the inflation tax in




                                                                                                        5
countries with better institutions is less sensitive to growth. In column (3), we estimate the model

including country fixed effects, and find no qualitative change in the coefficients of interest. 2

         One problem with the estimated model is that we cannot tell the direction of causality.

High inflation may, in fact, cause low growth, though why this should be more pronounced in

countries with poor institutions is harder to say. Nevertheless, it is important to examine the effect

of the exogenous component of growth on the inflation tax. Typically, a country will be affected by

similar exogenous shocks as its neighbors, if not directly, then via trade. So one plausible

instrument for a country’s i’s growth is EXTGROWTH, which is the weighted average growth of

all other countries j, with each country j’s growth weighted by that country’s log GDP and divided

by the square of the distance between i and j. In column (4), we re-estimate the fixed effects model,

using EXTGROWTH to instrument for growth. The coefficient of the interaction is now larger in

magnitude and stronger in significance.

         Large countries may affect the growth of their neighbors, so there is a case for arguing the

instrument is purer for small countries. One should ask if the coefficient estimate for the interaction

differs for small countries. In column 5, we re-estimate the fixed effect instrumented regression

with an additional term, the interaction multiplied by an indicator for countries whose GDP is

below the 90th percentile GDP. The coefficient estimate for the indicator is statistically insignificant

and small, suggesting that small countries do not have a different estimated interaction coefficient

than large countries. This lends confidence to the instrument for growth.

         There could, however, be some concern about our measure for institutional quality. It may

be that the proxy for institutions is simply a proxy for per capita GDP. In column (6), we also

include the interaction between initial GDP for the country (in 1965 or the first year for which we

have GDP) and the country’s growth rate. The coefficient of the interaction between institutions

and growth is now slightly higher in magnitude, and still strongly significant.


2
 We also cluster by country and include year indicators with no qualitative change in the interaction
coefficient.


                                                                                                         6
         We have assumed that institutions are slow moving, and have thus taken the index of

government efficiency from Kaufman et al. (2003), averaged over the years 1996, 1998, and 2000

as the measure of institutional quality in a country for the period 1965-2002. One concern is that

this measure is not pre-determined and exogenous. There is some controversy about what

instruments are appropriate for institutions. Following Acemogulu et al. (2002), we use the log of a

country’s population density in 1500 (countries that had less of a native population were less likely

to have an exploitative colonial structure imposed on them and have better institutions today) as an

instrument for institutional quality in column (7). While we lose a number of countries, the

coefficient of the interaction is still positive, large, and statistically significant. 3

         The opposite concern would be that the measure of institutional quality is too static, that it

does not reflect changes that take place in a country over time. The problem is that detailed

measures of institutional quality going back to 1965 are simply not available. However, the index

we have constructed from ICRG data is one measure of institutional quality that does go back till

1985. 4 In column 8, we use the data from 1985, with the time-varying index as our measure of

institutional quality and find that the interaction variable is positive and significant as predicted.

         The bottom line is that the inflation tax is higher when countries experience poor growth

(as also in Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004)), and it is particularly high when those

countries have poor institutions. Poor societies with weak institutions do not share the burden of

distress well. 5

1.3. Contractual Adaptation




3
  Of course, while the instrument for institutional quality is exogenous and pre-determined, whether it
satisfies exclusion restrictions depends on what else we think might explain the institutions growth
interaction. Since we have put forward no such alternative explanation, we do not pursue this issue.
4
  We try and approximate the index created by Knack and Keefer (1995). The ICRG measures for quality of
bureaucracy, rule of law, corruption, and investment protection (including risk of expropriation, contract
repudiation, and repatriation of profits) are all normalized to be between 0 and 1. The index is the weighted
sum of these four measures, with the first three having a weight of 0.2, and the last having a weight of 0.4.
5
  This contrasts with the view in Tornell and Lane (1999) where developing countries do not share windfalls
well and overspend them.


                                                                                                            7
        If the country’s underlying basic and narrow institutions do not permit a contingent,

speedy, and predictable sharing of adverse economic circumstances, and the tendency of the

government is to spread the burden along the path of least resistance, economic agents will take

steps to protect themselves. But without a reliable and effective legal system, what can they do?

Clearly the answer has to be to use instruments that depend in a very limited way on the legal

system for enforcement.

        One approach is to use inflexible, non-contingent contracts, whose violation is easily

detected. For example, labor contracts in many developing countries effectively do not permit

employees to be fired. This is seen as inefficient because it does not allow firms to react quickly to

business conditions. Often, these prohibitions are ascribed to overly strong unions that hold the

economy to ransom. But if courts are slow and corrupt, so that a worker who is wrongfully fired

has no redress, perhaps the prohibition of firing—because violations are so easily and publicly

observable and can be responded to through mass protests—is the only way to protect workers

from arbitrary decisions by employers (also see Glaeser and Shleifer (2001)). Job tenure may also

act as a form of social security because the government does a miserable job providing a safety net,

and private insurance markets do not exist. Thus an inflexible contract can protect workers when

the preponderance of bargaining power is with firms.

        This is not to argue that such contractual arrangements should never be reformed – they

may outlive their initial usefulness if the legal system improves, but may continue to be supported

by vested interests. The arguments we have made may be trotted out as a defense long after they

are valid.

1.3.1. Demandable debt

        Another form of a rigid contract, but one with special features, is a bank demand deposit.

Essentially, a demand deposit has two features that make it virtually self-enforcing. First, the bank

is required to honor the claim when it is presented at the teller window. If it is slow in doing so, or

attempts in any way to renege, the news spreads quickly since the refusal to honor a demand


                                                                                                          8
deposit is such a clear and incontrovertible event. Second, the bank honors withdrawals in the order

they are presented until no more depositors want to withdraw or the bank fails. “Sequential

service” implies that when depositors sense even the slightest hint of potential distress, they have a

strong incentive to withdraw their money – if they do, at worst they have the trouble of re-

depositing if the bank later turns out to be safe, if they don’t, they may end up penniless as the bank

fails.

         The two features ensure that the ordinary depositor has a fairly secure claim, supported by

other depositors – the threat of a bank run plays the same role as the threat of a labor strike – if

bank management reneges on the commitment to repay the deposit contract it will face a depositor

run which will close it down. So except in the case where it absolutely cannot pay, bank

management will honor deposit contracts (see Calomiris and Kahn (1991), and Diamond and Rajan

(2001)). This may be one reason why banks are such an important component of the financial

sector in emerging markets.

         The broader point is that anticipating little power over outcomes in downturns, weaker

agents might demand contractual options that will protect them in those states. For labor, it is the

option to keep a job, for depositors, it is the option to get their money. For the economy as a whole,

however, the exercise of these options add to the difficulty of adjustment in downturns,

exacerbating the problems created by institutional weakness.

         In the rest of the paper, we will examine these problems further, specifically focusing on

how demandable debt raises the risks of financing industry in emerging markets. But before we

explore that, let us add two more ingredients.

1.3.2 Domestic Liability Dollarization

         Inflation is a greater systematic risk, in the financial sense, in emerging markets. When it

is likely to explode in downturns there, depositors will demand an extraordinarily high risk

premium for holding inflation risk. Issuers who want to minimize expected debt service -perhaps

because of short horizons, or because they are liquidity constrained- will opt to issue real


                                                                                                        9
instruments (see Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001) for a related explanation, and Ize and Levy

Yeyati (2003) and Jeanne (2002) on other theories why inflation risk could lead to dollarization).

        If there is high volatility in inflation (which usually accompanies a high inflation rate) in

addition to weak institutions, inflation indexed instruments may not be attractive to the public.

Uncertainty about the measurement of inflation, delays in producing an accurate estimate, and fears

that the measurement will be manipulated, can increase their risks. The natural alternative to

issuing inflation indexed bonds is to denominate them in a foreign currency. This way, suspicion

about the official actions in a downturn may lead quite naturally to domestic liability dollarization.

1.3.3 Evidence on Liability Dollarization

        What evidence do we have for this conjecture? Nicolo, Honohan, and Ize (2003) find that

in a cross-section of countries, the extent of dollarization (dollar deposits to total deposits) is

positively and significantly correlated with the log of inflation. However, when a proxy for

institutional quality is included, inflation no longer enters significantly. The evidence is consistent

with weak institutions driving inflation, which in turn leads to greater dollarization.

        Again, however, we want to test a more nuanced version. We also want to see if there is a

relationship between the sensitivity of inflation tax to growth (which we have seen, appears to

reflect the ability of a country to allocate the costs of economic adversity) and the level of

dollarization. We also want to see if the extent of dollarization is related to the volatility of

inflation, over and above its correlation with the level of inflation. In Table 3, we present summary

statistics and cross correlations. The extent of liability dollarization is measured by the ratio of

foreign currency deposits to total deposits (FCDTD) in a country’s banking system averaged over

the 1990s, using the Nicolo, Honohan, and Ize (2003) data. The sensitivity of inflation tax to

growth for a country (henceforth “SENSITIVITY”) is the coefficient estimate on GDP growth in a

regression of the inflation tax on GDP growth for that country for the period 1965-2002. The

standard deviation of inflation tax is measured for every period t by its standard deviation during




                                                                                                        10
the five years from t-4 to t; then for the cross-section we take the average of standard deviation

over 1965 to 2002.

        In Table 4, the dependent variable is liability dollarization in a country in the 1990s. In

column (1) we include the sensitivity of inflation to GDP growth and a constant as explanatory

variables. The coefficient estimate for the sensitivity is negative and significant. Since the

sensitivity is typically negative (lower growth, more inflation tax), countries with a higher

magnitude of the sensitivity have greater deposit dollarization as expected. In Figure 2, we plot the

extent of dollarization against SENSITIVITY. As the graph suggests, the relationship is likely to

be non-linear. So in column (2), we allow for a non-linear specification of sensitivity by including

the square of sensitivity. The coefficient of the squared term is positive and strongly significant.

Greater sensitivity again is correlated with greater dollarization. If sensitivity changes from 0 to its

lower 1 percentile threshold (-0.029), dollarization increases by 33 percent, which is 140 percent of

its standard deviation.

        We check that this relationship persists even when we include the “usual suspects”. In

column (3), we include the average inflation tax in the country, and in column (4) we add the

standard deviation of the inflation tax. While the coefficients for the non-linear specification for

sensitivity are positive and statistically significant in both columns, the coefficient for inflation tax

is positive and significant only when included alone, but becomes insignificant when the standard

deviation of inflation tax is included. The estimates for sensitivity are qualitatively similar if we

include squared terms for inflation tax and the standard deviation of inflation tax (estimates not

reported). Finally, in column (5), we include both the log of per capita GDP and the index of legal

restrictions on dollarization compiled by Nicolo, Honohan, and Ize (2003), which is available for

only 83 of the countries, and find qualitatively similar results.

        One should not read too much into these last few “kitchen sink” regressions since

sensitivity, inflation tax, and the standard deviation of the inflation tax measure various aspects of

the same thing. All we want to show the reader is that both sensitivity and the standard deviation of


                                                                                                        11
inflation tax seem to be correlated with the extent of dollarization as predicted by the earlier

discussion, and seem to capture something more than just the level of the inflation tax, which the

prior literature has identified.

         The evidence thus far is consistent with the following conclusions: Countries with weak

institutions have greater sensitivity of inflation to growth. In countries with higher sensitivity,

investors have a higher demand for real deposits. Because inflation is also very volatile, they may

prefer deposits denominated in foreign exchange rather than deposits that are indexed. 6

1.4. Aggregate Dollar Constraints/Sudden stops

         Let us now add the final ingredient to the “model”. Since emerging markets with the

weakest institutions for conflict management (and the most divided societies) have the hardest time

spreading the burdens of distress, they are also likely to have the most difficulty raising resources

to continue to service external debt. The tendency of some countries to default repeatedly

(Reinhart, Rogoff, Savastano (2003)) may reflect the weakness of their capacity to manage

economic adversity than any inherent lack of honesty on the part of their governments. But this

means that these countries are likely to face aggregate constraints on external borrowing sooner

than other countries. Since in periods of adversity creditors will reduce their expectations of what

the country will be able to repay, they will also reduce what they are willing to lend. Such a

“vertical” constraint on dollars the country can borrow (Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2000,2001))

or sudden stop (Calvo and Reinhart (2002)), will interact with liability dollarization to produce

unfortunate consequences we now document.

         II. Consequences: Overshooting, Liquidation, and Contagion

         Now that we have the ingredients, dollarized bank deposits and the possibility of aggregate

constraints on borrowing, let us sketch the consequences.


6
  There is a sense in which this argument runs counter to the “Original Sin” thesis (for example, see
Hausman, Eichengreen, and Panizza (2002)) because we attribute financial fragilities to weak institutions
rather than to other factors like country size. But Hausman et al. (2002) focus on the currency denomination
of public debt rather than on the currency denomination of bank debt.


                                                                                                          12
2.1. The Sources of Dollar Shortage

        In the normal course, dollar depositors will want to withdraw some of their deposits. The

reasons for this can range from normal liquidity needs (such as importing foreign goods) to good

dollar investment opportunities outside the country. Clearly, if their bank has fewer dollar reserves

than the amount of withdrawals, it will buy dollars on the market. Summing across banks, there

will be an aggregate demand for dollars, which will have to be met out of the country’s reserves,

dollar repatriation by exporters, and, if necessary, additional external borrowing. It does not really

matter which domestic entity (government or banks) does the external borrowing since the

aggregate available pool of dollar resources will determine whether the aggregate domestic demand

can be satisfied.

        Problems arise when the aggregate demand exceeds the aggregate supply (not including

external borrowing) and the country has difficulty borrowing the shortfall. One such situation is

one where the economy is booming but the (fixed) exchange rate is overvalued. Exporters may not

earn enough and, far from bringing foreign exchange into the country to repay loans, they may seek

to draw down their deposits to continue operations. Importers may have a huge demand for dollars

because foreign goods appear cheap. When added to the normal liquidity needs of depositors, the

demand may be so high that it even exceeds the willingness of foreign investors to lend the

shortfall. Another situation arises when the excess demand is relatively small but the economy is in

a bad way, or the government has over-borrowed, so foreign investors are unwilling even to lend

meager amounts of extra dollars needed. In fact, the government can contribute to the private sector

dollar shortage by adding its own external financing needs.

        Regardless of how the dollar shortage emerges (and we will shortly see some examples),

the dollarized banking system can exacerbate it (see Diamond and Rajan (2005) for a detailed

model). Since the banks have issued a non-renegotiable promise to pay dollars, they either have to

convince their own depositors not to withdraw, by hiking the interest rates paid on dollar deposits,

or they have to attract dollars away from other banks in the spot market. Higher rates may quell


                                                                                                    13
some depositor demand; but a core liquidity demand that cannot be deterred with higher rates will

remain. If this still exceeds the available dollars, the banks will compete with each other for scarce

dollars. Given that a bank fails if it does not come up with the needed dollars, it will be willing to

pay what it takes for additional dollars. With an overall shortage in place, however, banks can

competitively drive each other into failure.

        Short banks will sell non-dollar spot assets and long term assets for dollars. Thus the

exchange rate (dollars per domestic currency) will tend to fall and interest rates (both for long term

dollar assets and for long term domestic currency assets) will rise. In principle, because the

quantity of dollar demand and supply cannot adjust readily, these prices can move very far from

any notion of fundamental value. Both the exchange rate and the interest rate can overshoot during

the scramble for dollar liquidity.

        Real decisions will be affected during this scramble, with lasting consequences. Let us go

systematically through them.

2.2. Real Consequences

        The first place banks will look for additional dollars is amongst those who generate them

and those who use them. Exporters will be squeezed, in an attempt to get them to speed up their

own dollar receipts and hasten repayment of dollar borrowings to banks (on average, across

emerging markets approximately 30 percent of domestic loans made by banks are denominated in

foreign currency (see IMF (2004)). To raise these amounts quickly, exporters will sell finished

goods inventories at steep discounts, and reduce near-term sales prices. They will shelve exports

that are highly import intensive, and abandon long-term projects, especially those that require

capital goods imports.

        Clearly, all these actions will impair the economy’s medium run ability to export and thus

its ability to generate dollars in the future. The weaker a country’s institutions, the greater will be

the discount banks place on a future dollar generated by an exporter relative to a current dollar




                                                                                                      14
(foreign investors will be willing to lend less against the future), and the greater the long-run

destructive consequences of a scramble for dollars.

         We will see these effects not only in the tradable sector, but also in the non-tradable sector.

As domestic interest rates rise (because long run domestic assets are being sold for dollars), more

and more domestic projects will be shelved as they have to meet an impossible hurdle rate.

         As bank assets fall in value, some banks, typically the ones with the greatest asset liability

currency mismatch (though see later), will become insolvent. This will trigger a generalized run on

the banks’ assets, causing even those who had no desire to withdraw to add to dollar demand. 7 The

horizon of failing banks will be even shorter, causing them to be even more indiscriminate in the

squeeze they put on borrowers. Even projects that could produce substantial dollar revenues in the

near term may be sacrificed for the immediate need – for example, banks may stop offering

working capital loans and export credit even if these are essential for the exporter to generate

revenues. As a result, the aggregate pool of dollars available over the near term could fall as banks

fail, and the aggregate excess demand for dollars could increase, putting pressure on other banks. 8

This form of contagion could imperil the entire banking system.

         To summarize, when bank depositors demand repayment in dollars but the economy

cannot generate enough dollars to satisfy them, the consequences can be very serious. Domestic

dollar interest rates will rise to draw in dollars and choke off depositor demands. If, however, there

is a core group of depositors who absolutely want to withdraw dollars, and a limit to which

outsiders are willing to lend to the country, the country’s banking system can face an excess

demand for dollars that it cannot meet. If so, other asset prices will fall precipitously as banks

scramble to capture enough dollars from the common pool to save themselves. Domestic currency

7
  Note that if the exchange rate is fixed but there are no capital controls, domestic currency depositors have
an even greater incentive to withdraw (and convert) than dollar depositors because they will fear a
devaluation.
8
  Clearly a bank that fails will refuse to honor some of its dollar depositors. The unsatisfied demand of these
depositors will reduce aggregate demand. Therefore the effect of bank failure on the excess demand for
dollars depends on whether supply falls faster or slower than demand. See Diamond and Rajan (2005) for
conditions under which each is true.


                                                                                                             15
interest rates will spike up, while the exchange rate will plummet. Banks will squeeze borrowers,

and aggregate activity will fall. Some banks may become insolvent and such failures could be

contagious.

        Of course, in any such model, we could get multiple equilibria, where outside lenders

impose a sudden stop, which leads to the dollar shortage, which leads to bank actions that reduce

future dollar receipts, which justify the stop. We do not need, however, to appeal to multiple

equilibria to explain the crisis – a spike upwards in dollar demand, or downwards in dollar supply,

coupled with a “normal” demand for liquidity are sufficient to produce the effects.

        Consider now how this “model” differs from earlier work. In a comprehensive survey,

Frankel and Wei (2004) attempt to distinguish between the three “generations” of crisis models on

the basis on their explanation of why the crisis occurs:

        “ Whose fault is the crisis? Generation I says domestic macroeconomic policy,
        Generation II says volatile financial markets, and Generation III says financial structure.
        In neutral language, the explanations are, respectively, excessive macroeconomic
        expansion, “multiple equilibria,” and moral hazard. In finger-pointing language, the
        respective culprits are undisciplined domestic policymakers, crazy international investors,
        and crony capitalists.”


The “model” in this paper is related to the third generation models in that it focuses on structural

problems associated with lending to emerging markets. However, in our paper crises are not

necessarily caused by willful misbehavior. Instead, they stem from adverse liquidity shocks that

jolt a system that is necessarily rigid, given the institutional inadequacies of the economy. Put

another way, better regulation and supervision may not necessarily eliminate the possibility of a

crisis. What is really needed is deep-rooted institutional reform: susceptibility to crises in our

framework ultimately rests not in an incentive problem but a collective action problem.

        A closely related paper is Calvo, Izquierdo, and Mejia (2004), who also focus on a link

between sudden stops, dollarization, and banking crises. In their paper, sudden stops lead to a

devaluation, -in order to maintain external balance- which then causes problems in the dollarized

banking system through liability mismatches. In other words, macro-causes have micro-


                                                                                                       16
consequences. In our model, the channel is not the need to maintain external balance but bank

liquidity. The sudden stop creates a dollar shortage, which leads banks to dump assets, causing the

exchange rate (and interest rates) to overshoot fundamentals, which then create balance sheet

problems for the banking system. Micro-causes aggregate up to have macro-consequences.

           While we think both explanations have merit, there are differences. For instance, to the

extent that a devaluation gives exporters the ability to earn more (expansionary devaluation), there

is no reason for it to hurt the solvency of a dollarized banking system – since banks typically make

dollar loans to the exporters (see Nicola et al. (2003)). But to the extent that the capacity to earn

future dollars does not translate into current dollars, a liquidity mismatch could persist, and banks

could still go under in our framework.

2.2. Some Examples

Consider some examples.

Argentina (2001) 9

           By the end of 2000, the Argentinean banking system had approximately $72 billion in

foreign currency denominated assets and about the same amount in liabilities. By most standards, it

seemed to have matched exposures. However, $25 billion of its assets were government securities,

issued by a government that was increasingly strapped for financing. Another $41 billion were

foreign currency denominated loans and securities issued by Argentinean corporations, which

clearly did not have the ability to repay quickly as exports amounted to only $ 31 billion. Of the

liabilities, $ 48.5 billion were foreign currency deposits.

           In this fragile situation depositor runs could start for two related reasons. First, if the

government could not draw in more external resources to meet its own external debt service needs,

or its new borrowing requirements, the anticipated available dollar pool would be severely

constrained. The banking system’s liquidity needs would compete with the government’s needs,



9
    This section relies heavily on IMF (2004)


                                                                                                         17
pushing up interest rates and leading, perhaps, to a devaluation. 10 Second, given the extensive bank

holdings of government assets, a government default could render banks insolvent (though see

below).

          Depositor runs started in 2001. Bank liabilities fell by $24 billion (approximately 9 percent

of GDP). In fact, Argentina lost more as a result of the bank run than as a result of the inability of

the government to access external markets to meet financing needs. Interestingly, the fall in

domestic currency denominated deposits was far greater than the fall in foreign currency deposits,

suggesting that depositors feared a devaluation, perhaps from the liquidity shortage, more than a

bank default. Since bank holdings of government debt could not be reduced, -in fact, they

increased-, the run was financed by curtailing private lending ($ 12 billion), running down bank

liquid assets ($ 5 billion), and borrowing from the central bank ($ 9 billion).

          Ultimately, the entire banking system was affected, deposits were frozen, then loans and

deposits were “pesified” at different rates. The consequences are still being dealt with. The point to

take away is that a government may affect the dollarized domestic banking system simply by

crowding out access to dollars .

Uruguay (2002)

          Uruguay experienced an almost reverse sequence of events: liquidity problems in the

banking sector triggered a crisis, a devaluation, and problems for the government, which then, had

to restructure debt. Let us examine how this happened.

          Uruguay also had a highly dollarized banking system. Bank deposits were about 90 percent

of GDP by the end of 2001; 90 percent of these deposits were denominated in US dollars. About

half these deposits were held by non-residents, mostly Argentineans.

          As the Argentineans saw their deposits in Argentina frozen, they started withdrawing from

Uruguayan banks. Their liquidity need could have been met by Uruguay’s domestic holdings of

10
  Though not necessarily a default by dollar borrowers. For instance, Bleakley and Cowan (2002) find that
the negative balance sheet effects of devaluation are outweighed by the competitiveness gains for a sample of
Latin American firms.


                                                                                                          18
liquid foreign currency assets. However, anticipating a shortage, Uruguayan residents also began

withdrawing deposits. With over 45 percent of the foreign currency deposits withdrawn, the

currency depreciated precipitously, prompting further concerns about bank solvency. The

government declared a bank holiday to stop the run; eventually, it reopened successfully the

banking system with the help of a Stand-By Arrangement from the IMF and a rescheduling of

deposits.

        As a result of the depreciation, public debt, which was largely denominated in foreign

currency, ballooned from about 45 percent of GDP, by the end of 2001, to 100 percent of GDP, by

the end of 2002. Eventually, it had to be restructured. In this case, liquidity problems in the banking

sector created problems for the government in servicing its public debt.

South Korea (1997-98)

        It is generally accepted that the trigger for the Korean financial crisis was a decline in

export growth, especially in key areas like semi-conductors. The weakening demand in importing

partners and the appreciation of the real exchange rate, as the dollar -to which many Asian

currencies were implicitly pegged- strengthened against the yen, were behind the pressure on the

real external sector. In the case of Korea, such initial pressure, emanating in the real external

sector, was compounded by a banking system that had issued a significant amount of short term

external debt and thus was vulnerable to a liquidity shock. Contrast this with the liquidity shock

that resulted from the government’s losing access to external borrowing, in the case of Argentina,

or the liquidity shock set in motion by Argentineans withdrawing their deposits abroad, in the case

of Uruguay.

        We will not describe the details of the crisis, which resembled in many ways what we have

described above (see IMF (2002, 210) and IMF (1999, 188) for details). Korean banks initially

started facing difficulties in mid 1997. The government announced a guarantee of foreign

borrowings by Korean banks and the central bank attempted to help foreign branches and

subsidiaries of Korean banks roll over their foreign currency borrowings. But this depleted


                                                                                                     19
reserves, leaving the central bank with little to fight domestic bank runs. The government simply

did not have the necessary dollars to back the guarantee it had announced. The won fell sharply.

        In early December, the IMF announced a Stand-By Arrangement with Korea equivalent to

$ 21 billion, with additional financing from others of $ 37 billion. Yet this massive package was

insufficient, and the won continued falling. It was only when foreign private banks agreed to

maintain their exposure to Korean banks by exchanging their inter-bank loans for short term

government guaranteed bonds, and when the IMF accelerated disbursement of the loan, that

pressure on the won abated. In terms of our framework, the shortage was eliminated by reducing

dollar demand and increasing dollar supply and thus alleviating pressure on both the exchange rate

and the interest rate.

        Interestingly, in the case of Korea, a liquidity crisis was averted because the government

had spare borrowing capacity and could draw in dollars (with some help from the IFIs and

developed country governments), which it then lent out to the banks. With a few examples behind

us, we can now discuss policy interventions in general terms.

                                            III. Interventions

        Let us recapitulate what happens if no intervention takes place. Obviously, the only way to

eliminate a dollar shortage is to increase supply or reduce demand for dollars. If dollar depositors

who seek to withdraw are not tempted to stay in the bank by higher dollar interest rates (for the

same reason, perhaps, that higher interest rates do not draw fresh foreign investors in), then banks

will start competing for scarce dollars. Since a bank has to satisfy every one of its withdrawing

dollar depositors in order to stay in business, it will be willing to pay any feasible price for dollars

if it is falling short. This is why prices of non-dollar assets can deviate so far from fundamentals –

the bank essentially faces a classic short squeeze where it has to deliver a specific asset in short

supply, so it is willing to sell all other assets, almost regardless of price.

        The dollar shortage is a form of liquidity shortage for the banking system. However, it can

affect the solvency of firms, banks, and even the government, so it is extremely difficult to tell it


                                                                                                        20
apart from a solvency problem. There are many ways solvency and liquidity can interact. Consider

two. First, the dollar shortage may stem from an insolvent government, not being able to roll over

dollar liabilities (a sudden stop). Too few dollars relative to demand can cause banks to dump

domestic assets, pushing up interest rates and depressing the exchange rate, rendering, thus, firms

with dollar liabilities insolvent. Second, some banks may be insolvent because of bad loans. A run

on them may cause a squeeze on credit to exporters, a shortage of dollars, and contagion in the

banking system, rendering the government insolvent through its contingent liabilities to the

banking system. And so on...

        Put another way, the practical challenge in the midst of a crisis is to make a judgment call

on whether the crisis is one of illiquidity. If the judgment is in the affirmative, the proper

intervention is to lend freely to the healthiest banks the commodity that is in short supply, in this

case dollars (or alternatively, convince dollar demanders to hold off pressing their claims). For, if

the crisis is truly one of illiquidity, prevailing market rates will fall, and weaker institutions will

regain market access rapidly. If the crisis is one of insolvency, market rates will stay high, and the

banking system will continue to be fragile. Thus, except when failures are isolated or when asset

values collapse for other reasons than high interest rates or low exchange rates, it is typically only

after intervening in a crisis and seeing the consequences that one can tell whether the crisis was one

of illiquidity or insolvency.

        Given the difficulty of telling illiquidity from insolvency, and given the cost of a banking

system meltdown, if the government has dollar reserves, spare external borrowing capacity, or

support from international financial institutions, it would sell dollars into the banking system

hoping to alleviate pressure. However, we have defined a dollar shortage as one where the

government itself has too few resources to contribute. So let us turn to other interventions.

3.1. Ex Post Intervention by Country Authorities

3.1.1. Recapitalization




                                                                                                          21
        The authorities can recapitalize specific banks by offering them additional domestic assets

or guarantees (backed by domestic assets). Often, what is termed “liquidity support” are simply

loans by the central bank to distressed banks without adequate collateral backing the loans – in

short, they are partial recapitalizations.

        While targeted recapitalizations can prevent specific banks from failing, they leave, on the

aggregate, a dollar gap that has to be closed somehow. Unless other banks are allowed to fail, the

aggregate dollar demand cannot be satisfied. This implies that a bank recapitalization without any

attempt to bridge the dollar gap only forces other, potentially healthier, banks to fail. A blanket

recapitalization or guarantee of all banks simply allows all banks to bid more for dollars (that is, it

increases the interest or exchange overshooting) without reducing the eventual extent of bank

failures. This is why it is best to close down some banks and thus resolve the dollar shortage before

offering indiscriminate guarantees.

3.1.2. Monetary Policy

           The monetary authorities could be accommodative and buy long-term domestic assets in

exchange for domestic reserves (or do the opposite). Monetary accommodation will reduce the

extent to which the burden of adjustment falls on the interest rate, and increase the downward

pressure on the exchange rate. If not reversed later, it will increase inflationary pressures.

        However, the proximate effect will be to shift the burden amongst banks – the survival

chances of banks with relatively more holdings of long-term domestic assets will improve, while

the chances of those with more net dollar liabilities will weaken. Whether the new pattern of failure

reduces the overall dollar shortage depends on whether the newly failing banks subtract more

dollar liquidity in failing than the banks that would fail absent the intervention.

           An exchange rate defense (keeping the exchange rate high by tightening monetary

policy), or an interest rate defense (keeping the interest rate low by being accommodative), are

different in this simple framework only in that they select different sets of banks for failure. The

choice between them rests on which one allows the banking system to come through the dollar


                                                                                                       22
shortage creating the minimum long-term damage to the real economy – through the damage the

failing banks and their clients sustain. We are, of course, abstracting from any issues of credibility

here, though it would be hard to unambiguously relate monetary authority credibility gains to a

particular form of defense.

        Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2004) also examine monetary policy in a situation of a

dollar shortage. However, while our focus is on the effects of monetary policy on the extent of

failure and economic damage (an ex-post analysis), their focus is on the ex-ante effects on the

incentive to hold dollars. An accommodative monetary policy is unambiguously preferred in their

analysis because it increases agent incentives to hold dollars before the crisis. Since the main

friction in their model is that the price of dollars is too low ex post (agents who need them do not

have the collateral to buy them), any policy that enhances the price of dollars during the crisis

enhances ex ante incentives.

        If, however, such a policy did considerable damage to the banking system (because, for

example, moderately illiquid banks had many dollar liabilities), an effect they abstract from, our

analysis suggests the policy would be dominated. In fact, such a pre-announced policy might have

limited credibility ex ante and thus limited incentive effects. On the other hand, unlike their paper,

we assume no frictions in trading dollars ex post so we abstract from the effects they focus on. The

two papers should therefore be seen as complementary.

        Before proceeding to other interventions, we should note that the monetary authority also

has the ability to select banks that will fail by allocating its limited foreign exchange reserves only

to some banks (i.e., at a subsidized price) and not to others. While such an intervention is fraught

with political difficulties (who will be chosen and will the process be transparent), ultimately, it is

an optimization problem where regulators allocate scarce resources to minimize the overall cost of

bank failures. Thus it is similar in consequence to the interventions just discussed.

3.1.3. Forced conversion/suspension of convertibility/capital controls.




                                                                                                       23
        Finally, consider even stronger interventions that violate the rights of the depositors. These

include forced conversion into domestic currency at a pre-determined (typically below market)

rate, the freezing of foreign currency deposits, and the imposition of capital controls. Clearly, such

interventions can be implemented only by the country authorities and not by the banks alone.

        While these interventions do solve, to differing extents, the problem of dollar shortage,

they do so at the expense of a substantial loss in future credibility. Moreover, it is not clear that

they can be implemented effectively and for the long term. For instance, capital controls tend to

leak, and the longer they are in place, the more they leak. Therefore, the authorities had better be

confident that the liquidity shortage is temporary, else the breathing space these measures give

them will insufficient to rectify the problem; the problem will return with a vengeance with the

added difficulty that the authorities then have no credibility.

3.2. Ex ante intervention by country authorities.

        Thus far we have discussed measures that could be taken in the midst of a crisis. Consider

now measures that could be taken upfront by the economy.

3.2.1. Reserves

        One way to bullet-proof an economy against dollar shortages is for the authorities to build

foreign reserves. Of course, there are costs to holding reserves and to building them, including the

fiscal costs and possible distortions in the exchange rate. Furthermore, it is possible that the level of

dollarization in the economy increases as reserves, and confidence, grow. As a result, the

authorities may lose all control over monetary policy and the transmission mechanism. Building a

moderate amount of reserves is clearly warranted, but the welfare effects of building a hoard large

enough to buffer against most crises are ambiguous.

        A second question that arises with reserves is whether the country should use them to

prepay debt. In other words, is spare debt capacity not the same as holding reserves, and less costly

to boot? For the riskiest countries though, prepaying debt may be dominated by holding reserves:

spare debt capacity is less fungible than reserves, and may also disappear in a crisis. Also, by


                                                                                                        24
prepaying debt, the country loses the option to force a restructuring, which may be valuable in

times of stress.

3.2.2. De-dollarization and shifting dollarization

        Given the risks associated with dollar shortages, some countries, including Mexico and

Bolivia in 1982 and Peru in 1985, have opted to ban dollarization. But if the proximate cause,

monetary instability, is not eliminated, investors will demand significantly higher interest rates to

hold domestic currency deposits, and some may simply take the money out of the country.

Consistent with this, countries that today have significant restrictions on dollarization, such as

Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela, have particularly high loan spreads (see IADB (2004)).

        Also, domestic currency depositors are not passive. With less-than-effective monetary

authorities, banks could be subject to stress even if they only issue domestic deposits. For instance,

suppose the authorities maintain an overvalued but fixed exchange rate. Fearing an eventual return

to equilibrium, depositors have an incentive to withdraw and convert into foreign currency. This

puts enormous stress on the banking system, forcing it to pay high interest rates to keep depositors

in, with the level of interest rates being determined by the degree of overvaluation rather than more

typical determinants like the return on investment and expected inflation. As described earlier,

domestic currency depositors were prominent in the Argentinean bank runs in 2001.

        The point is that dollarization is not necessarily an aberration in the environment which

gives birth to it. Instead, it may be a reasonable adaptation. As Savastano (1996) and Balino et al.

(1999) document, the consequence of banning dollarization in Mexico, Bolivia, and Peru was

typically a severe contraction of intermediation which was reversed in Bolivia and Peru only when

dollar deposits were allowed again. Similarly, Nicolo, Honohan, and Ize (2003) show that

economies with high inflation tend to have more monetary depth with dollarization than without.

        Rather than banning liability dollarization altogether, authorities may want to focus on

removing the distortions that lead it to its excessive practice, such as the dollar-liability issuers not




                                                                                                       25
internalizing all the risks. More useful, of course, is to focus on changing the underlying conditions

that lead to dollarization, in the first place, a point we will touch on shortly.

        Before concluding this section, note two points. First, the transition from an economy with

liability dollarization to one where dollarization is banned implies either violating existing dollar

contracts and prohibiting new ones, or shifting dollar liabilities to another domestic entity. The

Brazilian government essentially took the latter route by taking on the dollar liabilities of its

banking system – through the issuance of dollar denominated bonds to banks in 1998. As a result,

even though the real depreciated substantially in 1998-99, the banks were relatively immunized. Of

course, government debt ballooned as a result.

        From a theoretical perspective, the government could improve welfare by taking on the

dollar liabilities of the banking sector. When individual banks fail during a dollar shortage, we have

seen they can worsen the aggregate shortage. When the government takes over the liabilities of the

banking sector, these individual failures are eliminated, so the dollar shortage need not be as

severe. Against this, one should weigh the increased moral hazard if the government is expected to

step in every time banks anticipate trouble.

        Second, as argued above, with a fixed exchange rate and full convertibility, even domestic

currency denominated liabilities may become a source of vulnerability. This suggests that the

choice of exchange regime is not without consequence (also see, for example, Burnside,

Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2001b) or Edwards (2004)). But unfortunately, the very institutional

requirements needed to maintain a monetary anchor with a floating exchange rate regime may be

missing in countries where fixed exchange regimes create vulnerabilities. Therefore, there are

trade-offs involved in the choice of exchange regime, and as suggested by Calvo and Mishkin

(2003), it may be more useful to focus on changing the underlying institutions rather than on

choosing a specific regime.

3.2.4. Institutional reform




                                                                                                        26
        The root cause of deposit dollarization, we have argued, is weak basic institutions for

conflict management. The more proximate causes are inadequate fiscal and monetary institutions.

Of course, it is easier, -though not easy-, to reform the narrow institutions rather than the basic

ones. But without reforming the deeper basic institutions, which typically requires deep-rooted

political change, how successful can reform of narrow institutions be? We do not know much about

the process of institutional reform; countries like Chile, Mexico, and South Korea that have

improved their basic institutions over a relatively short time, aided by good policies and rapid

economic growth, offer a only a few successful examples. Understanding what ingredients in this

mix are essential, and what simply are coincidental, is a topic of ongoing research on which,

hopefully, researchers will have more to say in the near future. For now, let us turn to the role the

international financial institutions can play.

3.3. What can IFIs do?

        Clearly, the international financial institutions (IFIs) can provide the technical support that

will help countries adopt good policies and improve their narrow institutions (such as their fiscal

framework or their inflation targeting framework). They can also provide the bilateral and

multilateral economic surveillance that can alert countries to possible sources of shocks. The

International Monetary Fund does all this. The million dollar question, of course, is whether IFIs

should lend in such situations.

3.3.1. “Liquidity” Loans

        A dollar shortage seems precisely the kind of temporary need that certain IFIs like the

International Monetary Fund were set up to meet. By creating a common reserve pool of dollars,

the IFIs can substitute for costly reserve hoarding by countries.

        The most persuasive case for lending is when the IFI alleviates what is essentially a

market-driven short squeeze on the country. It tides the country over its temporary exchange

shortage, preventing more destructive domestic sector real adjustment, and gets repaid once the

reasons for the temporary need vanish (e.g., exports recover).


                                                                                                      27
        The difficulty, of course, even with this simple scenario is that the ultimate cause for a

dollar shortage has to be that the country loses access to international markets. Thus the IFI has to

make the judgment call of whether the loss of access is due to irrational/ rational uncoordinated

behavior by market participants, or whether it stems from genuine fears. If the former is the case,

most would agree that the IFI should act as a lender of last resort. The only remaining concern

would be whether this role creates bad incentives for market participants, for the government, and

for banks – the issue of moral hazard, to which we will come in a moment-.

        If however the adverse shock precipitating the dollar shortage reflects a genuine

institutional infirmity in the country – for instance that the government has no fiscal discipline, it

has reached borrowing limits, and thus it is shut off from international capital markets – matters

become more difficult. It may well be that the country could undertake reforms that would help it

regain access. In this case the country is illiquid but solvent contingent on undertaking reforms.

Solvency, however, will not be restored until the markets gain confidence that the reforms are

irreversible. This implies that the lending may well not be temporary.

        If the alternative is a banking system crisis coupled with a burden to restructure public

debt, both of which will set back the country’s economy considerably, it may well make sense to

lend even when reforms are highly probable but not fully assured. The IFI bears some risk here that

it will not be repaid, but it does so in the larger interest of the member country facing distress (and

it should impose conditionality as well as charge an adequate premium for the risk).

        The problem critics have is with the assumption that the IFI has a better ability to gauge

willingness to reform than market participants. Two arguments have been put forward to justify

this. First, the IFI may have better information about the country. This may have been true in the

past, but given the development of financial markets, we see little reason to believe it to be true

today. Second, the IFI may have a better sense of its own ability (and willingness) to coax the

reform process forward, and may in fact have to show some success (or put its money at stake)

before the market is persuaded. The IFI may also be able to put in place incentives for the country


                                                                                                         28
to reform. We find the second argument more persuasive but one should not rule out the possibility

that the IFI has an incentive to find a role for itself where none exists (see below).

        A final situation where IFI lending may be warranted is when the country’s public debt is

too high given its underlying fundamentals, so it cannot borrow, but, as a result, it also faces an

immediate dollar shortage that threatens its banking system. Rather than stand back and watch the

banking system implode, the IFI may want to offer a bridge loan targeted at the banking system, to

be repaid when the country regains market access after restructuring its external public debt. Again,

this is a form of liquidity lending but one compounded by the problem that the excessive public

debt will prolong the eventual resolution.

        All this, however, raises two questions. First, does IFI intervention distort incentives

among participants? Second, are there better ways to provide assurance of liquidity support to

member countries?

3.3.2. Incentive Distortion and Tough Love

        At least three types of incentive distortions are possible: (i) An unwillingness on the part of

countries to take adequate precautions or to avoid excessively risky situations (ii) an unwillingness

on the part of investors to take all risks into account, knowing they will be “bailed out” (iii) an

unwillingness on the part of domestic corporations and banks to insure themselves adequately.

        Reams and reams have been written on the issue of moral hazard and we have little to add.

Some argue that country moral hazard is not an issue because finance ministers and central bank

governors lose their jobs in a financial crisis. Others argue that investor moral hazard is not a

problem because investors lose their shirts in a crisis. These arguments are reasonable but miss the

point. No finance minister will take an action that he thinks will create a crisis for sure. At the

margin, however, concerned about budget deficits, he may prefer to borrow cheaply in dollars than

borrow more expensively and for a longer term in domestic currency. He will be more likely to do

so if he knows the IFI will help if things go wrong. At the margin, interventions do distort

incentives to take risk.


                                                                                                      29
          The question is how much. Unfortunately, the empirical evidence does not offer a

reasonable assessment of magnitudes (see Jeanne and Zettelmeyer (2004) for an excellent

exposition of the issues). Our reading of the current consensus is that country and investor moral

hazard is small in most situations; in a few cases, though, it could be really big. We need more

research identifying the circumstances where moral hazard is really a problem.

          What seems clearer is that domestic corporations and banks may have too little incentive to

prepare themselves for possible shocks, knowing that there are ways they can force the system to

share it with them. This, however, is a case for better domestic regulation and supervision rather

than limiting IFI intervention.

          In sum, then, the moral hazard rationale against IFI intervention may well exist in some

cases but we need to be able to identify those cases better. If these cases are indeed few in number,

as a reasonable judgment would suggest, then it may well make sense to accept the risks of

inducing moral hazard through intervention while trying harder to identify when it is a mistake.

          If, however, the reasons for dollarization lie primarily in poor institutions rather than in

gaming - a collective action problem rather than an incentive problem - the greater concern should

not be about distorting individual incentives but about altering collective actions. Sometimes

external discipline forces a country to reform in ways, and at a speed, that the domestic

constellation of political forces will simply not allow, if left to its own devices. Put another way,

bailouts may help governments shift the burden of a crisis off the shoulders of the domestic

business elite on to domestic taxpayers (see Jeanne and Zettelmeyer (2001)). To the extent that the

latter do not have an adequate voice, they bear the brunt of excessive intervention, and everyone

else who has a voice is willing to go along. The knowledge that bailouts may be hard to come by -a

policy of “tough love”- could pressure domestic forces to compromise and effect much needed

reform.

          We simply do not understand the political economy of deep institutional reform, or of

crisis, well enough to offer a categorical answer on whether external financial support is a good


                                                                                                         30
thing or a bad thing on net. Clearly, if there was an assurance that the pain would be short and

borne by those best able to absorb it, that the country would undertake genuine reforms, and that

the future would be much brighter, “tough love” is certainly an argument worth considering. But

what if the pain is prolonged, the economy degenerates into warring factions, and much of the pain

is borne by weaker sections of society? Again, further research is needed here. What seems

unquestionable is that if this route is chosen, there is a need to apply steady external pressure long

before a crisis, even conditioning the extent of crisis assistance on past willingness to reform or

maintain good policies.

3.3.3. A better way to intervene?

        IFIs like the IMF typically agree to lend large amounts only when the member country is

experiencing conditions of distress. Since intervention, let alone adequate assistance, is not

assured, and the political considerations of large shareholders as well as the economic situation of

the member country can affect these decisions, countries face uncertainty – which reduces the

effectiveness of intervention in warding off the crisis. Moreover, countries fear that they will be

forced to accept unwarranted conditionality even if assistance is forthcoming, because they really

have no alternatives in a moment of crisis. These are understandable concerns: countries with a

strong policy regime seem to want insurance, not uncertain loans laden with further uncertainty

about conditions.

        There is a second problem with leaving assistance to the complete discretion of the IFI. As

we have argued, it is hard to tell, even in the midst of a crisis, whether the underlying factors are

temporary or more structural, i.e., liquidity or solvency. The facts that emerge are unlikely to help

decision-making. In such a case, discretion can be harmful as it exposes the IFI to internal and

external political pressures to intervene. Not only will the decision be biased as a result of

discretion, it will also be noisy as it will not be based on underlying fundamentals.

        One way to change this is through rules. For instance, access to IFI lending could be tied to

a country’s policies and reforms in normal times, as suggested by Jeanne and Zettelmeyer (2001).


                                                                                                        31
If a country follows sound policies and undertakes needed reforms there should be a presumption

that if and when it faces a crisis, it is likely to be a liquidity crisis, or a solvency problem (such as a

permanent terms of trade shock) that is not of its own making. The IFI should intervene in the

former, and will be providing insurance in the latter case (with the country then making needed

adjustments on its own accord), not an entirely bad use of IFI resources.

        These access limits could be set in the regular annual consultations between the IFI and a

member country, where they would be based on an in-depth analysis of the country’s policies. To

the extent that a country’s policy environment changes significantly, interim assessments could

also be undertaken. The assessments will be a clear signal to the market about the IFI’s view of a

country’s policies, putting steady pressure outside normal IFI programs on the country to stay the

course of reforms (a “non-borrowing” program), and putting more pressure on IFI staff to do a

good analysis because inadequate assessments will be contested.

        Two immediate concerns arise. First, if the IFI is to intervene successfully in a liquidity

crisis, it usually makes sense to pump in enough funds to stop the panic. Smaller amounts may not

do the job and access limits, if set too low, may inhibit successful intervention. While no one may

be able to determine whether a crisis is one of liquidity or solvency, IFI staff can certainly judge

how much is needed from the facts of the crisis. So would not the rules on access be overly

constraining?

        The answer, of course, is yes, but that is the point. To the extent that the access limit is

deemed insufficient for the crisis at hand, the IFI will have to convince bilateral or private parties

to join, which will limit excessive intervention. Otherwise, it will have to stay out. Thus the access

limit will effectively translate into a probability of intervention.

        An alternative, though, is to link the probability of intervention but not the quantum of

assistance, to the country’s policies and reforms in normal times. For instance, for countries in

good standing, a decision to help might need approval by only a minority of the Board, while for

countries in poor standing, it might need approval by a supermajority. A politically independent


                                                                                                        32
minority of the members could then block loans to countries that have not shown much ownership

of reform policies in the past.

        This then leads us to the second concern. Ex ante conditionality, which is effectively what

rules amount to, is more intrusive than anything the IFIs currently do – even members not under

programs will be subject to greater scrutiny. Members will be rightly concerned about the kind of

polices the IFI’s staff will encourage and the possibility of political interference in setting access

limits (or voting requirements). This implies that reforms to the governance of the IFIs, ensuring

that they are seen as legitimate by all the members, will be critical to any such change in lending

policies.

                                               Conclusion

        We examine liquidity or dollar shortages in dollarized economies in this paper and explore

how they precipitate and exacerbate crisis. Unfortunately, the obvious solution – ban liability

dollarization – may not be appropriate. Liability dollarization is a response to institutional

infirmities. It will not diminish unless those infirmities are fixed. In the meantime, we have to, as

Guillermo Calvo suggested, learn to “live with dollarization”.

            In particular, this means stepped up regulation and supervision up front to ensure that

dollarization does not become excessive. It also implies the government has the responsibility to

maintain a reasonable fiscal position so it does not crowd out liquidity, and to maintain adequate

reserves. It means developing tools for crisis resolution that recognize the nature of the problem; a

banking crisis driven by a dollar shortage has to be dealt with in a different way from a banking

crisis driven by bad loans. IFIs can play a role in all this, but the precise way to circumscribe that

role has to be worked out.

        Finally, we have to pay more attention to deep-rooted institutional reform. Giving central

banks more independence and adopting inflation targeting frameworks are good steps, but if not




                                                                                                         33
accompanied by serious fiscal reform are unlikely to persuade the public to forego dollarization. 11

It may not be surprising that the level of dollarization has increased over the 1990s despite a fall in

inflation, perhaps because monetary reforms still lack credibility. Fiscal reform itself may be

difficult unless political reform creates better basic institutions for allocating burden sharing in the

economy. This suggests much work needs to be done.




11
  We agree in many ways with the analysis in Goldstein and Turner (2003), who also focus on institutional
reform as a way of dealing with dollarization. However, we think it will be more difficult than they seem to
suggest.

Notes: Inflation tax is π/(1+π), with π the annual CPI inflation.
The standard deviation of inflation and the inflation tax at year t is calculated over the 5 year period from t-4 to t.
Growth is the annual growth rate of real GDP.
The Governance Matters III indicators of the institutional environment are measured by their respective averages over the years 1996, 1998 and 2000.
The ICRG Index is the normalized 0-1 sum of the following components: quality of bureaucracy, law and order, corruptions, 2* investment protection similar to
Knack and Keefer (1995). Investment protection includes expropriation, contract repudiation and repatriation of profits. It is weighted by 2, so that the Index can
approximate the one used in Knack and Keefer(1995)
The ICRG individual components have been annualized and normalized 0-1 from available monthly observations for the period 1984 to 2002.

Notes: Standard deviations in parentheses below the estimated coefficients. Three stars indicate significance at 1% or less, two stars at 5% or less.
Columns 1 and 2 report the estimates of random effects GLS regressions; columns 3 to 8 those of fixed effects.
In columns 4 to 8 we instrument the growth rate and the interaction of growth with institutions, by the "external" growth rate
and its interaction with institutions. For every country i, and every year, the "external" growth rate is calculated as the average
of every other country's j ≠i growth rate weighted by the ratio of log GDP to the square of the distance between country j and country i.
In column 5, we interact (Growth*Institutions) with the dummy Small, which equals 1, if the country's GDP in that year is below the 90th percentile of the sample in that year.
In column 6, we interact Growth with the log of the initial level of real GDP; for most countries the initial level is that of 1965;
when this is not available, as in the transition economies, for example, we take the first year for which we have an observations for real GDP.
In column 7, we instrument the growth rate, institutions and the interaction of growth and institutions, by the "external" growth rate,
the log of population density in 1500 (see Acemoglou, Johnson and Robinson(2002)), and the interaction of "external" growth with the log of population density respectively.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2
In column 8, institutions are proxied by the ICRG Index, which is the normalized 0-1 sum of the following components: quality of bureaucracy, law and order, corruptions, 2* investment
protection similar to Knack and Keefer (1995). Investment protection includes expropriation, contract repudiation and repatriation of profits. It is weighted by 2, so that the Index can
approximate the one used in Knack and Keefer(1995)

Notes: Foreign Currency Deposits to Total Deposits (0-1) for each country is the average of available observations over 1990 to 2001.
Inflation tax and its standard deviation for each country is the average for the period 1965 to 2002.
The sensitivity of inflation tax on growth is the estimated coefficient of growth as a regressor on inflation tax as the dependent variable.
The regressions were estimated by country for the period 1965 to 2002.
The measure of legal restrictions on dollarization (0-5, 0 meaning no legal impediments) is based on IMF's Exchange Arrangements and Restrictions for 2001.

Notes: Estimates based on a cross section of 91 countries except for column 5, where availability of legal restrictions limits the sample to 83.
The standard deviations are in parentheses under the estimated coefficients. Three stars indicate significance at 1%, two stars at 5%, and one star at 10%.
The sensitivity of inflation tax to growth is for each country the estimated coefficient of the growth rate of real gdp as regressor
on the inflation tax as dependent variable; the regressions for the estimation of sensitivity have been estimated for each country separately for the period 1965 to 2002.
Square of Sensitivity is the square of the above variable.
Inflation tax and its standard deviation are measured here by their averages over 1965-2002.
The measure of legal restrictions on dollarization (0-5, 0 meaning no legal impediments) is based on IMF's Exchange Arrangements and Restrictions for 2001.

         Note: Real growth, on the horizontal axis, is measured for each country as the average over 1980 to 1995 of the annual growth rate of
         real GDP. Inflation tax, (π/(1+π)), with π the annual CPI inflation, on the vertical axis, is each country's average inflation tax over
         1980 to 1995. In the left (right) panel I group those of the 165 countries in the sample for which government effectiveness (average
         value for 1996,1998 and 2000 as in Kaufmann et all (2003)) is below (above) the sample median.

                                Note: T he sensitivity of inflation tax to growth is the estimated coefficient of the real gdp growth rate as regressor on inflation tax as dependent variable; regressions by
                                country were based on 1965-2002 samples. Liability Dollarization is measured as the ratio of foreign currency deposits to total deposits in percent; for each country we take
                                the average for the period 1990-2001.
