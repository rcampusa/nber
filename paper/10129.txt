This paper summarizes the main lessons learned from Law and Employment: Lessons from Latin

America and the Caribbean, a forthcoming NBER book. It places Latin American economies and

economic policies in a world context. The paper quantifies the cost of regulation in Latin America

and OECD Europe and discusses the origin of regulation. It shows the fragility of time series data

analyses of the sort widely used to analyze the impact of regulation in OECD Europe and the

benefits of using microdata data. The evidence shows that regulation reduces labor market

flexibility, reduces the employment of marginal workers and generates inequality in the larger

society.

1. Introduction

        This book uses microdata from diverse Latin American and Caribbean countries to

investigate the impact of regulation on their labor markets. Common methodologies are

applied to extract empirical regularities from the region. Latin America and the Caribbean

are of interest in their own right. But for several reasons, the lessons learned from studies

of these labor markets have much greater generality.

        The shifts in the policy regimes experienced in the region are dramatic by OECD

standards, and many of these regime shifts are exogenous. This large and exogenous

variation provides identifying power not available to analysts studying regulation in

Europe and North America. Given the evidence on the comparability of labor demand

functions around the world summarized in Hamermesh (1993 and this volume), lessons

about the impact of regulation learned from Latin labor markets apply more generally.

        The studies in this volume are based on microdata. Use of such data avoids reliance

on fragile country aggregate statistics that have been the main source of information used

to study European regulation (see, e.g. the evidence summarized in Nickell and Layard,

1999). Countries have diverse economic regions and agents and aggregation over these

regions and their economic agents masks this diversity. In this chapter, we show the

sensitivity of estimates of the impact of regulation obtained from conventional pooled time

series-cross sections of countries to alternative choices of samples and models, although a

few important empirical regularities established at the microlevel hold up in macrodata.

Our analysis builds the case for doing disaggregated analyses of the type reported in this

book.

        The evidence presented here challenges one prevailing view that labor market

regulations affect only the distribution of labor incomes and have minor effects on


                                               5
efficiency.4 The results presented in this volume suggest that mandated benefits reduce

employment and that job security regulations have a substantial impact on the distribution

of employment and on turnover rates. The most adverse impact of regulation is on youth,

marginal workers, and unskilled workers. Insiders and entrenched workers gain from

regulation but outsiders suffer. As a consequence, job security regulations promote

inequality among demographic groups. Most of the individual country studies demonstrate

that regulations promoting job security reduce covered worker exit rates out of

employment and out of unemployment, and on net reduce employment.

         This introductory essay has three main goals. (1) It summarizes the main lessons to

be drawn from the studies assembled here. (2) It places Latin American and Caribbean

(LAC) regulatory burden in an international context by comparing the level and changes in

LAC labor regulation policies with those in OECD countries as well as providing some

historical context about the origins of this regulation. (3) It updates the work of Heckman

and Pagés (2000) with an expanded sample and better measures of regulation, providing a

cross-country time-series analysis of the impact of regulation on employment and

unemployment. We quantify the cost of regulation in LAC and OECD region. The fragility

of the macro-based estimates documented in our paper suggests one reason why relatively

little is known about the impact of regulations in Europe despite an abundance of cross-

country time-series papers analyzing policies in that region. However, the macro time-

series literature does produce some empirical regularities. The methods used to analyze the

micro-evidence presented in this book should be extended to produce more convincing

evidence of the impacts of regulations on employment in the OECD region5.

 Freeman (2000) and Nickell and Layard (1999), among others, adopt this view.

 See, however, the studies of Abowd et al. (1997, 1999, 2000), Machin and Stewart (1996), Kugler, Jimeno
and Hernanz (2002) and others, who use microdata to investigate the impact of regulation in Europe.


                                                   6
       This Chapter proceeds in the following way. Section 2 provides background on

Latin American economic and labor market performance. Section 3 presents some basic

facts about regulation in LAC, and compares LAC with OECD countries both in terms of

the level and composition of labor cost and in terms of the labor market reforms

experienced in the region. Section 4 summarizes the main lessons from the essays

presented in this book. Section 5 updates Heckman and Pagés (2000) and uses the cost

measures derived in Section 3 to examine the impacts of labor regulation on Latin

American and OECD employment and unemployment rates. Section 6 concludes and

makes suggestions for future work on regulation in Latin American and OECD labor

markets. We first present some background on Latin America and the nature of labor

market regulation in the region.



2. Latin American Economic and Labor Market Performance

       Latin American economic performance has been quite disappointing. Since 1970,

growth of income per capita has been just over one percent a year, higher than in Africa or

the Middle East, but much lower than in Asia or in the developed countries (Figure 1). Up

to the 1980s, trade policies heavily protected Latin economies from foreign competition.

There was a substantial degree of intervention by the state in the economy. The collapse of

most economies during that decade due to growing fiscal and monetary imbalances led

many countries to implement large structural reforms towards the end of the 1980s and

early 1990s. Macroeconomic stabilization policies reduced fiscal deficits and brought

inflation under control. Sweeping, fast-paced trade reforms lowered substantial tariff

barriers on manufactured goods. Governments undertook fiscal reforms, lifted control over

financial markets and privatized most state-owned firms. Some countries also embarked on


                                             7
labor reforms described in the next section. While growth rates in the 1990s were higher

than they were during the 1980s, the rates of growth in this period still fell short of those

attained in other parts of the world.

       Among the countries covered in this volume (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,

Peru, Uruguay, Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago), Chile was the best

performer, with an average growth rate of GDP of 4.8 during the period 1980-2001 (see

Table 1). Argentina and Trinidad and Tobago experienced the lowest average growth

during the past two decades, despite high average growth rates during the nineties.

       In spite of this weak economic performance, GDP per capita (PPP US$ adjusted)

levels in Latin American countries are higher than those of other developing regions.

According to the World Bank Development Indicators, in 2001, the average GDP per

capita in the Latin America and the Caribbean region was $7,050, considerably higher than

that of East Asia and the Pacific (4,233), Central and Eastern Europe (6,598), South Asia

(2,730), Sub-Saharan Africa (1,831) or the Arab States (5,038). Similarly, the regional

Human Development Index computed by the United Nations for LAC (0.77) was almost as

high as in Central and Eastern Europe (0.78) and higher than in any other region except for

the OECD (0.90). Among the countries whose labor markets are analyzed in this volume,

Barbados and Argentina exhibited the highest income per capita and human development

indexes while Jamaica and Peru rank the lowest among the countries both in per capita

income and in human development (see Table 1).

       While GDP growth rates were not high, during the period 1980-1999 employment

rates grew in the nine countries studied here. The highest growth rates were recorded in

Colombia and Peru, countries that also experienced fast growth in female labor force

participation. In contrast, average employment growth rates were low in Trinidad and


                                               8
Tobago and in Argentina. According to International Labor Organisation (ILO) and

Economics Commission For Latin America and The Caribbean (ECLAC) data, average

urban unemployment rates during the eighties and nineties exceeded 8 percent in all

countries analyzed in this book except for Brazil. Unemployment comparisons should be

treated cautiously because they are not strictly comparable. For instance, in the Caribbean

countries, the unemployment rates include discouraged workers (those who drop out of the

labor force), while such workers are excluded in the Latin American countries, which

compute unemployment rates according to more traditional definitions. 6 Many have

remarked that the high level of regulation of economic activity in the region accounts for

problems in the labor markets in the region, and the essays assembled here shed light on

this conjecture.



3. Labor Market Regulations and Institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean

         This section sketches the history of labor market regulation in the region and

describes and quantifies the regulatory environment in Latin America and the Caribbean. It

compares the level of regulation and pace of regulatory reform in LAC countries and

OECD countries. When it is credible to do so, we also make an effort to quantify the

monetary costs (as a percentage of wages) of full compliance with regulations without

discussing whether costs are borne by workers or firms. We discuss this issue more

extensively in sections 4 and 5.




Regulations governing individual contracts

6
  That is, they only include persons that are available for work and who are taking specific steps to search for
a job.

                                                       9
       Throughout Latin America, labor codes determine the types of contracts, the

lengths of trial periods, and the conditions of part-time work. Regulations favor full-time,

indefinite contracts over part-time, fixed-term or temporary contracts. As a form of worker

protection, labor codes mandate a minimum advance notice period prior to termination,

specify which causes are considered justified causes for dismissal, and establish

compensation to be awarded to workers depending on the reason for the termination. In

contrast, temporary contracts can be terminated at no cost provided that the duration of the

contract has expired. To prevent firms from exclusively hiring workers under temporary

contracts, in most countries the use of such arrangements is severely restricted. Labor

codes also limit trial periods – that is, the period of time during which a firm can test and

dismiss a worker at no cost if his or her performance is considered unsatisfactory.

       Although most OECD countries began regulating their labor markets when they

had attained relatively high income per capita, Latin America and other developing

countries started regulating their markets much earlier in the development process

(Lindauer, 1999). The first regulations date from the beginning of the twentieth century.

The motivation for these regulations was the perceived need to protect the welfare of

workers against the excessive power of employers, and to insure workers against the risk

of job loss and income security (Lindauer, 1999). The Mexican constitution of 1917

articulated the principle that protecting workers was one of the duties of the State. By the

1930s and 1940s most countries had a Labor Code. The belief that each new reform should

only strengthen the set of warranties and benefits awarded from previous laws became

widespread. For many years, successive reforms expanded the protection that the law

afforded to workers. There was little examination of the question whether such regulations

would affect economic performance. However, until the 1980s most countries in the LAC


                                              10
region were isolated and their industries heavily protected. Labor regulations were one way

to distributing the rents from protection among covered workers and employers.

Regulations are a low cost way (from the point of government fiscal authorities) of

providing social insurance to protect workers. The weak fiscal systems in place in the

region joined with the low level of income and a tradition of tax evasion, corruption and

noncompliance made the social insurance schemes used in more developed countries

prohibitively costly.

       Military rule often led to deregulation of many labor markets. Unions were frequent

targets, as much for political as for economic reasons. The political and economic

environment in LAC changed substantially in the 1980s and 1990s. Most countries

restored democracy after long periods of military rule. These political changes bred some

labor reforms, first to restore union activity, which had been made illegal in many military

regimes, and second to reach a new social pact. In Chile, Brazil and the Dominican

Republic, at the beginning of the 1990s and later in Nicaragua (1996) these reforms

produced more protective labor regulations.

       A new Constitution was enacted in 1988 in Brazil as part of the process of re-

democratization during the second half of the 1980s (See Paes de Barros and Corseuil, this

volume). This new Constitution revised labor regulations and changed many labor codes

that had been in place since the 1940s. The new Constitution reduced the maximum

working hours per week from 48 to 44 hours; reduced the maximum number of hours for a

continuous work shift from 8 to 6 hours; increased the minimum overtime premium from

20 percent to 50 percent; increased maternity leave from 3 to 4 months; and the value of

paid vacations increased from 1 to, at least, 4/3 of the normal monthly wage. The new

Constitution also modified the mandatory individual saving accounts system created in


                                              11
1966. Prior to the reforms, the law required employers to deposit 8 percent of employees’

wages in a worker-owned account. In case of separation, workers could withdraw the

accumulated funds (plus the interest rate). In addition, if a firm initiated a separation it had

to pay a penalty equivalent to 10 percent of the amount accumulated in the account. As

part of the 1988 reform, this penalty was increased to 40 percent, considerably increasing

the cost of dismissing a worker.

           In the case of Chile, the 1990 reform introduced with the return to democracy

reestablished some of the protection to workers that had been eliminated during the

military regime. Under the dictatorship, union activity had been severely restricted and

some benefits, such as indemnities for dismissal had been substantially reduced.7 See

Montenegro and Pagés (this volume). In 1990, the new law increased maximum

indemnities from 5 to 11 months of pay. It also re-introduced the need for firms to prove

just cause for dismissal, although unlike the case in other countries, the new law

considered the economic needs of the firm a just cause.

           While in some countries lawmakers were busy increasing legal protection for

workers, the economic environment was changing substantially. The deep economic crisis

that ensued with the Debt Crisis of the early 1980s called into question the protectionist

model. The relatively good performance of the Chilean economy, which in the mid 1970s

opened to trade and introduced many pro-market reforms, spawned imitators all across

Latin America. By the second half of the 1980s and the early 1990s, most countries had

drastically reduced tariffs on imports. The new openness to international trade increased

the demand for labor market flexibility. It was argued that without sweeping labor market

reforms, Latin American economies would not be able to compete internationally. This

7

                                               12
was the main motivation behind the reforms that introduced temporary contracts in

Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Peru and that reduced the cost of dismissing

workers with indefinite contracts in Colombia (1990) and Peru (1991). Temporary and

fixed-term contracts were introduced in Argentina in 1991 and their role was expanded in

1995 (See Hopenhayn, this volume). These changes were influenced by similar reforms in

Spain during the 1980s. Special fixed-term duration employment promotion contracts

could be awarded to unemployed workers and to workers younger than 25 and older than

40 years old. For some types of contracts, severance pay was reduced by 100 percent.

However, these contracts were eliminated in 1998, when the share of persons working

under these arrangements had increased substantially. Ecuador, Peru and Colombia also

lifted restrictions on the use of these types of programs in the early 1990s. In Peru, the

number of workers hired under these contracts increased enormously. In Brazil, the use of

such contracts has been liberalized since 1998.

       The 1991 reforms in Peru reduced the cost of dismissing workers hired under

indefinite contracts. During 1971-1991, workers who had completed trial periods were

granted permanent job security. If a firm dismissed a worker and could not prove "just

cause" in labor courts, the worker could choose between being reinstated in his or her job

or receiving a severance payment of three monthly wages per year of work (with a

maximum of 12 months pay). In practice, since workers could always ask to be reinstated

and then settle for a higher severance pay, the mandatory amount was a lower bound of the

firing cost. See Saavedra and Torero (this volume).

       Beginning in 1991, workers hired after that year could be dismissed at will upon

payment of a severance benefit. In addition, “just cause” clauses were extended to allow

the dismissal of workers who did not perform up to expectations. The severance pay


                                              13
schedule was reduced from three to one wage for every year of tenure for workers with

more than one year in the firm, with a minimum of three wages and a maximum of twelve.

The 1993 Constitution replaced the right of workers to a permanent job with the right of

firms to dismiss workers. In July 1995, a second wave of labor reforms, simplified the

severance payment to one month per year of work up to a maximum of 12 months and the

two-tier severance system was eliminated. These modifications substantially reduced the

cost of dismissing workers. However, in November 1996, the severance payments rule was

increased again to one and a half wages per year of work with an unaltered maximum cap

of twelve wages.

       In Colombia, the 1990 Labor reforms liberalized many aspects of labor regulation.

Besides regulations introducing the use of temporary contracts, the most important changes

were those in the Cesantias, or severance pay that firms owed to workers at the end of the

work relationship regardless of the cause or the party that initiated separation. Prior to the

reforms, employers were mandated to pay severance of one month per year at the time of

the separation based on the salary at the separation. Workers could obtain advanced

payments against their benefits. Such withdrawals were credited against the severance pay

due workers at the end of the labor relationship in nominal terms as of the date of the

withdrawal. High rates of inflation increased the costs of such schemes to employers. After

the reform, the withdrawals were credited in real terms, substantially reducing costs for

firms. In addition, the reforms eliminated the right to re-instatement for workers with

more than ten years of tenure. Offsetting these cost-reducing features, the reforms

increased the cost of indemnities for dismissal.

       Panama (1995) and Venezuela (1997) also undertook labor reforms with the goal of

increasing labor market flexibility while preserving some form of protection to workers.


                                              14
In both countries reforms increased mandatory pay in case of separation, but considerably

reduced the additional amount that firms had to pay in case of a firm-initiated dismissal.

       In contrast to Latin American regulation, in the Caribbean a mixture of legislation,

common law doctrines, custom and policy characterizes the institutional context. At the

beginning of the Twentieth Century, in all countries of that region, regulation of the labor

market was based on common law rather than on the Civil Law tradition predominant in

Latin America (see Downes, Mamingi and Antoine, this volume). While in some countries,

like Barbados, most aspects of labor relation are still left to the courts to determine, in

others, such as in Trinidad and Tobago, the enactment of different regulations has

progressively increased the level of statutory protection to workers. In Barbados (1973),

Trinidad & Tobago (1974) and Jamaica (1985) labor reforms instituted mandatory

severance pay, although as shown in the next section at levels that are much lower than

those prevalent in Latin America.



Payroll Contributions and other Mandatory Benefits

       As in most industrial countries, in LAC many social protection programs, such as

old-age pensions, public health systems, unemployment subsidies, and family allowances

are funded from payroll contributions. In addition, regulations mandate other employee-

paid benefits such as occupational health and safety provisions, maternity and sick leave,

overtime pay and vacations.

       Unlike changes in labor codes that tend to be infrequent events, changes in the level

of contributions to these programs occur often. In addition, during the 1990s, many

countries implemented reforms, which transformed pay-as-you-go systems into full or

partial capitalization systems. One of the advantages of such schemes is that they tend to


                                               15
increase the link between contributions and benefits. However, at the same time, many

countries, most noticeably Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Uruguay, and Brazil, increased

the level of payroll taxes to reduce the actuarial imbalances present in their social security

systems. Below, we quantify the levels and changes in these contributions across Latin

America and OECD countries.



Collective Bargaining

          Unions in Latin America tend to be firm or sector-based and weak. In most cases,

the state intervenes in union registration and accreditation as well as in the process of

collective bargaining. The state authorizes only certain unions to have representation

authority (Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Brazil), and intervenes in the resolution of conflicts

and the arbitration process (Argentina, Mexico). Only in Brazil and Argentina is collective

bargaining highly centralized at the sector level, while in Nicaragua and Colombia, sector-

level bargaining coexists with firm-based negotiation. In Mexico, collective bargaining

takes place at the firm level but a high level of centralization is achieved through a strong

corporatist structure and through union discipline (O’Connell, 1999). In contrast, unions

are stronger and collective bargaining tends to be national or sector-based in OECD

countries with the exception of Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United

States.

          According to data from ILO (97-98), union density as percentage of non-

agricultural employment is higher in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Nicaragua and smaller

in the rest of the Latin American countries. Union affiliation tends to be higher in countries

where collective bargaining is more centralized. Overall, union density is lower in Latin




                                              16
America (14.7) than in industrial countries (36.6).8 There are also large differences in

coverage rates. Thus, while collective bargaining agreements in countries such as Spain,

France and Greece, which are negotiated by a minority, are extended to almost all

employees, in Latin American countries this is generally not the case. As a result,

coverage rates in Latin America tend to be much lower than those observed in OECD

countries with similar affiliation rates.

         The influence that collective bargaining exerts on wage and employment

conditions, measured by affiliation rates, is declining over time. Thus, Latin American and

Caribbean countries share a trend that has been well documented for OECD countries.

Affiliation rates have declined in all of the countries of the region.9 This decline has been

especially large in Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Uruguay. In this

chapter, we only present estimates for Uruguay on the impact of unionization on

employment. Cassoni, Allen and Labadie (this volume) estimate a strong adverse impact

of unionism on employment in Uruguay. The evidence for other Latin American countries

is still too sparse.



Minimum Wages

         Minimum wages are widely used in Latin America to increase the wages of the

poorest workers. Figure 2 (taken from Maloney and Nuñez-Mendez, this volume) ranks

various Latin American and OECD countries by their minimum wage, standardized by the

8
  ILO data corresponds to the mid nineties. The comparison between LAC and Industrial countries reflects
the difference between unweighted regional averages. The average for industrial countries includes the
following countries (France, Spain, US, Greece, Germany, Italy, UK, Denmark, Belgium, Finland, Iceland,
Ireland, Sweden and Canada)
9
  ILO data for 1985 and 1993 indicates that union affiliation increased in Chile during that period. Yet, data
from a later period indicates that union affiliation has been declining since 1993.

distribution, most notably Uruguay, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico, others,

such as, Venezuela, El Salvador, Paraguay and Honduras have very high minimum to

average minimum wages by OECD standards. These high levels suggest that minimum

wages are likely to be binding, and, as a result, to reduce employment, and to retard

downward wage movements in the presence of adverse demand shocks.

        Data on enforcement of the minimum wage is incomplete. However, some

evidence available for workers between 25 and 40 years old suggests that about 10 percent

of wage employees in that age range earn salaries below the minimum wage (See Table 2).

In some countries, such as Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia and Argentina, the proportion below

the minimum in this age range is very small. In other countries, such as Colombia,

minimum to average wages are high but a large proportion of the labor force in the 25 to

40 age-range earns wages below the statutory minimum. Whether the adverse effect of a

high level of minimum wages is offset by substantial non-compliance remains an open

empirical question.



What motivates reforms?

        In studying the effect of reforms in the labor market it is important to examine what

factors initiate these relatively infrequent episodes. It could be argued that labor market

outcomes are driven by the same events that drive the reforms, and not by the labor

reforms themselves. Figures 3A-3F (for Latin America) and 3G-3I (for the Caribbean) plot

GDP growth rates and unemployment rates for the countries covered in the individual

10
  The observations are from the early nineties for the OECD countries and from the mid and late nineties for
LAC. Data from OECD were obtained from Dolado et al (1996), data from LAC comes from IADB (1998-
1999) and Maloney and Nuñez.

country studies of this volume during the period 1980-2000. They also plot major episodes

of labor reform (marked with a continuous line if a liberalization of the labor market

occurred and dotted line if the reforms increased protection to workers).11 In addition,

these figures mark episodes of major tariff reductions (double line) or the end of military

regimes and the return to democracy (discontinue line).

        In Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, reforms that liberalized the labor

market occurred within one or two years before or after major reductions in tariffs, and

were part of efforts to liberalize economies and increase the participation of the market in

the production and allocation of goods and services. In Chile and Brazil, reforms that

increased the legal protection of workers occurred in the context of a transition to

democracy. In all of these episodes it could be argued that labor reforms were exogenous

to the economic system since they were driven either by a new economic philosophy or by

profound transformations in political regimes, although one could counter that these

political transitions were facilitated by economic developments. Some reforms and

transformations are clearly driven by changes in economic activity. There is evidence that

many reforms tend to occur around periods of negative economic growth. In the countries

and periods analyzed in this volume, there have been at least 15 episodes of reform. Out of

these fifteen, six episodes of reform occurred in years in which GDP had declined the year

before. However, four of those reforms increased the legal protection to workers and two

liberalized the labor market.

        Overall there is no empirical relationship between labor reforms and labor market

outcomes driven by economic performance. Our cross-country time-series analysis

11
   Only major changes in labor codes or other major government interventions in the labor market are
included. Changes in social security contributions or payroll taxes, as well as changes in the level of
minimum wages –which occur quite frequently-- are not included.

presented in this chapter controls for present and past levels of economic activity, to

account for the possibility of endogeneity. The disaggregated studies use year effects and

other strategies to control for endogeneity.



Quantifying the Cost of Regulation

       This section constructs measures of labor laws that can be compared across

countries and time (see also Heckman and Pagés, 2000). Many studies that summarize

institutional data across countries construct qualitative indices that rank variables across

countries. For instance, Grubb and Wells (1993) construct a series of indicators of

employment protection by ranking different aspects of job protection across countries and

averaging these different rankings in one summary indicator. Although such measures

summarize many complex institutional features, they are not comparable over time. A

second group of studies constructs measures that aggregate institutional aspects of the

labor market by assigning to each country/year a value in a certain range, for instance,

between zero and one. These measures summarize a large number of interesting aspects

and are comparable across time. However, they can also be quite arbitrary since it is

difficult to justify any assigned numerical values for qualitative variables and it is difficult

to compare one measure against another. Moreover, the measures are very sensitive to the

weights assigned to the different components of these measures. From a policy standpoint,

summarizing many features of a regulatory system in one indicator makes it impossible to

distinguish which components, if any, have an adverse effect on employment.

       We take a different route by constructing measures of the direct cost (measured as a

fraction of average monthly wages) of complying with labor laws. These measures can be

compared not only across countries and over time, but they can also be compared against


                                               20
each other. This allows us to quantify, for instance, the share of the total costs given by

each type of regulation. Our measure of mandatory total costs (TC) of regulations is:

                                       TC = SSP + JS

It is the sum of the cost of social security payments (SSP) plus the cost of abiding by job

security provisions (JS). These costs are expressed as fractions of the average monthly

wage.

        This measure of the cost of regulation omits some important components of labor

cost. For example, the costs of abiding by certain laws are hard to quantify and are omitted.

One example of laws whose costs are difficult to quantify, is the prohibition against

dismissing workers in bad times. In addition, this measure does not include the cost of

regulating the length of the standard workweek and overtime work. It does not include the

cost of complying with minimum wage laws or other income floors. We do not include

regulations on temporary labor contracts. Although these regulations are likely to have

effects on employment and unemployment, we choose to exclude them because

comparable data on the share of the labor force affected by these regulations across time

and countries are difficult to obtain. We leave the quantification of these features of

regulations for future work.

        There is one major conceptual problem with this index. It does not distinguish

between static and dynamic aspects of the cost of labor. Job security affects both

components of costs by raising the total cost of labor and by increasing the cost of

adjusting labor. Social security costs affect the unit cost of labor without affecting dynamic

costs of labor. Our index of total cost is not a measure of the price of labor facing firms at

different stages of the business cycle. We develop this point below and in Appendix B.




                                              21
Quantifying Job Security Provisions

     Our index includes in job security legislation those provisions of the law that increase

the cost of dismissing a worker for economic reasons.12 Across countries, termination laws

require firms to incur at least five types of costs: administrative procedures, advance

notification, indemnities for dismissal, seniority pay and the legal costs of a trial if workers

contest dismissals. Administrative procedures require the firm to notify and seek approval

by labor unions or the Ministry of Labor to extend the period between layoff decisions and

the actual occurrence of layoffs. They may also involve long negotiations to place workers

in alternative jobs. The period of advance notification should also be included in the

computation of labor costs because in many countries, laws allow firms to choose between

providing advance notice or paying a compensation equivalent to the wages for the

corresponding period. Moreover, since productivity declines substantially after notice,

advance notification should be considered as a part of dismissal costs even when firms

choose to notify workers in advance. Therefore, we assume that employees do not work at

full productivity levels after notification.13 In most countries, mandatory advance notice

periods increase with tenure, and in others they are higher for white-collar than for blue-

collar workers.

     Most Latin American and OECD countries mandate indemnities in cases of firm-

initiated dismissal. In general, indemnities are based on multiples of the most recent wage

and the years of service. Some countries calculate the amount of mandatory indemnities

based on whether the dismissal is deemed just or unjust or whether the worker is blue-

12
    In most countries, the law does not mandate compensation for dismissal if the separation is due to
employees’ misdemeanors. However, if such behavior cannot be proved, the worker has to be compensated
at the regular legal rate.
13
   There is some evidence that advance notice stimulates on-the-job search during the notification period
(Addison and Portugal 1992), which suggests a reduction in the effort devoted to work.


                                                   22
collar or white-collar. In contrast, seniority pay is only mandated in a few Latin American

countries in which the law requires employers to make a payment upon termination of the

work relationship regardless of the cause or party initiating the separation. In these

countries, firms initiating dismissal are required to pay both indemnities and seniority pay.

In some countries, this payment is deposited as a regular contribution to the worker’s

individual savings account. In these countries, workers can withdraw principal and interest

from their account upon separation. In other countries, seniority pay is determined as a

given amount that has to be paid to the worker upon termination of the work relationship.14

Finally, firms can incur considerable additional costs if workers contest dismissal in courts.

If judges rule in favor of workers, firms not only have to pay indemnities, but also the

workers’ foregone wages during trial.

       To compute the monetary cost of labor laws, we improve on the job security measures

developed in Heckman and Pagés (2000) in three ways. First, we expand our previous data

base to include the 1980s in all OECD countries. This expansion of the data set allows us

to capture some additional labor reforms in OECD countries not previously captured.

Second, we revise and correct some of our previous data on advance notice and

indemnities for a number of countries to better capture the actual cost of the law (see

Appendix A for a complete description of the methodology and assumptions involved).

Finally, we include the cost of seniority pay in our measure of job security, which we did

not include in our previous work.

            Our measure of the cost of job security JS jt for country j at time t is constructed

from the following formula:

where δ is the probability of a worker remaining in a job in a period, β is the discount

factor, i denotes tenure at the firm, and T is the maximum tenure that a worker can attain in

a firm which is assumed to be twenty years (T=20). The expression is broken down into

three terms corresponding to advanced notice costs ( AN j,t ), indemnity costs ( ID j,t ) and

seniority pay ( SenPj,t ). The first term in expression (1) is the discounted cost of future

advance notice, weighted by the probability that a worker will be dismissed, after one, two,

three, and so on, periods at the firm where bj,t+i is the advance notice to a worker who has

been i years at a firm measured in monthly wages. The second term in expression (1) is

the discounted cost of future indemnities, weighted by the probability of dismissal after i

periods at the firm. In this expression, aj denotes the probability that the economic

difficulties of the firm are considered a just cause of dismissal while yj,t+ijc (yj,t+iuc) is the

mandated indemnity in case of just cause (unjust cause) dismissal, again measured in

monthly wages. Finally, the third term in expression (1) captures the cost of severance

pay, and cj,t+i denotes contributions to a workers’ savings account measured in monthly

wages.15 We assume a common discount and dismissal rate of 8 and 12 percent,

respectively across countries. The choice of the discount rate is based on the historical

returns of an internationally diversified portfolio. Our choice of the turnover rate is

motivated by the concern that turnover rates are affected by the legislation in countries




                                                              24
with job security provisions. We use a benchmark turnover rate from the United States, a

country with lower job security costs than any country in our LAC sample. If intrinsic

turnover in LAC is higher than in the U.S, we understate costs. The choice of this

benchmark is clearly a rough way to avoid endogeneity problems. To assign values to the

discounted future payments of advance notice, indemnities and seniority pay, we use the

information contained in Tables A.1 and A.2 in Appendix A. When regulations mandate

different provisions for white-collar and blue-collar workers, we take the unweighted

average for the two types of workers.

        By construction, our job security measures give a higher weight to dismissal costs

that may arise soon after a worker is hired since they are discounted less at the time of

hiring, while they discount more firing costs that arise further in the future. Our measure

captures the expected average cost. Consequently, it does not measure the true marginal

labor cost, which is state contingent, nor does it distinguish dynamic from static costs, as

we have previously noted. We discuss these issues further in Appendix B.



Quantifying the Cost of Social Security

        To quantify the cost of social security regulations and payroll taxation, we gather

data on mandatory payroll contributions to old age, disability and death, sickness and

maternity, work injury, unemployment insurance and family allowances programs. Since

the nominal incidence of the contributions (whether they fall on the employer or the

employee) is irrelevant in measuring total social cost (although it is not irrelevant for the

study of labor demand), we add both contributions as a percentage of wages.

15
  In countries where the law mandates seniority pay, but this pay is not capitalized in individual savings
accounts, cj, t+i measures the costs associated with this provision, which will arise in the future with
probability one.


                                                   25
To quantify the cost of social security provisions in a way that is comparable to the cost of

job security, we compute the expected cost of social security provisions at the time of

hiring as:


                              T
                 SSPjt = ∑ β i ( ss ej , t + i + ss wj ,t + i )
                             i=0




where ss ej ,t +i and ss wj ,t +i are, respectively, the costs of payroll taxes paid by the employer

and the worker expressed as a percent of wages, and β is the discount rate.16



The Cost of Labor Laws across Countries

     Table 3 summarizes our measures of the cost associated with different labor regulation

regimes. In the first three columns, we summarize the cost of abiding by employment

protection laws at the end of the 1990s. We generate these indices for all countries in all

years for which we have data. Table 3 only reports those values for the last year of our

sample. Column (1) summarizes the cost of giving advance notice to workers. In the Latin

American countries, the typical required advance notice is a month or the equivalent to

0.63 monthly wages in expected value terms. Bolivia stands out as the country that

requires a longer advance notice period (1.77 months in expected terms), while Peru and

Uruguay require no advance notice. Mandatory advance notice provisions tend to be more

stringent in OECD countries. Many OECD countries mandate fairly long advance notice

periods, particularly for skilled workers. In addition, in most countries, advance notice

periods increase with seniority. In Belgium, for instance, the mandatory advance notice for

16
  We obtain the information on these contributions from the series “Social Security Programs Throughout
the World,” edited by the United States Social Security Administration (1983-1999).


                                                                  26
skilled workers with 10 years of seniority is 9 months, while for workers with 20 years of

seniority it is 15 months. In Sweden, all workers with 10 years of seniority are entitled to

an advance notice period of 5 months, whereas for a worker with 20 years of seniority, the

mandatory advance notice period is 6 months. The fact that Belgium and Sweden have

very similar values in Table 3 reflects the fact that in Belgium very high advance notice

only applies to skilled workers whereas in Sweden it applies to all workers. It also reflects

the fact that our measure heavily discounts costs that are expected to occur far in the

future. On average, mandated advance notice periods are significantly longer in OECD

countries than in the Latin American and Caribbean sample.

   The second column displays the cost of indemnities for dismissal. Within the LAC

sample, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, El Salvador, and Honduras stand out as

countries where the cost of abiding by these regulations is the highest. In the sample of

OECD countries, Portugal, Turkey, Korea, Italy and Spain are the ones where indemnities

for dismissal laws are more costly (in terms of expected monthly wages), while a number

of countries including Belgium, Finland, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand,

Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States do not mandate indemnities

for dismissal. Comparing the two regional samples, it is clear that, on average,

compensation for dismissal is three times larger in LAC than in the OECD countries

despite the much lower level of income in the LAC region.

   The third column refers to seniority pay. This additional payment is mandatory in only

six Latin American countries, but the estimated expected discounted costs are large when

this feature is present. In Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru, employers are required to

deposit about one month of pay every year to workers’ individual savings accounts. Over

the life of a worker, this provision is expected to cost about 10 monthly wages in these four


                                              27
countries. Once advance notice, compensation for dismissal and severance pay are added,

we find that the cost of job security provisions is much higher in the poorer Latin

American and Caribbean region than in the richer OECD sample.

    The fourth column reports the expected costs of complying with social security laws.

Compared to the costs of employment security, social security costs are very large and

therefore constitute the lion’s share of the total costs of labor laws. In Argentina, for

example, expected discounted costs of social security are 44.5 months of pay while in

many OECD countries these costs are even larger. In the average Latin American country,

social security payments amount to 82 percent of the total costs of labor laws. This

percentage is even larger in OECD countries where, on average, they reach 96 percent of

the total regulatory costs.

    Once all the costs are aggregated, labor laws impose a much larger cost in OECD

countries. However, the composition of these costs is quite different. While the typical

Latin American country mandates shorter advance notice periods and lower social security

contributions than the average OECD country, job security provisions are substantially

higher in LAC.

    Latin American and Caribbean countries have a higher burden of regulations that affect

adjustment processes in the labor market. European countries have a higher burden of

payroll taxation that affects labor demand but not labor adjustment. Both regions have a

much higher burden of labor costs than North America.

    Exploring the relationship between income per capita and social protection across

countries, it is clear that job security provisions are strategies of low income regions.

Figure 4 graphs regression relationships for each of our measures of labor cost on GDP per

capita (PPP adjusted) and GDP squared. Across countries, advance notice costs tend to


                                              28
increase with income; seniority pay and indemnities for dismissal decline with country

income. Social security contributions follow an inverted U-shape pattern in income. They

tend to increase with income in the Latin American sample and reach a maximum in

medium income countries, while they tend to decline with income within the sample of

upper-income countries. Regulation is an inferior good. It is the response of poor countries

to the demand for worker security. By imposing a mandate on firms, central governments

avoid the direct fiscal cost of financing social safety nets albeit at the cost of affecting their

labor market performance.

        We next examine the evolution of these measures over time. Since the early 80’s

there have been few reforms in job security provisions in Latin America and even fewer in

OECD countries. Social security contributions have changed more, but even they seldom

change drastically. This lack of variability, particularly in job security provisions, poses a

challenge for empirical studies of the impact of regulations. Figure 5 shows the level and

the changes in job security since the late eighties across Latin American countries. The

general view that there have been important reductions in dismissal costs in Latin America

is not accurate once we aggregate across all components of job security. Only Colombia,

Panama, Peru and Venezuela have experienced a reduction in the costs of terminating

indefinite contracts. In Venezuela and Panama, the reduction in indemnities has been partly

offset by increases in the costs of severance pay. Our measures reveal that Brazil, the

Dominican Republic, Chile and Nicaragua undertook reforms that increased the cost of

dismissal. Assembling Latin American and OECD events, there are 13 episodes in which

job security provisions were changed. Nine of these episodes occurred in Latin America

and four occurred in the OECD sample. Figure 6 shows the percentage change in advance

notice and indemnities for dismissal in the countries that have experienced reforms. It


                                                29
makes clear that changes in job security costs have been substantial in Latin America

relative to the OECD sample. The enormous variation in the Latin American region and

the exogeneity of some of the reforms is the reason why we think that the study of Latin

American labor markets can inform further analyses of the impacts of regulation in

economies around the world.

       Figure 7 reports social security contributions (measured in expected discounted

cost terms) at the beginning and at the end of the nineties for Latin American Countries.

There have been important changes during the last decade. In many countries, social

security contributions increased during the nineties as a consequence of pension reforms

and population aging. Yet, in some countries, most significantly in Argentina, social

security contributions were reduced during the decade.



Enforcement and Informality

       The measures summarized in Table 4 calculate de jure cost of regulations,

assuming that firms and workers abide by the text of the law. In practice, however,

enforcement is at best weak, and many workers end up not being covered by mandatory

regulations. Such workers are often referred to as informal workers. Given the difficulties

in measuring the extent of informality, different approaches have been followed in the

literature. Some authors follow the traditional ILO approach of classifying as informal

those workers who are either self-employed, work for firms with five or less employees,

work as unpaid family help or are employed as domestic workers. Although some of these

workers may be receiving the benefits prescribed by the law, there tends to be a high

correlation between being in any of these categories of employment and not being covered

by labor laws. Other authors use a more direct measure of informality, computing the


                                             30
percentage of workers who are affiliated with social security programs or have a formal

labor contract. All authors in this volume use a “benefits” definition of informality except

for the study by Maloney and Nuñez-Mendez, which follows the ILO convention.

        Measured by the extent of compliance with social security regulations in Latin

America, non-compliance is substantial. According to IADB (2003), only 39 percent of all

workers and 60 percent of all wage employees are contributing to such programs (See

Table 2). Among the countries covered in the individual studies of this volume,

compliance as percentage of total employment is the highest in Chile and Uruguay and the

lowest in Peru. Compliance tends to be higher among skilled workers, among workers

employed in larger firms and in the manufacturing and high-paying finance and business

services sectors. In these latter sectors, the effect of regulations should be easier to detect.

Compliance is higher when the burden of regulation is lower.



4. The Impact of Labor Market Regulations

   This section summarizes the studies of the impact of labor market regulations that are

presented in this volume and places them in the context of the literature on more

economically developed countries. We distinguish between policies that alter employment

levels (generating static costs) from policies that affect employment flows (generating

dynamic transition costs). The essays contained in this book present evidence on both

types of policies. We also report findings on the effects of temporary contracts and

minimum wages.



4.1 A Static Labor Demand-Labor Supply Analysis




                                               31
         A convenient starting point from which to assess the impact of labor market

regulations on employment levels the standard neoclassical labor demand-labor supply

framework. If mandatory legislation increases labor costs, economic theory predicts that a

move up the labor demand function produces a fall in employment. The slope of the labor

demand schedule provides a good measure of the policy-induced change in employment

when governments or trade unions set labor costs administratively. The standard theory is

silent about the effects of the regulation on unemployment because it depends on whether

the displaced workers drop out of the labor force or attempt to seek new jobs.

         Table 4 summarizes estimates of constant-output labor demand elasticities for Latin

America. As noted by Hamermesh (this volume), these estimates are comparable to those

estimated for other countries.17 Although labor demand studies abound, we focus on those

studies that use disaggregated industry or individual firm data to infer the labor demand

parameters, since models fit on such data produces more reliable estimates of underlying

production parameters than models fit on data at higher levels of aggregation (Hamermesh,

1993). Comparisons across types of workers indicate that labor demand elasticities are

larger for blue-collar than for white-collar workers, suggesting a lower impact of

regulations on the employment rates of the latter. Estimates of labor demand for Latin

America tend to be somewhat lower than those obtained for other countries of the world,

especially those estimated for Peru and Mexico. (See the estimates from industrial

countries in the lower panel of the table.) Nonetheless, all estimates are between 0 and –

1.5, and most of them cluster between –0.2 and -0.6, well within the range for worldwide

17
  A more comprehensive measure of the impact of regulations on employment is given by the total elasticity,
that includes the possible scale effects of an increase in regulation including the entry and exit of firms due to
changes in labor costs. Unfortunately, there is very little empirical evidence in this book regarding the
magnitude of the total elasticity although studies by Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) and Nicoletti and
Scarpetta (2003) suggest that entry and exit decisions are an important component of the response to
regulation.

estimates reported by Hamermesh (1993) for output- constant labor demand elasticities.18

This range of estimates implies that a 10 percent increase in labor costs will result in a

sizable decline in employment, between 2 percent and 6 percent.

           The preceding analysis assumes that the cost of regulations is entirely paid by

employers. However, when the supply of labor is not perfectly elastic, part of the increase

in labor costs will be compensated by lower wages, reducing the disemployment effect of

the regulations. Alternatively, workers may not perceive the cost of regulation as a tax,

since higher contributions pay for improved job benefits, which are valued. In this case,

workers will be willing to pay for this benefit, reducing their wage demands. This wage

offset would also contribute to lessening the impact of regulations on employment.

           How likely is it that the costs of labor market regulations are shifted to workers in

Latin America? Before reviewing the existing evidence, it is important to note important

features of Latin American labor markets. First, high evasion implies that the relevant

labor supply to the formal sector in developing countries is likely to be more elastic than in

developed ones. Thus, if workers have access to similar jobs in both the formal and

informal sectors, the possibilities of shifting costs to workers are lessened, resulting in a

high elasticity of labor supply to formal sector firms that comply with regulations. Second,

as previously noted, in some countries minimum wages are quite high, both absolutely and

in relation to the average wage and this reduces the scope for wage shifts (see Figure 2).

Moreover, Maloney and Nuñez-Mendez (this volume) show piling up of workers at

minimum wage levels, suggests that compliance with the minimum wage is substantial

even in the so called “informal” sectors so that wage shifting will be attenuated in

countries with a binding minimum wage that also affects the informal sector. Third,

     Hamermesh reports a range between -0.15 and -0.75 and an average estimate of -0.45.

although most social security programs in the region are restricted to covered workers, and

this tightens the link between contributions and benefits, the dismal financial condition of

some social security systems and the high degree of discretion exercised by governments

over the determination of benefits weaken this link. In this respect, the recent social

security reforms aimed at privatizing pensions should strengthen the relationship between

benefits and costs in many countries of the region.

       Several empirical studies have attempted to measure the impact of mandatory

benefits on employment rates. Gruber (1994) analyzes the effects of insurance for

workplace injuries and mandated maternity benefits in the U.S. and finds that a large share

of the cost is shifted to wages with only minor disemployment effects. In contrast,

Kaestner (1996) examines the effect of unemployment insurance contributions on the

employment of U.S. youth and finds large disemployment effects and little wage shifting.

       For developing countries, there is some evidence on the magnitude of wage shifts

predating the studies collected in this volume. MacIsaac and Rama (1997) assess the

fungibility of the cost of mandated benefits in Ecuador. In 1994, the year they study,

Ecuador had one of the most cumbersome labor legislation regimes in Latin America.

Beyond mandated contributions to social security programs, the law also mandated

payment of thirteen, fourteen, fifteen and sixteen-month payments for separation at various

times of the same year. MacIsaac and Rama’s analysis suggests that while labor market

regulations increase labor costs, part of the increase is shifted to workers in the form of

lower base wages. Thus, for an average Ecuadorian worker, social security contributions

and other mandated benefits amount to at least 57 percent of the base wage. However,

workers whose employers comply with regulations earn on average only 18 percent more

than workers at non-compliant firms. This difference is explained by a 39 percent


                                              34
reduction in the base earnings of workers in compliant firms. Interestingly, these

reductions are not uniform across firms; they are smaller in larger firms and essentially

zero in the public sector and in unionized firms.

       Mondino and Montoya (this volume) and Edwards and Cox-Edwards (1999)

explore this topic for Argentina and Chile, respectively, by comparing wages of workers

who have access to social security programs with wages of uncovered workers. In

Argentina, Mondino and Montoya (this volume) find that during the period 1975-1996,

wages of non-covered workers were 8 percent higher than the gross wages of covered

workers. Considering that employee-paid payroll contributions average 40 percent of the

payroll, the share of contributions paid by workers is around 20 percent of total labor costs.

In Chile, Edwards and Cox-Edwards find evidence of a larger wage shift. In 1994, cash

wages for workers covered by mandatory pension, health, and life insurance were 14

percent lower than wages for non-covered workers. Since in that year, social security

contributions amounted to 20 percent of wages and were nominally paid by workers, their

estimates suggest that about 70 percent of the cost of social security contributions were

absorbed by workers, while the other 30 percent fell on employers. Gruber (1997) reports

evidence of an even larger wage shift in the aftermath of the 1981 pension reform in Chile.

The 1981 reform reduced employer-paid labor taxes and increased taxes paid by

employees. In addition, the funding of some programs was shifted to general revenue.

Using this tax change as a “natural experiment” and data on individual firms’ payments in

labor taxes and wages, he seeks to determine whether lower employer-paid labor taxes are




                                              35
associated with higher wages within a firm. His results suggest a full-shift of payroll taxes

to wages and no effect on employment.19

         Marrufo (2001) examines the 1997 reform in Mexico, which, as in Chile,

transformed the pay-as-you-go pension system into an individual retirement accounts

(IRA) system. She finds evidence of substantial employment reallocation between non-

covered and covered sectors suggesting that the labor supply to covered sectors is fairly

elastic. However, she also finds evidence of a wage shift in response to a reform that ties

benefits to taxes collected. Decomposing the effect of the reforms into the effect of a tax

reduction and the effect of tying benefits to contributions, she finds that increasing social

security taxes reduces wages by 43 percent of the tax increase, while increasing benefits

decreases wages by 57 percent of the value of benefits.

         An important factor determining the extent of wage pass-through is whether

minimum wages bind. Maloney and Nuñez-Mendez (this volume) document that the

minimum wage binds in Colombia. This explains the weak pass-through effects reported

by Cardenas and Bernal (this volume) for Colombia. At the same time, the minimum wage

is less binding, and pass-through effects may be more substantial, in Mexico and Chile,

and this may explain the Marrufo and Gruber results.

         All in all, the available evidence suggests that at least part of the cost of non-wage

benefits is passed on to workers in the form of lower wages, and therefore, the employment

19
   Measuring the impact of such an “experiment” is complicated by many factors. (See the discussion in
Edwards and Cox-Edwards, 2000). First, although payroll taxes declined, worker contributions increased. If
measured wage payments by firms include employee contributions, then a decline in employer-paid taxes
will be associated with higher measured wages due to higher employee-paid contributions. Second,
measurement error in wages biases his estimates toward finding full shifting, as he reports. The quality of his
instruments is questionable and he is forced to make strong assumptions to circumvent a severe measurement
error problem. Third, at a time when social security reform made work benefits more attractive, he estimates
that wages were rising. The only way that wages can rise to match the decreased employer taxes in an
environment with an improved link between employee contributions and benefits is if labor supply is
perfectly inelastic to covered sector firms, which seems implausible.


                                                      36
cost of such programs will be lower than what is predicted by the elasticity of the labor

demand. Combining wage-shift and labor demand estimates indicates that a 10 percent

increase in non-wage labor costs can lead to a decline in employment rates ranging

between .6 and 4.8 percent with most of the evidence shaded toward the high end of this

spectrum.

       Given the significance of these estimates for policy decisions, it is important to

estimate them as accurately as possible. In this regard, the room for improvement in the

literature is still large. As they stand, they might overestimate or underestimate the true

employment impact depending on which of the following two effects dominates. On the

one hand, the reported estimates are based on constant-output labor demand elasticities,

which do not consider the employment effects of regulations through a negative effect on

the scale of production of existing firms and on entry and exit decisions of firms. From this

perspective, the reported range of estimates provides a lower bound on the disemployment

effects of regulation. Moreover, the estimates of the wage shift in MacIsaac and Rama

(1997), Mondino and Montoya (this volume) and Edwards and Cox-Edwards (1999) only

include the cost of social security programs, but do not include the cost of other regulations

such as job security or vacation time. Once the cost of these regulations is taken into

account, the computed wage shift could be lower than what we report above, and,

therefore, the estimated effects of those costs on employment would be larger.

       On the other hand, studies comparing wages of covered and non-covered workers

performed using a cross-section of workers, such as most of the ones discussed above, may

underestimate wage shifts and overestimate employment costs. It is necessary to model

selection into covered sectors. This is because unobserved personal characteristics




                                              37
correlated with social security affiliation might explain higher wages in covered sectors.20

If this correlation is substantial, it will lead to an underestimation of wage differences

between covered and uncovered workers, and hence reduce estimates of the fraction of

wage costs shifted to workers. This concern highlights the importance of the Marrufo study

because she controls for sectoral self-selection bias and still finds substantial evidence of

wage shifting. If her selection adjustments to the Mexican data are typical of what would

be found in other Latin American countries, the weight of the evidence in this book and the

literature on firm entry in response to incentives, suggest that the studies reported in this

volume underestimate the disemployment effects of regulation.



4.2 Job Security Provisions Alter Hiring and Firing Decisions

        Regulations affecting transition costs are not adequately analyzed within a simple

static labor-demand labor-supply framework. Dismissal costs and other regulations not

only increase labor costs, but also alter firms’ firing and hiring decisions. The importance

of dismissal costs in Latin America is clearly shown in Figure 5. Whereas non-wage labor

costs are low relative to those of OECD countries, dismissal costs tend to be very high.

These costs make Latin American labor markets less flexible than OECD markets and

likely impair productivity and adaptation to new technology and trade patterns as they do

in Europe (see Heckman, 2003). It is thus important to assess the impact, if any, that such

policies have on the functioning of the labor market.



Theoretical Discussion

20
  For instance, if workers covered by social security programs also happen to be more productive, then they
will also have higher wages. Yet, higher wages are explained by unobserved productivity and not by social
security affiliation.


                                                    38
        To analyze the full impact of job security provisions requires a more complex

framework that encompasses dynamic decisions of firms. Bertola (1990) and Bentolila and

Bertola (1990) develop dynamic partial-equilibrium models to assess how a firm’s firing

and hiring decisions are affected by dismissal costs. In the face of a given shock, the

optimal employment policy of a firm involves one of three state-contingent responses: (i)

dismissing workers, (ii) hiring workers or (iii) doing nothing. Appendix B presents a

simple two period model of labor adjustment that summarizes the main ideas in this

literature.

         In the face of a negative shock and declining marginal value of labor, a firm might

want to dismiss some workers. However, it faces a dismissal cost in most regulatory

regimes in LAC. This cost has the effect of discouraging firms from adjusting their labor

force, resulting in fewer dismissals than the number of dismissals that would occur in a

scenario in the absence of such costs. Conversely, in the face of a positive shock, firms

might want to hire additional workers but would take into account that it would be costly

for some workers to be fired if future demand declined. This potential cost acts as a hiring

cost, effectively reducing the creation of new jobs in a relatively healthy economy. The

net result is lower employment rates in expansions, higher employment rates in recessions

and lower turnover rates as firms hire and fire fewer workers than they would in the

absence of adjustment costs.

        Adjustment costs produce a decline in employment variability associated with

firing costs. The implication of these models for average employment is ambiguous. In

particular, whether average employment rates increase or decline as a result of firing costs

depends on whether over the cycle the decline in hiring rates more than compensates for

the reduction in dismissals. Simulations reported in Bertola (1990) and Bentolila and


                                              39
Bertola (1990) suggest that average employment in a given firm is likely to increase when

firing costs increase. However, these results are quite sensitive to different assumptions

about the persistence of shocks, the elasticity of the labor demand, the magnitude of the

discount rate, and the functional form of the production function. Less persistent shocks

and lower discount rates produce larger negative effects of job security on employment

because both factors reduce hiring relative to firing (Bertola, 1992; Bentolila and Saint

Paul, 1994). Furthermore, a higher elasticity of the demand for goods implies a larger

negative effect of job security on employment rates. In addition, when investment

decisions are also considered, firing costs lower profits and discourage investment,

increasing the likelihood that they reduce the demand for labor (Risager and Sorensen,

1997).

         The Bertola (1990) and Bertola and Bentolila (1990) analyses focus on

employment rates in a “representative” firm without considering the impact of firing costs

on the extensive margin, that is, on how firing costs affect the creation and destruction of

firms. Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) develop a general equilibrium model based on the

U.S. economy. The partial equilibrium framework of Bertola (1990) is embedded in their

model as part of a general equilibrium framework in which jobs and firms are created and

destroyed in every period in response to firm-specific shocks. In the context of their model,

Hopenhayn and Rogerson find that increasing firing costs in the U.S. would lead to an

increase in the average employment of existing firms as a consequence of the reduction in

firings. However, they also find that such a policy would result in lower firm entry, and

lower job creation in newly created firms. These final two effects could potentially offset

the increase in employment in existing firms, and they would thus reduce overall

employment rates.


                                              40
       The recent literature has also emphasized the possible impact of job security

regulations on the composition of employment. Kugler (this volume) proposes a model in

which job security regulations provide incentives for high turnover firms to operate in the

informal sector. This decision would entail producing at a small, less efficient scale in

order to remain inconspicuous to tax and labor authorities. In this framework, high job

security costs paid by formal sector firms would likely increase informality rates. Pagés

and Montenegro (1999) develop a model in which job security provisions, which depend

on tenure, bias employment against young workers and in favor of older ones. As

severance pay increases with tenure, and tenure tends to increase with age, older workers

become more costly to dismiss than younger ones. If wages do not adjust appropriately,

negative shocks result in a disproportionate share of layoffs among young workers.

Therefore, job security based on tenure results in lower employment rates for the young

relative to older workers because it reduces hiring and increases layoffs for young workers.

This effect has also been found in studies of European employment. (Heckman, 2003).

       Finally, it is important to understand that not all components of dismissal costs may

have the same effect on employment and unemployment rates. Thus, in principle, there is

an important conceptual distinction between advance notice and indemnities, which are

state-contingent and affect the cost of adjustment to different states, and seniority pay

provisions, which are paid in all states and do not affect transitions. The latter are more

comparable to other non-wage costs such as vacation and other mandatory benefits.

       The existing evidence regarding the impact of employment protection is abundant

but inconclusive. Table 5 from Addison and Teixeira (2001) summarizes the current

literature. While, Addison and Grosso (1996), Grubb and Wells (1993), Lazear (1990),

Heckman and Pagés (2000), Nickell (1997) and Nicoletti and Scarpetta (2001) find a


                                              41
negative relationship between job security provisions and employment, other studies, such

as Addison, Teixeira and Grosso (2000), OECD, (1999), Garibaldi and Mauro (1999) and

Freeman (2001) do not find evidence of such a relationship. The evidence on the effects of

job security on unemployment is equally ambiguous. Some studies find a positive link

between job security and unemployment (Elmeskov, et al., 1998; Lazear, 1990; and

Addison and Grosso, 1996) while others find no effect (Blanchard, 1998; Heckman and

Pagés, 2000; Nickell, 1997). Our own estimates at the end of this chapter give reasons for

these mixed findings. All these studies are based on the analysis of aggregates of cross-

country time-series data with little variation in regulatory policies. The studies presented in

this volume surmount some of these difficulties by studying episodes of major labor

reform using large micro data sets. Using disaggregated data for single countries,

Mondino and Montoya (this volume) and Saavedra and Torero (this volume) find a large

negative relationship between employment protection and employment. The studies

presented in this volume contribute substantially to a literature that analyzes the

consequences of reforms. Recent studies for OECD countries using disaggregated data

suggest a negative effect of job security regulations on employment. Autor et al. (2003)

estimate the effects of recent common law wrongful discharge doctrines adopted by courts

across states in the U.S that limit employment at will. They find that the wrongful

discharge doctrine has a negative impact on employment to population rates in state labor

markets. Similarly, Kugler et al (2002) find that in Spain a combination of a reduction in

payroll taxes and the reduction of dismissal costs increased the employment of workers on

permanent contracts. Finally, Acemoglu and Angrist (2001), replicating the earlier work of

Deleire (2000), examine the effects of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which

outlaws discrimination against the disabled in hiring, firing and pay on the employment


                                              42
rate of workers with disabilities. Their findings and prior work by Deleire suggest that the

passage of the Act reduced employment for disabled workers.



Empirical Evidence for Latin America and the Caribbean

        The essays assembled in this volume assess the impact of job security regulation on

employment and turnover rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, and provide the first

systematic evidence of its impact on the labor market. Several studies assess the impact of

job security on turnover rates in the labor market. Changes in turnover are measured using

changes in the duration of jobs (tenure), the duration of unemployment and rates of exiting

out of employment and unemployment.21 Higher employment exit rates indicate more

layoffs (or more quits), while higher exit rates out of unemployment and into formal jobs

indicate higher job creation in the formal sector. Other studies examine the impact of job

security on employment rates. The definition of employment used in the empirical studies

varies depending on the country being analyzed. In general, most studies focus on

employment in large firms, although some also examine more aggregated measures of

employment. In addition, a small group of studies also examine the impact of job security

on the composition of employment. See Table 6 for an overview of the empirical evidence

for Latin America and the Caribbean presented in this volume.



Turnover Rates

        As predicted by most theoretical models, the bulk of empirical evidence reported in

this volume confirms that less stringent job security tends to be associated with higher

21
   These studies estimate hazard rates. The hazard rate is defined as the rate at which a given spell of
employment or unemployment ends in a given period conditional on having lasted a given period of time in
the spell (e.g., one month, one year).


                                                  43
turnover and greater flexibility in the labor market. Kugler (this volume) analyzes the

impact of the 1990 labor market reforms in Colombia. She finds that a reduction in job

security costs reduces average tenure and increases employment exit rates.22 This decline is

significantly larger in the formal sector, which is covered by the regulations, than in the

uncovered or informal sector. In addition, the increase is greater in large firms than in the

smallest ones. Her results show similar patterns within tradable and non-tradable sectors,

providing a clear indication that the decline in tenure cannot be attributed to contemporary

trade reforms. The increasing use of temporary contracts explains only part of the increase

in formal turnover rates since job stability also declined for workers employed at

permanent jobs.23

         Kugler also finds a decline in the average duration of unemployment after the

reforms. In addition, exit rates out of unemployment increase more for workers who leave

unemployment by going into the formal sector than they do for those who exit into

informal jobs. As with average tenure, her results show quite similar patterns across

sectors and a higher exit rate toward larger firms. Finally, only two-thirds of the increase in

the rate of entry into unemployment can be attributed to higher use of temporary contracts.

The rest is explained by increased exit rates into permanent jobs in the formal sector.

         Saavedra and Torero (this volume) conduct a similar study, evaluating the impact

of the 1991 reform in Peru. Like the reform in Colombia, the 1991 Peruvian reform

considerably reduced the cost of dismissing workers. Their analysis shows a consistent

decline in average tenure from 1991 onward, suggesting higher exit rates from

22
  In this study tenure is measured by the duration of incomplete employment spells.
23
  In her study, Kugler performs two types of analyses. First, she uses a difference-in-difference estimator to
analyze whether changes in average duration of employment (unemployment) are significantly different in
the formal and informal sectors. Second, she estimates an exponential duration model to control for changes
in demographic covariates, pooling data from before and after the reform and using interaction terms to
assess the differential impact on the formal and informal sectors.

                                                     44
employment. As in the Kugler study, the decline is significantly more pronounced in the

formal sector than it is in the informal sector. In addition, the tenure patterns were quite

similar across economic sectors, suggesting that these findings cannot be explained by the

trade reforms that took place in the early nineties.

       In contrast to these findings, Paes de Barros and Corseuil (this volume) find little

evidence that the substantial 1988 Brazilian Constitutional reform altered employment exit

rates. In that year, the cost of dismissing workers was raised, and therefore a reduction in

exit rates would be expected as a result. (Many other reforms were also put in place as

well.) Their results indicate that aggregate employment exit rates decline in the formal

sector relative to the informal sector for short employment spells (two years or less), but

increase for longer spells. Their measured increase in exit rates for long spells could be

driven by the special characteristics of the Brazilian system. In this system, employers

contribute 8 percent of a worker’s wage to the worker’s individual account. In case of

voluntary dismissal, the worker can claim the principal, the compounded interest rate and a

penalty paid by the firm, which in the 1988 reform was raised from 10 percent to 40

percent of principal plus interest. In the case of a voluntary quit, the worker receives

nothing. This asymmetry in the treatment of termination induces workers to force dismissal

or to collude with firms to obtain the funds accumulated in the account. It can be argued

that the 1988 reform greatly increased the incentives to force dismissals, particularly for

workers with longer tenures. This may explain the increase in exit rates for workers with

longer employment spells.

       These three studies use the informal sector as a control group unaffected by the

reforms. Their credibility hinges on the validity of this assumption. Kugler shows that

estimates based on formal-informal sector comparisons are likely to be biased. However,


                                              45
such comparisons are still valid under certain conditions – at least as tests of the null

hypothesis of no effect of the reform.24 When viewed as a whole, these studies provide

evidence that dismissal costs and other employment protection mechanisms reduce worker

reallocation in the labor market. Unfortunately, these studies do not identify whether

reduced worker reallocation is due to reduced layoffs, lower quits or a mix of both.

         Some studies in this book assess the impact of regulations on the speed of

adjustment using the length of the lag (the speed of adjustment) as an alternative measure

of the constraints faced by firms. The intuition supporting this is based on the original

work of Holt, Modigliani, Muth and Simon (1960).

         Let nt* be the optimal level of employment at date t determined by some implicit

(usually static) theory. Let the cost of being out of equilibrium ct0 be quadratic in

deviations of current employment from optimal employment:

(2)                                  ct0 = γ 0 (nt* − nt )2        γ 0 > 0.

The greater the discrepancy between employment at t and optimal employment, the greater

the cost. There is also a cost of adjustment cta , which is also assumed to be quadratic in the

adjustment from nt −1 to nt :

(3)                                  cta = γ a (nt − nt −1 ) 2 .

Minimizing the sum of these costs produces an optimal labor demand nt

24
   Kugler shows that lower severance pay may induce high-turnover informal firms to move to the formal
sector. Assuming either no overlap in the distribution of turnover between covered and uncovered firms, or
that entry to the covered sector comes from the high-end –or at least from the end that is higher than the
formal sector, this shift results in higher turnover in both the formal and the informal sector. Higher turnover
in the informal sector biases the difference-in-difference estimator downward. Therefore, a positive estimate
still provides substantial evidence of increased turnover in the formal sector.

where

        γa
λ=            .
     γa +γ0

The greater the cost of adjustment, the bigger the value of λ. Abraham and Houseman

(1993) and many others use this method to assess the effect of different regulatory regimes

across countries on adjustment costs while others interact λ with measures of regulations to

assess whether the speed of adjustment increases or declines when the regulatory

environment is changed. Cardenas and Bernal (this volume), Paes de Barros and Corseuil

(this volume) and Saavedra and Torero (this volume) use this methodology to examine

whether the speed of adjustment increased or declined after labor reforms. In the study of

Saavedra and Torero, their estimated interaction term suggests that more stringent

regulations reduce the speed of adjustment, particularly in the pre-reform period, when

regulation was very stringent. In the other two studies, this methodology is unable to

identify any changes in adjustment due to reforms. This is particularly relevant in the

study of Cárdenas and Bernal on Colombia since other methodologies based on duration

data (Kugler, this volume) show clear effects of regulation on adjustment. Addison and

Teixeira (2001) indicate that “none of the implementations of this (adjustment cost) model

in core OECD countries were able to detect a discernible impact of job security regulations

on the speed of employment adjustment”. In the concluding section of this paper, we

discuss why the lag coefficient is not a reliable measure of the regulatory costs, especially

when applied to cross country data.

Average Employment


                                              47
         The available evidence for LAC countries shows a consistent, although not always

statistically significant, negative impact of JS provisions on average employment rates.

Saavedra and Torero (this volume) and Mondino and Montoya (this volume) use firm-level

panel data to estimate the impact of job security on employment in Peru and Argentina,

respectively. Both studies estimate labor demand equations in which an explicit measure

of job security appears on the right hand side of the equation, and both find evidence that

higher job security levels are associated with lower employment rates.25 In the case of

Peru, Saavedra and Torero find that the size of the impact of regulations is correlated with

the magnitude of the regulations themselves. Thus, the impact is very high at the beginning

of their sample (1987-1990), coinciding with a period of very high dismissal costs (see

their Table 4). Afterward, and coinciding with a period of deregulation, the magnitude of

the estimated coefficient declines after a new increase in dismissal costs, only to increase

again from 1995 onward. Their estimates for the long-run elasticities of severance pay are

very large (in absolute value). Between 1987 and 1990 a 10 percent increase in dismissal

costs is estimated to reduce long-run employment rates by 11 percent, keeping wages

constant. In subsequent periods, the size of the effect becomes smaller but is still quite

large in magnitude (between 3 and 6 percent). In Argentina, the estimated long-run

elasticity of a 10 percent increase in dismissal costs is also between 3 and 6 percent. 26

   The data for the Peruvian study covers firms with more than 10 employees in all sectors of the economy.
The Argentinean study only covers manufacturing firms. Given the nature of these surveys, these studies
analyze formal employment rather than employment as a whole. The data used in these two studies does not
capture job creation by new firms, since both panels are based on a given balanced panel census of firms,
which does not adjust for attrition.
26
   The methodology used by these studies might lead to upward biased estimates of the elasticity of
employment to job security. Thus, for example, Mondino and Montoya construct explicit measures of job
security based on:
                                      JSjt= δj TjtPjt SPjt
Where δj is the average layoff rate in sector j, Tjt is average tenure in sector j, for a time period t, Pjt is the
share of firms in sector j, time period t that are covered by regulations and SPjt is the mandatory severance
pay in sector j, given average tenure Tjt . This measure provides variability across sectors and periods, and
therefore it yields a more precise estimation of the impact of job security than before-after types of

                                                        48
        Kugler (this volume) computes the net impact of the Colombian 1991 labor reform

on unemployment rates. Using unemployment and employment exit rate estimates before

and after the reform, she finds that the reforms cause a decline in unemployment between

1.3 and 1.7 percentage points. Thus, as in Mondino and Montoya (this volume) and

Saavedra and Torero (this volume), Kugler’s estimates of the impact of deregulation

indicate that the positive impact of reduced labor costs on hiring outweighs the negative

impact of reduced severance costs on firing, resulting in a decline in unemployment rates.

        Heckman and Pagés’ (2000) analysis of cross section-time series aggregates also

finds evidence of a negative impact of employment protection on employment. However,

the evidence presented at the end of this chapter suggests that their results for Latin

America are not robust although their results for OECD Europe are robust. The fragility of

their estimates for Latin America based on aggregate data suggests the value of using more

disaggregated data in reaching sharp conclusions.

        Other studies find negative, but statistically less precisely estimated, effects of job

security on average employment rates. Pagés and Montenegro (1999) find that JS has a

negative but statistically insignificant effect on overall wage-employment rates in Chile.

Similarly, Marquez (1998), using a cross-section sample of Latin American and OECD

countries, finds a negative but insignificant coefficient of job security on aggregate

employment rates. Table 6 summarizes the various estimates of job security on

employment.

        Downes et al (this volume) also use aggregate time series data to examine changes

in the labor demand associated with changes in the regulatory framework in three


comparisons. Yet, such a measure may also be correlated with the error term in a labor demand equation
since both layoffs and the tenure structure of a firm might be correlated with its employment level. However,

Caribbean countries. Their inconclusive results are typical of an entire literature. They use

an indicator variable that measures periods with more or less stringent regulations. Their

estimates do not capture changes in labor demand before and after the reform. However, as

in the case in most of the OECD-based literature, their sample variation in regulations and

institutions may be too limited and the level of aggregation too great to capture any effects

of regulation on employment.



The Composition of Employment

        Economists have paid relatively more attention to studying the effects of job

security on the level of employment and unemployment than to studying the effects of

such policies on the distribution of jobs. However, a few studies shed some light on the

impact of job security on the composition of employment in LAC. Marquez (1998)

constructs a ranking of the relative severity of labor market regulations (including

workweek, contract and other regulations besides job security provisions) for LAC and

OECD countries and uses it to estimate the effects of JS on the formal/informal

distribution of employment. He finds that across countries more stringent regulations

coincide with a larger percentage of self-employed workers. In a study of Chile,

Montenegro and Pagés (this volume) use repeated cross-section micro-data spanning forty

years of data and substantial variation in labor market policies. They control for year

effects that are common across workers, as well as for the differential effects of the

business cycle, and other labor market policies on each demographic group. They find that

more stringent job security measures reduce the employment rates of youth and the

unskilled, while increasing the employment rates of older and skilled workers. Their


robustness analyses reported in Mondino and Montoya suggest that not considering some of this variability

                                                   50
results also suggest that job security regulations increase the self employment of women

and unskilled workers, relative to other demographic groups. This evidence is consistent

with evidence in Bertola (2001) and Heckman (2003) that job security provisions protect

the relatively privileged workers at the expense of the less advantaged ones. In a review of

the recent OECD literature, relying on cross-country, time-series analysis, Addison and

Teixeira (2001) reach similar conclusions stating that while prime-age male employment

rates have not been affected by job security provisions, the employment rates of other

groups, most notably younger workers, have been affected.



4.3 Temporary Contracts

         Hopenhayn (this volume) discusses the impact of temporary contracts on the

Argentine labor market. Such contracts were introduced following the Spanish model. He

finds that these contracts induce an increase in hiring and a substitution away from long-

term employment toward short-term employment. So, in the short-run, these contracts

remove one barrier from the labor market and make it more fluid. At the same time, they

tend to promote turnover. Hopenhayn finds that the average hazard rate for the first three

months out of employment increased by 30 percent and for tenure above three months by

10 percent. While temporary contracts promote fluidity, they reduce firm attachment and

the incentive of firms to invest in workers. Alonso-Borrego and Aguirregabiria (1999)

document that in Spanish labor markets, the effect of temporary contracts is to reduce

investment in workers and hence to produce lower quality (less skilled) workers in the long

run.




still produces positive and statistically significant estimates for the coefficient of the job security measure.

                                                        51
4.4 Minimum Wages

       Maloney and Nuñez-Mendez (this volume) present novel estimates of the impact of

minimum wages on wage distributions and employment. Their evidence demonstrates

convincingly that minimum wages are binding in most Latin American countries and have

substantial effects on employment and wage distributions. An important finding in their

analysis is that both covered and uncovered sectors (“formal” and “informal” sectors)

respond in similar fashion to wage minimums. The informal sector does not show the

downward wage flexibility that traditional models of labor market dualism predict.

Another important finding is that minimum wages percolate much more widely across

wage distributions in Latin America than they do in the U.S. There are substantial effects

of minimum wages on wages far up in the distribution of wages. Their study puts to rest

the claim that minimum wages are innocuous, even in countries with large “informal”

sectors.

       Montenegro and Pagés (this volume) study the effects of minimum wages on the

distribution of employment in Chile. They find that, like job security provisions, minimum

wages reduce the employment probabilities of the young and the unskilled relative to older

and more skilled workers. Not surprisingly, as suggested in other studies for developed

countries, their results indicate that minimum wages are particularly binding for young

unskilled workers. However, their results also indicate an adverse effect of the minimum

wage on prime-age unskilled workers. Minimum wages adversely affect disadvantaged

workers of all ages.

       We next turn to a pooled time series cross-country study of the impact of regulation

on employment. The fragility and sensitivity of the estimates for the Latin American

region that we find highlight the benefits of the microdata analysis reported in this volume.


                                             52
5. Evidence from A Cross-Section Time-Series Sample of LAC and OECD Countries

       In this section, we summarize and expand on some of the main results of our recent

work, updating our earlier paper (Heckman and Pages, 2000). We use time series of cross-

sections of countries and we exploit the substantial variability in labor laws in Latin

America to estimate their effects on employment and unemployment. These studies serve

to place the essays in this volume within the broader context of a literature that almost

exclusively focuses on time series of cross section averages of countries. Unfortunately,

few empirical regularities emerge when an honest sensitivity analysis is conducted.

Nonetheless a few robust regularities do appear. Payroll taxes reduce employment and

(less robustly) in OECD countries, job security regulation reduces employment.



The Data

   Labor market studies focusing on developing countries are hampered by serious data

problems. Thus, labor market variables contained in most cross-country databases suffer

from a lack of comparability and reliability. To overcome these problems, we construct a

new data set that includes OECD and LAC countries. For OECD countries, we collect

employment and unemployment data from the OECD statistics. For the Latin American

sample, we directly construct the same indicators out of a large set of Latin American

Household Surveys. See Appendix A for a more detailed description of the employment

and unemployment variables as well as the countries and years used to obtain the LAC

data. Population variables are obtained from the UN Population database while GDP

measures are from the World Bank Development Indicators. To characterize labor market




                                              53
regulations we use the set of measures summarized in Table 4, but defined for each year

and country.

   Our joint sample collects more than 400 data points from 38 countries; 23 in the OECD

and 15 in LA. (Mexico is included in the Latin America sample although it belongs to the

OECD). We analyze country means and do not disaggregate further. The sample is an

unbalanced panel covering the period 1983-1999. Table 7 reports summary statistics of our

data for both our whole sample and for the sub-regional ones. There are large differences

between the OECD and the LAC samples. GDP per capita measures tend to be

substantially lower in the LAC than in the OECD region. Conversely, GDP growth is

lower in the latter. Indemnities for dismissal and seniority pay are higher in Latin America

than in OECD countries while advance notice provisions and social security contributions

are lower. There are important differences in labor market aggregates as well. On average,

employment rates are higher in the LAC region than in OECD countries. The reverse is

true for unemployment rates. The LAC region also displays a lower percentage of the

working age population in the 25 to 54 and the 55 to 65 years old brackets than OECD

countries and a higher share of the population in the 15 to 24 years age group. By

constructing our own data set from individual household-level surveys, we are guaranteed

that all of the labor market variables are comparable and reliable. One drawback of our

data is that for the LAC sample, we only have a few time series observations per country

(usually six or seven), and not necessarily from consecutive years.

       Our objective is to relate our measures of regulations to employment and

unemployment outcomes. Although we perform multivariate analyses, it is interesting to

examine the bivariate relationship between regulations and employment. This is

particularly easy for regulations such as job security provisions that, within our sample,


                                             54
change at most once or twice per country. In figures 8 and 9, we graph employment before

and after reforms for countries that experienced job security reforms. The graphs for LAC

should be interpreted with caution because they have been interpolated from incomplete

time series data.

       There is little evidence that reforms that reduced job security increased

employment rates in Colombia. There is also not much evidence that reforms that

increased job security had a deleterious effect on employment in Brazil, Chile or

Nicaragua. However, there is some evidence indicating that reforms that liberalized labor

markets in Peru increased employment rates, while reforms that increased labor market

rigidities reduced employment. For Germany, our data suggest that employment declined

at a slower rate after a reform that increased job security, while in Spain and UK the

opposite seems to be true after liberalization. These figures suggest that periods of less

stringent job security regulations coincide with higher employment rates in some countries,

while the reverse is also true in other countries. The data presented in these figures,

however, fail to control for contemporaneous changes in economic activity or other factors

that could be correlated with employment and labor reforms. In the next section, we

perform an empirical analysis in an attempt to control for contemporaneous effects that

may be correlated with reforms, employment and unemployment outcomes.



Methodology and Results

       To relate labor market regulations to employment and unemployment outcomes, we

estimate the following model:

                       Yit = α i + β1 X it + β 2 git + β 3GDPPCit + β 4 Z it + ε it




                                                 55
where Yit is a labor market variable (employment or unemployment) of country i at period

t, αi denotes a country fixed effect, Xit denotes a vector of employment regulation

variables, git, and GDPPCit denote GDP growth and (log of) GDP per capita, respectively,

Zit is a vector of demographic controls and ε it is a mean zero error.

         Given the nature of the data with incomplete gaps, we decided not to average

observations from a given period to control for business cycle effects, as is often done in

OECD studies. Instead, we control for the state of the business cycle in a given year using

GDP growth27. Although a large part of our variation is cross-sectional, we use fixed

effects estimates to control for unobserved variables that may be correlated with measures

of regulation across countries. In addition, we control for demographic changes that may

be correlated with employment and unemployment rates as well as regulatory variables

that change over time. Finally, we use GDP per capita (adjusted by PPP) to control for

differences in levels of country economic activity across years.28 We estimate a reduced

form model to investigate whether periods of high non-wage labor costs stemming from

advance notice, indemnities for dismissal, severance pay or social security contributions

are associated with lower employment or higher unemployment rates. We thus estimate an

average net effect of labor laws as they operate through intermediate variables, which we

do not include in the regression. We do not estimate a theoretically more appropriate state-

contingent labor demand specification because we lack the information on the firm-

specific state of the product market confronting individual firms. Therefore, we only

attempt to identify the effect of labor laws through their effect on expected (across labor

27
   GDP growth is obtained from the World Bank Development indicators. It turns out that deleting or
including this variable has no important effect on our empirical conclusions. Deleting or including GDP per
capita (PPP adjusted) does not alter our results, either.




                                                    56
market states) labor cost. This is a severe limitation. However, what we offer is an

improvement over the existing literature on cross-country time series that does not quantify

labor costs. Appendix B discusses conceptually more appropriate specifications of labor

demand functions.

        Table 8A displays our estimates for employment in the overall and regional

samples. In these and subsequent results, we compute standard errors that are robust to

heteroscedasticity. Throughout this analysis, we extend social security data to yearly

frequencies since this information is only available biannually. We do so either by

interpolating or by inputting each missing data values with the value from the former year.

The results of our empirical analysis are robust across methods. The results do not vary

either when we consider only the original biennial data. However, in this case, the number

of available observations drops substantially.

        The coefficients on GDP growth have the expected positive signs and are

statistically significant for the overall sample. The coefficients on the demographic

variables are positive, suggesting that countries with larger percentages of their working

age population above age 25 tend to have higher employment rates. However, none of the

coefficients on the demographic variables are statistically significant at conventional

levels. A higher GDP per capita tends to coincide with higher employment to population

rates. However, this estimated effect is not precisely determined.

        Our main interest is on measuring the effect of the labor market regulations. We

find that once we expand our sample to include a larger number of OECD and LAC

countries, the strong negative effect on employment of indemnities for dismissal reported

28
  We control for GDP growth and GDP per capita (PPP adjusted) because we have few data points per
country and they are not necessarily contiguous, so we cannot use the simple averaging method employed in
OECD studies to control for business cycle effects.


                                                   57
for the pooled sample in Heckman and Pagés (2000) disappears. This is somewhat

surprising because not only do we expand the set of countries and periods for which we

can construct the measure, but we also revise some of the variables used in our previous

analysis to more accurately model the laws. We still estimate a negative, statistically

significant, coefficient for indemnities in the OECD specification and this is an important

contribution to the European debate on the impact of regulations. This evidence suggests a

significant lack of robustness of the estimated effect of regulations that we explore in

detail.

          With regard to the rest of the regulations, we find a positive although not

statistically significant coefficient on advance notice cost both in the joint and in the sub-

regional samples. Since seniority pay regulations only exist in Latin America, we cannot

identify the impact of these regulations in the OECD sample. However, we find positive

coefficients for this variable both in the LAC and in the pooled sample. Moreover, the

coefficient in the joint sample is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The

estimated coefficient suggests that an increase in payments equivalent to one month’s pay

(in expected present value) increases employment rates by 1.12 percentage points. One

might argue that the strong association between contributions and benefits associated with

these types of schemes contributes to an expansion of labor supply increasing overall

employment rates. However, the coefficients on advance notice and on indemnities are also

positive. In contrast to these results, our estimates suggest a negative effect of social

security contributions on employment both in the joint and the sub-regional samples.

(Recall this is the total contribution of employers and workers). This effect is statistically

significant. According to our estimates, a reduction in the social security contributions

from the OECD to the LAC average (see Table 4) would increase employment by 3.25


                                                58
percentage points for the coefficients from the joint sample or by 4.26 points if the OECD

coefficient is used (table 8a, columns (1) and (6), respectively).

         Since there is substantial correlation among our measures of labor market

regulation, we also estimate specifications that include these measures one at a time.29 The

number of observations used in each regression varies because there are countries for

which we do not have information for all the regulation measures. The results are

unchanged if we restrict all regressions to have the same observations than the ones used in

column (1). Adding the regulation measures separately tends to produce smaller

coefficients for each of them, suggesting that there are important complementarities that

are not captured by the one-at-a-time specifications. We strongly reject the hypothesis that

the four measures are not jointly significant (last row, Table 8A) and therefore include

them together in the remaining analysis.

         Table 8B presents the estimates for unemployment. As for employment,

indemnities for dismissal have a strong positive effect on unemployment in the OECD

sample but no effect in the Latin America or the joint sample. The coefficient on advance

notice is negative in the overall and OECD samples, but not in the LAC sample. However

the coefficient is not statistically significant in any sample. The coefficient on seniority pay

is also positive, suggesting that these schemes increase labor supply. However, the

coefficient is not statistically significant. Finally, and consistent with our results on

employment, we find that higher social security contributions are associated with higher

levels of unemployment in the three samples considered. Our point estimates suggest that

reducing social security contributions from the OECD to the LAC average reduces

29
  The correlation coefficient between advance notice, indemnities for dismissal and seniority pay is between
.15 and .21 (in absolute value) and statistically significant. Social security contributions are positively and



                                                      59
unemployment by 2.54 percentage points if we use the estimate for the joint sample or 3.11

points if we use the OECD one. As with the case of employment, adding the regulatory

measures one-at-a-time produces smaller coefficients for each of the measures. As before,

we reject the hypothesis that the coefficients of the four variables are jointly equal to zero,

and therefore we will include them in the rest of the unemployment analysis.

         Our results in Tables 8A-8B suggest that not all regulations have the same effect on

employment and unemployment rates. Since all regulations are measured in multiples of

monthly wages we can compare the coefficients of the four regulations studied and assess

whether they have similar effects. In Table 9 we report the results of testing the hypothesis

of equality of coefficients. We reject the null hypothesis of identical coefficients for the

four measures in the employment, but not the unemployment, specifications. Interestingly,

we are also able to reject the hypothesis that social security payments exert the same effect

on employment as seniority pay, despite the fact that both variables imply mandatory

contributions defined as fraction of wages. Perhaps because contributions to finance

seniority pay are capitalized in individual accounts, the link between contributions and

payments is strengthened, and this reduces or eliminates the “tax” effect. Instead, our

results suggest that social security contributions tend to be perceived as taxes on labor and

therefore reduce the demand of labor above and beyond a possible reduction in the supply

of labor. Moreover, we reject the hypothesis that indemnities for dismissal and seniority

pay have the same coefficient or that all components of job security (advance notice,

indemnities for dismissal and seniority pay) have the same coefficient. When we impose

this (incorrect) constraint on the data, we obtain a positive and statistically significant


significantly correlated with advance notice, but the correlation with the other measures is close to zero and
not statistically significant.



                                                     60
coefficient, while the coefficient on social security regulations remains negative and

statistically significant.

        Finally, although we reject the hypothesis that all four regulations have the same

effect on employment, imposing this constraint yields a negative, statistically significant

coefficient on employment and a positive, statistically significant coefficient on

unemployment. Moreover, the size of the coefficients is very similar to the ones reported

in Table 8.A and 8.B for social security. This is not surprising, since social security

regulations constitute the lion’s share of the total cost of regulations.

        In summary, our results suggest that not all regulations have the same effect on

employment rates. Thus, while social security contributions are negatively associated with

employment (and positively associated with unemployment), the effect of job security

measures on employment is ambiguous. While in the joint and LAC samples, advance

notice and indemnities for dismissal have positive, although not statistically significant

coefficients, the coefficient on indemnities in the OECD sample is negative and

statistically significant at conventional levels. Seniority pay is positively associated with

employment and the coefficients on this variable are statistically significant in most

specifications. We also reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on seniority pay and the

coefficients on the rest of the components of job security are the same. These differences

in results across regions, specifications and samples, relative to our previous work, suggest

a lack of robustness that we further explore. Before turning to a robustness analysis, we

first consider the evidence on the shifting of the payroll tax.



Wage shifts




                                               61
        What is the estimated wage pass-through implied by our coefficients on social

security contributions? The social security effect is a robust finding of our aggregate

country analysis and so is worth exploring further. Define α as the elasticity of

employment with respect to the cost of labor. Assume that social security taxes are

expressed as a percentage of wages. Writing labor demand as a function of wages

inclusive of taxes in log linear form, we obtain:

        ln Emp ( SS ) = α ln W ( SS )(1 + SS )  + C

where SS is the fraction of wages marked up by social security and W(SS) is the wage

which depends on SS through equilibrium shifting effects and C is a constant standing in

for all other factors. Taking derivatives with respect to the SS markup, we obtain:

∂ ln EMP( SS )     ∂ ln W ( SS ) 
               =α               + 1 .
    ∂ ln SS         ∂ ln ( SS )    

                ∂ ln W ( SS )
Solving for                   , we obtain:
                   ∂ ln SS

∂ ln W ( SS )       1  ∂ ln EMP ( SS )    
                =                      −α  .

                                                 ∂ ln EMP( SS )
To estimate the wage shift, we estimate                         from a specification with the same

dependent variable is in logs, advance notice, indemnities for dismissal and seniority pay

are defined in logs and social security contributions are defined as fractions of gross wages

and we use ln (1 + SS ) as a regressor. Finally,                   is assumed to be within the ranges

of estimates reported in Table 4 and consistent with the estimates reported in these studies.

With all of these elements, we obtain the estimates presented in Table 10.30

            We find that the elasticity of employment with respect to social security

contributions is -.7 for the whole sample, around –1 for the OECD sample and -.447 for

Latin America. This implies that increasing social security contributions by 10 percent

will lower employment by 7 percent in the overall sample, 10 percent in the OECD and 4.5

percent in Latin America. These are large numbers. They also imply that for a large range

of labor demand elasticities the estimated pass through is zero, particularly for the OECD

sample. Thus, for a labor demand elasticity of -.7, the pass through is zero in OECD and

36 percent in LA. Although this larger pass through in Latin America is at odds with the

presumption of a very elastic labor supply to the formal sector, it is consistent with a much

higher wage flexibility in Latin America than in industrial countries due to greater inflation

in the region (see IADB, 2003). All in all, this evidence suggests that part of the cost of

regulations is borne by workers, but that social security contributions tend to be perceived

as taxes on labor. Increasing social security taxes leads to substantial costs in terms of

reductions in employment and increases in unemployment.



The effect of recent social security reforms

            Our negative coefficients on social security contributions suggest that the benefits

associated with these contributions are valued at less than 100 percent of their cost. An

interesting question is whether the recent wave of pension reforms in Latin America have

contributed to strengthen the link between contributions and benefits as well as to increase

the size of the wage pass-through. This is especially relevant because most reforms

30
     Hamermesh (1993) reports a range of elasticities between -.15 and -.7. We constrain wage effects of SS in

                                                        63
transformed pay-as-you-go systems into full or partial capitalization systems. To examine

this possibility we create a dummy variable Reform, which, for each country, takes the

value of zero in the period pre-reform and 1 from the period of reform onward. We add this

variable and an interaction of reform with the cost of social security payments to the

specification given by expression (2). Our results suggest contemporaneous positive effects

of pension reforms on employment. (See Table 11) However, it is unclear whether this

positive effect is associated with the reforms themselves or with other factors. Thus, we

find a positive and statistically significant coefficient on the Reform variable, suggesting an

increase in employment rates in the post-reform period. However, the interaction term with

social security reform is negative and statistically significant, indicating that social security

taxes have larger disemployment effects after the reforms. This higher disincentive could

be due to the mixed effects resulting from the transition to the new system. As workers

move from the pay-as-you-go to the capitalization system, contributions to social security

finance individual accounts and, in many instances, the pensions of those left in the old

system. The contribution to fund the old system is likely to be viewed as a pure tax on

employment.



Robustness

        The results reported in this section are based on larger samples and depart

substantially from those reported in Heckman and Pagés (2000).31 Unfortunately, a lack of

robustness to changes in specification or sample size is all too common in the cross-section

time-series literature that uses aggregate data. However, fragility is not the entire story.

   We are greatly indebted to David Bravo and Sergio Urzua, who made us aware that adding Chile to the
original sample used in Heckman and Pagés (2000) substantially changes our earlier conclusions.


                                                 64
The estimated payroll tax effects are robust as are the negative effects of indemnities on

employment. Given this potential weakness, we investigate whether our new results are

robust to changes in estimation method, measures of regulations, specification and sample

size, as well as to the exclusion of outliers.

        Given the limited variance of the job security variables, it is interesting to compare

our fixed effects coefficients with the results obtained from estimating our main equation

using random effects (RE) (see Table 12) We reject the hypothesis of consistency of the

RE estimator for employment in the joint sample at 10 percent. The most substantial

difference is the considerably smaller magnitude of the coefficient on indemnities for the

OECD sample in the RE model. While in the OECD sample we still find a negative effect

of indemnities on employment and a positive effect on unemployment, these effects are no

longer statistically significant at conventional levels. The coefficient on advance notice is

now positive and statistically significant in the employment regressions and negative and

statistically significant in the unemployment regressions. The size and significance of the

social security contribution coefficients are robust to the change in method of estimation.

        In unreported results available upon request, we also examine whether our results

are robust to alternative measurements of the cost of regulations that do not require

assumptions about discount or layoff rates. Following Lazear (1990), we measure job

security regulations as the mandatory amount (in multiples of monthly wages) that should

be paid to a worker who is dismissed after 10 years of tenure. A major disadvantage of this

measure is that it only reflects job security in one point of the job security-tenure schedule.

In our samples both his measure and our measure yield similar results.

        We also assess the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion or exclusion of

additional control variables such as year effects, region-specific year effects, time trends


                                                 65
and region-specific time trends. The results on the effect of social security contributions on

employment and unemployment are very robust to changes in specification. Other results

are less robust. For instance, in a specification with region-specific year fixed-effects the

coefficient on seniority pay is still positive but it is no longer statistically significant at

conventional levels. Adding or deleting either g or GDP levels does not change our

conclusions.

        Important differences also arise when we assess the sensitivity of our baseline

results to changes in sample size. In particular, we find that both the coefficients on

advance notice provisions and indemnities for dismissal are sensitive to the

inclusion/exclusion of some countries in the sample while the coefficients on social

security payments and seniority pay do not change. For instance, excluding Germany from

the sample greatly increases the coefficient on advance notice in the baseline employment

specification. Similarly, excluding Brazil or Peru changes the coefficient on indemnities

for dismissal in the employment regressions.

        Finally, we check whether our results are robust to the exclusion of outliers, which

are defined as those observations for which the difference in the regression coefficient

when the i-th observation is included and when it is not, scaling the difference by the

estimated standard error of the coefficient, is larger than 2 n (Belsley, et al., 1980). Our

results confirm that there are no outliers that alter the coefficients for social security

contributions. There are a few outliers that modify the coefficients on job security

provisions (advance notice, indemnities and seniority pay). However, they do not

qualitatively alter our baseline results.

        Taken as a whole, our results suggest that the negative (and statistically

significant) association between social security contributions and employment, as well as a


                                                 66
positive association between social security contributions and unemployment is very

robust to changes in estimation method, specification, regional sample, sample size and

outliers. The coefficients on our job security measures are much less robust. Thus, while

the FE estimates provide some evidence that in some OECD countries reducing

indemnities results in higher employment rates, the evidence across countries provided by

our RE estimates is less conclusive. One component of job security, seniority pay, is

positively correlated with employment.



Endogeneity

       It is often argued that labor reforms are put in place when labor market

performance is poor. As demonstrated in the Figure 3 plots, this is sometimes true for

reforms in the LAC region. If a decline in employment rates (and an increase in

unemployment rates) prompts a reduction in labor market regulations, then least squares

estimates will be upward biased, potentially underestimating a negative relationship

between job security or social security taxes and employment. Our baseline specification

partly controls for the possibility of such reverse causality because the propensity for

reform is partly captured by changes in the GDP or demographic conditions. Another

source of concern is the timing of reforms. If labor reforms that liberalize the labor market

are undertaken at particularly bad times, an estimated negative relationship between

employment and regulations could just be the consequence of mean reversion.

       In the results available on request, we address these issues in various ways. First,

we attempt to control for differences in the propensity to reform at different points in time

by including current and past GDP rates up to five lags. Since presumably, bad

employment outcomes are strongly associated with poor GDP outcomes, the inclusion of


                                              67
this set of variables will control for the propensity to reform. Secondly, we control for the

timing of reforms by interacting changes in regulatory variables with a variable that

measures the distance (in years) between the current year and the last business cycle

trough. Finally, we directly address the problem of reverse causality by using the

dependency ratio, defined as the ratio of population 65 and older to the population in

working age (15 to 64), as an instrument for social security contributions.32 Our results

suggest that controlling for either the propensity or the timing of reforms does not alter the

conclusions of our analysis.33

         Regarding our instrumental variable estimates, Table 13 indicates that in the three

samples considered, social security contributions increase with the dependency ratio. In

addition, demographic changes explain a substantial share of the within-country time

variation in social security contributions. The average dependency ratio in our sample is

0.17, while in OECD and LA are 0.19 and 0.08 respectively. The coefficients in Table 13

suggest that if the dependency ratio increases in one percentage point, expected discounted

social security contributions increase in 1.12 months for the total sample, 1.02 for the

OECD and 2.83 for Latin America. Moreover, our instrumental variable estimates (Table

14) suggest that there is a causal relation between changes in social security contributions

and changes in employment and unemployment rates at least in the overall and OECD

sample. In these two samples, IV estimates produce larger coefficients than the FE

regressions. Instead, the Latin America IV estimates yield coefficients with opposite signs

to the ones obtained with the FE regressions. However, such coefficients are not

32
  The source of this data is the UN Population Statistics, 1998.
33
  Another way to control for endogeneity is to use the information in the Figure 3 sequence to break out
episodes of reform that were not preceded by major downturns (or upturns) of the economy from other
episodes and analyze the latter. The problem with this approach in our sample is that it uses up too many
scarce degrees of freedom.


                                                     68
statistically significant. The small number of observations available for Latin America is

not sufficient to obtain precise IV estimates in this region.

Summary

           Our analysis of pooled time-series cross-sections of countries underscores why the

studies examining the impact of regulations in OECD countries based on such data have

produced such ambiguous results. Lack of variation in the relevant policy measures and

poor measures of regulation have hampered empirical analyses of the effect of regulations

on labor market outcomes. To surmount these problems we have expanded the number of

countries comprising the LAC region, included more within-country variation, and

improved the measures of regulation. Contrary to previously reported estimates, we have

found little evidence of a systematic relationship between advance notice and indemnities

for dismissal on employment or unemployment in our improved and expanded sample for

Latin America. Estimates vary across countries with some countries showing gains in

employment after reducing job security, and others showing little benefit to the

employment rate or even employment reductions after such reforms, but no clear pattern

emerges from the aggregates.

           However, we find robust evidence that social security contributions are not fully

shifted to workers. Payroll taxation tends to reduce employment and increase

unemployment rates across samples and specifications. At the aggregate level, our analyses

of reforms intended to increase the link between contributions and payments show mixed

results.



6. Conclusions and Directions for Future Research




                                                69
       Summarizing an entire school of thought, Freeman (2000) writes that “the

institutional organization of the labor market has identifiable large effects on distribution,

but modest hard-to-uncover effects on efficiency.” This view is shared by many

economists. However, the microevidence summarized in this volume suggests that

mandated benefits and job security regulations have a substantial allocative impact both in

Latin America and in OECD countries.

       What policy lessons can be drawn from the essays in this volume? The evidence

assembled in this volume suggests that labor market regulations are an inequality-

increasing mechanism, because some workers benefit while many others are hurt. The

benefits of programs funded with mandatory payroll contributions should be weighed

against their costs in terms of employment. Funding such programs with general revenues

does not necessarily reduce employment costs (see Nickell, 1997), but strengthening the

link between payments and benefits contributes to shifting the cost of such programs to

workers, at least in the long run. Regulation acts unevenly across different groups in

society. Young, uneducated, and rural workers are much less likely to enjoy coverage than

older, skilled and urban workers.

       While the aggregate evidence on the effects of job security on the level of

employment is inconclusive, the microstudies assembled here find a large and negative

effect of job security on employment. Individual country studies based on microdata

reduce the fragility and lack of robustness problems that pervade the cross-section of

countries time-series literature.



Lessons For Future Research




                                              70
       While these essays demonstrate that firms and workers respond to incentives in

predictable ways, and that regulation reduces employment and labor market turnover, more

precise quantitative estimates would be desirable. We conclude with a discussion of the

main areas in which future research could improve upon the current estimates.

(a) Incidence of Payroll Taxes and General Equilibrium

    Several essays in this volume take significant steps towards addressing whether

workers accept lower wages if they receive mandated benefits. These estimates of

incidence can be improved. Comparing the wages of covered and uncovered sectors to see

if covered workers get lower wages, as in Cardenas and Bernal (this volume) and several

other essays in this volume, fails to control for self-selection into these sectors which

several studies in this volume have documented to be important. The method fails to adjust

for general equilibrium effects arising from induced entry and exit and the willingness of

workers to purchase benefits by accepting reduced wages.

    The most comprehensive approach to the incidence question is the analysis of Marrufo

(2001), which finds that controlling for self-selection and accounting for general

equilibrium effects substantially affects estimates of tax incidence and difference-in-

difference estimates understate the true extent of wage adjustment. As argued by Kugler,

the simple difference-in-differences method is downward biased so that the estimates

reported in this volume are conservative.

(b) Dynamic Labor Demand

    The empirical models of labor demand estimated by the authors in this volume are

traditional static models and dynamic labor demand models based on the assumption of

symmetric adjustment costs. They abstract from the asymmetries in labor demand that are

produced by severance and indemnity systems. Appendix B sketches out the main ideas in


                                              71
the asymmetric demand literature using a two-period model. Alonso-Borrego and

Aguirregabiria (1999) develops the econometrics needed to estimate such models but the

methods remain to be implemented on LAC data. Given that all of the labor demand

models estimated in this book assume symmetric adjustment costs, it would be productive

to rework these studies using more advanced methods. As previously noted, the

inconclusive evidence on the effect of job security on firm adjustment dynamics may be an

artifact of the symmetry assumption.

        In this class of models, it would also be useful to account for general equilibrium

effects of entry and exit of firms. Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) demonstrate that in

principle accounting for general equilibrium effects can reverse the predictions of partial

equilibrium models.

(c) Accounting for Nonstationarity

        All of the duration models used to determine the impacts of regulation on labor

market turnover assume stationary environments. Any student of Latin America knows

how poor that assumption is. The high volatility of economic outcomes in Latin America

suggests that this assumption does not adequately characterize the region. Accounting for

nonstationarity more systematically would improve econometric estimates of behavioral

parameters for the region.

(d) Accounting for The Effects of Regulation on Output

        All the labor demand studies estimate output-constant wage elasticities. Abstracting

from the potentially important econometric problem of endogeneity of output, output-

constant demand functions are more robust because they allow the analyst to abstract from

product market adjustments to relative price changes. At the firm level, the output-constant

effects of regulation understate the total effect of regulation if regulation raises the


                                               72
marginal cost of labor to the firm and costs cannot be shifted onto wages or other factor

costs. The estimates reported here underestimate the full disemployment effects of

deregulation in sectors adversely impacted. At the level of the national economy, the

effects are more ambiguous because the burden of regulation may impact industries

differently although it will still have efficiency losses by distorting sectoral allocations. In

a closed economy, relative output prices adjust and will lead to an expansion of output in

those sectors least impacted. So in those sectors, greater regulation may lead to greater

employment. In an open economy facing world prices, when regulations are not

accommodated by a downward adjustment of factor prices, regulation reduces output and

accentuates reductions in employment.

        A complete analysis of the impact of regulation would require accounting for both

product market and factor market adjustments. The presumption is that a full account

would produce disemployment effect of regulation on the overall economy but not

necessarily in each sector.

        Notice, however, that even if wages adjust fully and there are no adverse effects of

regulation on labor demand, regulation may still have substantial effects on the welfare of

workers. If a job security mandate is offset by lower wages, worker welfare is not

necessarily improved, at least not for all workers. It may be higher or lower depending on

how much the mandate differs from what workers and firms would mutually agree upon in

an unregulated environment.

(e) Accounting for serial correlation

        While most of the studies summarized in this volume measure the cost of

regulations by elaborating direct monetary measures of their cost to employers, several

authors use the length of the lag (the speed of adjustment) as an alternative measure of the


                                               73
cost of regulation facing the firm. The intuition supporting this is based on the original

work of Holt, Modisliani, Muth, and Simon (1960), as previously described in section 4.2.

        In the simple model of equations (2) and (3), if we introduce an error term, and an

implicit theory of optimal employment as a function of the real wage Wt, we obtain

(4)                               nt* = a + bWt + ε t ,         b ≤ 0.
If εt is serially correlated, we obtain

(5)                                 ε t = ρε t −1 + ut

where ut has zero mean and is independently and identically distributed and ρ is the first

order serial correlation. Analysts obtain a high estimated value of λ (the coefficient on

lagged labor) from a least squares estimation that does not correct for serial correlation

since

(6)                                     nt =(1−λ)(a+bWt ) +λnt−1 +(1−λ)εt .

If 1<λ<1, ρ>0, OLS estimates of λ are upward biased. An asymptotically unbiased

estimator that accounts for this serial correlation is based on

(7)               nt = (1− λ )(1− ρ )a + (1− λ )b(Wt − ρWt −1 ) + (λ + ρ )nt −1 − λρ nt −2 + (1− λ )ut

which is derived from (6) by lagging it one period, solving for (1-λ)εt-1, writing

εt=ρεt-1+ut in (6) and substituting for εt-1. This bias is especially important in making cross

country comparisons where serial correlation coefficients may differ greatly across

economies. For studies of regulations in a single country, this bias will not affect estimates

of the relative cost of different reforms if the serial correlation pattern is invariant across

reforms. However, no meaning can be attached to the absolute value of the lag coefficient.

        This conventional model assumes symmetric hiring and firing costs. Yet even in

the original Holt et al study, this assumption was only introduced as a mathematically

simplifying one that was contrary to their evidence. A more accurate description of the

                                                         74
data from Latin America and other regions is that there are substantial asymmetric

adjustment costs.

        A measurement model accounting for asymmetric adjustment costs requires a new

econometric approach. In work available on request, we consider a model of asymmetric

hiring and firing costs based on Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993). The coefficient on

lagged labor is not necessarily monotonic in the cost of labor regulations. This may

account for the ambiguous evidence on the impact of regulation on the cost of adjustment

obtained from the conventional estimates.34



Taking Stock

        Although there is clearly room for improvement, the body of evidence summarized

in this chapter, and reported in this book, demonstrates that regulation matters, that the

choice of labor market institutions matters and that further labor reforms offer the promise

of promoting both efficiency and equity across demographic groups in Latin America.

They demonstrate the power of microdata to answer important questions when the

evidence from cross-country macro-time series is ambiguous.

34
   The intuition behind this result is simple. Different serial correlation-fixed cost pairs produce the same
lagged employment coefficient. This is also possible in the simple model (6). So it is possible that a regime
with higher labor transition costs is also one with lower serial correlation in shocks and so would display a
lower estimated lag and a faster adjustment rate. See Barbarino and Heckman (2003).

Appendix A: Definitions and sources of variables used in section 5

For the empirical analysis described in section 5, we build an unbalanced panel data
covering the period 1983-1999. Table A.3 describes the variables and their sources.
Table A.4 describes the countries and the years covered in our sample.
Computation of Labor Market Regulation Measures
(1) Advance Notice and Indemnities for dismissal:
OECD Countries
We gather information on advance notice and indemnities for dismissal for OECD
countries from the OECD Employment Outlook (1999), Table 2.A.2: Required notice and
severance pay for individual dismissal, pp. 94-96, which summarizes the “case of a
regular employee with tenure beyond any trial period, dismissed on personal grounds or
economic redundancy but without fault”. For countries for which is likely that individual
dismissals be considered “unjust” (measured as those countries to which the OECD gives
a score of 2 or more in a 1-3 scale in Table 2.A.4 pp.100), that, is countries where a
“transfer and or retraining to adapt to different work must be attempted prior to
dismissal” and where “worker capability cannot be ground for dismissal”, we consider
the information summarized in the “Compensation and related remedies following
unjustified dismissal”. From this table, and for this subset of countries, in at least one
country, unjust dismissals carry a much higher penalty. This is the case of Spain. We
make this contingency explicit by computing the expected severance pay assigning a ½
probability that a dismissal will be considered unfair and will carry the higher severance
pay that the law mandates in this event. We obtain information on labor reforms from
Table 2.1 pp. 53 (Employment Outlook, 1999), which describes the main changes in
legislation since the mid eighties. We also compare the information described in OECD
(1999) with the one presented in Grubb and Wells (1993). If they diverge, we take the
information in the latter to be valid up to 1993 while we take the information presented in
OECD (1999) to be valid from 1997 onwards. For the years in between the index has a
missing value. There are only four countries where there are some divergences between
the former and the latter source. This is the case of Denmark, Greece, Netherlands and
Sweden. Finally, in countries where the law prescribes different severance pay and
advance notice for blue and white-collar workers we compute the cost of dismissal as the
unweighted average for the two groups. For Hungary, Korea, New Zealand and Turkey
the job security measures only take non-missing values from 1990 onwards since we
could not find legal information for former years. To construct our index, we do not
consider upper monetary limits. In addition, we do not consider benefits that firms pay or
unions can obtain for their workers, which exceed the legal mandatory. Finally, we do not
consider what workers can get in courts if they sue their employers.
        Individual country notes: In Australia, we consider the severance pay awarded to
workers dismissed for redundancy. For Canada, we take the maximum of the severance
pay and advance notice mandated by the federal and the local jurisdiction. In Greece, for
white-collar workers, advance notice can be waived if full severance pay is given. We
thereby assume that firms pay in full to avoid paying additional advance notice. In
Ireland, the awarded severance pay depends on the age of the worker. We assume that
workers receive 0.18 monthly wages per year worked, which corresponds to the
(unweighted) average of half a week per year worked (workers under the age of 41) and a
week per year worked (workers over the age of 41). In Norway, after 10 years of tenure,


                                            85
notice period increases with age. To capture this effect, we have increased notice period
from 3 months to 4 and 5 in the case of individuals of more than 15 years of tenure. For
Spain, we adjust the severance pay obtained in case of just dismissal by the fact that
many dismissals are considered unjust. We therefore weigh mandatory dismissals in case
of just and unjust causes by a probability of ½ for each event.
 Latin America
We consider the legal information summarized in Tables A.1 and A.2 obtained from the
Ministries of Labor of individual countries.
        Notes: In Brazil, employers are required to deposit 8 percent of a workers’ wage
in individual workers’ accounts, which accrue interest rates. In case of a firm initiated
dismissal, firms are required to pay a worker severance pay that is a given fraction of
what a worker owns in his individual account. The 1988 constitutional reform increased
this share from .1 to .4 of the total amount in the fund. To compute the fraction of what is
accrued in the individual fund, we assume that the interest rate equals the discount rate.
Therefore, the indemnity is computed as:

               T
Indemnities = ∑ δ i −1(1 − δ ) ( i   )
              i =1

where i denotes tenure at the firm, δ is the per period probability of survival (equal to
0.88) and T denotes the maximum tenure of a worker in a firm, which is assumed to be
equal to twenty. In Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua and Dominican Republic, a constant
advance notice equal to one month is assumed. In Peru, there were reforms in job security
in 1991, 1995 and 1996. Tables A.1 and A. 2 only report the schedule as in 1990 and in
1999. See Saavedra and Torero (this volume) for a more detailed description of the
changes in the Peruvian labor code throughout the nineties.

(2) Seniority Pay:
Seniority payments only exist in Latin America. There are two kinds. In Brazil,
Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, workers deposit 1/12 of their monthly wages in individual
accounts. In this case, seniority pay is computed as:

       T
Senp= ∑ β i
      i =0
where T = 20. This reflects the discounted value of a stream of payments equivalent to
one month of pay per year. For Colombia, Kugler (this volume) reports that before the
1990 labor reform, workers were entitled to one month of salary per year of work as a
seniority fund upon separation independently of the cause of separation. However, partial
withdrawals were allowed and deducted in nominal terms from the final payment,
implying a “double retroactivity” with an estimated cost of 35 percent of the total
payments of seniority pay in the manufacturing sector. We therefore apply a surcharge of
35 percent to the legislated scheduled for seniority pay during the period before 1990.
        Instead, in Venezuela and Panama, labor codes mandate a mandatory seniority
payment that is computed as multiples of the last wage per year of work. In those cases,
seniority pay is computed as:



                                             86
        T
Senp = ∑ δ i −1(1 − δ ) (α j * i ) ,
        i =1
where αj denotes multiples of the last wage and i denotes tenure at the firm. In
Venezuela, the legal codes specified a seniority pay of one monthly wage per year of
work (αj =1). After the 1997, seniority pay was increased to two monthly wages per year
of work (αj =2). Notice that this formula assumes that the probability of worker turnover
is identical to the probability of job turnover. Since in general, worker turnover rates tend
to be higher than job turnover rates, we also experimented with a probability of worker
turnover equal to two times and three times the probability of job turnover. The cost of
seniority pay declines with the rate of turnover (since the probability of surviving in the
firm and obtaining larger amounts declines). Our estimated results are robust to different
assumptions in the worker turnover rate.

(3) Social Security Regulations:
Information provided by Social Security Programs Throughout the World (biannually
1983- 1999, US Social Security Administration. Office of Research, Evaluation and
Statistics). Social security contributions include contributions by employers and
employees to old age, disability and death; sickness and maternity; work injury;
unemployment insurance and Family allowances programs. Since this information is only
available biannually, we extend the data to yearly frequency in two alternative ways: by
interpolating or by inputting each missing data values with the value in the former year.
The results of our empirical analysis do not vary with the method used. The results also
do not vary when we consider only the original biannual data.
        For Argentina, we obtained direct information from the country. Rates apply to
Buenos Aires. In all countries, we consider the rates applied to wage earners. We do not
include contributions made by government to fund social security programs. In cases
where contributions differ across individuals, states, or industry risk, only one rate is
chosen, and the choice varies somewhat across countries. However, the same criterion is
used within countries across time. This somewhat reduces cross-country comparability
but preserves across time comparability within countries.

(4) Social Security Reform:
The variable Reform takes a value of 1 after a country has implemented a social security
reform that totally or partially replaces a pay as you go system by an individually
capitalization system. Based on social security reforms information summarized in Lora
and Pages (2000) this variable takes the value of 1 in Chile on and after 1981; in
Colombia on and after 1994; in Argentina on and after 1994; in Uruguay on and after
1996; in Mexico and Bolivia on and after 1997; in El Salvador on and after 1998.

(*) workers can choose between getting an unconditional payment after 7 years in the firm, or getting a higher indemnity in
case of dismissal. Most workers opt for the latter.
FUND: A certain fraction of a worker’s wage is deposited in an individual account every month. The principal plus the interest
can be withdrawn by the worker upon dismissal and in some cases, upon voluntary separation.

                                       Dynamic Demand SpeciÞcations


      All of the papers on labor demand in this volume ignore the asymmetric nature of labor adjust-

ment costs. In this appendix, we explore the consequences of this asymmetry on labor demand. The

main conclusion is that static and dynamic costs of labor have separate eﬀects on labor demand,

and in general no scalar index adequately summarizes these costs. In order to specify labor demand

functions in the presence of asymmetric hiring and Þring costs, it is convenient to use a two period

model. Such a model is implicit in Kugler (this volume). Let f(") denote output as a function of

labor input ". Let θ be a second period productivity shock. It is normalized against a Þrst period

productivity shock of “1.” We assume, for simplicity, that workers do not quit once they are hired.

      Labor hired in period 1 is "1 . Labor employed in period 2 is "2 = "1 + ∆. ∆ is thus the change in

the stock of period 1 labor. Spot wage W is assumed to be common in both periods, and is assumed

to be exogenous to the Þrm. The cost of Þring a worker is C. Oﬀsetting this cost is the saving

in wages. The cost of hiring a worker is the wage. Asymmetry arises when C 6= 0. Assume no

discounting. Labor "1 is kept on in period 2 unless second period demand shocks (θ) are suﬃciently

low. The Þrm maximizes proÞts:



                       f("1 ) − W "1 + E[θf ("1 + ∆) − W ("1 + ∆) − CMax(−∆, 0)]                  (B-1)



where the Þrst period labor productivity is normalized to 1.

      We assume that the support of θ is (0, ∞) and that θ is an (absolutely continuous) random

variable. If θ ≥ 1 with probability 1, the Þrm in the second period wants ∆ ≥ 0. Labor productivity

has increased when θ is bigger than its Þrst period value, which implicitly is set at 1.

      The presence of second period Þring costs inhibits hiring in the Þrst period. Thus, anticipating

the possibility of an adverse shock in the second period, the Þrm hires less labor than it would hire

in the Þrst period in the absence of Þring costs. If, for the sake of making an heuristic argument,

we characterize the Þrm as myopically maximizing period-by-period proÞts, the Þrm acts as if the

Þrst period productivity shock is less than 1 in making its Þrst period decisions and hires less labor

than it would if there were no second period Þring costs. Letting θ̄ be the value of the “as if” Þrst

                                                                                     θ
   If θ = θ̄, the Þrm stays put at "1 so that "1 = "2 and ∆ = 0. If productivity is below θ̄, the

Þrm may still keep its workforce at "1 = "2 because it is costly to Þre labor. We now determine the

lower bound on θ that gives rise to inaction. For a Þxed "1 , the two required conditions for inaction

(∆ = 0) are θf 0 ("1 ) < W , so it pays in gross terms to get rid of a unit of "1 , and θf 0 ("1 ) > W − C,

so it does not pay in net terms. Thus the inequalities determining the zone of inaction are (for a

given "1 )

                                         W − C ≤ θf 0 ("1 ) ≤ W.

                             W −C
The lower boundary θ∗ is               = θ∗ . Holding "1 Þxed, raising C lowers the threshold θ∗ . Thus
                             f 0 ("1 )
the zone of inaction for a given ("1 , C) is θ∗ ≤ θ ≤ θ̄, where θ̄ = W/(f 0 ("1 )).

   The Þrst order condition for "1 is f 0 ("1 )−W +E(θf 0 ("1 +∆)−W ) = 0, where ∆ = 0 if θ∗ ≤ θ ≤ θ̄,

∆ < 0 if θ < θ∗ and ∆ > 0 if θ > θ̄. From concavity, "1 is decreasing in cost C. Intuitively, Þrms

with high Þring costs hold back on hiring "1 . There is an option value of holding back on hiring "1

to avoid the cost of Þring unwanted second period labor. In order to characterize "1 , we must Þrst

characterize ∆("1 ).

The positivity of this Þnal expression arises from the fact that as C increases, the Þrm is more risk

averse (θ∗ falls) so that it is more likely that it hires labor in the second period.

   If θ is iid across Þrms in period 2, and iid across time, then the mean conditional (on "1 ) labor

demand function is not a direct function of W + Pr(0 < θ < θ∗ )C which, in this simple framework,

is the measure of labor cost used in Heckman and Pagés (2000) and in the empirical analysis of

Section 5. In fact, the model predicts that


                              ∂E("2 | W, C, "1 ) ∂E("2 | W, C, "1 )
                                                +                   <0
                                    ∂W                 ∂C


          ∂E("2 | W, C, "1 )                                  ∂E("2 | W, C, "1 )
so that                      is larger in absolute value than                    although they are of
                ∂W                                                  ∂C
opposite signs.

   This analysis suggests that empirical speciÞcations of labor demand functions should use C and

W separately. W corresponds to static costs as deÞned in the text. C corresponds to costs of

adjustment. OLS regressions of conditional (on "1 ) demand functions do not identify the standard

substitution terms used in static demand analysis.

   One way to avoid problems with direct estimation of labor demand functions is to estimate

production functions. These can be used to derive the demand functions given Þxed costs without

directly estimating demand functions with Þxed costs.



                                 First Period Demand Functions


   These are obtained by substituting each state-contingent "2 = "1 + ∆ demand function into

(B-1) and maximizing with respect to "1 . As in the analysis of the second period demand function,

W + Pr(0 < θ < θ∗ ) C is not an appropriate marginal price in any state. Substituting into (B-1),

and making the dependence of ∆− and ∆+ on W, C, "1 explicit, we obtain total proÞts (as perceived

in the Þrst period) as

Assuming an interior solution, and using the envelope theorem,

so the Þrst period demand obtained as the solution to this equation " is a function of W and C

separately and not W + Pr(0 < θ ≤ θ∗ )C. Observe, trivially, that the "1 obtained as a solution of

this Þrst order condition is lower than the "1 obtained when C = 0. This rationalizes our choice of

θ̄ < 1 in the heuristic solution outlined above.

*: ∂ ln E m p is obtained from a regression in which the dependent variable is computed in logarithms and
     ∂ ln S S
all regulatory variables are also computed in logs. The other control variables used in Table 8A are used
here. Social security contributions are defined as logarithms of the fraction of the contribution rate, that is
we use ln(1+SS). Standard errors are in parentheses. The other three rows are obtained from the formula in
the text, using alternative values of α, as shown in the first column of the table. When estimated effects on
