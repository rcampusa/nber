                                              ABSTRACT

Using tick-by-tick data of the dollar-yen and euro-dollar exchange rates recorded in the actual transaction
platform, a "run" -- continuous increases or decreases in deal prices for the past several ticks -- does
have some predictable information on the direction of the next price movement. Deal price movements,
that are consistent with order flows, tend to continue a run once it started i.e., conditional probability
of deal prices tend to move in the same direction as the last several times in a row is higher than 0.5.
However, quote prices do not show such tendency of a run. Hence, a random walk hypothesis is refuted
in a simple test of a run using the tick by tick data. In addition, a longer continuous increase of the
price tends to be followed by larger reversal. The findings suggest that those market participants who
have access to real-time, tick-by-tick transaction data may have an advantage in predicting the exchange
rate movement. Findings here also lend support to the momentum trading strategy.

1. Introduction
The foreign exchange market remains sleepless around the clock. Someone is trading
somewhere all the time—24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Analyzing the
behavior of the exchange rate has become a popular sport of international finance
researchers, while global financial institutions are spending millions of dollars to build
real-time computer trading systems (program trading). High-frequency, reliable data are
the key in finding robust results for good research for academics or profitable schemes
for businesses.
         Program trading typically uses some algorithm to find a “trend” that is to
increase or decrease the price (exchange rate) for several minutes to several hours.
The computer program produces buy or sell orders depending on a detected trend.
Finding a trend is usually based on a continuous increase or decrease (a run) of the price
in the past several minutes to several hours. This type of trading is known as a
momentum trading strategy (as opposed to a contrarian strategy). What is attempted in
this paper is to construct a very naïve strategy, try to detect a trend by a run, and make a
bet on the next move. A program trading strategy is much more sophisticated than the
naïve strategy of just detecting a run and making a bet. So, even if the conditional
probability is estimated to be different from 0.5, then it is just an example of such a
trading, and any profit opportunity detected there would be underestimate. On the other
hand, all exercises here would not be proof for profitability, because exercises are
conducted in the in-sample manner. However, the point is to examine whether the
conditional probability of increase (or decrease) could be different from 0.5—the
prediction of the random walk hypothesis.
         In order to mimic a program trading strategy, a data set has to be exactly the
same as the dealers’. Recently, the actual transactions data have become available.
The EBS data set is a historical record of firm quotes and transactions prices recorded at
one-second slice. The information is almost the same as what dealers’ had in the
information. One of the advantages of this paper is the use of tick by tick (a one-second
slice, to be precise) data of the EBS, which covers a large share of spot exchange rate
transaction in the world. The data from the transaction platform is much more reliable
and desirable, as shown in Ito and Hashimoto (2006).
         The most popular data set among researchers through various sources, FXFX
screen of Reuters indicative quotes, is not appropriate for this purpose because quotes
are input by dealers for delivering the market condition. However, they are information
only, without any commitment for trade. Reliability of indicative quotes to capture the


                                                                                          2
whole picture of a market reality is much less than firm quotes. Firm quotes (ready to
trade) and transaction price data are simply not available in the FXFX screen.7
        Many academic researchers and officials believe that the exchange rate changes
follow a random walk. The literature is full of papers failing to refute a random walk
hypothesis, in that the best predictor of the price in the future is the current price. Most
papers are written using daily, hourly, or minute-by-minute frequency, with data using
FXFX screen of Reuters. However, the literature does not prove non-existence of any
profit opportunity in real world, since the FXFX screen does not represent actual trading
possibilities and tick-by-tick, conditional trading strategy is not examined properly in
the existing literature.
         A particular test conducted in this paper is a test using a concept of a “run”—a
continuous increase or decrease in deal or quote price (exchange rate) changes. The
probability of the next exchange rate change being positive has to be one-half, if the
increase or decrease is a random event, irrespective of a history of exchange rate
changes. However, momentum traders tend to perceive that the probability of next
change being positive is higher than a half. Therefore, the test of random walk is the
conditional probability of next change after a run of the same signs in the exchange rate
changes.8 Second, the size of the next change is examined. In particular, it is examined
whether the step size of the next change may become different in case of a run.
         There are three kinds of innovations in this paper. First, our data set is much
better than any other data set used in the literature, because it is a record of actual
trading platform. Second, the frequency is one-second slice—almost tick-by-tick.
Third, a very simple test is devised so that a test is not subject to model uncertainty or a
structural break. It is possible to test whether expected percentage change (direction
times step size) can be estimated in a regression model, using both price and transaction
volume information, to test a “no profit condition,” as Ito and Hashimoto (2007).
However, the regression model relies on an assumption of stable structural parameters.
         Major findings with respect to price behavior, for both the dollar-yen and
euro-dollar, are as follows. First, quote prices are less likely to continue rising or
falling even if there exists a run. For quote prices, a conditional probability of a run
(movement in the same direction) is lower than 0.5 for most cases. Second, deal prices


7
  See Goodhart and O’Hara (1997: p.78) for detailed arguments on the advantage of using the actual
trading data, and Goodhart, Ito, and Payne (1996) and Goodhart and Payne (1996) for an early
attempts to make use of transactions data.
8
  Bouchaud, Gefen, Potters and Wyart (2004) and Lillo and Farmer (2004) examined price
movements in stock market and found that the conditional probability of the sign of the next
order is higher than 0.5.


                                                                                                 3
are more likely to continue falling or rising. For deal prices done on the bid (ask) side,
conditional probability that the price continues falling (rising, resp.) is higher than 0.5.
Third, the step size of price change in a run is constant in general. The size of price
fall is larger than that of price increase in the case of bid quote prices. On the contrary,
the size of price increase is larger than that of price fall in the case of ask quote prices.
Fourth, in the case of deal prices, the size of price increase is larger than that of price
fall for the bid-side deal prices, (and vise versa for the ask-side deal prices). Finally, the
size of correction after a run is found to depend on the number of continuous price
increase (decrease) and on the cumulative price change in a run.
          The sample period covers from January 1998 to October 2003. Saturdays,
Sundays, Mondays and days when interventions were conducted by the monetary
authorities (Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve Bank, and ECB) were dropped from the
data.
         The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data.
Section 3 shows patterns of transactions (quotes) in foreign exchange market based on
conditional probability. In section 4, the size of price change at each transaction (quote
revision) is examined conditional on a run of price increase/decrease. In section 5,
probability of price increase/decrease is calculated conditional on bid-ask spread.
Section 6 concludes the paper.



2. The data
Recently, almost all spot foreign exchange transactions of major currencies are now
carried out through electronic broking systems. The EBS, whose data we use in the
analysis below, has a strong market share (in absolute terms and in comparison to other
electronic broking systems such as Reuter D-3000) in the yen/dollar rate and the
Euro/dollar rate.9 The EBS is a provider of trading technology, and the quotes and
transactions are shown continuously, 24 hours a day. The EBS screen shows the “firm
bid” and “firm ask”, the bid and offer that are committed to trade if someone on the
other side is willing to trade at that price.10
          A “firm ask” (“firm bid”) means that the institution that posts the quote is ready
to sell (buy, resp.) the shown currency (e.g., the dollar in exchange for the quoted yen).


9
   Reuters have significant market shares in exchanged related to sterling, Canadian dollar, and
Australian dollars.
10
    For the general reference on the microstructure of the foreign exchange market, see Goodhart
and O’Hara (1997), Lyons (1995) and Lyons (2001).


                                                                                                   4
The ask quote is almost always higher than the bid quote.11 When the deal is done at
the ask side, it means that the firm ask (ready to sell) quote is “hit” by a buyer. When
the deal is done at the bid side, the firm bid quote is “hit” by a seller. Therefore the
ask deal is a buyer-initiated deal, and the bid deal is a seller-initiated deal, according to
the description in Berger, et al (2005).12 If ask (bid) deals are continuously hit, then the
ask (bid) deal prices tend to move up (down), because of the buy (sell, resp.) pressure.
         The data used in the analysis includes information on price of the USD-JPY
and EUR-USD currency pairs from January 1998 to October 2003. It contains
information of best bid, best ask, bid-side deal prices, and ask-side deal prices. Every
data point is on the one-second time slice. Bid and ask quote prices are recorded at the
end of the time slice. Any bid/ask quote price movements within a second are not
recorded. When there are multiple trades within one second, “lowest given price” and
“highest paid price” will be shown. Highest paid is the deal price done on the ask side
and the lowest given is the price done on the bid side within the one second.
          As part of facilitating an orderly market, EBS requires any newly linked
institution to secure a sufficient number of other banks that are willing to open credit
lines with the new comer. A smaller or regional bank may have fewer trading
relationships, thus not as many credit relationships. Then the best bid and ask for that
institution may be different from the best bid and ask of the market. A smaller or
regional bank may post more aggressive prices (higher bids or lower asks) because they
will have relatively fewer credit relationships, implying that they will see fewer dealable
prices generally.
          This trend means that “hot potatoes” (Lyons (1997)) are less important now,
11
    However, in the EBS data set, the reversal (bid higher than ask) can happen, when the two parties
do not have credit lines each other, and there is no third party that has credit lines to the two quote
posting parties. The EBS system facilitates, as part of the dealing rules, each institution to control
bilateral credit lines. Namely, each EBS-linked institution sets credit lines (including zero) against
all other potential counter-parties. Therefore, an institution faces a restriction of bid, offer, or deal
from other institutions. When bid and offer rates are posted for the system, they are not necessarily
available to all participants of the EBS system. The EBS-registered trader’s screen shows the best
bid and best offer of the market and best bid and best offer for that particular institution. In normal
times, the best bid of the market is lower than the best offer of the market. Otherwise, some
institution that has positive credit lines with both institutions on the bid and ask sides will be able to
make profits by arbitrage.
12
    The buyer-initiated trades (the seller-initiated trades) used in Berger et al. (2005) corresponds to
the number of deals on ask side (the number of deals on bid side) in our paper, respectively. The
order flow, the net excess of buyer-initiated trades in Berger et al. corresponds to the netdeal in our
paper. Berger et al. had access to the data of actual transaction volumes---proprietary data of
EBS---while we use the number of seconds in which at least one deals was done. The number of
deals, rather than the signed (actual) volume, is good enough proxy for the volume of transaction. In
fact, the actual transaction volume is not revealed to participants other than parties involved, so that
they would not be able to be used in prediction of price movement in real time.


                                                                                                         5
and a cool supercomputer is increasingly important. In other words, dealers’ tactics to
transform order flows from the corporate sector into the interbank market may be less
influential than before, and the dealers’ behavior in posting firm bids and asks through
the electronic broking system is more influential then before.13



3. Patterns of Quote and Deal prices
3.1. Run
In this section, the directional patterns of quote and deal price changes will be examined,
calculating conditional probabilities of sign of changes. In the foreign exchange
market, quote prices fluctuate as limit orders are newly entered, hit or withdrawn, and
deal prices fluctuate as deals are done at different prices. By taking a first difference of
prices, pt-pt-1, a series of binary choices consists of sings of price changes is generated.
For example, … - + + + - - + + - + + + + - - - + - + + - - …. is a new series.14
         Many theoretical works derive or assume that the exchange rate follows a
random walk process. The random walk hypothesis implies that probability of price
increases, irrespective of history, in the next change should be 0.5 (given the size of
increase/decrease in prices is symmetric). Thus, probability that the price is revised
higher for n successive trade (that is, the sign of price change is positive for n
successive quotes) equals 0.5n. Similarly, probability that price is revised lower for n
successive trade is 0.5n.
        The probability, calculated from the new data series, that the next price revision
is positive (negative) conditional on the n successive positive (negative) price revisions
is as follows:

                                                      N (+ | ++, , ,+,－)
           Pn (+ | ++, , ,+(n pluses )) =                                           ,   (1)
                                            N (+ | ++, , ,+,－) + N (− | ++, , ,+,－)


where Pn( | ) is the calculated conditional probability of continuing a run, given the N
successive price change in the same direction; N( | ) is the number of successive price
changes; “+” means positive price revisions (price going up), and “–“ means negative


13
   Our interviews (in November 2003) with banks with substantial foreign exchange trading in
London revealed that they had reduced the degree of discretion of dealers and shifted proprietary
trading to the specialized section. Computer models have replaced dealers’ instincts.
14
   Methodology employed in this paper follows the up-down analysis of Figure 6 in Mizuno,
Kurihara, Takayasu and Takayasu (2003), where they used CQG quote data for a test of trend
existence.


                                                                                                    6
price revisions (price going down). The “run”—the number of successive changes in the
same direction—is defined as those after the change in the direction N+1 times earlier.15
         If Pn(+|++,,,+,－) is higher than 0.5 and statistically different from a null of
     n
(0.5) , then the process is said to have “a momentum.” Given a history of a
run—positive (negative) changes n times in a row—it is more likely that the price will
move up (down, resp.) again in the next change.       If it is less than 0.5, then the process
is said to have a nature of “mean reversion,” that is a sign reversal in the next change is
more likely, given a history of a run.
         In the data, the conditional probability of a run may be different from
theoretical probability with an assumption of random walk. Table 1 shows the number
of samples of a run. For example, N=2 (+) shows the number of runs that have two
consecutive increases in the prices. Five kinds of prices are considered in this sample:
(1) bid quote; (2) ask quote; (3) mid-price quote; (4) bid-side quote; and (5) ask-side
quote.


                                           Table 1


         In the following, we calculate the conditional probability of equation (1) for
five different kinds of prices: bid quote, ask quote, mid-price of bid and ask quotes,
bid-side deal price, and ask-side deal price. The probability is calculated up to 13
successive (either positive or negative) changes. In calculating probability, Saturdays,
Sundays and Mondays are excluded from the data set.16


3.2. Results
Figures 1-1 through 1-5 show the conditional probability of price changes in USD/JPY,
Figures 2-1 through 2-5 show the conditional probability of EUR/USD. In each figure,
the horizontal axis shows numbers of successive positive/negative price revisions. The
probability at n=0 can provide an unconditional test of the random walk hypothesis. The
conditional probability at n=j, for example, indicates the probability of price
increase/decrease in the next price change after j successive price hike (down).



15
  Therefore there is no “double counting” of a run. That is, a run of four successive
changes (++++) in the same direction contain two successive changes and three
successive changes as a subset of the four successive change, they are not counted in the
N=2, or N=3 definitions.
16
  Mondays are excluded because many national holidays fall into Mondays.   The patterns of price
changes on Monday are slightly different from other business days.


                                                                                               7
3.3. Conditional probability, USD/JPY
Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show the calculated conditional probability of bid and ask price for
currency pair of USD/JPY, respectively. As is clear from these figures, similar patterns
of price movement are seen in both bid and ask prices. At n=0, the probability of
positive revision (white square) is slightly above 0.5 and the probability of negative
revision (black circle) is slightly below 0.5 for bid price. This means that the bid price is
more likely to be revised higher. The result is opposite for the ask price: At n=0, the
probability of negative revision (black circle) is slightly above 0.5 and the probability of
positive revision (white square) is slightly below 0.5 for ask price. The ask price is more
likely to be revised lower. Putting two results together, it implies that at n=0, the
bid-ask spread tends to narrow, but the difference from neutral (P=0.5) is very slight.
         At n between 1 and 9, the conditional probability of a run, either pluses or
minuses, is substantially below 0.5 for both bid and ask prices. This implies that there is
a mean-reversion tendency both for bid and ask prices. Probabilities of successive
positive price changes (white square) is higher than that of negative price changes
(black circle) for bid price (and vice versa for ask price), while they are far below 0.5.
As n becomes larger, the probability tends to converge toward 0.5.
         The conditional probability of mid-price for USD/JPY is shown in figure 1-3.
The pattern of the mid-price probability is an average of bid and ask price patterns. No
significance is detected between the probabilities of positive price revisions and
negative revisions. For n=0, the conditional probability is almost exactly 0.5, i.e.,
consistent with a random walk hypothesis. However, for n between 1 and 7, the
conditional probability is significantly below 0.5, indicating mean reversion, but as n
becomes larger, price revisions become closer to unpredictable (P=0.5). Conditional
probability becomes significantly larger than 0.5 for a run of more than 10 successive
positive price revision (white square).   Negative quote changes are mean reversion in a
small-number (n<6) run, but become a momentum after a large-enough-number run.
        Figures 1-4 and 1-5 show the conditional probability of bid-side deal and
ask-side deal prices of USD/JPY, respectively. It is clear from these figures that
patterns of the conditional probability for deal prices are quite different from those of
quote prices in some important ways.


                                     Figures 1-1—1-5


         The probability of having a run of ask-side deal price increases (white square in


                                                                                           8
Figure 1-5) is higher than 0.5, and so is a run of bid-side deal price decreases (black
circle in Figure 1-4). Once the price starts to rise on the ask side—that is, the buyer
initiated deals—then the price increases tend to continue (P>0.5). Similarly, once the
price starts to decline on the bid side—that is, the seller-initiated deals—then the price
decreases tend to continue (P>0.5). These results are quite in contrast to results implied
by quote price movements, and quite consistent with a real-world conventional view
that there are some moments in time when a momentum is formed. When the buyers are
eager to hit the ask quotes, and starts to drive up the prices, then this creates a
momentum to push prices up further. Having deals is important in this process.
Similarly, when sellers hit bid-prices, driving down the prices, with deals, this creates
downward momentum. These movements support a view that momentum strategy is a
winning strategy while the run continues. The run tends to continue for two to nine
ticks.
        The positive price change for bid-side deal prices (white square in Figure 1-4)
does not have a tendency of a run, but a mean reversion, and so does the negative price
change for ask-side deal prices (black circle in Figure 1-5).
         As for deal bid prices, for 0≤ n ≤4, conditional probability of negative price
revision is around 0.55-0.58. Then it gradually declines to 0.53 at n=8. The probability
of longer than 9-successive negative price revisions is not significantly different from
0.5. In contrast, the probability of positive price revision is 0.42-0.43 for n=1 and 2,
and it remains stable around P=0.45 up to n=9. The probability of longer than
10-successive positive price revision is not significantly different from 0.5. Once the
bid-side deal prices (seller-initiated deals) starts to decline, then a run of the same sign
tends to continue.
         Conditional probability of ask deal price has the exactly opposite pattern to that
of bid deal price. The conditional probability of positive price revision is around
0.56-0.58 and higher than that for negative price changes. One of the contrasts to deal
bid price is that the longer than 7-successive positive price revisions disappears.


3.4. Conditional probability, EUR/USD
Figures 2-1 and 2-2 show the conditional probability of bid and ask prices, respectively,
for currency pair of EUR/USD. The patterns are quite comparable to those of the
USD/JPY. In both ask and bid price revisions, the conditional probability at n=0
equals almost 0.5, indicating that the quote price moves more or less randomly. The
conditional probability is lower than 0.5 at n>0, indicating that it is not likely that the
quote prices tend to show mean reversion—the change following positive change tends


                                                                                          9
to be negative, and vice versa. However, the conditional probability converges to 0.5
as n becomes higher, and power of mean reversion wanes.
          Figure 2-3 shows the conditional probability of mid-price quote for EUR/USD.
The pattern of the probability is similar to that of the USD/JPY. First, the conditional
probability pattern shows that the quote price change shows no unconditional expected
change (P0=0.5), while it shows mean reversion at 1<n<6. Second, conditional
probability becomes neutral (P=0.5) after n>7. Third, conditional probability of 10 or
longer successive positive price revisions (white square) becomes significantly larger
than 0.5. The last feature is in contrast to USD/JPY where negative price revisions
become a momentum after n > 10.
         Figures 2-4 and 2-5 show the conditional probability of bid-side and ask-side
deal prices, respectively. Similar to USD/JPY, a run tends to continue (P>0.5) for a
negative run of bid-side deal price, and for a positive run of ask-side deal prices. Again,
buying pressure (buyer-initiated deals) generates a positive run, and selling pressure
(seller-initiated deals) generates a negative run. As n becomes larger, the conditional
probability converges toward 0.5.
          The positive price change for bid-side deal prices does not have a tendency of a
run, but rather a mean reversion, and so does the negative price change for ask-side deal
prices.
        Similar analysis for the EUR/JPY has been conducted, but the patterns are the
same, and results are less robust (wider standard error) so that it is not presented here.


                                     Figures 2-1—2-5


          In summary, several salient features are detected regarding the conditional
probability of a run. First, the USD/JPY and EUR/USD show similar patters with regard
to patterns of conditional probability for a run for five different kinds of prices. Second,
patterns for quote price changes are quite different from patterns for deal price changes.
The quote prices tend to show mean reversion (i.e., conditional probability of a run is
less than 0.5), regardless of a positive run or a negative run, either for bid or ask quotes.
For deal prices, buyer-initiated deal prices (ask-side deal prices) tend to have a
continuous positive run (i.e., conditional probability of a run of positive changes to
continue exceeds 0.5), and seller-initiated deal prices (bid-side deal prices) tend to have
a tendency of a continuous negative run. The contrast is striking, and this shows that
any study based on quote prices will be misleading in describing how transactions are
proceeding in the market. Once a “momentum” measured by deal prices fueled by


                                                                                          10
buying pressure or selling pressure is formed, the momentum tends to continue.



4. Size of price change in the continuous quotes/deals
4.1. Acceleration or Deceleration?
In this section, the size of price change is examined. When a run is detected (i.e.,
ask-side positive run and bid-side negative run), is it more likely that the step of
increase or decrease becomes larger (acceleration in momentum)?     This question is
interesting for the following reasons.
          As the momentum trading works for several ticks (ask-side deals and bid-side
deals), that is, the conditional probability is above 0.5, those who detect this momentum
may want to join the bandwagon. It may be conjectured that those one-side movement
may gather force until the momentum stops and possibly followed by a sharp reversal.
The process of momentum and an eventual stop may be a reflection of a (rational)
“bubble” phenomenon, if a stop means a correction of a significant degree, following
acceleration of momentum. A rational bubble requires a process that a higher degree
of correction has to be compensated by a larger step toward the end of the bubble
process. This kind of a pattern is known as a stochastic bubble.
        In contrast, a run may stop without having a reversal in the price. The run
results in finding a new equilibrium level. Pattern 1 is a typical bubble process if the
increase is followed by a significant amount of drop. Pattern 2 indicates a process that
is a convergence to a new equilibrium after digesting some fundamental news. In order
to distinguish the process, we first examine whether the step of increase or decrease
would become larger or smaller as the run continues.

                                      Patterns 1, 2


        In the following, we analyze the size of price change in successive
quotes/deals.


                  Size of price change = price(t+n) - price(t)     (2)


         We calculate the size of price change for the phase of price increase only (or
price decrease only) for n successive quotes/deals. Four types of prices are used for
calculation: bid, ask, midprice, deals done on the bid side and deals done on the ask
side.


                                                                                      11
        Results are shown in figures 3-1 through 3-5 for USDJPY; and figures 4-1
through 4-5 for EURUSD. In each figure, the vertical axis shows the cumulative price
increment (or decrease) and the horizontal axis shows the successive price increase (or
decrease). The white circles show the price path of continuous price increase and
black circles show the price path of continuous price decline. The symmetric dashed
straight lines indicate the smallest cumulative change of n-successive price increase
(decrease). The minimum price increase/decrease is called “pip” and its size is 0.01
for USD/JPY; and 0.0001 for EUR/USD.
         Figure 3-1 shows a run of rise or fall of bid quotes for USD/JPY. As seen in
the figure, the price paths of both the continuous rise and fall are linear up to n=10,
indicating that the size of incremental increase or decrease is almost constant at each
quote change. The size is slightly larger than the minimum increment (“pip”) when bid
prices are falling, while it is almost equal to the minimum increment, when bid prices
are rising. The decreasing step for the bid quote becomes much larger when n>10.
         Figure 3-2 shows the price rise or fall of ask quotes for USD/JPY. Again, the
change in the price is linear up to n=10. The size of ask quote change is larger when
the price is going up than when the price is going down. They are almost linear up to
n=10. In contrast to the case with bid quote, the size of price increases is larger than the
size of price decreases.
         Figure 3-3 shows the Midprice of bid and ask quotes for USDJPY. Again, the
price paths of price increase/fall are linear up to n=12, and they are almost symmetric.
The decrease of the mid-price quotes after n=12 accelerates, while no such acceleration
is detected in the rise of mid-price quote.
          Figures 3-4 and 3-5 show the rise and fall of deal price run. The pattern
shows the contrast to the run of bid/ask quotes. The path of price increase (white
circle) for deal bid is well above the straight line, indicating that the size of continuous
price increase is larger than the continuous price fall in the run of bid-side deals, and
while the sizes of continuous price fall is larger than sizes of price increase in the run of
ask-side deals. In figure 3-5, at n=12 or larger, it is found that the ask-side deal price
fall accelerates: when transaction price continues to fall for more than 12 times, the
selling price starts falling faster.
         As argued above, the price increase with buying pressure tends to exhibit a
positive run of the ask-side deal price and the price decrease with selling pressure tends
to exhibit a negative run of the bid-side deal price. For these price changes no
acceleration is detected.




                                                                                          12
                                           Figures 3-1—3-5


           Figures 4-1 through 4-5 show the price paths for EURUSD. Figure 4-1 shows
the price increment/fall of bid quotes. Similar to the case for bid quotes of USDJPY,
the price paths of continuous rise/fall are linear up to n=12, and the sizes of price fall
(black circle) is a bit wider than that of price increase.
           Figure 4-2 shows the price paths of ask quotes. In contrast to the bid quotes, the
size of price increase is larger than the size of price fall. The paths of price rise/fall are
linear up to n=8. The pace of price increase accelerates after n=10, indicating that the
ask quote price increases once the quote price start increasing. Figure 4-3 shows
midprice of bid and ask quotes of EURUSD.                Again, the price paths of price
increase/fall are linear and almost symmetric.


                                      Figures 4-1—4-5


         Figures 4-4 and 4-5 show the price path of a run of deal price changes. The size
of price increase is slightly wider than the size of price fall for deals on bid side, and
vise versa for deal prices on ask side. In both cases, the price paths are almost linear
and there is no evidence that the price soars once deal price starts increasing.
         In summary, there is no difference in patterns of price paths between the two
currency pairs. It is found that the price increases (decreases) tend to accelerate as price
continues to rise (fall). The size at each price change is mostly constant regardless of
its price—bid, ask, midprice, deals done on the bid side, or deals done on the ask side.


4.2. Size of Correction after a run
In this section, we test whether the size of an opposite movement at the termination of a
run becomes larger as the number of a run so far is larger and whether the cumulative
increases (decreases) during the run becomes disproportionately larger. The following
specifications are adopted for examinations:

| Δp n +1 | = α + βn + ε n+1         (3)


        After the run with the length of n, the direction of the price movement reverses,
shown in Δpn+1. Ifβ=0, then there is no relation between the size of a correction and
the length of a run. The run is more likely associated with a transition from an old
equilibrium to a new equilibrium. On the other hand, if β>0, then the longer the run,


                                                                                           13
the larger the correction. This will be a suggestive evidence of a speculative bubble.
This would suggest a scenario that the price deviates from a fundamental value and then
crashes back to a fundamental value. Recall panels 4-1 and 4-2 for the two cases,
respectively.
         The second specification of the same test is to use the cumulative price change
rather than the just a number of the successive changes.

                       n
| Δp n +1 | = α + β ∑ Δp j + ε n +1          (4)
                      j =1



            n
Where    ∑  j =1
                   Δp j denotes the cumulative price change of the run in the length of n.   The

interpretation of β is the same as equation (3). In addition, ifβ=1, then all the
cumulative change is wiped out in one change after the run.
         Table 2-1 and Table 2-2 summaries the regression results of equation (3) and
(4), respectively. In each regression, β is estimated for either a run with positive price
changes only (increase), or a run with negative price changes (decrease). “All” shows
the estimated coefficient of β using all of the run.


                                           Tables 2-1, 2-2


            As shown in Table 2-1, β is estimated significantly positive in all cases
regardless of the currency pairs. This implies that the longer the run, the larger the
correction. We also find that the size of a correction is larger after the run with price
increase than the run of price fall for ask and/or deal price on the ask side. On the
other hand, the size of a correction is larger after the price decrease run than the price
increase run for bid and/or deal price on the bid side. Note that price increases here
means the yen depreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar, and the dollar depreciates vis-à-vis
the euro.
            The estimation results of equation (4) is shown in Table 2-2. Again, β is
estimated significantly positive in all cases regardless of the currency pairs. That is, the
larger the cumulative price increases (decreases), the size of price revision after the run
will be larger. We also find the similar patterns in the coefficient—the size of correction
is larger after the run of price increase than the run of price fall for ask and/or deal price
on the ask side, and vice versa for bid and/or deal price on the bid side.




                                                                                              14
5. Concluding remarks
In this paper, a random walk hypothesis is refuted in a simple test of a run—continuous
increases or decreases in quote prices and deal prices—using tick-by-tick exchange rate
data. Several questions exploiting the tick-by-tick data have been examined in this
paper. Will the changes in ask (bid) deal prices, as well as ask (bid) quote prices, be
influenced by the previous transactions? If a deal price goes up from its previous deal,
then will the next deal price be more likely to go up or not? How long do prices
continue to increase (decrease)? How about the size of price changes? We have
examined the patterns of quote activities and transaction activities in foreign exchange
market using a very rich data set.
        The main findings are as follows. First, conditional probability that the price is
to be revised in the same direction is lower than 0.5 for both bid and ask quotes.
Therefore, the quote price moves more like in a mean-reverting manner. On the
contrary, deal prices are more likely to continue rising or falling. For deal prices done
on the bid side, conditional probability that the price is revised lower exceeds 0.5.
Similarly, for deal prices done on the ask side, conditional probability that the price is
revised higher exceeds 0.5. Second, we do not see the size of price increment/fall at
each transaction (quote) is widening or shrinking as a run continues. Again, regardless
of currency pairs, the size of price fall is larger than that of price increase in bid-quote
prices, and vice versa in ask-quote prices. In contrast, size of price increase is larger
than that of price fall for deals done on the bid side, and vise versa for deals done on the
ask side. Third, we estimate the size of price correction after the continuous price
increase (decrease). The absolute size of price correction is larger when a run becomes
longer. It is also found that the absolute size of price correction is larger when the
cumulative change in price in a run is larger.
         What is found at a very high-frequency level in exchange rate markets is that
the exchange rate mostly follows random walk, but there appears a so-called mini
bubble once exchange rate starts rising (falling). This was evident in the conditional
probability of a deal price run, and the size of correction after a run.
