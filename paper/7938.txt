                                   1   Introduction

The problems facing European labor markets are well-known, and a large literature tries
to explain how unemployment could be so high for such a long time in a number of Eu-
ropean economies (see, for example, Layard, Nickell, and Jackman, 1991; Bean, 1994 or
Nickell, 1997 for reviews). Most economists believe that the rigid labor market institutions
of European economies are, at least in part, responsible for the high rates of European un-
employment. In a recent review Siebert put this in a stark form: ‚ÄúLabor Market Rigidities:
At the Root of Unemployment in Europe‚Äù (see also Lazear, 1992).
   It would not be an unfair statement, however, to say that the economics profession is
still at a loss in understanding the European unemployment phenomenon. Although the
idea that labor market rigidities cause unemployment is plausible, there have been only
a few major changes in the institutions of European economies over the 1970‚Äôs to lead to
the high rates of unemployment of the 1980‚Äôs and 1990‚Äôs (see, for example, Nickell, 1997).
For this reason, many economists have emphasized not only institutions, but also other
macroeconomic changes.
   The famous Krugman hypothesis, for example, explains the increase in European un-
employment as a result of the interaction between skill-biased technical change and labor
market institutions (Krugman, 1994, OECD, 1994). Adrian Wood (1994) similarly ar-
gues that increased international trade put downward pressure on the wages of less skilled
workers, and unemployment resulted because the rigid European labor markets prevented
unskilled wages from falling. More recently, Ball (1997) and Blanchard and Wolfers (1999)
have emphasized the interaction between macroeconomic shocks, such as disin‚Ä°ation, the
slowdown in TFP growth and the increase in the real interest rates, and the rigid labor
market institutions as an explanation for European unemployment.
   Nevertheless, it is di¬¢cult to generate large responses to any of these shocks. For
example, the evidence is hard to reconcile with skill-biased technical change being the
driving force of unemployment in Europe (e.g., Nickell and Bell, 1996; Card, Kramartz and
Lemieux, 1998; Kruger and Pischke, 1998). Similarly, the e¬§ect of increased international
trade seems relatively small (see, for example, Krugman, 1995; Lawrence and Slaughter,


                                             1
1994). Macroeconomic shocks, on the other hand, do not appear to be large enough to
lead to such a persistent e¬§ect. Although disin‚Ä°ation during the early 1980‚Äôs could have
increased unemployment, it is only an extreme degree of hysteresis that can sustain very
high levels of unemployment for over twenty years. Similarly, in most standard models, a
permanent slowdown in TFP or a permanent increase in the interest rate only have a small
e¬§ect on the unemployment rate.
      This assessment of the state of literature on unemployment suggests that we need new
ways of looking at the unemployment problem. This paper makes a preliminary attempt
at developing an alternative hypothesis.1 I develop the thesis that di¬§erences in the credit
markets may have played an important role in the increase in European unemployment.
To develop this idea as simply as possible, I will abstract from labor market rigidities, and
focus only on di¬§erences in credit markets. In addition to illustrating the importance of
credit market problems in causing unemployment di¬§erences, the model presented here is a
simple starting point for analyzing the joint behavior of access to credit and labor market
prices.
      Credit markets di¬§er in many dimensions between the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S.,
stock market activity, venture capital ‚Ä¶nance, and funding of small businesses appear more
important than in Europe. In contrast, in Europe, lending by large banks appear to play a
more prominent role. Most measures in fact show that credit markets are more developed in
the U.S. than in Europe (e.g. Rajan and Zingales, 1998). I will make a heroic abstraction
from the many complexities, and presume that the U.S. credit market is more ‚Ä°exible in
providing loans to new ‚Ä¶rms. The main argument in the paper is that this di¬§erence in
the way in which credit markets respond to new opportunities is an important contributor
to the di¬§erent employment performances in these economies.
      Even though, as I show below, coordination failures can lead to a high unemployment
equilibrium in an economy with imperfect credit markets, di¬§erences in credit markets will
often not have large e¬§ects on steady state unemployment rates, because entrepreneurs
  1
    Previously, Krueger and Pischke (1998) argued that di¬§erences in product market competition could
be important in understanding European unemployment. A recent paper by Wasmer and Weil (2000)
provides a simple model combining labor and credit market imperfections, and shows that credit market
imperfections tend to increase unemployment. Another recent paper by Blanchard and Giavazzi (2000)
emphasizes the interaction between product markets and labor markets, while Bertrand and Kramartz
(2000) investigate the impact of the zoning restrictions in France on employment creation.



                                                 2
who need credit will get it eventually. However, in the medium run, the failure to channel
money to the correct entrepreneurs can have a large e¬§ect on unemployment. To capture
these issues, I think of the U.S. and Europe during the 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs as characterized
by the steady state of two economies, one with better credit markets than the other.
Unemployment in both economies will be low to start with. I will then consider the response
of these two economies to a common shock: the arrival of a new set of technologies. The
main result is that the economy with better credit markets will respond to the arrival of
new technologies without an increase in unemployment. In contrast, in the economy with
worse credit markets (the model equivalent of Europe), the change in technologies can
have a persistent adverse e¬§ect on unemployment because, in the absence of e¬¢cient credit
markets, the agents who need to have the cash to start up new businesses cannot borrow
the necessary funds. They have to accumulate this cash through their own savings (or rely
on more expensive alternative sources of ‚Ä¶nance, such as borrowing from their family), so
the economy goes through an extended period of depressed job creation. Accumulation by
potential entrepreneurs may be made even more di¬¢cult by the fact that in a depressed
labor market, unemployment will be high and wages low, so earnings for many individuals
will be low. So a set of self-reinforcing factors slow down the transition of the economy to
low unemployment for an extended period.
   The idea that there has been a change in technology (or the pattern of comparative
advantage), and that the U.S. has adapted to this change faster than Europe is plausible.
Many commentators think that the engines of growth of the U.S. economy today is not
companies like Ford or GM, but new ‚Ä¶rms like Microsoft and Intel, which require di¬§erent
skills, and perhaps di¬§erent types of ‚Ä¶nancial arrangements. Nevertheless, more empirical
evidence is necessary to assess the importance of these factors in explaining European
unemployment. As a preliminary attempt I look at the evolution of sectoral employment
across OECD countries.     I classify manufacturing industries into high, medium and low
credit-dependent categories following Rajan and Zingales (1998), and look at whether the
most credit-dependent industries, such as electronics and o¬¢ce and computer equipment,
grew slower in Europe since 1970. I ‚Ä¶nd no evidence for a major di¬§erential growth across
these sectors. This result is not encouraging for the credit market story. Nevertheless,
I ‚Ä¶nd that the fraction of employment in the most credit-dependent industries is higher



                                             3
in the U.S., suggesting that di¬§erences in credit markets may be playing some role in
constraining employment creation in Europe. Furthermore, it might be argued that what
is more relevant is not growth of speci‚Ä¶c industries, but job creation by new ‚Ä¶rms within
all industries. The data I have do not enable an investigation of whether there has been
less employment creation by new ‚Ä¶rms in Europe than the U.S. over the past 25 years.
This is an interesting research area for future work.

                                        2    The Model

Consider an economy that consists of a mass 1 of agents who live for one period, and
are replaced by an o¬§spring.        Each agent can become an entrepreneur, a worker, or
remain unemployed. Production takes place in worker-entrepreneur pairs. Agents di¬§er
in their skills. Let ¬Æi;t be the type of agent i of generation t. Then, if agent i becomes an
entrepreneur and hires worker j with type ¬Æj;t , they produce

                                            3¬Æi;t + ¬Æj;t :                                      (1)

This form of the production function implies that skills of both the entrepreneur and the
worker matter for productivity, but that of the entrepreneur is more important.2 I assume
that the distribution of ¬Æ in the population is given by Gt (¬Æ) with lower support ¬Æmin and
upper support ¬Æmax .
      All agents have preferences given by

                                  (1 ¬° s)1¬°s ss Ci;t
                                                 1¬°s s
                                                     Bi;t ¬° ei;t ;

where C is consumption, B is bequest left to their o¬§spring, and e is cost of e¬§ort. This
utility function is convenient as it implies a constant saving rate, s. It also implies that
the indirect utility function is linear, in particular U (y) = y ¬° e; where y is income, so that
all agents are risk neutral.
      I also assume that the cost of e¬§ort is given as follows
                               8
                               < ¬∞W      if worker and exert e¬§ort
                          e=       0 if worker and exert no e¬§ort
                               :
                                  ¬∞E           if entrepreneur
  2
   The fact that the productivity of the entrepreneur is three times more important than that of the
worker is to simplify some of the expressions below.

                                                  4
                                                    ¬∞ E ¬°¬∞ W
where ¬∞ W < ¬∞ E . For future use, I de‚Ä¶ne ¬¢¬∞ ¬¥          2
                                                               . The e¬§ort choice of an individual
is his private information. In contrast, the skill level of a worker is common knowledge.
   For the analysis, it is important that the ability to perform entrepreneurial tasks are
correlated across generations. I adopt a particularly simple form of this here, and assume
that the type of agents do not change across generations, i.e., ¬Æi;t = ¬Æi;t¬°1 for all i.
   The fact that workers need to exert costly e¬§ort that is not observed by others introduces
a moral hazard problem. Workers need to be induced to exert e¬§ort through monetary
incentives. I assume that if the worker does not exert e¬§ort, output will be high with
probability q, and 0 with probability 1 ¬° q.       In contrast, if he exerts e¬§ort, output will
be high with probability 1.    The wage contract of a worker of type ¬Æ has to encourage
him to exert e¬§ort as in the standard e¬¢ciency wage model. I assume that negative wages
are not possible, so w (¬Æ) ¬∏ 0. Since all agents are risk neutral, a worker who produces
no output will get a zero wage. Therefore, the utility to shirking (not exerting e¬§ort) is
qw (¬Æ) whereas the utility to exerting e¬§ort is w (¬Æ) ¬° e. This implies that to encourage
e¬§ort, the wage, w (¬Æ), needs to be greater than

                                      v ¬¥ (1 ¬° q)¬°1 ¬∞ W :

I assume that it is always in the interest of the entrepreneurs to encourage high e¬§ort.
Hence, there is an incentive compatibility constraint (the equivalent of the no-shirking
condition in the Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984, model) which requires that wages for all possible
types of workers satisfy

                                          w (¬Æ) ¬∏ v:                                         (IC)

Finally, to become an entrepreneur, an individual needs an investment of 2K.
   The exact timing of events is as follows. At the beginning of the period, each agent
decides to become an entrepreneur or a worker. If there is a credit market, entrepreneurs
borrow the necessary funds, otherwise they have to use their own wealth. Entrepreneurs
hire workers, production takes place, and they pay back the loans. Finally, consumption
and bequest decisions are made. The labor market is Walrasian except for the presence of
the moral hazard constraint (see, e.g., Acemoglu and Newman, 1997).
   Since there is no discounting within a period, an entrepreneur who borrows an amount
2K at the beginning of the period has to pay back 2K. So the utility of an entrepreneur

                                               5
of type ¬Æ employing a worker of type ¬Æ0 as a function of the wage, w (¬Æ), is

                            UE (¬Æ; ¬Æ0 ) = 3¬Æ + ¬Æ0 ¬° w (¬Æ0 ) ¬° 2K ¬° ¬∞ E ;                            (2)

where 3¬Æ + ¬Æ0 is the revenue that this employment relationship generates, 2K is the cost
of capital, and ¬∞ E is the e¬§ort cost. Since the labor market is competitive, in equilibrium
an entrepreneur has to obtain the same level of pro‚Ä¶ts from hiring two di¬§erent workers.
Therefore, UE (¬Æ; ¬Æ0 ) = UE (¬Æ; ¬Æ00 ), for all ¬Æ0 and ¬Æ00 that are workers. This implies that
the equilibrium wage contract has to take the simple linear form

                                         w (¬Æ0 ) = w ¬§ + ¬Æ0 ;                                       (3)

where the constant term, w¬§ will adjust to clear the market. The incentive compatibility
constraint, (IC), imposes a wage ‚Ä°oor and implies that workers with w¬§ + ¬Æ0 ¬∑ v, i.e., with

                                         ¬Æ0 ¬∑ ¬Æ ¬¥ v ¬° w¬§ ;                                          (4)

will be unemployed. Intuitively, their contribution to the revenues of the ‚Ä¶rm falls short of
the wage that they have to be paid to solve the moral hazard problem.
       Along the equilibrium path, all employed workers exert e¬§ort, so the utility to becoming
a worker for an agent with ¬Æ0 ¬∏ v ¬° w¬§ is

                                      UW (¬Æ0 ) = w¬§ + ¬Æ0 ¬° ¬∞ W                                      (5)

       Combining eqs. (2) and (5), we obtain that all individuals with skill level greater than

                                        ¬Æ¬§ ¬¥ w¬§ + K + ¬¢¬∞                                            (6)

would like to become entrepreneurs. Whether they can do so or not will depend on the
availability of credit.3

                  3   Equilibrium Without Credit Market Frictions

The equilibrium with credit market frictions is relatively easy to characterize since all
agents who want to become an entrepreneur can obtain ‚Ä¶nance. Let me de‚Ä¶ne the wage
   3
     It is also possible that workers with ability less than ¬Æ, who cannot become workers because of the
wage constraint, might want to become entrepreneurs. I assume that 3¬Æ ¬° w¬§ ¬° 2K ¬° ¬∞ E < 0, which rules
this possibility out. So workers with low ability will be unemployed.

                                                   6
function that is consistent with full employment, wm (¬Æ) = wm + ¬Æ, in the absence of credit
market frictions. Let ¬Æm be the median of the distribution of ¬Æ (i.e., G (¬Æm ) = 1=2). For
full employment, half of the agents need to become entrepreneurs. Without credit market
frictions, this implies that all agents with ¬Æ greater than ¬Æm should become entrepreneurs.
Hence, the median agent should be indi¬§erent between entrepreneurship and working for
the equilibrium wage, w (¬Æm ) = wm + ¬Æm .          Therefore, the full employment equilibrium
wage function must satisfy

                                    wm = ¬Æm ¬° K ¬° ¬¢¬∞:

   Since my focus is on the interaction between credit market frictions and unemployment,
I impose that the lower support of the ability distribution, ¬Æmin , is less than w m :

Assumption 1: ¬Æmin < wm ;

which implies that full employment will not be an equilibrium.
   Equilibrium is now characterized by a cuto¬§ level of ability ¬Æ satisfying equation (4) to
become a worker, a cuto¬§ level of ability ¬Æ¬§ for entrepreneurship that satis‚Ä¶es equation (6),
the wage function (3), and a market clearing condition. This market clearing condition
requires that the number of entrepreneurs is equal to the number of workers, or

                                1 ¬° G (¬Æ¬§ ) = G (¬Æ¬§ ) ¬° G (¬Æ) ;                            (7)

where 1 ¬° G (¬Æ¬§ ) is the number of agents with ability greater than the cuto¬§ level, ¬Æ¬§ ,
who become entrepreneurs, and G (¬Æ¬§ ) ¬° G (¬Æ) is the number of agents who are not skilled
enough to be entrepreneurs, but have a su¬¢cient skill level to be employed. Equation (7) is
a simple supply equals demand condition. The left-hand side, is the demand for labor, and
since ¬Æ¬§ is increasing in w¬§ , demand falls as the price of labor increases. The right-hand
side is the supply of labor, which is a strictly increasing function of w¬§ . Figure 1 shows the
determination of the unique equilibrium wage function, i.e., w¬§ . Once w¬§ is determined,
the unemployment level is given by G (v ¬° w¬§ ).

                               response to an increase in ¬¢¬∞ or K.

Proposition 1 There exists a unique steady state equilibrium characterized by (¬Æ; ¬Æ¬§ ; w ¬§ )
given by equations (4), (6), and (7). In this equilibrium, all agents with skill level greater
than ¬Æ¬§ become entrepreneurs, all agents with skill level ¬Æ0 2 [¬Æ; ¬Æ¬§ ] become workers and
receive a wage w (¬Æ0 ) = w ¬§ + ¬Æ0 and all agents with skill level ¬Æ < ¬Æ are unemployed.

   The comparative statics of this equilibrium are straightforward, and can be obtained
using Figure 1.   Increases in K or ¬¢¬∞ make entrepreneurship less attractive, shift both
the supply and demand curves down to the broken curves, and lead to a lower equilibrium
wage intercept w¬§¬§ . As a result, both ¬Æ¬§ and ¬Æ increase, so there are fewer entrepreneurs,
and more unemployed workers.
   It is useful to characterize the steady state wealth distribution, even though the wealth
distribution does not a¬§ect the equilibrium allocation in this economy without credit market
frictions. First, notice that all agents who want to become an entrepreneur hire a worker.

Therefore, entrepreneur ¬Æ will leave bequest of Bt+1 (¬Æ) = s (Bte (¬Æ) + 3¬Æ ¬° w¬§ ¬° 2K) since
he received a bequest of Bte (¬Æ) from his parent, invested 2K, paid a wage of w¬§ + ¬Æ0 for
a worker of ability ¬Æ0 , and produced 3¬Æ + ¬Æ0 . He consumes a fraction 1 ¬° s of this, and
leaves a fraction s as bequest. In steady state, Bte (¬Æ) = Bt+1

     The steady-state wealth distribution for workers, i.e. those with ability ¬Æ 2 [¬Æ; ¬Æ¬§ ], is
                                 w
given similarly. In particular, Bt+1 (¬Æ) = s (Btw (¬Æ) + ¬Æ + w¬§ ). So

                                                  s (¬Æ + w¬§ )
                                     B w (¬Æ) =                :
                                                     1¬°s
Finally, those workers with ability ¬Æ < ¬Æ will be unemployed, therefore their steady state
wealth level will be B u = 0.

                   4   Equilibrium with Credit Market Frictions

Note that in the economy without credit market frictions, equilibrium prices determine the
distribution of wealth, but are themselves not in‚Ä°uenced by the distribution of wealth (i.e.,
the system is block-recursive).     In contrast, in an economy with credit market frictions,
the equilibrium depends on the wealth level of individuals with high skill, who need to
undertake the up-front investment 2K.          This feedback raises the possibility of multiple
steady state equilibria and richer dynamics.
     Here I assume an extreme form of credit market frictions: there is no borrowing (e.g.,
an individual could runaway with the money he has borrowed without any risk of being
caught).    In this case, we need to determine the equilibrium allocation jointly with the
steady-state wealth distribution. Let me denote the steady-state wealth distribution by
F (b j ¬Æ), i.e. this is the fraction of workers with ability ¬Æ who have wealth level less than
b.
   Then, the market clearing condition in this economy with credit market frictions is
 Z                        Z
           ¬Ω (¬Æ) dG (¬Æ) =          (1 ¬° ¬Ω (¬Æ))dG (¬Æ) + G (K + ¬¢¬∞ + w c ) ¬° G (v ¬° wc ) ;
     K+¬¢¬∞+wc                    K+¬¢¬∞+wc
                                                                                            (8)

where w c is the constant in the equilibrium wage function wc (¬Æ0 ) = wc + ¬Æ0 , and ¬Ω (¬Æ) =
1 ¬° F (2K j ¬Æ) is the fraction of agents with skill level ¬Æ who can a¬§ord to become an en-
                                                                      R
trepreneur, i.e. have wealth greater than 2K. In the expression (8), K+¬¢¬∞+wc ¬Ω (¬Æ) dG (¬Æ)
is the fraction of agents who have skill level greater than K + ¬¢¬∞ + wc and have a wealth

                                                 9
greater than 2K.      So these agents like and can a¬§ord to become entrepreneurs.         The
remainder become workers except those with skill level less than v ¬° wc who cannot be
employed pro‚Ä¶tably.

                   s(¬Æ¬§ +w¬§ )
Assumption 2:         1¬°s
                                > 2K.

   This assumption ensures that in an allocation corresponding to the equilibrium of the
economy with no credit market frictions, a worker with skill level ¬Æ¬§ can accumulate enough
wealth to eventually become an entrepreneur. So in the neighborhood of the equilibrium
of Proposition 1 (i.e. without credit market problems), those agents who need money to
become entrepreneurs can accumulate this money by saving. This implies

Proposition 2 There exists a steady state equilibrium identical to that described in
Proposition 1.

   In contrast to the economy without credit market frictions, the steady-state equilibrium
is no longer unique: there can now exist other steady state equilibria. I will give an example
to illustrate this point. Consider the following situation in which only a fraction ¬∏ of agents
with skill level greater than K + ¬¢¬∞ + w c have enough wealth to become an entrepreneur.
Then, the equilibrium condition can be written as
                            Z
                                                  ¬°     ¬¢
                         2¬∏           dG (¬Æ) + G v ¬° w b = 1:
                                   K+¬¢¬∞+wb


where wb is the constant in the wage function. A lower level of ¬∏ implies a lower equilibrium
wage, and moreover as ¬∏ ! 0, wb ! v ¬° ¬Æmax . Hence, as long as the upper support of the
distribution of skills, ¬Æmax , is not very high (i.e., ¬Æmax < (1 ¬° s) 2K=s), we can always ‚Ä¶nd
                                                              s(¬Æmax +wb )
a level of ¬∏ such that the implied wage level wb satis‚Ä¶es         1¬°s
                                                                           ¬∑ 2K. Then no addi-
tional agent can accumulate enough wealth to become an entrepreneur, and the economy is
                                                                        R
stuck with only a small fraction of entrepreneurs (equal to a fraction ¬∏ K+¬¢¬∞+wb dG (¬Æ) of
the population). Therefore, with credit market frictions, there can exist other steady state
equilibria with higher unemployment and lower wages than the equilibrium characterized
in Proposition 2. Intuitively, another steady-state equilibrium exists because when only a
few of the potential entrepreneurs have enough wealth, there is a limited demand for labor,
and this depresses wages. With depressed wages, it is harder for potential entrepreneurs

                                              10
to accumulate enough wealth to ‚Ä¶nance their investments, and in fact, as the above ex-
ample demonstrates, they may never be able to do so, leading to another steady state
equilibrium with greater unemployment and lower wages.4 This intuition is very similar to
the reasoning for multiplicity of steady states in the Banerjee and Newman (1993) model
of occupational choice.      There, too, di¬§erent wealth distributions can be self-sustaining
because the equilibrium wage rate depends on the distribution of wealth.

                                  5     Change in Technology

I now discuss how economies with and without credit market frictions respond to a change
in technology.     I consider a very simple shift in the distribution of skills, modifying the
pattern of comparative advantage in entrepreneurship. In particular, suppose that G (:)
takes the following speci‚Ä¶c form: a fraction 1 ¬° 2√Å ¬° ¬∑ of agents have a distribution F (¬Æ)
with upper support ¬Æ4 , a fraction √Å have ability ¬Æ1 , and another fraction √Å have skill level
¬Æ3 , and the fraction ¬∑ have skill ¬Æ2 . I assume that

                             a1 > ¬Æ2 > ¬Æ3 > ¬Æ4 ; and 1=2 > ¬∑ > 2√Å:

       Two economies, one with and the other without credit market frictions, are in the
minimum-unemployment steady-state equilibrium (i.e., equivalent to that characterized by
Propositions 1 and 2). In particular, I also assume that ¬Æ1 > ¬Æ2 > ¬Æ¬§ > ¬Æ3 > ¬Æ, so the
agents with skill level ¬Æ1 and ¬Æ2 will become entrepreneurs. This implies that an agent
with skill level ¬Æ2 has to be indi¬§erent between entrepreneurship and working for a wage.
                                  b (¬Æ) = w
So the equilibrium wage function, w       b + ¬Æ, is

                                            b = ¬Æ2 ¬° K ¬° ¬¢¬∞:
                                            w                                                       (9)

                                       b so unemployment is equal to
Using this, I also obtain that ¬Æ = v ¬° w,

                                                              b :
                                      U = (1 ¬° 2√Å ¬° ¬∑) F (v ¬° w)                                   (10)

       Furthermore, I assume that

                                   b
                                 s(w+¬Æ 3)                          b
                                                                 s(w+¬Æ 1)
Assumption 3: B w (¬Æ3 ) =          1¬°s
                                            < 2K < B w (¬Æ1 ) =     1¬°s
                                                                          .
   4
    In terms of Figure 1, this corresponds to the demand for labor being an upward sloping curve because
when wages are low, potential entrepreneurs cannot accumulate the necessary funds to hire workers. As a
result, there can be multiple intersections of supply and demand.

                                                   11
       This assumption ensures that the steady state wealth level of a worker with skill level
¬Æ3 is not enough to a¬§ord the up-front investment for entrepreneurship, while that of a
worker with skill level ¬Æ1 is su¬¢cient for entrepreneurship.
       Now suppose that there is an unanticipated shift in the distribution of skills at time t¬§ ,
and all agents with ¬Æ1 and ¬Æ3 are switched: i.e., those who had skill ¬Æ1 now have ¬Æ3 and vice
versa.5 The economy without any credit market frictions will immediately adjust to this
change, and there will not be any macroeconomic changes‚Äîthe equilibrium is still given
by Proposition 1. In contrast, in the economy with credit market frictions Assumption 3
implies that unemployment increases: at ‚Ä¶rst, agents who previously had productivity ¬Æ3 ,
and now have productivity ¬Æ1 , cannot a¬§ord to become entrepreneurs. The evolution of
unemployment in the economy with credit market frictions now depends on the transitory
dynamics of the model. Transitory dynamics are in general quite complicated, since the
equilibrium wage rate changes as the wealth distribution of agents evolves. Nevertheless,
the speci‚Ä¶c assumptions that I imposed simplify the analysis. In particular, they ensure
                                                                                  b This
that the wage rate is independent of the wealth distribution, and always equal to w.
is because agents with productivity ¬Æ2 continue to be the marginal entrepreneurs, and
equation (9) still determines the equilibria wage. This implies that immediately after the
technology change at t¬§ unemployment increases to

                                                         b + √Å > U:
                               Ut¬§ = (1 ¬° 2√Å ¬° ¬∑) F (v ¬° w)

After this point, the agents (dynasties) who now have skill level ¬Æ1 start accumulating
wealth. Their wealth level at time t¬§ + ¬ø can be written as6
                                                       b
                                                 (¬Æ3 + w)   1 ¬° s¬ø
                          Btw¬§ +¬ø (¬Æ1 ) = s1+¬ø            +                b
                                                                   s (¬Æ1 + w)
                                                   1¬°s      1¬°s
Assumption 3 implies that lim¬ø !1 Btw¬§ +¬ø (¬Æ1 ) > 2K, so there will exist a threshold time ¬ø ¬§
such that at t¬§ + ¬ø ¬§ , Btw¬§ +¬ø ¬§ (¬Æ1 ) exceeds 2K the for the ‚Ä¶rst time. At this point, the agents
with productivity ¬Æ1 become entrepreneurs, and unemployment falls from Ut¬§ to U given
   5
      Perhaps this is too simple, since I am assuming that some I agents become less productive. It is
conceptually straightforward, but the notationally cumbersome to extend the model so that the productivity
of all agents increases over time, and the changing technology can be modeled as some productivities growing
more than others over a certain time period.
                                                                                            b
    6
      To obtain this expression note that at time t¬§ , they start with wealth B w (¬Æ3 ) = s(w+¬Æ3)
                                                                                            1¬°s , and then
  w                w
Bt¬§ +1 (¬Æ1 ) = sB (¬Æ3 ) + s (w b + ¬Æ1 ), etc.

by (10). Therefore, while unemployment is always constant in the economy with perfect
credit markets, it increases upon change of technology in the economy with credit market
frictions.   It stays high persistently between the date of technology change, t¬§ , and the
date t¬§ + ¬ø ¬§ .
    By changing parameters within this simple example we can make the decline in unem-
                                        b
                                      s(w+¬Æ 1)
ployment arbitrarily late (e.g., if     1¬°s
                                                 ' 2K), so this model is capable of generating an
arbitrarily long period of unemployment, or an arbitrary amount of persistence. It is also
useful to note that a potentially important factor contributing to unemployed persistence
is missing in this simple example. In general, with a depressed labor demand, the wage
rate will also fall during transition, and this will make it harder for potential entrepreneurs
to accumulate funds su¬¢cient to ‚Ä¶nance their own businesses. This is in fact exactly the
same force that led to the multiplicity of steady state equilibria in the previous section.

                       6   Empirical Evidence: U.S. vs. Europe

So far I have presented an abstract model of unemployment in the presence of credit market
imperfections. Credit market problems do not necessarily lead to higher unemployment,
though they may introduce additional equilibria with high unemployment levels. The ma-
jor result is that economies with and without credit market frictions respond to changes
in technology quite di¬§erently. In response to a shock that changes which agents have a
comparative advantage in entrepreneurship, an economy without a well-functioning credit
market may su¬§er a lengthy period of unemployment, as productive agents lack the neces-
sary funds to create jobs. This situation is reversed only slowly as these agents gradually
accumulate enough wealth to ‚Ä¶nance their investments.
    It is possible to tell a story of European unemployment based on this model. Europe
and the U.S. had similar unemployment levels during the 1960s because they were both
in a ‚Äústeady state situation‚Äù. A variety of changes during the early 1970s and early 80s
shifted the growth sectors of the economy, requiring di¬§erent entrepreneurs and ‚Ä¶rms to
assume a more important role. This happened relatively quickly the U.S. thanks to a more
‚Ä°uid credit market, especially with institutions like venture capitalists channeling funds to
the rapidly growing high-tech sectors. In contrast, in Europe, lack of funds in the hands
of the people with the right skills slowed down job creation.


                                                   13
       Is there any evidence supporting this story? I end the paper with a quick look at some
sectoral evidence to answer this question.            There are two interpretations of the model.
The ‚Ä¶rst views the ‚Ä¶rms that are constrained in Europe to be those using new technologies
within each sector.       The second maintains that it is ‚Ä¶rms in some particularly credit-
dependent sectors that are most constraint. Although I do not have a way of investigating
the validity of the ‚Ä¶rst version of the story, I can look for support for the second version
using the OECD sectoral database.
       With this purpose, I follow Rajan and Zingales (1998) in classifying sectors according
to their credits dependents in the U.S.. Using the results in Table 1 of these authors, I
classify food, beverages and tobacco, textile, apparel and leather, wood and furniture, paper
and paper products, basic metals, and metal products as low credit-dependent industries;
chemical, coal, rubber and plastic products, metal products, machinery and equipment,
and transport equipment as medium credit-dependent industries, and electrical goods and
o¬¢ce and data processing machine industries are high credit-dependent industries.                       By
focusing on manufacturing, this classi‚Ä¶cation avoids other potential di¬§erences in the U.S.
and European economies in the growth of service sectors, though if service industries are
more credit-dependent, it might understate the importance of credit problems.
       Figure 2 plots the share of employment in a number of European countries in the low,
medium, and high categories relative to the share of the same categories in the U.S..7 If
European unemployment is mainly due to the failure of the European economies to expand
into new sectors because of credit constraints, we would expect these economies to fall
behind the U.S. in the high credit sectors.           In other words, in this case, the curve with
the squares (the high category) should fall relative to the other curves, especially relative
to the circles, which denote the low industries.8              For most countries, all three curves
move in a more or less parallel fashion. In fact, for France and Germany, employment in
high credit-dependent sectors seem to be growing more than another sectors. Therefore,
there is no evidence that European economies have been falling behind the U.S. in the

     The data are from the OECD ISDB data set, and refer to the total number of employees in that sector
relative to total employment. More formally, let elct be¬° total employment

time t, and Ect be total employment. I am plotting elct =Ect = elUSt =EU St . Data for the high category
in Sweden and Finland are missing.

     An increase in all three curves, as in the case of West Germany or Denmark, would correspond to an
increase in the relative share of manufacturing employment compared to the U.S..

    Nevertheless, except for the Netherlands and the UK, European economies appear to
have substantially less employment in the most credit-dependent industries. For example,
in Belgium, Italy and Denmark, relative employment in the least credit-dependent indus-
tries is on average about 50 percent more than in the U.S., while the relative employment
in the most credit-dependent sectors is about 30 percent less than the U.S.. This suggests
that credit market problems may have played some role in constraining employment in

Europe. Interestingly, the UK is commonly thought to have the best credit markets among
the European economies, so it is suggestive that the most credit-dependent industries have
relatively high employment in the UK as well as in the U.S. (though their share in the UK
employment seems to have fallen over the 1980s). These observations give some support
for the idea that credit market problems may have been an important factor in the recent
European employment experience, and encourage further research in this area.
