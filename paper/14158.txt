                                            ABSTRACT

This paper demonstrates that short sales are often misclassified as buyer-initiated by the Lee-Ready
and other commonly used trade classification algorithms. This result is due in part to regulations which
require short sales be executed on an uptick or zero-uptick. In addition, while the literature considers
"immediacy premiums" in determining trade direction, it ignores the often larger borrowing premiums
which short sellers must pay. Since short sales constitute approximately 30% of all trade volume on
U.S. exchanges, these results are important to the empirical market microstructure literature as well
as to measures that rely upon trade classification, such as the probability of informed trading (PIN)
metric.

1. Introduction

        The Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm is widely used to establish the direction of

an equity trade. That is, it classifies whether the transaction is initiated by a buyer or

seller. The issue of trade direction is important in the market microstructure literature,

particularly for information-based trading models. Commercially available trade and

quote data, however, do not include the direction of trades. As a result, empiricists use

the Lee-Ready and other commonly accepted algorithms, such as the tick test and quote

test, to assign trade direction. As of June 1, 2008, the Web of Knowledge lists 290

citations for Lee and Ready (1991), and Google Scholar lists 698. This paper applies the

three algorithms to short sale trades and finds that all three classify the majority of short

sales as buyer-initiated1.

        The tick test classifies a trade as a buy (sell) if the trade price is higher (lower)

than the previous trade. If the current and previous trade prices are the same, the trade is

classified by the next previous trade. Because the test depends on data from previous

trades, transactions at the beginning of the day are not classified. The quote test classifies

a trade as a buy (sell) if the trade price is closer to the ask (bid). This test, however, is

unable to classify those trades priced at the midpoint between the bid and ask. The Lee-

Ready algorithm combines the trade and quote tests to establish trade direction. It first

classifies a trade based on the quote test, then applies the tick test to the trades priced at

the midpoint between the bid and ask.

        Although there is no theoretical framework justifying the Lee-Ready and other

algorithms, empirical studies have typically concluded that these methods are reasonably




                                                                                                 3
accurate. The Lee-Ready algorithm is usually reported as the most accurate, though the

degree of accuracy varies, ranging from 72% to 93%, depending on the study. Tests of

these algorithms, however, run into the same problem that makes them necessary. That is,

there is no good source of trade data that identifies transactions as buyer- or seller-

initiated. Those papers that do test the accuracy of these methods typically use datasets

that are limited in time, have a small sample size, or are from non-U.S. exchanges.

Further, since these limited datasets do not unambiguously identify trades as buyer- or

seller-initiated, researchers are forced to rely upon rules of inference. However, all the

rules of inference that are employed only apply to single-sided market or executable limit

orders, making large portions of the datasets unusable. In addition, all of the current tests

of Lee-Ready algorithm occurred before decimalization in 2001.2 Decimalization has led

to narrower bid-ask spreads, which may make trade classification more difficult.

         The trade direction literature identifies the initiating party by focusing on two

characteristics. First, the initiator is defined as the last party to enter a transaction. Lee

and Radhakrishna (2000), Odders-White (2000) and Ellis et. al. (2000) use this definition.

The rationale is that the first party does not select a price that results in immediate

execution. Rather, the first party acts as a liquidity provider at their chosen price. Second,

the initiator is defined as paying an “immediacy premium” for rapid execution of the

trade, a point that Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) and Odders-White (2000) make. In this

paper, we consider both definitions as they apply to short sales.



1
  We also used the Ellis, Michaely, and O’Hara trade classification algorithm. The EMO results are similar
in size, direction, and statistical significance to all the results reported in this paper. However, since EMO is
less commonly used than the others, to save space, we do not report those results in this paper.
2
  Boehmer, Grammig, and Theissen (2006) use post-decimalization data, but their focus is the impact trade
misclassification has on the probability of informed trading (PIN) estimation.


                                                                                                               4
       This paper applies the three commonly used trade classification algorithms to a

new dataset of short sale transactions for stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ in 2005.

Short sales are unique because a short seller must locate and borrow, at a positive interest

cost, the stock being sold. Short sales are also highly regulated and are subject to the

uptick rule on the NYSE and the bid-price rule on the NASDAQ. For NYSE stocks the

uptick rule requires that a short sale must be executed on an uptick or zero-uptick. For

NASDAQ stocks the bid-price rule requires that a short sale must be executed above the

previous inside bid.

       In this paper we find that the trade classification algorithms overwhelmingly

classify short sales, a unique subset constituting almost 30% of trading volume, as buyer-

initiated. We then address the question of whether short sales are properly classified.

Analyzing the classification algorithms, we find that all three classify about two-thirds of

the short sale trades in our sample as buyer-initiated. This is in part due to the uptick or

bid-price rules mentioned above. In 2005, the SEC exempted a number of stocks from

these rules in a Pilot study. Testing these exempted securities, we find that short sales on

Pilot securities are classified by Lee-Ready as buyer-initiated 52% to 59% of the time

depending on the exchange and time period.

       We demonstrate that the uptick and bid-price rules cause many short sales to be

improperly classified as buyer-initiated. These rules cause short sales to be executed at a

price that is higher in the bid-ask spread. The Lee-Ready and other algorithms reflect this

bias, regardless of the order in which each party entered the transaction. We then consider

the size of a short seller’s execution costs relative to the immediacy premium. At a

minimum, our findings are surprising, and they introduce some concern regarding the




                                                                                               5
accuracy of existing trade classification algorithms. In addition, we raise concerns about

applying the trade classification algorithms to all trades in the TAQ database.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section Two reviews previous

empirical tests of the Lee-Ready and other trade direction algorithms. Section Three

discusses our dataset and methodology. Section Four presents our results. Section Five

discusses implications of applying the Lee-Ready algorithm to trades that contain short

sales. Section Six concludes.

2. Literature Review

       In their 1991 paper defining the algorithm, Lee and Ready examine a sample of

trades for 150 NYSE firms in 1988. They first criticize the tick test, stating that its

primary limitation is its reliance on previous trades, which may not be current. Since

trades may occur several minutes or more apart, they argue that quotes are a better

indicator of current market conditions. However, the paper also identifies two potential

problems with the quote test. The first is that the prevailing quote at the time of a trade

may not be that trade’s associated quote. Specifically, they find that quote changes

resulting from a trade may be recorded ahead of that trade. The Lee-Ready algorithm

addresses this problem by adjusting the quote data to exclude those quotes that occur less

than five seconds before the current trade. The second problem with the quote test is that

trades at the midpoint between the bid and ask are not classifiable. For these trades, the

Lee-Ready algorithm relies on the tick test.

       Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) test the Lee-Ready algorithm using the TORQ

dataset. This database is comprised of 144 NYSE stocks trading during the three-month

period from November 1990 through January 1991. Trade direction is inferred by tracing




                                                                                              6
transactions to the originating party through the use of the NYSE system order file. In an

attempt to ensure that each observation has only one active (initiating) party, the authors

eliminate stopped market orders, market ‘crosses,’ and the pairing of market orders with

executable limit orders. Removing these order types eliminates approximately 40% of the

trades in the TORQ dataset. Lee and Radhakrishna, using a sub-sample of 15 stocks and

129,700 trades, find that the Lee-Ready algorithm has a 93% overall success rate for the

remaining single participant trades. The success rate is highest for those trades at the bid

or ask, with 98% of trades correctly classified. The method is less accurate, 76%, for

midpoint trades classified by the tick test.

       Finucane (2000) uses the TORQ dataset to test the Lee-Ready algorithm. He

compares it to the tick test and revisits the question of time-matching trade and quote

data. His sample consists of 337,667 trades for all 144 firms, with 25% of the original

transactions eliminated. Much like Lee and Radhakrishna, Finucane only includes those

trades that contain a market order on at least one side of the trade. He tests the algorithms

using quotes adjusted according to Lee and Ready’s original five-second rule as well as

unadjusted quotes. The results are similar for both, indicating that delayed trade

timestamps may not pose as large a problem as Lee and Ready originally stated.

Additionally, Finucane finds that the Lee-Ready algorithm has a success rate of 84.4%,

while the tick test correctly classifies 83.0% of the trades in the sample.

       Odders-White (2000) also uses the TORQ dataset to evaluate all three trade

direction algorithms on a sample of 318,364 transactions. She reports that 25.1% of the

observations in the database cannot be unambiguously classified as buyer- or seller-

initiated. Odders-White infers the buy/sell intent of the initiating party on the basis of




                                                                                               7
time order. She defines the initiating party as the last party, chronologically, to place an

order. This assumption, she argues, is consistent with the idea that the initiating party is

willing to pay a premium for immediate execution. She also notes that it is not possible to

identify an initiating party when all parties to the trade are active (a crossed trade, for

example). The paper finds that the tick test misclassifies 21.4% of the trades, the quote

test misclassifies 9.1% of the trades, and the Lee-Ready algorithm incorrectly classifies

15.0% of the trades. Odders-White finds that trades within the spread, small trades and

trades in large or frequently traded stocks are more likely to be misclassified. Odders-

White also makes the point that while the TORQ database identifies order type, most

other databases do not.

        Ellis, Michaely and O’Hara (2000) use a proprietary NASDAQ dataset to analyze

the tick test, quote test and Lee-Ready algorithm. Their sample is comprised of 313

NASDAQ stocks trading from September 27, 1996 through September 29, 1997, and

contains 2,433,019 trades. The authors establish trade direction using the “buy/sell

indicator” included in their dataset, which identifies the reporting party. This indicator, in

conjunction with trader identity codes included in the dataset, allows the authors to

identify whether the initiating party is a market maker, a broker, or a customer. They

include only those trades that take place between market-makers and brokers/customers

or trades between brokers and their customers. In the end, 24.6% of the sample is

discarded as a result of ambiguity. Ellis et. al. find that the tick test, quote test and Lee-

Ready algorithm correctly classify 77.7%, 76.4%, and 81.1% of the sample, respectively.

As is the case with the other empirical tests, their paper finds significantly higher

accuracy rates for trades at the bid and ask prices.




                                                                                                 8
        Theissen (2001) tests the accuracy of the Lee-Ready algorithm and the tick test

using data from the Frankfurt Stock exchange. The sample in his paper tracks 15 stocks

from September 26, 1996 through October 25, 1996. Trade direction is inferred from the

position taken by the stock’s specialist. Theissen does not concern himself with the

problems associated with order type since all trades in the sample include a market

maker. A sample of 9,124 transactions is used for the tick test, 72.2% of which agree with

Theissen’s classification of the trades. Theissen then tests the Lee-Ready algorithm using

9,449 observations and finds that it agrees with the specialist classification for 72.8% of

the trades.

        Aitken and Frino (1996) examine transactions on the Australian Stock Exchange

(ASX) for the two-year period ending June 30, 1994. The paper evaluates the

performance of only the tick test on its sample of 4,022,339 transactions. The authors

infer trade direction on the basis of time priority. They consider the last party to enter or

amend an order to be the initiating party. The paper finds that the tick test classifies

74.4% of the trades in the sample in a matter consistent with their buyer and seller

assignments, but it finds that seller-initiated trades are more frequently misclassified than

buyer-initiated trades. Aitken and Frino suggest that short sales may be to blame for this

misclassification, noting that the ASX is subject to a tick rule similar to those used for

many U.S. exchanges3.

3. Data and Research Design




3
  Diether, Lee and Werner (2006) also hypothesize that the uptick rule should increase the percentage of
NYSE short trades above the bid-ask midpoint when using the Lee-Ready algorithm. Because of regulatory
differences, they further hypothesize that the bid-price test will not have such an effect for NASDAQ short
trades.


                                                                                                         9
       In order to test the trade direction algorithms, we randomly select from CRSP two

hundred common stocks that were listed in 2005. One hundred of these stocks are taken

from the NYSE and one hundred from NASDAQ’s National Market System. For our

analysis we examine the time periods March 1, 2005 to March 31, 2005, June 1, 2005 to

June 30, 2005 and December 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005.

       After selecting our sample of stocks and choosing our time period, we then

combine and analyze trade and quote information from two databases. The first is the

TAQ database, which is commonly used in the empirical market microstructure literature.

The dataset contains two files, one of which describes all trades occurring on each

exchange, while the other describes the quotes. We merge the two files to obtain trade

and quote data for each transaction in our sample. For each stock, the TAQ data provide a

ticker symbol, exchange code, timestamp, bid and ask price and size (for quotes), and

transaction price and size (for trades). Trade direction and order type, however, is not

provided. For our sample stocks and time periods, the TAQ database contains 12,099,132

trades and 70,877,601 quotes. This represents 7,170,782,500 shares traded.

       To establish which trades are short sales, we rely on a second, non-commercial

database compiled by Paul Asquith, Andrea Au and Parag Pathak, which contains all

short sale transactions in 2005. SEC Regulation SHO went into effect at the beginning of

2005, requiring each exchange to post data describing individual short transactions. The

data made available include the price, time and size of all short sales in addition to ticker

symbols and exchange codes identifying the security and where it is traded. Their

database aggregates this information across the nine major U.S. exchanges.




                                                                                           10
         We then use the short sale database to identify which trades in our sample of two

hundred stocks are short sales and classify them as seller-initiated. There are 3,587,468

short trades in our sample during the relevant time periods. These short trades represent

29.7% of all trades for our stocks during the three months and 27.9% of all trading

volume.4 Observations are matched by symbol, exchange, price, size, date and time. For

electronic transactions, times are recorded exactly and the matching is straightforward.

Floor negotiated transactions, however, may receive a timestamp at the beginning, middle

or end of the negotiation. As a result, a negotiated trade may have a timestamp in the

SHO data that is not the same as the timestamp in the TAQ data. To correct for this, we

allow a one second window around a given trade for the purpose of matching. For our

sample stocks, 98.8% of the observations in our short sale database were exactly matched

to transactions in the TAQ database, and 99.5% were matched within a one second

window. The 0.5% not matched was eliminated from the sample.

         Our dataset differs from those in the previous literature in a few key ways. The

number of trades we examine is significantly larger than most of the prior tests of the

Lee-Ready algorithm. In addition, our sample is from 2005 and only contains trades that

took place after decimalization.5 Most importantly, all trades in our dataset are

unambiguously classified as short or long trades.




4
  This percentage is in line with that reported in the short sale literature. Asquith, Au, and Pathak (2006)
show that for all common stocks during all of 2005, short sales are 28.1% of total trading volume. Diether,
Lee, and Werner (2006) find a similar number of 26.7% for their sample of NASDAQ stocks.
5
  Bessembinder (2003) shows that decimalization results in narrower bid-ask spreads, and Ellis et. al.
(2000) as well as Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) have shown that the trade direction algorithms are more
accurate at the bid and ask than at the quote’s midpoint. If narrower spreads result in prices being closer to
the midpoint, classification could become more problematic. If narrower spreads result in less midpoint
trades, then the classification could actually become more accurate. These hypotheses have never been
tested empirically.


                                                                                                            11
       An important consideration for classifying short sales is the effect of the uptick

rule and bid-price rules. For example, because a non-Pilot NYSE short sale must occur on

an uptick or zero-uptick, it is not always possible to execute a short sale as a market order

even if it is entered as one. Diether, Lee and Werner (2006) posit that the uptick rule has

a significant effect on how short sales are executed since the NYSE trade software adjusts

short trades to ensure compliance with the uptick rule. This software effectively converts

non-compliant market order short sales into limit orders. Pilot securities, however, are

exempt from the uptick rule and face no such limitations. A higher percentage of Pilot

securities should, therefore, be classified correctly since Pilot short sales are more likely

to be executed as market orders.

       Table 1 provides a descriptive overview of our sample and lists the per stock

average for number of trades, number of shares traded, price per share, number of quotes,

bid-ask range, number of short trades, number of shares shorted, and percentage of short

sales by month as well as by exchange for the entire sample. The average number of

shares traded is relatively constant across exchanges and time periods. The same holds

for the percentage of short trades and the number of shares shorted. Almost 30% of all

trades are short sales which represents over 27% of shares traded by volume. The bid-ask

range is much larger for NASDAQ securities than for NYSE securities, approximately

$0.21 and $0.04, respectively. The number of quotes is approximately four times as large

as the number of trades for NYSE stocks, and over nine times as large as the number of

trades for NASDAQ stocks.

       We make an additional adjustment to the combined dataset before testing the

trade direction algorithms. As mentioned above, Lee and Ready (1991) only consider




                                                                                            12
quotes that are at least five seconds older than a trade when testing their algorithm.

Vergote (2005) revisits this problem for data on electronic exchanges. He finds that the

introduction of electronic communications networks improves the accuracy of quote and

trade timestamps, and recommends using a two second delay. Finally, when assessing

whether trades are buyer- or seller-initiated, Bessembinder (2003) finds that no time

adjustment is necessary when aligning the quotes and trades for NASDAQ and NYSE

stocks. While matching quotes with trades, we adjust our dataset to test the five second

delay, two second delay, and no delay.

       After these adjustments, we classify the short sales in our sample as either buyer-

or seller-initiated using the tick test, the quote test, and the Lee-Ready algorithm. For the

tick test, we only consider previous trades from the same exchange as the current trade.

This is consistent with NYSE rules that forbid using off-exchange trades to satisfy the

uptick rule6. We do the same for quotes, only using prior quotes from the same exchange,

although there is no corresponding regulatory requirement. Finally, we include only those

trades and quotes that take place during normal trading hours.

       In addition to requiring exchanges to post data describing short sale activity,

Regulation SHO began a Pilot study in May 2005 which exempted short sellers in certain

stocks from adhering to the uptick and bid-price rules. This regulatory change allows us

to test the Aitken and Frino (1996) and Diether et. al. (2006) conjectures that these

particular trading restrictions have an effect on the classification algorithms. Our sample

of 100 NYSE stocks contains 35 Pilot securities and our sample of 100 NASDAQ stocks

contains 22. This paper tests Pilot and non-Pilot securities separately.




                                                                                           13
         Since the Pilot study began in May 2005, the periods we have selected (March,

June, and December, 2005) allow us to examine the effects of this regulatory change in

two ways. First, we compare Pilot and non-Pilot firms during the Pilot period. Second,

we examine the Pilot firms both before and after the Pilot program was implemented.

Finally, for our sample stocks and time periods, we examine all long trades in the TAQ

dataset in order to establish a benchmark for comparison. Since we do not know whether

long trades are buyer- or seller-initiated, we can only provide the percentage classified in

each category by the trade algorithms.

4. Results

         Table 2 presents the results from applying each algorithm to our entire sample of

trades, and it shows that each algorithm overwhelming classifies short sales as buyer-

initiated. The sample trades are first divided into short and long transactions. The quote

test and Lee-Ready algorithm are evaluated using Lee and Ready’s five-second quote

matching delay, the two-second quote matching delay suggested by Vergote, as well as

no delay. Quote delays are irrelevant for the tick test since quotes are not used. The first

column of the top panel in Table 2 shows that the tick test classifies only 24.3% of the

short sale transactions in our sample as seller-initiated. Moreover, the quote test, using

the five-second delay identifies 27.0% of the short trades as seller-initiated. The Lee-

Ready algorithm, with a five-second quote delay, classifies 28.2% of the short sales in

our sample as seller-initiated.

         The results for the five-second quote delay, two-second quote delay, and no delay

are not materially different, although the no delay case identifies the highest percentage

 Earlier studies do not discuss whether they include trades off the exchange. Trading securities off of their
primary exchange is currently a common occurrence. In fact, for NYSE listed stocks in 2005, 23.4% of


                                                                                                           14
of short sales as seller-initiated. The results for long trades follow in the bottom panel.

This panel shows that more long trades are classified as seller-initiated than short sales.

Between 46% and 57% of the long trades are classified as seller-initiated, and between

40% and 46% are classified as buyer-initiated. Under each classification algorithm, and

with all three possible delays, the difference between the classification results of short

sales and long trades is statistically significant at the 0.1% level or higher. That is, short

sales have a significantly lower percentage of trades classified as seller-initiated than long

trades.

          A possible explanation for the overwhelming classification of short sales as

buyer-initiated is that most of them are subject to either the uptick or bid-price rules. For

example, since the uptick rule allows short trading on only an uptick or zero-uptick, short

sales subject to the rule would be automatically classified incorrectly as buyer-initiated

using the tick test. The quote test should also be affected by the uptick or bid-price rules.

Floor traders treat short sales subject to the uptick rule as limit orders executable only at

or above the last trade price. This behavior causes short sales to be executed at a higher

price within the spread than they otherwise would be. Thus these regulations introduce a

systematic bias, since any trades above the midpoint of the spread are classified by the

quote test as buyer-initiated. Because the Lee-Ready algorithm is a combination of the

tick and quote tests, it is prone to the same bias as those tests. The effect of the bid-price

rule should be similar to that of the uptick rule, though not as severe since application of

the bid-price rule is more flexible.

          In Table 3, we test whether the misclassification of short sales is a result of the

NYSE uptick rule and the NASDAQ bid-price rule by applying all three algorithms to

                                                                                                15
Pilot and non-Pilot short trades separately. We also divide our sample into monthly time

periods as a second test of whether the uptick rule affects the trade classification

algorithms. Since our March sample is before the SEC’s Pilot study, which began in

May, we can test if Pilot firms are classified differently before and after the uptick and

bid-price rules were suspended. Finally, we divide the sample into NYSE and NASDAQ

stocks, to see if the application of the uptick rule is different from the bid-price rule.

Table 3 presents our results when using the five-second quote delay. The results for the

two-second and no delay adjustments do not differ substantially but, just as in Table 2,

the no delay case classifies the highest percentage of short sales as seller-initiated.

        The NYSE results shown in the top half of Table 3 are dramatic. For the non-Pilot

NYSE sub-sample, 98.9%, 98.5%, and 95.0% of all short sales are assigned as buyer-

initiated by the tick test in March, June, and December, respectively. The quote test and

Lee-Ready algorithm classify over 80% of the non-Pilot NYSE short sales as buyer-

initiated in each month. The difference for Pilot NYSE stocks is striking. For example,

the Lee-Ready algorithm classifies only 11.8% of the non-Pilot short sales as seller-

initiated in June but classifies 40.6% of the Pilot short sales as seller-initiated in the same

month. The results are similar for December. The differences between Pilots and non-

Pilots in June and December are statistically significant at the 0.1% level and indicate

that the uptick rule causes a substantial amount of short sales to be misclassified as

buyer-initiated when they are, in fact, seller-initiated.

        The results for the three algorithms on NASDAQ short sales are not as one-sided,

with approximately 60% of the non-Pilot stock trades classified as buyer-initiated by the

tick test, quote test and Lee-Ready algorithm for all three months. Even though the




                                                                                             16
difference is not as large as for the NYSE trades, the percentage of NASDAQ Pilot short

sales classified as seller-initiated is higher than that of non-Pilots in June and December.

For example, the Lee-Ready algorithm classifies 41.6% and 46.8% of the Pilot short sales

as seller-initiated in June and December, but only 36.6% and 39.1% of the non-Pilot short

sales in the same months. The differences in classification percentages for June and

December between Pilot and non-Pilot are statistically significant at the 0.1% level for all

three algorithms.

        The Pilot and non-Pilot differences for June and December are further supported

by examining the March results (before the uptick and bid-price rules were suspended)

where there is no significant difference between Pilot and non-Pilot short sales. In

March, the Lee-Ready algorithm classifies 12.7% of Pilot NYSE short sales as seller-

initiated and 12.2% of non-Pilot NYSE short sales as seller-initiated. This difference is

not significant7. In addition, for NASDAQ short sales in March, the Lee-Ready algorithm

actually classifies a higher percentage of non-Pilot stocks (37.3%) as seller-initiated than

of Pilot stocks (35.9%). Thus, not only are the classification differences between Pilot

and non-Pilot NYSE and NASDAQ stocks in June and December large and statistically

significant, the differences in March are neither.

        The results in Table 3 show that while both rules matter, the uptick rule has a

larger percentage impact on the classification algorithms than the bid-price rule. It is also

important to note that the seller-initiated classification rates for Pilot securities in June

and December, while higher than non-Pilots, still classify less than half of the short trades

in our sample as seller-initiated. Therefore, even without these trading restrictions, all

three algorithms predominantly classify shorts sales as buyer-initiated.




                                                                                                17
        Examining the natural experiment created by regulation SHO seems to

demonstrate that the uptick and bid-price rules cause many short sales to be misclassified

as buyer-initiated. Another possibility, however, is that the differences in Pilot and non-

Pilot results can be explained by fundamental changes in trader behavior. That is, traders

changed their trading strategies due to the elimination of the uptick and bid-price rules.

We find this explanation for the significantly larger amount of seller-initiated short sales

to be unlikely. This “Lucas Critique” of our results does not hold unless short sellers

change the parameters of their trading model. We argue that the basic parameter for short

sellers remains profit maximization before and after regulation SHO. Short sellers short

stocks when they think the stock price is going down, just as traders buy when they think

the stock price will go up. If regulation imposes a cost to that process, the economic

implication is that there must be a greater gain to the short sale in order for a trader to

undertake it. This in turn reduces the amount of short selling, but not the economics of

which stocks are overpriced. Removing the regulation, which the Pilot study does, does

not change how short sellers identify which stocks are overpriced or their goal of profit

maximization; it merely removes one cost8.

        There are a number of recent papers which investigate this issue of whether short

selling behavior changed as a result of the Pilot study. The SEC’s Economic Analysis

(2007) of the Pilot program reported an increase in short sales volume of 2%, and

concluded that removal of short sale restrictions did not result in any material adverse

  Examining a regulatory regime change is a common way to test for the effects of regulation. In addition,
a broad view of the “Lucas Critique” would also apply to the change to decimalization in 2001. Since
decimalization leads to lower bid-ask spreads and since trade classification algorithms depend on where in
the bid-ask spread a trade takes place, it could be argued (although we don’t) that this regulatory change
invalidates trade classification research using data after 2001.


                                                                                                        18
impact on either market quality or liquidity as measured by the relative effective quoted

spread. Alexander and Peterson (2008) also test this conclusion using a sample of 418

Pilot and non-Pilot securities. They conclude, "the removal of price tests has had no

deleterious effect on trader behavior and has not led to a decrease in market quality."

Alexander and Peterson do find, however, that the elimination of the uptick rule results in

improved order execution speed and marginally lower execution prices. Diether, Lee and

Werner (2007) find that, for a sample of Pilot and non-Pilot securities, the total increase

in short sale volume is approximately 2%, the same change reported by the SEC’s

economic review. All of these results are consistent with the Pilot study removing a

regulatory cost to short selling, but not changing the underlying decision model for short

sellers9.

         Examining Table 1, we find that short sales increase by approximately 1.5%

between March and June 2005. This is consistent with the change found above by the

SEC and by Deither, Lee, and Werner. It should be noted that short selling increases

almost another 1% between June and December. Since Asquith, Au, and Pathak (2007)

point out that there is a long term trend towards increasing short sales and since the

increase between June and December is after the Pilot study was underway, it is not clear

whether the initial increase is due to the change in regulation or the long term trend. More

importantly, we are skeptical that the large difference in classification of short sales in

Table 3 (e.g., almost a 30% difference in NYSE Lee-Ready classification results for Pilot

securities relative to non-Pilot securities) is explained by these much smaller increases in

short selling.

5. Additional Problems with Trade Classification Schemes: Trade Initiation, Order

Type, and the Implications of Short Sales

         The result that short sales are predominately classified as buyer-initiated seems

counter-intuitive. Since short sellers must, as mentioned above, first locate a security to

borrow and accept a below-market rebate rate, a short sale would seem to be seller-

initiated. Further, while it would seem reasonable to consider the first mover to be the

“initiator,” the empirical literature which tests the Lee-Ready and other algorithms

defines the initiating party as the one to last enter into the transaction. While there is no

theoretical basis for this definition, the rationale is that the initiator is the trader who

demands immediate execution and is willing to pay an “immediacy premium.”10 This

definition is then used when testing the classification algorithms for accuracy, where

accuracy is defined as the empirical results being consistent with an author’s inferential

scheme.

         The mechanics of the uptick and bid-price rules make this definition particularly

problematic for short sales. If a short seller desires immediate execution of a sell order, it

will not be filled if the prior trade was a downtick or zero-downtick. In this instance, the

short seller must wait for an uptick before executing the trade. If, absent regulation, the

short seller would have accepted the prevailing market price, they would have been the

last party to enter into the transaction. Short sale restrictions, however, force the short

seller to wait and effectively provide liquidity. When the trade is executed following the


reveals that there is no significant disparity between traders before and after regulation SHO took effect.
10
   Both Lee and Radhakrishna (2000), Odders-White (2000) and Ellis et. al. (2000) consider the last party
to enter a trade to be the initiator. Odders-White(2000) explicitly makes use of the concept of an




                                                                                                          20
next uptick, the short seller may not be the last party to enter into the transaction. In this

way, the uptick and bid-price rules interfere with the mechanism that trade-classification

algorithms use to identify the initiating party.

        Even without the uptick and bid-price rules, there is still a problem when using

the concept of an immediacy premium to classify short sales. All short sellers, both Pilot

and non-Pilot, are required to find a security to borrow and then pay a premium in the

form of a lower rebate rate on collateral. For a “non-special” stock this premium is ten to

fifteen basis points. For a “special” stock this premium can be up to seven hundred basis

points. Consequently the premium paid by many short sellers is larger than that paid by

the last trader for immediate execution, which is, at a maximum, the bid-ask spread. The

fact that some short sellers may pay a larger cash premium than the last party to enter a

transaction negates one of the underlying rationales upon which the trade classification

algorithms depend. If “premium paid” is the defining determinant of initiation, then many

short sales are indeed initiated by the seller even if they are not the last party to enter.

        There is an additional problem involving trade classification that does not involve

short sales. Identification of this problem is not new to the trade classification literature,

but it is largely ignored despite its importance. Defining the last mover as the one who

initiates a trade is most valid for single-sided market order transactions. These are trades

that feature a specialist or market maker that passively supplies liquidity on the other

side. However, the ability of this rule to identify the initiating party is impaired for other

order types. A market “cross,” for example, matches an existing buy and sell order. In

such a situation, the buyer and seller effectively arrive at the same time, since both orders


“immediacy premium,” and Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) specify that Lee-Ready is useful in identifying
“the more aggressive side of a trade.”


                                                                                                   21
are already outstanding. Consequently, neither party initiated the trade. This type of

ambiguity is why Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) and others limit their samples by

removing market “crosses,” stopped trades, special orders, and multiple party market

orders when testing the Lee-Ready algorithm. Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) eliminate

40% of all trades, while Finucane (2000) and Odders-White (2000) both eliminate 25%.

        Recent authors do not limit their samples to single-sided market orders. This is

because more recent trade databases, such as TAQ, do not include this information, while

the TORQ database identifies order type. As a consequence, the application of trade

classification algorithms to the TAQ data utilizes all trades, not merely those involving

single-sided market orders. Therefore, an initiator is identified for a large number of

trades where the algorithms are undefined. This inclusion means that the error rate for

Lee-Ready and other algorithms will be higher for recent studies than that reported in the

literature reviewed above, which predominantly used the TORQ data. This implication is

troubling for all recent applications of trade algorithms.11

        This analysis and the results above have implications for researchers using the

Lee-Ready and other algorithms to establish trade directions. First, the inclusion of non-

market orders, i.e. those where there is more than one active trader, should cause the error

rate to be higher than that reported previously. If the algorithm is 85% accurate (which

the early literature shows) for the 75% of the trades which are market orders, and if

classification is randomly assigned with 50% accuracy for those 25% which are not, the

overall accuracy rate drops to 76.25% (or the error rate rises to 23.75%).




11
  Boehmer, Grammig and Thiessen (2006) demonstrate that misclassifications due to use of the Lee-Ready
algorithm lead to a downwardly biased estimate of the PIN variable.


                                                                                                   22
         Second, if short sales are misclassified because of the uptick or bid-price rules,

the accuracy of the algorithms is further decreased. If we assume that non-regulated Pilot

security short sales are correctly classified, then the percentage of non-Pilot short sales

classified as buyer-initiated is incorrect. Table 3 shows that an additional 29.2% of NYSE

non-Pilot short sales are classified as buyer-initiated by Lee-Ready when compared with

Pilot short sales in June and December. If there are no Pilot securities (which there

weren’t before 2005) and if the percentage of short trades is 30% (Table 1 shows they

were 29.7% in 2005), 6.6% of all trades will be incorrectly classified as buyer-initiated

by the Lee-Ready algorithm due to regulation. This is after eliminating the 25% of trades,

discussed in the paragraph above, which are not market orders.

         To determine the extent to which short sales affect the overall error rate of trade

classification algorithms it is necessary to estimate an error rate for long trades. It is not a

direct calculation but can be extrapolated from the studies using the 1991 TORQ

database. As mentioned, those studies found a 15% error rate, at best, for the 75% of

trades evaluated. The 15% is the sum of value-weighting the error rates on short trades

and long trades. Assuming that the error rate of short sales caused by regulation is 29.2%,

the error rate on long trades would be 13.89% or approximately half that of short sales12.

         Applying this analysis to all trades in 2005 results in a much higher error ratio

than the 15% reported in the literature. Assuming that 25% of trades are not classifiable

(i.e. market crosses or stopped trades), 30% of all trades are short sales, 29.2% of short



12
  This assumes a division of long trades to short trades of 92.1% versus 7.9%. While there is no time series
of short sale percentages before 2005, the time series of NYSE short interest, should be correlated. Asquith,
Au and Pathak (2006) show that the average short interest in 2005 is 3.4%, while Asquith, Pathak and
Ritter (2005) show it was 0.9% in 1991. This implies a level of short sales in 1991 of 7.9%. Assuming an
error in classifying short sales due to regulation of 29.2% this means short sales contribute 2.3% of the 15%
error rate and long trades 12.7%. This implies an error rate on long trades of 13.8%.


                                                                                                          23
sales are misclassified due to regulation, and 13.8% remains the error rate on long trades,

then the error rate for all trades is 26.3%. Analyzing this 26.3% rate, we find that

approximately 12.5% is due to applying the algorithms to non-market order trades, 7.2%

is due to errors in classifying long trades, and 6.6% is due to errors in classifying short

sales.

         In this estimation, we have made no attempt to address the problem of those short

sales improperly classified as buyer-initiated even though short sellers paid a higher

premium than the last party to enter a transaction. Doing so would increase the error rate.

Thus, if it is true that the Lee-Ready algorithm, when applied exclusively to market

orders in the TORQ database, is 15.0% inaccurate, applying the same algorithm to all

trades in the TAQ database and accounting for the rise in short sale volume will increase

the error rate by more than 75% to 26.3%.

         We should note here that the SEC's decision to eliminate the uptick rule on July 6,

2007 does not reduce the importance of this conclusion to the empirical market

microstructure literature. The vast majority of papers testing or applying the Lee-Ready

and other algorithms have used and will continue, for the foreseeable future, to use data

from periods where the uptick rule was in effect. As a result, the need to reevaluate the

conclusions in these papers remains. It should also be noted that all three trade

classification algorithms label the majority of Pilot short sales as buyer-initiated. Thus,

even without the uptick and bid-price rules there appears to be a misclassification of short

sales.

         Further demonstrating the usefulness of the critiques of trade classification

algorithms in this paper is the fact that a number of foreign markets still have price




                                                                                              24
restrictions on short sales. Major stock markets in Australia, Japan, Canada and other

countries have rules that are effectively the equivalent of the uptick rule. In addition,

recent deterioration in US financial markets has prompted calls for the reinstatement of

the uptick rule. The effect that any new restriction on short selling could have on trade

direction algorithms should be evaluated in light of the considerations raised in this

paper. Finally, there remains the problem of applying the trade classification algorithms

to all trades, which is usually done with TAQ data, regardless of current trading

regulations.

6. Conclusion

       In this paper, we test the Lee-Ready algorithm, the quote test, and the tick test on

a sample of short sales. We find that all three methods of assigning trade direction

classify a majority of short sales as buyer-initiated and that in many instances, these

trades may be misclassified. For a random sample of two hundred stocks trading over a

three-month period in 2005, the Lee-Ready algorithm, with no delay, classifies 33.4% of

our short sales as seller-initiated, the highest of any algorithm. For those short sales that

are exempt from the uptick and bid-price rules under Regulation SHO, we see an increase

in the percentage classified as seller-initiated. We find that, for NYSE securities, a short

sale is more than three times as likely to be classified as seller-initiated when the security

is exempt from the uptick rule (11.8% and 40.6% for June and 14.6% and 44.2% for

December). Though the difference is not as striking for NASDAQ securities, the effect is

significant and in the same direction.

       In addition, there are problems when applying the trade direction algorithms to all

trades in a dataset. Because the definition of “initiation” is predicated on the order in




                                                                                            25
which the parties enter into a transaction, certain order types cannot be classified as either

buyer- or seller-initiated. For example, referring to a market cross or stopped trade as

either buyer- or seller- initiated is meaningless. Since most commercial datasets (TAQ

being the most widely used) do not distinguish between order types, papers using Lee-

Ready and other algorithms cannot exclude these order types from their samples.

       Assuming a true error rate of 15% for trade classification, and considering only

the effects of misclassification due either to the uptick and bid-price rules or the inclusion

of all trades, we obtain a lower bound error rate of 26.3%. This percentage is

considerably higher than the error rates found in previous empirical tests of the Lee-

Ready and other trade classification algorithms. Further, the literature sometimes relies

upon the definition of an initiator as the party that pays a premium for execution. Since it

is possible that a short seller’s premium (derived from locate and borrowing constraints)

may sometimes exceed the “immediacy premium,” some additional short sales may be

incorrectly classified as buyer-initiated.

       These results have potential implications for a large body of academic research.

Lee-Ready is widely used in the empirical market microstructure literature and, most

recently, in the probability of informed trading (PIN) literature. Our results show that this

research is subject to systematic bias in the treatment of short sales. The degree of this

bias will vary and depends largely on the focus of the research and its dependence on

correct assignment of trade direction. The effect of this inaccuracy, however, is not

limited to published and working papers that rely on these algorithms. It is likely that

misclassifications have also had an effect on research that has been abandoned as a result

of the insignificant results obtained through these algorithms.




                                                                                             26
        Moreover, the extent of this problem has most likely become worse over time.

Short sales have been rising as a percentage of market volume13. As short transactions

continue to constitute larger percentages of market volume, the trade direction algorithms

will become increasingly inaccurate. Additionally, the results before 2005 would have

been far worse since there were no Pilot securities. Exchanges have also decimalized

stock prices since the last domestic test of the Lee-Ready algorithm. Decimalization has

narrowed quote spreads, and empiricists have typically found the trade direction

algorithms to be less accurate between the bid and ask. For all of these reasons, it is likely

that the performance of the trade algorithms has worsened over time.

        Lee-Ready and other trade classification algorithms are essential to empirical

research in several bodies of literature. This paper highlights several problems related to

their application, particularly to short sales. It is necessary for researchers to recognize

these problems when interpreting their empirical results.

  Asquith, Pathak and Ritter (2005) show that short interest rose dramatically from 1980 through 2003.
Boehmer, Jones and Zhang (2006) report that short sales are 12.9% of NYSE volume during the period
from January, 2000 through April, 2004, but that the percentage for the first four months of 2004 is 17.5%.
They comment that short sales become “more prevalent as the sample period progresses.” As mentioned
above, Asquith, Pathak and Au (2006) and Diether, Lee and Werner (2005) show that short sales constitute
approximately 28% of all share trade volume in 2005.

                                     Characteristics of the 200 Randomly Selected Stocks In Our Sample

There are 100 NYSE stocks and 100 NASDAQ stocks for 3 months: March, June and December of 2005. The price per share is the average trading
 price during that month. The bid-ask range is the average quote range per stock for the month. All numbers are per firm averages calculated by
                                           equally weighting each stock in the selected sub-samples.

Trade classification results using the tick test, quote test, and Lee-Ready algorithm to classify trades as seller- or buyer-initiated for the sample
 of 100 NYSE and 100 NASDAQ stocks during March, June, and December 2005. The percentages are the number of trades classified as sells,
 buys, or not classifiable divided by the total number of trades. N is the total number of either short or long trades. The delays of 5 seconds, 2
      seconds, and no delay define which quote is considered active at the time of the trade for the quote test and Lee-Ready algorithm.

  The seller-initiated classification percentages for non-Pilot short sales are significantly lower than the classification percentages for Pilot short sales in June and December for all
three classification algorithms at the 0.1% level. This is true for both NYSE short sales in the top half in Table 3 and for NASDAQ short sales in the bottom half of Table 3. This is not
true for March NYSE or NASDAQ short sales.
