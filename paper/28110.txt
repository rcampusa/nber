                                         ABSTRACT

We analyze the tone of COVID-19 related English-language news articles written since January
1, 2020. Ninety one percent of stories by U.S. major media outlets are negative in tone versus
fifty four percent for non-U.S. major sources and sixty five percent for scientific journals. The
negativity of the U.S. major media is notable even in areas with positive scientific developments
including school re-openings and vaccine trials. Media negativity is unresponsive to changing
trends in new COVID-19 cases or the political leanings of the audience. U.S. major media readers
strongly prefer negative stories about COVID-19, and negative stories in general. Stories of
increasing COVID-19 cases outnumber stories of decreasing cases by a factor of 5.5 even during
periods when new cases are declining. Among U.S. major media outlets, stories discussing
President Donald Trump and hydroxychloroquine are more numerous than all stories combined
that cover companies and individual researchers working on COVID-19 vaccines.

Introduction

On February 18th, the Oxford Mail published a story that Professor Sarah Gilbert and her

colleagues at Oxford's Jenner Institute were working on a vaccine for the novel coronavirus and

that rapid vaccine development could be possible given the scientists' existing work and

experience with a possible MERS vaccine. 1 In contrast to Oxford Mail's reporting, the U.S. major

media outlets of Fox News, CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post did not begin

coverage of Professor Gilbert's COVID-19 related work until late April. 2 The U.S. based stories

emphasized caveats from health officials and experts downplaying the optimistic timeline and past

success of the Oxford researchers. The earliest available (major outlet) U.S. story is from CNN

on April 23rd and begins with a quote from England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty saying

that the probability of having a vaccine or treatment "anytime in the next calendar year" is

"incredibly small."

There is a similar disconnect between U.S. major media reporting on school reopenings and

scientific findings on the same topic; the reporting is overwhelmingly negative, while the scientific

literature tells a more optimistic story. Oster (2020) collects data on school reopenings and

COVID-19 infections within schools and districts. 3 She finds that infection rates among students

remain low (at 0.14 percent) and schools have not become the super-spreaders many feared. 4

Guthrie et al (2020) and Viner et al (2020) review the available evidence and reach similar

conclusions. However, ninety percent of school reopening articles from U.S. mainstream media

are negative versus only 56 percent for the English-language major media in other countries.

The tone of media coverage impacts both human health and attitudes towards preventative

measures including vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing (Bursztyn et al 2020, Van

Bavel and Baicker et al 2020, Simonov et al 2020, Kearney and Levine 2015, Ash et al 2020) 5.

The proportion of U.S. adults who exhibit depression symptoms has risen threefold since the start

of the novel coronavirus pandemic (Etman et al 2020, Fetzer et al 2020). In discussing this increase

in mental health problems, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against

heavy consumption of news stories about the pandemic 6.

Our results suggest the CDC's warning is prescient. We categorize by topic over 9.4 million

published news stories on COVID-19 since January 1, 2020. We then conduct several forms of

textual analysis on roughly 20,000 COVID-19 news stories to examine levels of negativity by

subtopic, source of the news, and time period. We have five major findings. First, COVID-19

stories published by the top 15 U.S media outlets (by readership/viewership) are 25 percentage

points more likely to be negative in content than more general U.S. sources or major media outlets

outside the U.S. 7 Second, the time pattern in observed negativity is at most weakly related to the

actual time trend in new weekly cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. Third, the most popular stories in

  Bannerjee et al (2020) find that text messaging can significantly increase reporting of COVID symptoms and use of
social distancing and other health promoting measures. Nyhan et al (2014) find that it's difficult to correct
misperceptions around vaccine safety.

 This regression-based estimate controls flexibly for article length and week of publication. The unadjusted
probability of an article being negative is 91 percent for US major media versus 54 percent for English-language
non-US major media.
The New York Times have high levels of negativity, particularly for COVID-19-related articles. 8

Fourth, negativity appears to be unrelated to the political leanings of the newspaper's or network's

audience (Niven 2001). Finally, U.S. major media stories that discuss the benefits of social

distancing or alternatively the benefits of mask wearing are less numerous than stories about

President Trump not wearing a mask. Similarly, the terms "Trump and hydroxychloroquine"

receive more coverage than do all stories about companies and researchers developing vaccines.

Overall, we find that relative to other media sources, the most influential U.S. news sources are

outliers in terms of the negative tone of their coronavirus stories and their choices of stories

covered. We are unable to explain these patterns using differential political views of their

audiences or time patterns in infection rates. This is analogous to Niven (2001) which finds a

strong negative bias in the U.S. media when covering unemployment and limited evidence of

partisanship. U.S. major outlets do demonstrate an above- average interest in promoting prosocial

behavior like mask wearing and social distancing. Consistent with the existing literature

(Gentzkow and Shapiro 2010 and Gentzkow, Glaeser and Goldin 2006), our results suggest that

U.S. major outlets publish unusually negative COVID-19 stories in response to reader demand and

interest.

Data Description

We obtain counts of COVID-19 articles and separately the text of COVID-19 articles using the

LexisNexis database. We use all English news sources and a date range of January 1, 2020 to July

31, 2020. We divide our universe of sources into the top (most widely read or watched) sources



8
  This is consistent with the findings of Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010) who find that media respond strongly to
consumer preferences. Eshbaugh-Soha (2010) finds that negativity media coverage of the President responds to
local support for the President.
and all other sources. We further stratify by U.S. versus non-U.S. sources. The top non-TV

sources for the U.S. that are also included in LexisNexis are Newsweek, the New York Post, Los

Angeles Times, USA Today, Politico, The Hill, and the New York Times. For the top television

sources we include both written articles and television transcripts from ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox

News, MSNBC and NBC. Further details for our data downloading procedure and the search

terms used are contained in Appendix 1.

We also gather the text of articles discussing COVID-19 vaccines from five widely read scientific

and medical journals namely Science, JAMA, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet,

and Nature. We gather the New York Times most popular articles from their website from

September 4-October 6th 2020. We rely on the New York Times most read articles in our current

investigation, but future versions of this paper will also incorporate "most emailed" articles, outlets

beyond the New York Times, and a larger date range.

We analyze the text of 20,000 articles that fall within three subtopics regarding COVID-19:

vaccines, increases and decreases in case counts, and reopenings (of businesses, schools, parks,

restaurants, government facilities, etc). We limit ourselves to roughly 20,000 articles given the

legal requirement to "manually" download the articles from LexisNexis 100 articles at a time 9.

We classify all articles using two different but related methods. First, we measure the fraction of

words that are negative according to established dictionaries of negative words. See Liu 2012,

Tetlock 2007, Loughran and McDonald 2011 for canonical examples of this approach. 10 The




9
  LexisNexis does not permit automated downloading of the text of stories. We manually downloaded articles in
batches of 100 articles.
10
   Riffe Lacy Fico and Watson (2019) is an in depth presentation of these methods. Grimmer and Stewart (2013)
review the value of text analysis for summarizing political documents and transcripts.
results reported here use the Hu-Liu (2004) dictionary of positive and negative words. 11 We

compute the fraction of total words that are negative according to the dictionary and standardize

this variable to be mean 0 variance 1. 12

Second, we create a predicted probability that an article has a negative tone. We identify

characteristics of negative and positive media reports in a set of 200 articles classified as strongly

positive or negative by human readers. We use the two- and three-word phrases appearing in the

training articles combined with machine leaning techniques to find the phrases that best predict

whether the human reader will classify an article as strongly negative. We implement a Naïve

Bayes classification scheme (Zhang 2004 , Pazzani 1996, Antweiler and Frank 2004). 13 Naïve

Bayes assumes that each phrase in the article contributes independently to the probability that the

article is negative and maximizes the number of correct predictions given the phrases.

We use the resulting model to predict whether each of the 20,000 articles in our sample are

negative. For example, the inclusion of the phrases "clinical trial" and "Jenner Institute" are strong

predictors of an article being positive while "White House" and "death toll" are strong predictors

of a negative article.

Table 1 reports summary statistics at the article level for our main sample which excludes New

York Times most popular articles and a comparison sample of non-COVID articles. We analyze

roughly 23,500 articles from January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020. On average the articles have 1652



11
   We have conducted the same analysis using the Harvard General Inquirer dictionary of positive and negative
words and obtain qualitatively similar results. http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/
12
   To keep the yardstick consistent, we standardize once within our broad sample which includes New York Times
most popular articles and a sample of non-Covid articles. Our main analysis sample excludes these two categories.
We standardize before dropping duplicates of articles which were published multiple times.

words. This count and our subsequent statistics are measured after we apply a truncation procedure

to limit the text to be within 10 lines of the words "COVID" or "coronavirus". We applied this

truncation to deal with very long television transcripts that switched to non-COVID topics in the

middle of the transcript. However, results are quite similar with or without truncation.

The share of negative words (using the Hu-Liu dictionary) is 4 percent. As mentioned above we

standardize this variable to aid in interpreting the coefficients. By construction, our articles are

divided roughly equally between articles on increases/decreases in cases, reopenings, and

vaccines. The division among US major media, US General media, International Major Media,

and International General media is also roughly equal. 14

Results

Figure 1 plots the time trend in media negativity for major media outlets in the U.S. (green line)

and outside the U.S. (blue line) using the scale on the left. The most striking fact is that 91 percent

of the U.S. stories are classified as negative whereas 54 percent of the non-U.S. stories are

classified as negative. Figure 1 uses our estimated probability that an article is negative. We

obtain similar results using the Hu-Liu dictionary and the fraction of words in the article that are

negative.

The red line plots the weekly average of daily new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. using the scale

on the right. The x-axis is the week of the year within 2020. New cases per day rise sharply from

March through mid-April. Cases decline until about June 15th, then rise rapidly until late July,



14
  We don't have exactly 25% of articles in each major category because our initially drawn sample included many
articles that were repeats which we then eliminated to arrive at this final sample. Our reopenings analysis is for all
reopenings articles. We also examine school reopenings specifically and for these articles "school" must appear in
the title of an article that also contains "reopen" or "re-open".
when cases begin to decline again. Average media negativity over time is not correlated with new

case counts, as regression results confirm (not reported).

In Table 2 we regress our estimated probability that an article is negative on indicator variables for

whether the source is from the U.S. major media, U.S. general sources, or international general

sources. The omitted category is international (non-U.S.) major media sources. In the regressions

we control flexibly for the length of the article and the week the article was published. We run a

linear probability model, though results from probit and logit models are similar to those reported

here. The non-U.S. major media sources have a baseline rate of negativity of 54 percent. In

column (1) we show that relative to this omitted category, articles in the U.S. major media are 25

percentage points more likely to be negative. In contrast, U.S. general and non-U.S. general

sources have about the same level of negativity as non-U.S. major media.

In column (2) we switch the dependent variable to the share of negative words in the article. We

standardize the outcome to be mean 0 standard deviation 1. The U.S. major media publish stories

that are .23 standard deviations more negative relative to non-U.S. major media. U.S. general

media outlets are significantly less negative than all other categories of sources. In columns (3)-

(5) we examine media negativity by subtopic within COVID-19. Relative to both types of

international media, U.S. major media vaccine articles are particularly negative. Vaccine stories

in the U.S. major media are 45 percentage points more likely to be negative relative to stories in

the non-U.S. general media.

In Figure 2 we present the mean share of negative words (standardized) by source and topic

(COVID-19 versus not). For Figure 2 only, we add a large sample of non-COVID articles and the

New York Times most popular articles. Starting with the bars at the bottom of the chart, we see

that in a sample of non-COVID-19 stories (pre-January 2020), the U.S. major media are only
modestly more negative than the rest of the sample. In covering COVID-19 (the second bar from

the bottom), U.S. major media negativity is .31 standard deviation above the average while the

non-U.S. major media are .17 standard deviation below average. Notably, scientific media articles

on COVID-19 vaccines are a full standard deviation below average in negativity. In contrast, the

New York Times' most popular articles are .6 standard deviations above the sample mean in

negativity for non-COVID-19 stories and 1.5 standard deviations above the mean when covering

COVID-19 topics. Readers of the U.S. major media (as represented by the New York Times) are

attracted to negative stories in general and negative stories about COVID-19 in particular.

The next two figures look specifically at the share of words that are negative within vaccine articles

(Figure 3) and within school reopening articles (Figure 4). We standardize across the entire sample

(all topics) and hence are comparing the negativity in the vaccine articles to the overall sample

mean. For vaccine articles, all media categories are meaningfully below the overall sample mean

for negativity, except for the U.S. major media which produces articles on COVID-19 vaccines

that are .35 standard deviations higher on negativity.

These data were gathered prior to Pfizer's positive stage three trial result announced on November

9th. Our results show that on a relative basis, U.S. major media gave much less positive coverage

to the developments that lead up to Pfizer's breakthrough. We hypothesize (but have not yet

tested) that U.S. major media coverage of vaccines remained more negative than other categories

of media during and after the Pfizer announcement.

For school re-opening articles (Figure 4), the U.S. major media is .18 standard deviations more

negative than the overall sample mean.       All other media categories are less negative than the

sample mean. The U.S. general media vaccine articles are .4 standard deviations less negative.
A natural question is whether media negativity varies greatly by the specific news source and

whether that variation is related to the political beliefs of the readership. Our results are perhaps

surprising. COVID-19 stories from all the major U.S. outlets have high levels of negativity and

the variation that does exist is not correlated with readers' political leanings. See Figure 5. We

plot the share of negative words (standardized) by U.S. media source versus the probability that

conservative-leaning people say that this is a "trusted media source." The latter comes from a

2019 Pew survey of 12,000 people about their consumption of election news. 15

The estimated probability that a COVID-19 article is negative varies from 70 percent to 100

percent among major U.S. outlets. These probabilities are not correlated with the likelihood that

conservative consumers of news trust the source. COVID-19 stories from Fox News are about as

negative as those from CNN. We obtain similar results using our estimated probability that a story

is negative.

We now take a broader look at which COVID-19 topics the media choose to emphasize. Table 3

provides an overview of the number of COVID-19-related articles during our sample period

(January-July 2020) and counts of articles by topic, where one article can cover multiple topics.

Overall, we found 2.6 million articles from U.S.-based sources and 6.4 million from non-U.S.

sources. The rows represent different search terms we included while the columns represent four

broad categories of sources, namely U.S. versus non-U.S. interacted with major media outlet

versus general media. We are most interested in the relative coverage of different topics. For

example, among the U.S. major media (column 2) 15,000 stories mention increases in caseloads




15
    https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/24/qa-how-pew-research-center-evaluated-americans-trust-
in-30-news-sources/
while only 2,500 mention decreases, or a 6 to 1 ratio. Even when caseloads were falling nationally

(April 24th to June 27th), this ratio remains relatively high at 5.3 to 1.

In row 3, we show results for mentions of COVID-19 vaccines and any names of the top ten

institutions or companies working on a COVID-19 vaccine. The U.S. major outlets ran 1,371 such

stories. During the same period they ran 8,756 stories involving Trump and mask wearing and

1,636 stories about Trump and hydroxychloroquine.

A natural question is whether the media is promoting prosocial behaviors (Simonov et al 2020 and

Burstyn et al 2020). While we cannot answer whether the U.S. media are "doing enough" to

promote transmission-reducing behavior in absolute terms, we can compare how emphasis of the

benefits of mask wearing or social distancing varies across media categories. Five percent of

COVID-19 articles in U.S. major outlets mention the benefits of mask wearing compared to .6

percent for non-U.S. outlets and 2 percent for general U.S. sources. U.S. major media outlets are

also much more likely to discuss the benefits of social distancing (4 percent of stories) than their

non-U.S. counterparts (1 percent of stories). This suggests the U.S. media are outperforming the

non-U.S. media in promoting prosocial behavior, though perhaps because such messages are more

needed in the U.S. 16

Overall, we find that COVID-19 stories from U.S. major media outlets are much more negative

than similar stories from other U.S. outlets and from non-U.S. sources. The negativity does not

respond to changes in new cases. Potentially positive developments such as vaccine stories receive

less attention from U.S. outlets than do negative stories about Trump and hydroxychloroquine.

Overall, we are unable to explain the variation in negativity with political affiliation of an outlet's

consumption on human behavior.
audience, or U.S case count changes, but we do find that U.S. readers demand negative stories (as

evidenced by article popularity). We conclude that the CDC's implicit "warning label" against

consuming too much U.S. COVID-19 media may be warranted.

Notes: Negativity is estimated using supervised machine learning on article phrases coupled with a training data set.
Articles are manually downloaded from LexisNexis for the period January 1st, 2020 to July 31st, 2020. The red line
shows the weekly average of daily confirmed new COVID-19 cases and is accessed from the New York Times
website.

    Media Negativity by Source for COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19
                              Articles




Notes: Negativity is estimated as the fraction of negative words in the article and is standardized. Dark blue bars are
for COVID related articles and light blue bars are for non-COVID related articles. The raw share of negative words
is .043 with a standard deviation of .021. Negative words are defined by the Hu-Liu (1997) dictionary. Articles and
transcripts are manually downloaded from LexisNexis for the period January 1st, 2020 to July 31st, 2020 and
websites for Science, JAMA, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, and Nature. The New York Times
website is used for the list and text of the most popular articles.

  Notes: Article counts come from a LexisNexis for the period January 1st, 2020 to July 31st, 2020. The left most column indicates the search terms used (see
  methodology documents for exact searches). The article can be counted in multiple rows if the article contains both sets of terms.
Appendix 1
Dataset Construction Details and Search Terms Used
Data Set Construction
Our dataset was assembled from Nexus Lexis articles. We utilized the following instructions:
   1. Click on the link (links were derived from search terms at the bottom of this document)
   (setting pages to display 50 at a time instead of 10)
   2. Click the dropdown on the left that says location by publication
   3. Click edit settings
   4. In results display settings, switch it from 10 to 50.
   5. Scroll to the bottom and hit save (you may have to do this every time for each link, not entirely sure how it "saves"
   (downloading)
   6. Before downloading, double check that you are sorting by relevance, and the slider is set to group duplicates
   7. Click the little box beside the folder to select the whole page
   8. Go to the next page and do the same
   9. Click the download button which looks like it's a downwards pointing arrow
   10. In the dialog box, make sure the format is RTF and "save as individual files" these likely won't be done already.
   11. Download, and repeat until reaching 2500/link. In the final dataset this number may be less due to duplicates.
