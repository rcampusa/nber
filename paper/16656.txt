                                              ABSTRACT

Market definition is essential to merger analysis. Because no standard approach to market definition
exists, opposing parties in antitrust cases often disagree about the extent of the market. These differences
have been particularly relevant in the hospital industry, where the courts have denied seven of eight
merger challenges since 1994, due largely to disagreements over geographic market definition. We
compare geographic markets produced using common ad hoc methodologies to a method that directly
applies the “SSNIP test” to hospitals in California using a structural model. Our results suggest that
previously employed methods overstate hospital demand elasticities by a factor of 2.4 to 3.4 and define
larger markets than would be implied by the merger guidelines’s hypothetical monopolist test. The
use of these methods in differentiated product industries may lead to mistaken geographic market delineation,
and was likely a contributing factor to the permissive legal environment for hospital mergers.

Introduction

       Market definition is pivotal to the antitrust process and a key part of merger

analysis (Baker, 2007). The assessment of the potential competitive effects of a merger

or acquisition rest so heavily on the definition of a relevant antitrust market that Robert

Pitofsky, the former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), noted that

“antitrust practitioners have long known that the most important single issue in most

enforcement actions—because so much depends on it—is market definition.” (Pitofsky,

1990, p. 1807). While there is an approximate consensus about how market definition

should be done in principle (Baker, 2007), there is wide variation in how it is

implemented in practice. A number of ad hoc methods have been used which, as we

show, do not correspond well to the agreed upon concept of an antitrust market.

Although these ad hoc methods have been widely criticized, to our knowledge they have

not been previously compared to empirical antitrust markets that are consistent with

economic theory.

       It is clear that an antitrust market should be the set of products and locations that

exercise a significant competitive constraint on each other (Motta, 2004). The U.S.

antitrust authorities introduced the “SSNIP” test as a method for delineating markets

(Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice, 1982), and this approach has

been adopted by competition authorities worldwide. The Small but Significant and Non-

transitory Increase in Price (SSNIP) test begins by defining a narrow market and asking

whether a hypothetical monopolist in the defined market could profitably implement a

SSNIP (usually a 5 percent price increase for 1 year). If sufficient numbers of consumers

are likely to switch to alternative products so as to make the price increase unprofitable,



                                                                                               1
then the firm or cartel lacks the power to raise price. The relevant market therefore needs

to be expanded. The next closest substitute is added and the process is repeated until the

point is reached where a hypothetical cartel or monopolist could profitably impose a 5%

price increase. The set of products/locations so defined constitutes the relevant market.

        While the conceptual exercise prescribed by the SSNIP is straightforward,

implementation in practice is not. This is in part due to data limitations, and in part due

to analysts’ failure to utilize econometric analysis. If one has reliable estimates of

demand in hand, the SSNIP test can be implemented in a clear-cut way that is consistent

with the conceptual exercise. In the past, data limitations precluded demand estimation.

In addition, modern econometric methods were not brought to antitrust until

approximately 20 years ago (Scheffman and Spiller, 1987). As a consequence, ad hoc

methods of market definition were developed that did not require either extensive data or

econometric methods (Elzinga and Hogarty, 1973, 1978; Harris and Simons, 1989).

        These simple quantitative approaches to market definition have been widely used

in antitrust analysis, yet have been criticized for their static nature, simplifying

assumptions and internal inconsistencies that have the potential to affect the conclusions

drawn from the use of these methods (Baker, 2007; Capps et al., 2002; Danger and Frech,

2001; Frech et al., 2004; Katz and Shapiro, 2003; Langenfeld and Li, 2001; Varkevisser

et al., 2008; Werden, 1981, 1990).

        The use of such ad hoc market definition methods has been particularly influential

for antitrust decisions in the hospital industry, where 1,425 mergers and acquisitions were

successfully consummated between 1994 and 2009.1 These mergers have resulted in

et al., 2003; Gaynor & Vogt, 2003; Dafny, 2009), no measurable increase in the quality

of care (Hamilton and Ho, 2000)2 and an estimated loss of $42 billion in consumer

welfare (Town et al., 2005).3 While the hospital industry has seen more merger litigation

in recent years than any other industry,4 the courts have denied all but one government

request to block hospital mergers since 1994,5 due largely to the inability of the antitrust

authorities to convincingly define a geographic market that supports their case.6 In the

eight cases brought to the courts since 1994, the primary reason given for denying the

government’s request in six of these cases centered on the markets delineation.7

         This paper introduces a new method for market definition using a fully specified

structural model of consumer demand and firm behavior. The exercise prescribed by the

SSNIP can be performed exactly by using such a model. The use of these models has

been promoted in the past decade as a theoretically superior approach to merger analysis

in differentiated product industries, (e.g., Motta, 2004; Baker, 2007; Geroski and Griffith,

2004; van Reenen, 2004; Ivaldi and Lőrincz, 2009) however, such an approach has not

been commonly employed in antitrust analysis. Consequently little is known about the

differences in markets produced by these methods relative to methods used in actual

cases. We apply this method to the hospital industry and compare the markets implied by

this model to those produced by the ad hoc techniques that have been used in hospital

merger cases. We seek to better understand the extent to which currently employed

methods of market definition define markets that are consistent with the criteria for

merger analysis described in the merger guidelines.

       Our results suggest that the market definition techniques that have been used in

antitrust enforcement of hospital mergers by and large incorrectly define (geographic)

markets as specified by the merger guidelines’ hypothetical monopolist test. Our analysis

of a large subset of hospitals in the state of California using 1995 data suggests that

markets implied by previously employed quantitative market definition methods are, in

the majority of cases, substantially larger than those that would be implied by a method

rooted in the principles set forth in the merger guidelines. Finally, our examination of

mergers in San Diego provides an illustration of the differences in implied market

concentration in a localized region of the state, and enables comparison of our approach

to an alternative market definition method for hospitals developed by Capps et al. (2003).

guidelines and their application in the hospital industry. Part II discusses quantitative

methodologies, while Part V describes our data. Part VI presents our main results. Part

VII concludes.



I. The Merger Guidelines and Market Definition

The Merger Guidelines

         The merger guidelines are a collaborative effort by the FTC and DOJ outlining

the enforcement policy of the agencies concerning horizontal acquisitions and mergers

subject to section 7 of the Clayton Act, section 1 of the Sherman Act, or section 5 of the

FTC Act.8 They are considered to be the foremost articulation of the government’s policy

regarding enforcement standards for horizontal mergers (Werden, 1997). Their purpose

is to convey the analytical framework by which the government is to go about

determining the extent to which a merger is likely to lessen competition.

         Though the first guidelines were released in 1968 and modified as recently as

2010, the thrust of the criteria for market definition was pioneered largely in the 1982

version.9 The approach to market definition in the 1982 guidelines focused on the central

enforcement-related question of whether a merger would result in a price increase

through the use of the “SSNIP” criterion. In the SSNIP criterion, an antitrust market is

defined as a group of products and a geographic area in which a hypothetical profit-

maximizing firm, not subject to price regulation, that was the only present and future

seller of those products in that area would impose a “small but significant and non-

8
  Mergers subject to section 7 are prohibited if their effect “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to
tend to create a monopoly.” Mergers subject to section 1 are prohibited if they constitute a “contract,
combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.” Mergers are subject to section 5 if they constitute an
“unfair method of competition.”
9
  The FTC joined the DOJ in releasing joint guidelines beginning in 1992.


                                                                                                              5
transitory increase in price” (SSNIP) above all prevailing or likely future levels holding

constant the terms of sale for all products produced elsewhere. As a general matter, it

defined a price increase as significant if it was at least 5% and lasted for one year.10 The

general idea in this process is to find the smallest group of products or firms for which

there are no close substitutes, thus allowing such a hypothetical monopolist to exert

market power.11

         The development of this concept was notable in that the economic reasoning was

comprehensible to both attorneys and economists, and the methodology was operable.

Though economists and attorneys still differ on the implementation aspect of market

definition analysis, the basis for these disagreements is typically methodological rather

than the fundamental theoretical question of what defines a market (Scheffman et al.,

2002). To this day the SSNIP criterion continues to be the standard by which courts

define antitrust markets.

         The determination of market boundaries using the SSNIP test provides the basis

on which any subsequent steps rest when evaluating a merger. As Miles (2005) details,




10
   This was later refined in 1984 to ensure that 5% was not a rule, but 5% has nonetheless remained a
standard utilized in hospital merger cases by the courts. This was indicated in the Sutter case, as the court
requires a basis for deviating from this prescribed 5% figure. See California v. Sutter Health Sys., 84 F.
Supp. 2d 1057 (N.D. Cal.), aff'd mem., 2000-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) U 87,665 (9th Cir. 2000), revised, 130 F.
Supp. 2d 1109 (N.D. Cal. 2001).
11
   It should be noted that although the SSNIP test mandates that other prices be held constant, the
assumption of Bertrand competition assumes that reaction functions of other firms are upward sloping in
the prices of all other firms, and thus other firms would raise prices in reaction to the increase in price by a
firm. For this reason, the sizes SSNIP estimates of geographic markets are most likely an upper bound. This
is because upward sloping reaction functions for competitors (and thus higher prices) would induce less
substitution away from the hospitals included in the SSNIP test, and thus would require a smaller number
of coordinated price increases in order to increase profit. For an alternative approach that asks whether the
candidates in the market would increase prices by at least 5% in equilibrium, see Ivaldi and Lőrincz (2009).



                                                                                                              6
the court is required to follow a sequence of steps in determining the legality of a merger

consisting of12:

1. Definition of the relevant product market.
2. Definition of the relevant geographic market.
3. Identification of the competitors in the market defined from steps (1) and (2).
4. Calculation of market shares and Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI) of the
competitors in the market.
5. Calculation of merging firms’ post-merger market share and the level of post-merger
HHI. If this is too high, the merger is determined unlawful.
6. Consideration of other factors that indicate that the merger is unlikely to have
anticompetitive effects, such as ease of entry, ownership status, excess capacity and
efficiency gains.


         The first two steps involved in merger analysis are pivotal to the process in each

subsequent step. The inclusion of many products will understate market concentration,

while failure to include relevant products will overstate concentration. Likewise, the

delineation of geographic markets is fundamental to the determination of the degree of

market power. The inclusion of an inappropriately large number of firms will overstate

the degree of competition, while failure to incorporate all firms involved will understate

the prevailing competitive environment.

         Once the market boundaries have been set, the merger guidelines specify levels

and changes in the HHI which serve as a guide as to when mergers are likely to be anti-

competitive.13 According to the 2010 guidelines, markets with a post-merger HHI below



12
   The current (2010) guidelines offer more flexibility than in the past, in that “The Agencies’ analysis need
not start with market definition….although evaluation of competitive alternatives available to customers is
always necessary at some point in the analysis.” (FTC/DOJ, 2010, p. 7)
13
   Because the thresholds set by the guidelines are intended to be a reference point, the FTC has been
flexible in their enforcement of mergers conforming to these exact HHI thresholds. See Merger Challenges


                                                                                                            7
1,500 are said to be unconcentrated and are thus unlikely to have adverse competitive

effects. Markets with post-merger HHIs between 1,500 and 2,500 are regarded as

moderately concentrated and are likely to warrant scrutiny only if a merger will result in

an increase in the HHI of more than 100. Mergers resulting in a post-merger HHI of

above 2,500 are regarded as resulting in markets that are highly concentrated and thus

mergers producing an increase in HHI of between 100 and 200 are presumed to raise

significant competitive concerns, with increases of 200 points or more deemed likely to

enhance market power.



Application of the Merger Guidelines to Hospital Care

        In the case of hospital care, the relevant product market has not been an issue of

contention in merger cases. The generally accepted product market definition has been to

“cluster” products, leading to a typical product market definition of “general acute care

hospital services.”14 In only one of the last eight cases brought by the government has

failure to convincingly define a product market been a deciding factor in a hospital

merger case. 15

        The inability to convincingly define geographic markets for hospital care has,

however, been the primary determining factor in six of the government’s seven

consecutive unsuccessful merger challenges between 1994 and 1999. Table 1 presents a

list of the most recent cases challenged by the government, as well as the size of the

geographic markets and level of concentration in each market.16




II. Quantitative Approaches to Geographic Market Definition

         As discussed above, market definition is pivotal to the antitrust process. Failure to

correctly define a market may have serious consequences in antitrust cases. However,

because the merger guidelines prescribe their methodology through a thought experiment

rather than a concrete methodology, there is no uniform approach for defining these

markets. As a result, numerous quantitative approaches have been suggested and applied

across many industries including beverages, software, hospitals and supermarkets. These

include approaches based on product shipments, methodologies incorporating

econometric methods and merger simulation, and analysis of consummated mergers.17

Since we are using the hospital industry as our example, and since market definition

issues in this industry have revolved around geographic, rather than product markets, our

discussion in what follows will focus on geographic markets. It should be understood,

however, that the methodological issues are essentially the same regardless of whether

the focus is on product or geographic markets.18



Shipments-Based Approaches

16
   Only a fraction of the merger activity that has occurred has been challenged due to the issuance of the
Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy in Health Care which stipulated that mergers involving
hospitals with (1) less than 100 licensed beds, (2) less than 40 daily patients over the past 3 years, (3) a
merger that has been in existence for more than 5 years would not be challenged (see
http://www.ftc.gov/reports/hlth3s.htm).
17
   Although market definition cases rely upon quantitative methods as a basis for merger evaluation, these
cases often use factual qualitative evidence as well, such as testimony from buyers of the relevant product.
18
   Once can think of geographic location as a product attribute, in which case there’s no real difference
between product and geographic markets.


                                                                                                               9
        Shipments-based approaches have been commonly employed for geographic

market definition analysis in industries such as beer,19 photographic film20 and

software,21 and are, to the best of our knowledge, the only quantitative approaches

employed in hospital merger cases. The two methodologies most heavily utilized,

referred to as Elzinga-Hogarty and Critical Loss Analysis, rely on discharge (shipments)

data which are usually available from the hospitals themselves or from state reporting

agencies. Because of their utilization in the vast majority of hospital merger cases, we

focus mainly on these approaches in our analysis, as our aim is to examine market

definition methodology as it has been utilized in practice. Table 2 lists the market

definition methods used in actual hospital merger cases.



        Elzinga-Hogarty

        The Elzinga-Hogarty method, (Elzinga and Hogarty, 1973, 1978) uses shipments

information consisting of origin and destination data for delineating a market. Although

not originally developed for use in the hospital industry, as Table 2 indicates, it has been

utilized extensively in hospital merger cases. The Elzinga-Hogarty method determines

that a geographic area constitutes a market if that area satisfies a joint ratio of import and

export thresholds. The simultaneous satisfaction of these thresholds is evidence of the

self-sufficiency of the area for both demand and supply, and is thus a geographic market.

The method argues that if an area imports little of a particular product, it can be deemed a

market from a demand perspective. By similar logic, Elzinga and Hogarty argue that if an

area exports little of a particular product, it can be deemed a market from a supply

perspective.

        While Elzinga-Hogarty has frequently been acknowledged by the courts as an

acceptable method by which to define geographic markets, there are a number of

criticisms regarding the potential shortcomings of geographic markets defined using this

methodology, with particular attention devoted to its limitations for defining hospital

markets. 22 The first centers on heterogeneity by geography in quality or service. This

issue is particularly relevant in high-service, tertiary care urban hospitals which draw

large inflows of patients from rural areas. If a sufficient number of rural patients obtain

care at the urban hospitals, the Elzinga-Hogarty test could conclude that the urban and

rural areas are in the same geographic market, even though the price of care in the rural

region does not constrain the market power of the urban hospitals. As Werden (1990)

indicates, this scenario leads to markets that are larger than would be reasonable given

the hypothetical monopolist principle put forth in the merger guidelines.

        Alternatively, the use of shipments data can underestimate the size of markets. As

Werden (1981) illustrates, two firms may be close substitutes for each other but have no

cross shipments between the regions in which they are located (due to consumers

optimizing based on transportation costs). In this case Elzinga-Hogarty would

erroneously conclude that each firm and its corresponding region constitute a market,

despite the competitive constraints present due to their high cross price elasticities.

Other critical assessments of the methodology’s implications for behavior focus on its

static nature which makes consumer behavioral assumptions based on the pre-merger

22
 In the most recent hospital merger case (In the Matter of Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Corporation,
Docket No. 9315, FTC August 2007) Elzinga himself testified that the method is not appropriate for
hospital market definition.


                                                                                                      11
rather than post-merger terms of sale, and the “silent majority” criticism of Capps et al.

(2001) which implicitly assumes that if some patients are willing to travel to a more

distant hospital to escape a price increase by the merging hospitals, other patients will do

so as well. 23



        Critical Loss Analysis

        Critical Loss analysis (Harris and Simons, 1989) has been widely employed in

merger analysis since its introduction in 1989 (Epstein and Rubinfeld, 2004). It seeks to

directly answer the question posed by the merger guidelines regarding the smallest set of

hospitals that would have to be included in the market to make a hypothetical price

increase of 5% profitable. Although it has been used less frequently than the Elzinga-

Hogarty methodology, Critical Loss has played an important role in determining

geographic markets in industries such as chewing tobacco24 and supermarkets,25 and in

hospital cases such as the Dubuque, Poplar Bluff and Sutter cases detailed in Table 2. In

addition, in the Poplar Bluff case mentioned above, the circuit court gave substantial

weight to the defendant’s Critical Loss analysis in its reversal of the district court’s initial

ruling (Langenfeld and Li, 2001).

        The Critical Loss test proceeds in three steps. For a given set of firms, the first

step is to determine, for a given price increase, the percentage reduction in demand that

would render such a price increase unprofitable. This percentage reduction is a function

of the proposed price increase (typically fixed at 5%) and the gross margin of the firm.

For a firm with high margins, the loss of relatively few consumers will significantly

impact profitability, while low margin firms would need to lose fewer customers in order

to impose the same impact on profitability. The second step involves calculating the

actual percentage of sales that a firm would lose were they to increase their price by a

given percentage. This is called the estimated loss. The third step entails comparing the

Critical Loss with the estimated loss. If the estimated loss is greater than the Critical

Loss, this area does not constitute a market as defined by the SSNIP test.26 The market is

then expanded to include firms that are viewed as the next closest substitutes for the

group of hospitals in question.

        While the principles of Critical Loss rest upon sound economic reasoning, in

practice the implementation of Critical Loss has been subject to a number of criticisms.

One criticism concerns the classification of accounting cost data used for the

determination of the contribution margin, as the use of such data to calculate the

contribution margin allows for discretion in the classification of fixed versus variable

costs. An incentive exists for merging parties to classify a large portion of their costs as

fixed, since such classification reduces the scope of costs that can be determined as

variable, thus resulting in the determination of a high contribution margin and large

Critical Loss markets (Langenfeld and Li, 2001).

     The implementation methods used in the determination of the estimated loss have

also been subject to criticism, particularly as they have been employed in hospital merger

cases. This is because in practice, determination of the estimated loss in hospital merger

cases has entailed examining zip codes in which a significant percentage (e.g. 20% or

more) of patients already use other hospitals. It is then argued that given a price increase,

a significant number of patients in these zip codes would switch to an alternative hospital

and make such an increase unprofitable. Such claims are, however, disputed since the

high contribution margins claimed by analysts also imply that the actual loss sustained by

a firm would be small. This is because the presence of a large contribution margin

implies a low elasticity of demand and consequently, a small actual loss (Katz and

Shapiro, 2003; Danger and Frech, 2001). Furthermore, a paper by Simpson (2001)

argues that in areas deemed contestable (presumably indicating a high elasticity of

demand), price increases at nearby hospitals in actuality induce very small numbers of

patients to switch, thus indicating that demand is in fact less elastic in these contestable

zip codes than has been put forward in hospital merger cases.




III. Market Definition Using a Structural Model



Using the Structural Model for Market Definition

         In what follows, we employ a structural model of market competition to

implement the SSNIP test method to define hospital markets in California. We then go

on to compare the markets obtained via the SSNIP test with those via the methods that

have been commonly employed in hospital merger cases (Elzinga-Hogarty and Critical

Loss).




                                                                                               14
        The structural model estimates demand and supply relation parameters and builds

on the work of Baker and Bresnahan (1985), Scheffman and Spiller (1987), and Froeb

and Werden (2000). We employ a model based on Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes’s (2004)

model of differentiated product oligopoly and adapted for use in the hospital industry by

Gaynor and Vogt (2003). The model is well suited to the SSNIP criteria in that it is a

fully specified model of price and quantity determination and it allows for the calculation

of own-price and cross-price elasticities for each hospital in the data. In addition, it

allows for the determination of an initial equilibrium price and quantity for the market,

thus allowing for direct implementation of the thought experiment characterized by the

merger guidelines.

        This structural model of differentiated product oligopoly models demand at the

level of an individual consumer using discrete choice techniques and micro data on

individuals. This allows demographic characteristics at the level of individual consumers

to explain hospital choice. In addition, its use of multinomial logit demand implies that

the use of the model for merger predictions will result in lower post-merger prices (and

thus larger antitrust markets) than would be produced by alternative specifications

(Crooke et al., 1999). While this section presents the basic constructs of the model, for a

full exposition, including parameter estimates, see Gaynor and Vogt (2003).

        With a choice set of j (j=1,…..J) hospitals, the utility of consumer i(=1,….,N) is

assumed to be of the form:

                                                                   ξ                   (1)

where     is the hospital price,   is the marginal utility of income, X are observable

consumer characteristics, observable hospital characteristics and their interactions,        are



                                                                                              15
consumer and hospital characteristics interacted with price and         are unobservable

hospital characteristics. Assuming that        is an i.i.d. Weibull random variable, the

probability that consumer i attends hospital j can be written as:




                                                                                           (2)
                                   ∑




and the demand faced by hospital j charging price pj can be written as:



                               ∑                                                           (3)



where    is the quantity of hospital goods consumed by consumer i.

        Because equation (1) contains an unobservable term ( ) that is correlated with

price, a set of hospital fixed effects are used to absorb this source of endogeneity, as

proposed by Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (2004). Since the use of this fixed effect

obfuscates identification of       , an additional regression of these hospital fixed effects on

hospital price and other observable hospital characteristics is used to recover this

parameter. Because price is also endogenous in this additional regression, exogenous

wages and predicted quantity (using only geographic distribution and exogenous

consumer characteristics) are used as instruments for price, thus enabling recovery of           ,

the marginal utility of income.




                                                                                                 16
         In this model, firms are assumed to maximize profits à la Bertrand.27 Multi-plant

firms (called multihospital systems) are also common in this industry, necessitating a

model which accounts for substitution among plants and the coordination of pricing.

Letting θ represent a J×J matrix with θjk = 1 if hospitals j and k have the same owner and

θjk = 0 otherwise, the familiar Bertrand pricing equation used in the model is of the form:




                                                            Q
                                                   Θ⊗                                                (4)


where         /     is the J×J demand derivative matrix and ⊗ denotes an element-by-

element Hadamard matrix multiplication operator.

         Of note for this model is that it allows for observed consumer heterogeneity via

varying distances from consumers to hospitals and thus does not exhibit independence of

irrelevant alternatives or the restrictive substitution patterns of the logit (Train, 2003).

Using the estimates obtained from this model, own-price and cross-price elasticities can

be calculated for each hospital in the dataset using the formulas:

                                            ∑               1                                        (5)




                                            ∑                                                        (6)




where (5) corresponds to the calculation of the own-price, and (6) to the cross-price

elasticity.

27
  Not-for-profit firms are common in this industry. Not-for-profit hospitals are assumed to value output
(e.g., community service, access to care). This makes not-for-profits, in essence, like for-profits with lower
marginal costs. The econometric model allows for marginal cost (and demand) differences between for-
profits and not-for-profits.


                                                                                                           17
        We present a summary of the key model characteristics in Table 3.28 Hospitals

face a downward sloping demand curve, with average own-price elasticity of -4.57 and

an average price of $4,681 for a unit of care. Additionally, as the average cross-price

elasticities in the bottom of Table 3 show, hospitals physically close to one another have

higher cross-price elasticities than do hospitals far apart. For example, the average cross-

price elasticity between a given hospital and its most proximate competitor (measured by

distance) is calculated as 0.60, while the cross-price elasticity with the fifth-closest

competitor is one-third of this magnitude. This implies that markets for hospital care are

largely local.



Adapting the Structural Model for SSNIP Market Definition

     In order to define geographic markets that conform as closely as possible to the

Merger Guidelines using the structural model, we define the SSNIP test for a given

hospital as the smallest set of hospitals (inclusive of the hospitals for which we are

attempting to define a SSNIP market) for which a given price increase would be

profitable, holding constant price at all other hospitals. While a formal definition of our

SSNIP markets is included in Appendix B, intuitively, the SSNIP criterion states that for

a given hospital, j, a SSNIP market is the smallest set of hospitals for which an increase

in price at this set of hospitals (including hospital j) would increase the collective profits

in the systems of which these hospitals are members. This approach allows for the

definition of geographic markets that take into account system membership, making it

consistent with the current (2010) revision of the merger guidelines in its explicit

                                                                                              18
treatment of firms that own multiple plants in the same geographic area.29 To illustrate

the criterion, consider 4 hospitals, A, B, C and D, and let A and B be members of the

same hospital system. Suppose hospitals A and C act as a “hypothetical monopolist” and

engage in a coordinated price increase of 5% (holding the terms of sale constant at all

other locations), resulting in a decrease in demand at both hospitals and a decrease in

profits at the combined hospital entity of A and C. Suppose, however, that B is a

sufficiently adequate substitute for care at these hospitals so that the increase in profit as

a result of the increase in demand for hospital B’s services is greater than the decrease in

profits at the combined hospital entity of A and C. Hospitals A and C would be a market

under the SSNIP criterion, as the collective profits in the systems of which these hospitals

are members has increased. Likewise, if hospital D is a close substitute for the care

rendered at A and C while hospital B is not, hospital B would see little or no increase in

demand or profits and thus hospitals A and C would not be considered a market

according to the SSNIP criterion.

     In the event that a price increase at a given location results in a reduction of sales that

would be large enough such that a hypothetical monopolist would not find it profitable to

impose an increase in price, the merger guidelines suggest adding the location from

which production is the next-best substitute for production at the merging firm’s location.

Because spatial differentiation is an important attribute of hospital care, when a SSNIP is

not profitable, we include additional hospitals in order of their geographic proximity to

the location of the merging hospital(s) in question. Our algorithm for implementing


29
   The 2010 merger guidelines require that a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm that was the only present
or future producer of the relevant product(s) located in the region would impose at least a SSNIP from at
least one location, including at least one location of one of the merging firms. They also explicitly state that
a single firm may operate in a number of different geographic markets.


                                                                                                             19
SSNIP markets using the structural Bertrand model (SSNIP Market Definition) is as

follows:



     1. Begin with a hospital for which one would like to define a geographic market.

     2. Find the hospital geographically closest to the hospital chosen in step 1.

     3. Raise the price of only these hospitals by a given percentage (we use 5%) and

         allow demand to change as a result of the price increase.

     4. If the total difference in profits for the hospital system (given diversion to other

         hospitals in the same system) is positive, this constitutes a market by the SSNIP

         test. If it does not, we add the next hospital that is geographically closest to the

         hospital in step 1.



     We repeat this process until the increase in price for the chosen hospitals results in a

     positive difference in profits.30




IV.      Comparison Methodology for Implementing the SSNIP Test

         In our implementation of market definition, we employ the two versions of the

shipments-based techniques, Elzinga-Hogarty and Critical Loss, detailed in Section II.

Specifically, we seek to compare the geographic markets defined by the SSNIP criterion

using the structural model with the markets implied by the two most commonly

employed quantitative geographic market definition techniques for hospital merger cases.
30
  Note that this algorithm allows for hospitals which are close substitutes and also members of the same
system to capture each others’ demand as the result of a price increase at one of the hospitals. Additionally,
because the current merger guidelines require only that a SSNIP be imposed at only one location, our
algorithm produces markets that are likely larger than would be implied by the current (2010) revision of
the merger guidelines.


                                                                                                           20
In what follows we describe our implementation of market definition using these

methods.



Elzinga-Hogarty Simulation

       As previously described, the Elzinga-Hogarty method of geographic market

definition uses shipments information consisting of origin and destination data for

delineating a market. It specifies the use of the “little in from outside” measure (LIFO) to

determine the geographic extent of demand while the “little out from inside” measure

(LOFI) determines the geographic extent of supply. The simultaneous satisfaction of a

given threshold for each of these measures is evidence of a geographic market. The

thresholds recommended in the original article are .75 for a “weak market” and .9 for a

“strong market.” With regard to hospital care, Elzinga-Hogarty can be thought of as a

joint ratio of import and export thresholds by which to judge the self-sufficiency of a

particular market. We define the “import” of health care as an individual leaving an area

in order to be treated, and the “export” of health care as an individual from another area

(other than the one being analyzed) being treated in the relevant area. Elzinga-Hogarty

posits that if an area imports little of its health care, it can be deemed a market from the

demand perspective, as few individuals see the need to leave the area to be treated. Thus

as the import ratio, defined as



                       patient outflows from area of interest into any other area
       import ratio
                                 total discharges from area of interest




                                                                                               21
gets increasingly small, 1-(import ratio) gets increasingly large. LIFO is thus defined as

1-(import ratio).

       Similarly, Elzinga-Hogarty posits that if an area exports little of its health care, it

can be deemed a market from the supply perspective. Thus as the export ratio of

healthcare defined as

                                patient inflows from other areas into this area
                export ratio=
                                 total discharges from hospitals in this area



gets increasingly small, this is equivalent of 1-(export ratio) getting increasingly large.

LOFI is thus defined as 1-(export ratio).

       There are numerous ways in which Elzinga-Hogarty markets can be calculated.

Specifically, the means by which one expands a market that does not meet the prescribed

LIFO and LOFI criteria can affect the size of the market determined for a given hospital.

Frech et al. (2004) propose six methods for expanding an Elzinga-Hogarty market based

on the geographic area from which a given hospital draws its patients. For our purposes,

we employ the method of expansion termed “contiguous search” to expand the market.

This version of Elzinga-Hogarty market definition proceeds in 3 steps: The first step in

expanding the market is to set a threshold at which the simultaneous satisfaction of this

threshold for both LIFO and LOFI constitutes a market. The contiguous search method

then proceeds by first choosing a zip code for which one would like to calculate an

Elzinga-Hogarty market. LIFO and LOFI are calculated for this zip code. If either LIFO

or LOFI is less than the prescribed threshold, one chooses the zip code that contributes

most to the minimum of LIFO and LOFI, from the universe of zip codes contiguous to




                                                                                              22
the zip code of interest.31 For each additional zip code, zj, that is contiguous to the

combination of zip codes already included in the service area from previous iterations, z-j,

zip code zi is added, one at a time if it satisfies (for each iteration):



                               max                ,     , max                ,


         Zip codes continue to be added until both LIFO and LOFI equal the prescribed

threshold. For our analysis, we use the “weak market” criterion of 0.75 as our threshold.

As Frech et al. (2004) detail in their work, this method is one of the two approaches that

produce markets which are relatively compact and contiguous, and produce the most

realistic geographic markets. In addition, our choice of the weak market threshold of 0.75

rather than the strong market threshold of 0.9 is because in practice, it is virtually

impossible to obtain an Elzinga-Hogarty market for hospital care at a threshold of 0.9 for

some markets in our data, short of including most of the state.



Critical Loss Simulation

         In Critical Loss analysis, for a given price increase, the percentage reduction in

demand, X, that would render a price increase unprofitable is given by Harris and Simons

(1989) as

                                                   Y
                                           X          *100
                                                 Y CM




31
  Because of data limitations, we use a fixed radius between zip code centroids to create the universe of zip
codes by which to expand the market, rather than shared zip code borders.


                                                                                                          23
where Y is the proportion increase in price (5% in the case of the SSNIP test) and CM is

the contribution margin defined as               .     This value of X is called the “Critical Loss.”
                                              P

We employ a method based on previous cases for both the estimated contribution margin

as well as the estimated actual loss. Though calculation of contribution margins is

theoretically a straightforward exercise, in practice the calculation of these margins for

hospitals in merger cases is subject to the discretion of the analyst as to the definition of

fixed cost and variable cost. Consequently, our implementation of Critical Loss utilizes

approximations of these margins based on past merger cases rather than attempting to

extrapolate the classification of costs according to merging parties. The contribution

margin assumed in these cases has ranged from 41.4% in State of California v. Sutter

Health System to 65.9% in FTC v. Tenet. 33

           For our simulation of the estimated loss, we employ a method of determining the

“contestable zip codes” for a market of hospitals, meaning the collection of zip codes in

which at least a fixed percentage of the patients travel to hospitals other than those

posited as a potential market. It is then hypothesized that for these zip codes, if a given

increase in price were to be implemented, the demonstrated willingness of individuals in

these zip codes to travel outside of the proposed market for care at the present terms of

sale is evidence that a sufficient number of substitutes exist. Thus it is put forward that a

SSNIP would induce a significant number of these patients to switch to hospitals not

implementing such an increase in price. Given that our goal is to approximate Critical

Loss markets as determined by previous cases, we utilize a method similar, although not

determines the contestable zip codes and then states the number from these zip codes that

would have to leave in order to make a price increase unprofitable, we instead impose a

fixed percentage that would leave contestable zip codes for a given price increase. This

step is necessary in order to implement an algorithm to find Critical Loss markets rather

than define an arbitrary market and then hypothesize about the behavior of the patients in

this area necessary to make this area a market of a given size. Though this actual loss

number is not clearly defined and could vary greatly by case, we base our actual loss

numbers on the determination in the Sutter case that suggested that the number of patients

traveling into the proposed market that would have to switch is between one-third and

two-thirds.

        Given that the court ruled in favor of the defendant, we interpret this figure to be

indicative of the court’s conclusion of the likely substitution patterns of hospital

patients.34 In our calculation of Critical Loss, we apply a contribution margin of 55%

which would determine that the Critical Loss is approximately 8.3% for a 5% increase in

price. We define zip codes as contestable if 25% or more patients travel to hospitals other

than those being defined in a hypothetical merger. Finally, we assume that of the patients

that currently receive care at one of the merging hospitals, 30% of these patients from zip

codes deemed contestable (i.e. have at least 25% outflows under the pre-merger terms of

sale) would substitute to another hospital as a result of a 5% increase in price.35


34
   We do acknowledge, however that the number of patients that were determined to travel into the market
accounted for only 15% of the total discharges in question. The set of contestable zip codes often does
constitute a larger subset of discharges than was determined “out of the market” in the Sutter case.
35
   Our algorithm works as follows:
    1) Start with a hospital and the hospital closest to this hospital.
    2) Find the universe of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) served by the hospitals chosen.
    3) Find the contestable zip codes given this universe of DRGs.
    4) Calculate the actual loss by assuming that 30% of the patients currently attending the hospitals of
         interest in the contestable zip codes acquire their care elsewhere.


                                                                                                        25
V. Data

         We use 1995 data from California’s Office of Statewide Health Planning and

Development (OSHPD) which maintains a variety of datasets on various aspects of health

care in the state.36 Below we briefly describe each of the particular datasets we draw upon

and the criteria for selecting subsets of the data.



Discharge data

         Among the items collected by OSHPD for each discharge are patient

demographics, diagnosis, treatment, an identifier for the hospital at which the patient

sought care, the patient’s zip code of residence, and charges.



Annual and Quarterly Financial data

          Annual financial disclosures are submitted each fiscal year and every time a

hospital changes ownership. From these data, we use information on location of the

hospital, ownership of the hospital, type of care provided by the hospital, whether the

hospital is a teaching hospital or not, and wages. Quarterly financial disclosures are

submitted by calendar quarters, so that they are synchronized both with the discharge data

and with one another.



Selections


     5) Compare the loss calculated in (4) to the critical loss figure of 8.3% of original demand. If actual
          loss is greater than critical loss, we add the next closest hospital and repeat steps 1-4. If not, the set
          of hospitals is determined to be a market.

        For 1995, there are a total of 3.6 million patient discharges. For our analysis we

use only those discharges whose payment comes from private sources. These are

discharges in the HMO, PPO, other private, self-pay, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield

categories. This amounts to 1.47 million discharges. Our motivation in making these

choices is that for patients in these categories, some entity is making explicit choices

among hospitals, based, at least in part, on price. In the case of the various insurance

categories, insurers have discretion both over which hospitals to include in their networks

of approved providers and via any channeling of patients to less expensive hospitals.

We also eliminate patients with a DRG frequency of less than 1,000, patients with

missing values for any of the variables used in any of our analyses, patients with charges

less than $500 or greater than $500,000 and consumers with lengths of stay of zero or

greater than 30. After all the exclusions, there are 913,547 remaining observations.

       Of the 593 total hospitals in the financial data, we exclude hospitals such as

psychiatric hospitals, children’s hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, and other specialty

institutions, as well as hospitals associated with staff model HMOs. In addition we

exclude hospitals with either missing or useless quarterly financial data (some hospitals

had larger deductions from revenue than they had gross revenue, for example). We also

exclude hospitals with fewer than 100 discharges for the year. Finally, we drop hospitals

whose closest competitor (in terms of distance) is in another state. This is because our

data precludes us from observing hospitals in neighboring states which could presumably

be reasonable substitutes for those hospitals located on a state border. This leaves us with

an analysis sample of 913,547 discharges and 368 hospitals.

VI. Results



Statewide Analysis

         In order to compare markets delineated by using the three different methodologies

described above, we define markets using Critical Loss, Elzinga-Hogarty and the SSNIP

market definition using the structural model for all hospitals in our data.

Table 4 reveals substantial differences in the markets defined by the methodologies in

both the number of hospitals in each market, as well as the degree of concentration as

defined by the HHI measures. SSNIP market definition using the structural model

determines that the median hospital operates in a market of 3 hospitals with an HHI of

3,814.37 This is well above the threshold determined by the merger guidelines as being

highly concentrated. In contrast, our version of Critical Loss concludes that the median

hospital operates in a market with 16 hospitals and an HHI of 1,194. Elzinga-Hogarty

defines markets similar to Critical Loss, with the median hospital operating in a market

with 12 other hospitals and an HHI of 1,499. Thus under the merger guidelines, both the

Critical Loss and Elzinga-Hogarty methods would find that the median hospital exists in

a market that is unconcentrated.

         Many health economics studies use political boundaries to define markets, such as

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), or Health Service Areas (HSA), which are defined

based on commuting patterns and patient flows respectively (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007,

page 895; Makuc, 1991). Therefore we also examine the implications of using these

boundaries to define geographic markets. This produces the lowest concentration
37
  We use available beds in our calculation of HHI by market. The correlation between beds, total
discharges and total patient days and other standard measures of hospital output is above .9 for all
measures.


                                                                                                       28
measures of all market definition approaches. Using MSAs to define geographic markets

implies that the median hospital operates in a market with 18 hospitals and an HHI of

1,191, while defining geographic markets using HSAs infers that the median hospital

operates in a market with 15 other hospitals and an HHI of 1,191.

       A more detailed breakdown of the hospitals by geographic area reveals a

substantial amount about the competitive environment for hospitals based upon their

location. Dividing the hospitals in the sample into hospital “density quartiles” based on

the number of hospitals within a 25-mile radius exposes the wide variation in the

methodologies’ market definition for urban and rural areas. Quartile 1 includes hospitals

with 0-5 other hospitals within a 25-mile radius, quartile 2 includes hospitals with 6-18

other hospitals within a 25-mile radius, quartile 3 includes hospitals with 19-70 other

hospitals within a 25-mile radius, while quartile 4 includes hospitals with 71-110 other

hospitals within a 25-mile radius. Figure 1 maps these hospital density quartiles while

Table 5 shows the characteristics of hospitals within these quartiles

       As can be seen in Figure 1, the wide variability in the number of other hospitals

within a 25-mile radius is due to the difference in hospital density in urban and rural

areas. In particular, quartile 4 consists entirely of hospitals in Los Angeles County and

Orange County, while quartile 3 consists of hospitals from the Los Angeles (44.3%), San

Francisco-San Jose (37.5%) and San Diego (18.2%) metro areas. Quartile 1 consists of

mostly Northern California hospitals, hospitals in coastal towns and on the far outskirts of

metro areas, while quartile 2 comprises a mix of hospitals on the periphery of the 5 major




                                                                                            29
metro areas in California, as well as the hospitals located in the central part of the state

between San Francisco and Los Angeles.38

        As would be expected, the size of the geographic markets using all three of the

methodologies indicates that markets are more concentrated in areas where there are

fewer nearby hospitals and less concentrated in areas where there are more hospitals

close by. The magnitude of the concentration difference, however, varies substantially

depending on the density quartile. In particular, in quartile 1, all methodologies indicate

that the mean level of market concentration is somewhat high, although the structural

model produces markets where the mean level of market concentration is higher than that

implied by both Elzinga-Hogarty and Critical Loss. However, in this quartile, Elzinga-

Hogarty and Critical Loss agree with SSNIP market definition on the size of the market

in 22 and 10 of the 93 cases respectively, and produce smaller markets in some cases.

This stands in contrast to quartile 3 and 4 in which neither shipments-based methodology

produces markets of comparable size to markets defined using the structural model.

        As is evident from Table 5, all three of the methodologies produce markets that

include more hospitals in areas with greater hospital density. However, though the change

in the level of concentration by market is directionally equivalent, the magnitudes of the

concentration levels differ substantially. This suggests that although the shipments-based

methods are consistent in their determination that antitrust markets encompass a larger

number of hospitals in areas with greater hospital density (i.e. urban areas), the difference

in market sizes determined by these methods are substantially larger than those implied

by the structural model, and these differences are greater as the number of surrounding

Francisco.


                                                                                                   30
hospitals increases. In Los Angeles, for example, in density quartile 4, Elzinga-Hogarty

must include an average of 50 hospitals (and over 100 zip codes) in order to produce a

market, whereas Critical Loss must include an average of 65 hospitals in order for the

loss from contestable zip codes to be sufficiently small so as to produce a market. In

contrast SSNIP market definition finds that the average hospital in this quartile operates

in a market with just 5 other hospitals. In quartile 1 on the other hand, Elzinga-Hogarty

specifies a market with an average of 7.19 hospitals and Critical Loss determines that an

average market in this quartile includes 5.8 hospitals. Market definition using the

structural model determines that in this quartile, the average hospital market consists of

just 2.78 hospitals

        The bottom panel of Table 5 also reveals a great deal about the market

concentration according to the prescribed thresholds set by the merger guidelines.39

Across quartiles, both Critical Loss and Elzinga-Hogarty indicate that markets become

less concentrated as we move from quartile 1 to quartile 4. The percentage of hospitals

operating in markets with HHIs of less than 1,500 for Critical Loss increases from 8.6%

in quartile 1 to 100% in quartile 4. Likewise, for Elzinga-Hogarty, the percentage of

hospitals in markets with HHIs of less than 1,500 increases from 16.1% in quartile 1 to

100% in quartile 4. SSNIP market definition using the Bertrand model finds only five

markets with HHIs of less than 1,500 in any concentration quartile.

        The number of markets considered highly concentrated (HHI greater than 2,500)

also show significant changes across concentration quartiles. The percentage of hospitals

operating in markets with HHIs of greater than 2,500 according to Critical Loss decreases


39
 While the guidelines specify thresholds for post-merger market shares, the HHIs discussed below are pre-
merger market shares. Nevertheless, we use them as reference points in our analysis.


                                                                                                      31
from 68.8% in quartile 1 to 0% in quartile 4. Similarly, the Elzinga-Hogarty method

determines that 51.6% of hospitals operate in markets with an HHI of greater than 2,500

in quartile 1, while in quartile 4 no hospitals operate in a market with an HHI of such

magnitude. SSNIP market definition conversely shows all but three hospitals operating

in a market with an HHI of greater than 2,500 in quartiles 1 and 2, and just 12.5% and

48.4% of hospitals in quartiles 3 and 4 operating below the 2,500 threshold respectively.



Elasticities

       The structural model allows for the calculation of the elasticity of demand for

each hospital. As shown in Table 3, the average own-price elasticity of demand for a

hospital in the sample is calculated as -4.57. Table 6 indicates that this elasticity varies

by density quartile, as the average elasticity of demand for hospitals increases (in

absolute value) from 3.55 in quartile 1 to 5.48 in quartile 4. This suggests that hospitals in

areas with more nearby competitors do in fact face stiffer competition than those with a

lower number of nearby hospitals. While this increase in own-price elasticity using the

structural model is notable in and of itself, as Table 5 indicates, both the Elzinga-Hogarty

and Critical Loss methodologies produce significantly larger markets in all density

quartiles, thus implying a much flatter demand curve for each hospital and consequently a

larger elasticity than estimated by the structural model.

       Because the estimated consumer utility in equation (1) depends on price, all firm-

level elasticities are a function of the price parameter contained in the specified utility

function,      . Thus, the larger elasticities produced by the two comparison methodologies

are equivalent to consumers exhibiting more price sensitive behavior, or equivalently,




                                                                                               32
that the value of      in the utility function is of larger (absolute) magnitude than is

estimated in the structural model. Thus, if we solve for this value of            that produces

markets of equivalent size to our comparison methods, we can determine the elasticities

that would be required in order to produce markets of equivalent size to those implied by

Elzinga-Hogarty and Critical Loss for a 5% price increase.40

        In the top portion of Table 7, we include a summary by hospital density quartile

of the average own-price elasticity in a hospital market determined by the Elzinga-

Hogarty and Critical Loss methodologies according to the structural model. For example,

for the 93 hospital markets calculated using Elzinga-Hogarty in density quartile 1, the

average own-price elasticity as calculated using the estimated price parameter in the

structural model is -3.60. In the lower panel, we present the elasticities that would be

implied by the structural model in order to make the markets determined by Elzinga-

Hogarty and Critical Loss consistent with the price elasticity assumptions of the structural

model. For example, for the same 93 hospital markets calculated using Elzinga-Hogarty

in density quartile 1, the value of this price parameter that would make consumers

sufficiently price sensitive so as to produce an equivalent market to that determined by

Elzinga-Hogarty would imply that the average own-price elasticity in these 93 markets is

-10.10. Thus the differences in these implied elasticities demonstrate that both Elzinga-

Hogarty and Critical Loss implicitly substantially overstate the price sensitivity of

consumers with regards to hospital care. Looking across all quartiles, Table 7 shows that

Critical Loss overstates the magnitude of elasticities of a hospital in the median hospital

market by a factor ranging from 2.4 in quartile 1 to 3.4 in quartile 4, while Elzinga-

40
 We solve for this value of   which equates the two markets using a binary search algorithm for each
market.


                                                                                                       33
Hogarty overstates these elasticities by a factor ranging from 2.3 in quartile 3 to 2.6 in

quartile 1.

        These elasticity differences also suggest that the implied markups for hospital

care using these informal methods are smaller than the markups that are assumed when

analyzing actual hospital merger cases. The commonly used Lerner Index,                  ,

relates elasticity to margins, implying that the determination of high margins indicates a

low elasticity of demand. In the calculation of Critical Loss, the contribution margin

defined in the previous section is equivalent to the left-hand side of a Lerner Index

(assuming constant returns to scale). Thus from our elasticity estimates in Table 7, we

can infer that the percentage markup over marginal cost implied by the Critical Loss

market size is lower than the 55% that was actually used in our definition of the Critical

Loss markets. As Table 7 indicates, even in the lowest hospital concentration quartile, the

markup for a hospital in the median hospital market using the Critical Loss methodology

is 12%, while in quartile 4, the implied markup in the market for the median hospitals is

5.4%. Although Elzinga-Hogarty in its implementation does not explicitly postulate as to

the implied markup, it suffers from similar shortcomings in that it suggests markups

ranging from 7.4%-9.9% for a hospital in the median hospital market, well below those

implied by the elasticity estimates in the structural model. Both of these findings suggest

that the market definition techniques used in previously decided merger cases are

inappropriate for hospital market definition; that is, using shipments based techniques

will by and large produce overestimates of the price elasticity of demand faced by

hospitals, thus resulting in substantially larger markets than intended in the merger

guidelines.

An Analysis of San Diego

        To further demonstrate market definition under the SSNIP criteria, we examine

markets defined in a localized area of the state. Specifically, we perform market

definition in the San Diego area. Our selection of San Diego is strategic in that it is an

area with few geographic barriers and it contains a reasonable number of hospitals so as

to allow for methodological illustration while still being computationally feasible. It also

allows us to compare the markets defined by our structural model with those delineated

by a related, and influential, model of hospital competition developed by Capps,

Dranove, and Satterthwaite (2003) and applied to proposed consolidations in New York

State by Dranove and Sfekas (2009).

        Capps et al. (2003) present a model (based on Town and Vistnes, 2001) in which

insurers bargain with hospitals and the market power of a hospital is based on the

willingness to pay (WTP) of a group of consumers for the use of that particular hospital.

This model is estimated on data from San Diego, so comparisons using this method are

restricted to that area.

        A summary of the San Diego area hospitals is presented in Table 8, while a map

of the hospitals in the area is presented in Figure 2. San Diego contains hospitals that fall

into hospital density quartiles 2 and 3. The dominant systems in the area in our 1995 data

are the Scripps and Sharp systems, with each controlling 6 and 5 of the 23 hospitals

respectively. While 19 of the 23 hospitals were members of a multi-hospital system, 4 of

these hospitals, Alvarado, Harbor View, Mission Bay and Paradise Valley were owned

by corporations that controlled no other hospitals in the San Diego area. The other two




                                                                                             35
multi-hospital systems, University of California (UC) and Palomar Pomerado, each

controlled only two hospitals.

         Table 9 presents the results of SSNIP market definition for the San Diego area for

each of our three market definition methodologies. As evidenced in Table 8, San Diego

County had a moderate degree of concentration in 1995, with a system-based HHI of

1,949.41 With the exception of Fallbrook Hospital, all methods produce a market which is

a subset of the hospitals in this county.42 Critical Loss in column one defines markets as

consisting of 13-38 hospitals, each of which comprise substantial subsections of the San

Diego area, and in the case of Fallbrook Hospital, portions of the Los Angeles Area.

Similarly, Elzinga-Hogarty market definition in column two determines that markets are

anywhere from 14-19 hospitals in size. The structural model in column three, however,

shows that SSNIP markets consist instead of small sets of no more than 4 hospitals, with

a median market size of two hospitals. This difference in methodology evidently affects

the degree of concentration implied in the San Diego area. Both of the comparison

methods produce markets with the majority of HHIs falling in the 2,000-3,000 range,

while no SSNIP market produced by the structural Bertrand model has a HHI lower than

3,000 and 18 of the 23 hospitals operate in a market with an HHI of more than 5,000.

         Figure 3 illustrates the differences in markets produced by the three

methodologies, using as an example the definition of a market for Scripps Memorial

Hospital - Chula Vista (Scripps Chula Vista), a 159-bed hospital located in the southern

portion of the San Diego metropolitan area. Using the SSNIP market definition


41
   This HHI measure takes into account system membership and is highly correlated (correlation of over .9)
with total discharges and total patient days.
42
   In order to create a critical loss market for Fallbrook Hospital, the northernmost hospital in the sample,
the algorithm expands into the Southern section of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area.


                                                                                                          36
algorithm, Scripps Chula Vista and Community Hospital of Chula Vista, a 306-bed

hospital located in the same area represent a geographic market, with a HHI of 5,500.

Using Elzinga-Hogarty, a geographic market would include these two hospitals, as well

as 16 other facilities in the San Diego area, producing a market with an HHI of 2,228.

The market produced using Critical Loss shows a similar pattern, as a critical loss market

would include a total of 17 hospitals in the San Diego metropolitan area, implying that

Scripps Chula Vista operates in a market with an HHI of 2,692.



Comparison with the Willingness to Pay Model

           The Willingness to Pay (WTP) model represents a promising method of analyzing

mergers (Capps et al., 2003; Town and Vistnes, 2001). Because both the structural

Bertrand model and WTP models are both rooted in a multinomial-logit demand

specification which includes both hospital and consumer characteristics and patient-

hospital distance, we present results from a comparison of merger simulations using the

structural Bertrand model to compare price increases implied by the WTP model (see

Appendix A for a brief overview of the WTP model).43 The main differences between

the models involves the determination of firm pricing behavior; firm conduct and price

determination are not modeled explicitly in the WTP model, rather the relationship

between WTP and hospital profits is identified using a regression of hospital profits on

WTP for each hospital. Mergers in the model are simulated by calculating the difference

in WTP for a combined entity of hospitals and the sum of the WTP for each separate

hospital in this combined entity. Using the relationship between a “unit” of WTP and

hospital profits (calculated from the regression of hospital profits on WTP), and assuming
43
     Details of our estimation of the WTP model are included in appendix A.


                                                                                           37
no change in the cost of treatment, this difference in WTP is used to show the increase in

average revenue per patient brought about by the merger, leaving quantity unchanged.

         The WTP model does not allow for market definition in a localized area where a

large hospital firm (system) controls multiple plants (hospitals). This is due to the

difficulty in allocating the willingness to pay measure across hospitals of the same system

affiliation. Consequently, we adapt the structural Bertrand model to simulate mergers

between individual hospitals, as well as individual hospital systems, thereby enabling

directly comparable merger effects for each model. For our estimates of the WTP, we

employ the same variables in our utility function as were used in Capps et al. (2003) with

minor exceptions.44 Furthermore, use of the WTP necessitates a different sample of

consumers than was used in that of Capps et al. (2003) as the original estimated WTP

utility function includes Medicare patients, indemnity patients and HMO/PPO. In order to

ensure the most direct comparison of the two methods, we include only indemnity and

HMO/PPO consumers.45

         Table 10 includes the results of the mergers of 27 mergers of independent

hospitals located in the San Diego area.46,47 As Table 10 demonstrates, the two models

show merger effects on price that are virtually zero for the independent San Diego

hospitals. For the mergers in Table 10, for only one merger, that of Tri-City Hospital and



44
   Instead of the “equipment intensity” variable, we use a “tech index” variable which is the sum over
dummy variables for the presence of 28 technologies reported in the annual hospital financial data (such as
presence of an MRI, open heart surgical suite, etc.). Also, instead of travel time, we use distance.
45
   This corresponds to specification (4) in Capps et al. (2003)
46
   We display the results of independent hospitals primarily because Capps et. al. do not prescribe a method
of calculating WTP for markets in which a hospital system controls multiple hospitals. Thus these are the
“cleanest” comparisons of the two methodologies.
47
   We classify a hospital as independent for purposes of this analysis if the hospital had was not a member
of a hospital system or if the hospital was owned by a corporation that controlled only one hospital in the
San Diego area.


                                                                                                         38
Fallbrook Hospital, do the methods differ on whether a merger would produce a SSNIP.

They are otherwise in agreement.

         Calculation of WTP does not allow for isolation of unilateral merger effects;

rather it determines the aggregate price increase implied by a merger in a chosen market.

Thus we adjust the model to account for system membership; specifically we calculate

the WTP measure for each hospital separately and given these estimates, we can then

infer the WTP for an entire hospital system. The effect of a system merger can then be

identified using the difference in the aggregate WTP for both systems versus the WTP for

each system separately. Table 11 presents the results of the merger of 5 hospital systems

in the San Diego area.

         In three of the five system mergers presented in Table 11, both models agree on

which mergers would result in a 5% increase in price.48 For the two mergers presented in

Table 11 in which the two methods do not agree, both of these mergers involve the

University of California, San Diego, a hospital which generates the largest WTP measure

of all hospitals in our data. As Capps et al. (2003) indicate in their paper, this could be

due to UCSD’s status as the only university hospital in the market. This fact, coupled

with UCSD’s service area overlap with Scripp’s Mercy Hospital (0.4 miles from UCSD)

and Sharp Memorial Hospital (3.2 miles from UCSD) in downtown San Diego most

likely accounts for the substantial increase in WTP (and thus price) induced by a merger

of UCSD with both Sharp and Scripps. In the structural Bertrand model, however, UCSD

Medical Center charges the highest price for a unit of hospital care in the San Diego


48
  The correlation between the merger simulations and WTP model is 0.82. Furthermore, thought the
merger simulations allow for identification of individual merger effects, in order to facilitate a direct
comparison of the two methodologies, we weight the price increases produced by the structural Bertrand
model’s merger simulations by the demand at each hospital (pre-merger).


                                                                                                            39
($5,827) area while also exhibiting the highest own-price elasticity (-5.99) of San Diego

area hospitals (with the exception of Villa View Hospital). This pattern is suggestive of

the UCSD Medical Center exerting market power in its pricing of hospital services.

Consequently, while a merger of UCSD with hospital systems in the area does produce

an increase in price using the structural Bertrand model, this increase is most likely not as

large as would be the case if UCSD were not already exerting market power. To the

degree that consumers and health insurers substitute to other health care providers as a

result of the prevailing high price at UCSD Medical Center, the observed elasticity may

account for the lower price increase implied by the merger of these systems in the

structural Bertrand model.

       Overall, the results of the comparisons between these two methods reveal a

notable degree of similarity for hospital merger effects in the San Diego area. Though the

models differ in their assumptions about firm conduct, given that both models identify

demand-side merger effects via the intersection of patient market shares, such a result is

not surprising.



VII. Conclusion

       Market definition is essential for merger analysis, and has played a pivotal role for

antitrust decisions in the hospital industry in the past two decades. The vast majority of

hospital merger cases have utilized ad hoc methods of geographic market definition that

rely heavily upon patient shipment data, with no explicit economic model used to justify

such methods. Our use of a fully specified structural model of hospital competition

compares commonly employed geographic market definition approaches used in actual



                                                                                             40
hospital merger cases to geographic markets rooted in the principles set forth by the

merger guidelines. This method explicitly models consumer and producer behavior, and

also accounts for firms operating at multiple locations, as required by the 2010 merger

guidelines.

       We find that the use of approaches frequently utilized in previous cases largely

overstate the size of geographic markets for hospitals, particularly in areas with greater

hospital density. In addition, these informal approaches imply elasticities ranging from

2.4-3.4 times as large as those calculated from a structural model of hospital competition.

Furthermore, our analysis of the San Diego area is consistent with those implied by the

model of Capps et al. (2003).

       The results have important implications for merger analysis in both the hospital

industry and other industries involving differentiated products. They illustrate the

importance of economic modeling for defining markets, and indicate that reliance on

imprecise methods of market definition has the potential to mislead the courts as to the

appropriate extent of geographic markets. The markets presented here are most

consistent with those identified in merger cases by plaintiffs rather than by defendants, in

contrast to the court’s frequent rejection of markets alleged by the antitrust authorities.

Thus the use of such an approach should be emphasized when assessing the extent of

market power in this and other differentiated product industries.

Appendix A: The Capps, Dranove and Sattherwaite Model of Option Demand


A.1 Consumers
Consumers are assumed to maximize ex post expected utility. Thus they maximize the
expected utility of obtaining treatment for a specific condition at a specific hospital, but
before treatment is actually obtained. The utility function is defined as
                             U ij = U ( R j , S j , Tij , Yi , Z i ) − γ (Yi , Z i ) p j + ε ij

where R j is a vector of hospital characteristics that are common across all patient

conditions, S j is a vector of variables that contain patient specific service offerings, Tij

is the travel time from patient i to hospital j, Yi is a vector of the patient’s socioeconomic

characteristics, and Z i is a vector of clinical attributes specific to patient i. Assuming that

γ (Yi , Zi ) is constant, individual i will select hospital j if for all hospitals j≠k,
                       U ( R j , S j , Tij , Yi , Z i ) − U ( Rk , S k , Tik , Yi , Z i ) > ε ik − ε ij .

Assuming ε is distributed i.i.d. extreme value, the probability sij that patient i chooses

                                    exp(U ( R j , S j , Tij , Yi , Z i ))
hospital j is given as sij =                                                        where G is a network of hospitals
                                  ∑ exp(U ( R , S
                                  k∈G
                                                    k     k   , Tik , Yi , Z i ))

from which the patient chooses. The the parameter estimates for our calculation of the
utility function are included in Table A.1.


The patient’s interim expected utility is thus



                      {
                     j∈G
                              [                               ⎡
                                                                ]}                                     ⎤
           V IU = E max U ( R j , S j , Tij , Yi , Z i ) = ln ⎢∑ exp(U ( R j , S j , Tij , Yi , Z i ) )⎥ .
                                                              ⎣ j∈G                                    ⎦
Given this result, hospital j’s contribution to individual i’s expected utility is
                                                              ⎡              1                  ⎤

                                                              ⎢⎣1 − s ij (G , Yi , Z i , λ i ) ⎥⎦




                                                                                                                   47
where λi is the location of consumer i. Capps et al. then define the ex-ante willingness to

                                ΔV jIU (G, Yi , Z i , λi )
pay for patient i as        ∫
                            Z
                                      γ (Yi , Z i )
                                                               f ( Z i | Yi , λi )dZ i . Because this willingness to pay

is identified only up to the scale factor γ (Yi , Zi ) , summing over all consumers the

willingness to pay for hospital j is thus written as
                                                  ⎡                1                 ⎤
              ΔW jEA (G ) = N              ∫ λ ln ⎢⎢1 − s                            ⎥ f ( Z i , Yi , λ i ) dYi dZ i dλi .
                                                            ij (G , Yi , Z i , λ i ) ⎥
                                        Y ,Z ,    ⎣                                  ⎦


A.2 Pricing
        After the willingness to pay measure is calculated for hospitals, Capps et al.
regress hospital profits on the willingness to pay measure (without a constant) and
recover the coefficient from this regression, â . This generates the predicted impact of
WTP on hospital profits. Using the average revenue and average cost per discharge at a
hospital, they then calculate a measure of profits per discharge at each hospital.




A.3 Merger Effects using WTP
        The first step in using WTP to simulate merger effects entails calculating the
difference in willingness to pay for a merged entity versus the willingness to pay for each
entity independently. Defining

the increase in WTP as a result of a merger would thus be


                                        ΔW jEA
                                            + k (G ) − ΔW j (G ) − ΔW k (G ) .

As Capps et al. detail in their paper, if two hospitals are far enough apart, then if hospital
j has a positive market share in market segment (Z i , Yi , λi ) , hospital k will likely have a



                                                                                                                                     48
zero market share in that same segment. Thus the expression

ΔW jEA
    + k (G ) − ΔW j (G ) − ΔW k (G ) will be zero and thus a merger of hospitals j and k will
                   EA          EA



likely generate no increase in the market power of the two firms.
        The second step in using WTP to simulate merger effects involves inferring the
increase in profits resulting from a merger of two firms. Capps et. al. do this by
calculating the increase in profits to the entity (j+k), Δπˆ j + k , as

                                    [
                         Δπˆ j + k = aˆ ΔW jEA
                                            + k (G ) − ΔW j (G ) − ΔW k (G )
                                                           EA          EA
                                                                               ]
Profits are then calculated for the merged entity as π j + π k + Δπˆ j + k . Price increases are

then inferred as the price changes implied by the changes in profits, assuming quantity
does not change.




                                                                                               49
Appendix B: Definition of a SSNIP Market


SSNIP Definition
   Formally, given demand for each hospital as a function of its price, the SSNIP market
for a hospital is defined as follows:
   A SSNIP market for hospital j, is the set of hospitals, M, (of which hospital j is a
member), such that given a vector of pre-SSNIP prices p and post-SSNIP prices p’
   1)   ∑π
        s
             s   ( p ' ) − π s ( p ) > 0 for hospital systems with at least one plant in M and

   2) M is the smallest set of hospitals such that (1) holds
   where p k' = (1.05) * p k if hospital k is a member of M and p k' = p k otherwise.




                                                                                                 50
