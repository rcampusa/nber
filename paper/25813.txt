                                         ABSTRACT

We use panel data on charitable donations to analyze how the philanthropic behavior of the
Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) compares to that of earlier generations. On the basis of
a multivariate analysis with a rich set of economic and demographic variables, we find that
conditional on making a gift, one cannot reject the hypothesis that the Millennials donate more
than members of earlier generations. However, Millennials are somewhat less likely to make any
donations at all than their generational predecessors. Our findings suggest a more nuanced view
of the Millennials’ prosocial behavior than is suggested in popular accounts.

                               Are Millennials Really So Selfish?

                  Preliminary Evidence from the Philanthropy Panel Study

       With regard to prosocial behavior, members of the millennial generation—people born

between 1981 and 1996—have a bad reputation. The titles of opinion pieces such as

“Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation”, “Millennials are Entitled, Narcissistic, and Lazy”,

and “Millennials See Themselves as Greedy, Self-absorbed, and Wasteful” evidence the

prevalence of negative attitudes regarding this generation (Stein, 2013; Cleary, 2017; The

Guardian Magazine, 2015). Writers in the popular press have asserted that “what Millennials are

most famous for besides narcissism is its effect: entitlement” (Stein, 2013, p. 1), and that with

regards to their tipping habits “Millennials are cheapskates compared to other generations”

(Jagannathan, 2018, p. 1). According to survey data, 71 percent of Americans think of

Millennials as “selfish” (Gillespie, 2014).

       In addition, some academic research supports of the view that Millennials are selfish.

Some psychologists, for example, argue that standard personality tests indicate that individuals

who were in college between 2000 and 2006 exhibit less empathy than earlier cohorts (Konrath,

et al. 2011). Other personality tests suggest that students in these cohorts are more narcissistic

than their predecessors (Twenge, et al. 2008).

       However, there is contention regarding these claims, with some media writers claiming

that Millennials are generous. For example, popular press headlines assert that: “Millennials are

Actually More Generous than Anybody Realizes” (Schulte, 2015) and that “Millennials are the

Most Generous and Most Careful when Donating to Charity” (Calderwood, 2017). In addition,

there is far from consensus in the psychology literature that the Millennials are particularly

narcissistic. For example, Arnett, Trzesniewski and Donnellan (2013) challenge this

characterization, arguing inter alia, most of the data sets used to measure narcissism are

                                                 2
problematic because they rely on highly unrepresentative samples (students at residential

colleges (p. 17).

       These opposing claims raise an interesting question: are Millennials truly particularly

deficient in prosocial behavior? We address this question by examining how members of the

Millennial generation compare to members of other generations with regard to an important and

observable type of prosocial behavior, contributing to charities. While charitable giving is not the

only form of prosocial behavior (for example, volunteering is another well-studied form, e.g.,

Chambre and Netting, 2016), charitable giving is one of the most studied forms of prosocial

behavior and is our focus in this analysis. Specifically, we analyze panel data over the period

2001 to 2015 to estimate intergenerational differences in charitable giving.

       As discussed below, we show that on the basis of raw means, members of the millennial

generation indeed appear to be less generous than previous generations. However, once we take

into account differences in age, income, wealth and other variables, a somewhat more complex

story emerges. We find that conditional on making a gift, the Millennials donate more than

members of earlier generations. However, Millennials are somewhat less likely to make any

donations at all than their generational predecessors.

       Note that our documentation of a negative correlation in the data between membership in

the Millennial generation and the likelihood of making a gift does not establish the cause of this

behavior. There are a number of possibilities. For example, Oesterle, Johnson, and Mortimer

(2004, p. 1128) observe that assuming adult responsibilities, such as starting a full-time job or

starting a family, leads to an uptick in prosocial behavior. To the extent that Millennials are

taking on such responsibilities later than preceding generations, this difference in life course

might be the cause of their relatively low donations. Alternatively, the formative experiences



                                                 3
shared by members of a generation (such as the Millennials coming of age during the Great

Recession) might have lasting effects on their charitable behavior. In any case, our findings

suggest a more nuanced view of the Millennials’ prosocial behavior than is suggested in popular

accounts.

                                       Previous Literature

     There is an extensive empirical literature on the determinants of households’ donative

behavior; Andreoni (2013) and Bekkers and Wiepking (2007) provide comprehensive surveys.

Variables such as income (Andreoni and Scholtz, 1988), wealth (Banks and Tanner, 1999),

education (Apinumahakul and Devlin, 2004), age (Meer and Rosen, 2013), marital status

(Andreoni and Scholz, 1998), number of children (Hoge and Yang, 1994), race (Apinumahakul

and Devlin, 2004), employment status (Yao, 2015) and religion (Bekkers and Schuyt, 2005)

generally play important roles in statistical models of charitable giving.

     Turning now to the possible impact of an individual’s birth cohort on his or her giving, the

social science literature on generational theory provides useful insights. The reasonable premise

is that members of a generation have certain formative experiences in common (like wars and

economic crises), and these common experiences shape their subsequent attitudes and behavior

(Rooney, et al., 2018). In the context of donative behavior, the notion that early life experiences

have a substantial impact on lifetime giving is buttressed by empirical studies that show that

giving when young can become a habit that lasts throughout life (Rosen and Sims (2011) and

Meer (2013)).

     The related literatures on life course development and emerging adulthood are also

pertinent. As noted by Arnett (1997, p. 69), the theory of emerging adulthood serves “as a

framework for recognizing that the transition to adulthood [is] now long enough that it



                                                 4
constitute[s] not merely a transition but a separate period of the life course.” In earlier

generations, the transition to adulthood was marked by the achievement of certain milestones,

such as “finishing education, entering the labor force, marriage and parenthood” (p. 69).

However, members of younger generations now take longer to settle into long-term employment

and personal relationships, and in their early twenties do not consider themselves to be fully

adult (p. 70). Coté (2009, p. 297) places the age at which younger generations now resolve their

adult identities even later, in the late twenties, but the basic idea is the same—younger

generations are taking longer to think of themselves as adults.

     To the extent that self-identification as an adult is associated with empathy, involvement

with other people, and a desire to help others, it would seem plausible that members of a recent

generation like the Millennials would be less generous than their predecessors, who assumed

adult identities earlier. In the same way, to the extent that an elongated transition to adulthood is

associated with greater narcissism and egotism, one would expect charitable donations to fall,

other things being the same.

     Evidence supporting this unfavorable view of the Millennials is presented by Twenge

(2013) in a literature review provocatively entitled, “The Evidence for Generation Me and

Against Generation We.” On the basis of the results from five data sets that measure the

prevalence of narcissism among younger generations and their predecessors, she states that a

generational increase in narcissism has taken place over time. She also reports research

indicating that younger generations have overly positive self-views, noting, for example, that

among recent high school graduates, the proportion that expects to attain a professional degree is

twice as high as it was in 1976, although the percentage that actually attained such a degree is

about the same. Twenge’s conclusion is that “the overwhelming majority of the evidence shows



                                                  5
that more recent generations of young people have more positive self-views, endorse more

narcissistic personality traits, and are more self-focused. This is consistent with the ‘Generation

Me’ view” (p. 12). Ertas (2016) supports Twenge’s conclusion that the Millennials are relatively

narcissistic, finding that Millennials have lower levels of participation in volunteer activity than

their older counterparts (Ertas, 2016).

     However, Arnett, Trzesniewski and Donnellan (2013) challenge this characterization of the

literature. They argue, inter alia, that four out of the five data sets used by Twenge to measure

narcissism are problematic because they rely on highly unrepresentative samples (students at

residential colleges) (p. 17). They also cite an analysis based upon a nationally representative

survey of high school seniors from 1976 to 2006, which found no meaningful changes in egotism

or a variety of other psychological traits over that period (p. 18). Stewart and Bernhardt (2010)

also provide evidence contradicting the narcissistic-Millennial narrative. In an analysis of levels

of narcissism, self-assuredness, impulse control and academic achievement among university

students, they conclude that individuals who were young adults between 2004 and 2008 scored

significantly higher than individuals who were young adults before 1990 in their levels of

narcissism.

     These competing research claims regarding psychological traits of the Millennials raise the

question of whether there are observable differences in prosocial behavior between them and

their predecessors, and in particular, their donations to charity. Not much research has focused

on generational differences in giving behavior. Indeed, Midlarsky, Kahana and Belser (2015, p.

429) have noted that the analysis of inter-cohort differences is one of the areas in the study of

prosocial behavior deserving of most attention. Presumably, the dearth of research is due in part

to the fact that most econometric studies of this topic rely on single cross sections of data.



                                                 6
Because all individuals of a given age also belong to the same cohort, it is impossible to

distinguish between cohort and age effects in a single cross section. While a few statistical

studies of donative behavior have used panel data or repeated cross sections, their focus has been

on topics other than generational differences, such as the impact of the federal income tax on

charitable donations (Auten, Sieg, and Clotfelter, 2002).

     An important exception is the work of Rooney, Wang and Ottoni-Wilhelm (2018)

(hereinafter RWO). Building upon earlier work by Ottoni-Wilhelm, Tempel and Rooney (2007),

they employ two different data sets to compare the average giving of people of the same age who

are members of different generations. For example, using data from the 1973 National Study of

Philanthropy, they compute average giving of individuals born between 1928 and 1937 (whom

they group together into a composite of the Greatest and Silent generations) when they were

between 36 and 60 years of age. They then use data from the 2001 to 2013 waves of the Panel

Study of Income Dynamics to calculate average giving for the Baby Boomers (born between

1951 and 1965) when they were in the same range of ages. RWO observe that in order for the

comparison to be meaningful, one must take into account that the price level and real incomes

were different for the two cohorts. They therefore multiply the figure for the Greatest/Silent

Generation by a factor that reflects the increase in inflation and real incomes between 1973 and

2012. They follow an analogous procedure to make pairwise comparisons between other

generations as well.

     Following conventional practice in the literature, RWO distinguish between giving to

secular and religious organizations. For secular giving, they find that on average, Millennials and

members of Gen X (born between 1965 and 1980) give less than their Silent/Greatest generation

counterparts. On the other hand, the Baby Boomers give about as much as the Silent/Greatest



                                                 7
generation. For religious giving, members of the Silent/Greatest generation give more than

individuals in the Baby Boomer, Gen X and Millennial cohorts.

        RWO’s findings are interesting and important, but while their method has the advantage of

transparency, it is subject to a number of limitations. In particular, it implicitly assumes that the

only variables that need to be taken into account to make meaningful intergenerational

comparisons are age and income. 1 However, other variables that are relevant for donative

behavior, including family structure, religious beliefs, employment status, the macroeconomic

environment, and so on. To the extent that such variables are correlated with generational

differences, failure to include them in the model will lead to estimates of the impact of

generational differences that suffer from omitted variable bias. Hence, a multivariable approach

is required to isolate the independent effect of generational differences on giving.

                                                    Data

          Our goal is to estimate how amounts given to charity and the probability of making any

gift at all differ by generation, other things being the same. A data set well-suited for this

purpose is the Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (PPS). The PPS, an extract from the Panel

Study of Income Dynamics, contains a rich set of household economic and demographic

variables, as well as detailed information about charitable giving (Wilhelm, 2007). As Wilhelm

(2007) notes, even though the PPS does not over-sample high-income individuals, it offers

better data on the high-end of the distribution than other recent surveys of charitable giving. It

provides information on about 14,849 households for every other year, from 2001 to 2015 –

67,227 observations in total across the eight waves. Not all households are present in all waves

of the data. Some households exit, for example, due to mortality, and new ones take their

                                                     8
places. Each wave of the data contains information from the year that precedes it; for example,

the 2001 wave provides data from the year 2000. We lost some observations—about seven

percent of the sample—due to missing or anomalous data on one or more variables. The PPS

provides sample weights, which we use in all our computations.

       There is, of course, some arbitrariness in assigning birth years to the various generational

cohorts. Following the Pew Research Center (2018) we adopt the following convention: Greatest

Generation (before 1927), Silent Generation (1928 to 1945), Baby Boom (1946 to 1964), Gen X

(1965 to 1980), and Millennials (1981 to 1996). In order to assess the sensitivity of our

substantive results to these conventions for defining generations, we experimented with several

other dating schemes, and found that reasonable changes in the definitions had no impact.

       The dating scheme highlights a potentially important issue—the age ranges of certain of

the generations are very far apart. For example, the average age of the members of the Greatest

Generation in our data is 83, while the oldest Millennial is only 33. In effect, then, if we estimate

a model that compares the donative behavior of the Millennials to that of the older generations,

we are making comparisons far outside the range of our data. In order to address this issue, we

take a tack similar to that suggested by Knittel and Murphy (2019) in their analysis of the vehicle

purchase habits of the Millennials, and include in our analysis sample only the three most recent

generations, the Millennials, Gen X, and the Baby Boomers. This left us with 56,464

observations.

       The variable definitions and summary statistics for the entire sample are in Table 1; Table

2 shows the summary statistics by generation. In Table 1, the “omitted category” for each set of

dichotomous variables is the reference category in our regressions. A quick glance at the top of

Table 2 affirms the popular view: on average, the Millennials do indeed give less than older



                                                 9
generations. Their mean giving is only $364, compared to say, $1,679 for the Baby Boomers (all

monetary figures are in year 2000 dollars, using the CPI to adjust for inflation). However,

looking at the other variables in the table suggests that a simple comparison of means is probably

not meaningful. Incomes and ages are different (as emphasized by Rooney, Wang and Ottoni-

Wilhelm (2018)), but wealth 2, family structure, religious affiliation, and other variables differ as

well. Our approach, described below, incorporates a richer set of variables that can potentially

affect donative behavior. The impact of such variables on donative behavior is of independent

interest, but it is also important to determine whether their inclusion has a substantial impact on

our estimates of generational differences.

                                         Empirical Strategy

        Our goal is to estimate the impact of generational differences on individuals’ charitable

behavior during a given year, while taking into account the impacts of age and contemporaneous

events (“time effects”), inter alia. As is well known, estimating such a model presents a

fundamental identification problem because age, birth cohort and time effects are not

independent—given an individual’s birth year and age, the current year is fully determined.

Because of this perfect multicollinearity, the impacts of all three variables cannot be identified

simply by including them in the same regression equation. The conventional identification

strategy is to make assumptions on functional form that break the perfect multicollinearity. (See,

for example, Vaisey and Lizardo (2015, p. 4).) We make two such assumptions. First, we

assume that the impact of birth year on charitable behavior is the same for every member of a

given generation. This allows us to include as regressors a small number of generational

dichotomous variables, each taking a value of one if an individual is a member of a given

wealth.


                                                   10
generation, and zero otherwise. This is a natural assumption because our major goal is to

evaluate claims that members of different generations behave in systematically different ways.

        Second, we assume that the impact of age can be characterized by a polynomial, which in

effect constrains members of all generations to follow the same age-giving profile. Virtually all

empirical studies of charitable giving behavior explicitly or implicitly make this assumption

(Bekkers and Wiepking (2011)), and it is plausible in our case given that the oldest generations

are excluded from the analysis sample.

        Previous research such as Meer, Miller and Wulfsberg (2017) has documented that the

impacts of a given variable on the amount of a charitable donation and the probability of making

any donation need not be the same. Hence, we explore the effect of generational differences

upon amounts given and the probability of making a gift without constraining the estimated

coefficients to be the same. Specifically, we first use the sample of observations that include

nonzero contributions to charity to estimate an ordinary least squares regression of the logarithm

of the amount given on a set of conventional explanatory variables as well as indicator variables

for the various generations. 3 Such an equation is said to yield “conditional” estimates of the

effects of the covariates on the amount given because inclusion in the model is conditional on the

amount of giving being positive.

        We next use all the observations in the sample to estimate a regression in which the

outcome variable is a zero if the individual made no donation at all and a one if he or she did.

The right hand side variables are the same as those in the model for the amount given, but in this

case, the coefficients on the generational variables measure differences in the probability of


3 An alternative statistical model is some nonlinear technique such as Tobit. While each approach has
advantages and disadvantages, we follow Angrist and Pischke (2009, p. 94), who observe that ordinary
least squares provides the best linear approximation to the conditional expectations function, and hence,
in a context like ours, is the appropriate estimator.

                                                    11
making a gift, other things being the same. Standard errors are robust and clustered by

individual. All our computations use the analytical weights provided in the PPS, although the

results are largely the same regardless of whether or not the weights are used. All the models

include state effects. In addition, to account for differences in the macroeconomic environment

across time, each model includes time effects.

                                              Results

     At the outset, we estimated models that included separate indicator variables for the

members of Gen X and the Boomers. However, we were unable to reject the hypothesis that the

coefficients for these two generations were the same. (The p-values in the models for

conditional giving and the probability of making a gift were 0.923, and 0.422, respectively.)

Hence, we combined them into a single generation. In each regression, then, there is a single

indicator for the Millennial generation, and the associated coefficient is the estimated differential

in the outcome variable between the Millennials and the combined Gen X-Boomer generations.

     The results are reported in Table 3. In column (1), we begin by estimating a model for the

log of the amount of donations that includes only the Millennial indicator (as well as time and

state effects). The coefficient, reflecting the summary statistics described above, is large.

Conditional on making a gift, the Millennials donate 0.925 log points less than members of the

Gen X/ Baby Boomer generation. They key question is what happens to these estimates when we

take into account a standard set of economic and demographic variables. The answer is revealed

in column (2). The coefficients change dramatically. Conditional on making a gift, the

Millennials donate a statistically significant 0.16 log points more. A glance at the coefficients on

the other variables in column (2) indicates that they are generally in line with results from

previous studies. In particular, other things being the same, giving increases with income, wealth,



                                                 12
years of education, and number of children. Individuals who are married donate more than those

who are not, employed individuals give more than those who are not, individuals who report

themselves as being in good health give more than those who do not, and people who profess

membership in a religious group donate more than people who do not. The mere fact that an

individual identifies with some religion does not tell us about his or her religiosity, which might

be measured, for example, by the frequency of attendance at religious services. (See, for

example, Putnam and Campbell (2010) and Bielefeld et al. (2005).) However, the PPS contains

such data in only one cross-section and, therefore, cannot be included in our analysis.

     We next turn to the probability of making any gift at all, again beginning with a model with

only the Millennial indicator and time and state effects. The results, recorded in column (3), are

as expected given the summary statistics in Table 2. Millennials are substantially less likely to

give than their generational predecessors, with a difference of about 27 percentage points. When

we take into account other variables, the coefficient on the Millennials indicator remains

statistically significant, but it is much smaller in magnitude than in column (3)—about negative 3

percentage points.

       Taken together, the results in Table 3 suggest a somewhat nuanced picture of the

generosity of the Millennials relative to their predecessors. Controlling for differences in their

ages, incomes, wealth, and so on, conditional on making a gift, the Millennials donate more than

their predecessors do. However, they are less likely to make any gifts at all, even after taking into

account the other determinants of giving. Viewed through the lens of the literature on emerging

adulthood, this result is only partially consistent with the findings of researchers like Twenge

(2013), who have argued that the elongation of the transition to adulthood that is characteristic of

recent generations is associated with increased egotism and lack of empathy.



                                                 13
        As noted above, Rooney, Wang and Ottoni-Wilhelm (2018) focus only on age, income

and wealth as covariates in their analysis of intergenerational differences. An interesting

question is whether inclusion of an array of demographic and economic variables affects

inferences regarding generational differences. To investigate this issue, we simply re-estimate

the models in columns (2) and (4) of Table 3 including age, income and wealth and time effects,

but not the other right hand side variables in the table. In results not detailed here, we find that

the coefficients on the generational variables are little affected—not accounting for the various

demographic variables is inconsequential. 4 Another distinction between our setup and RWO’s.

is that our model includes time effects, while RWO’s statistical analysis does not account for

changes in the macroeconomic environment in a systematic way. Here the effects on the

estimated generational differentials are substantial. When we estimate the model for the

conditional amount of giving (column (2)) without time effects, the coefficient on the Millennials

variable falls from 0.156 (s.e. = 0.06) to 0.007 (s.e. = 0.057). For the probability of making a gift

at all (column (4)), the coefficient falls from -0.032 (s.e. = 0.02) to -0.103 (s.e. = 0.014). In

short, failure to include time effects leads one to understate the extent of the Millennials’

prosocial behavior relative to the previous generations.

Religious versus Secular Giving

        An issue of interest is whether our analysis of total giving masks significant generational

differences in giving to religious versus secular organizations. To explore this matter, we

estimate the models of Table 3 separately for religious and secular giving. The results are

reported in Table 4. Columns (1) and (2) refer to the conditional log of amounts given and the


4 For example, the coefficient on the Millennials variable for the conditional log of giving is 0.089 (s.e.
=0.07) which is statistically indistinguishable from the coefficient in Table 3, Column 2. The coefficient on
the Millennials variable for the probability of giving is -0.030 (s.e. = 0.02) and that is, likewise,
statistically indistinct from the corresponding estimate in Table 3, Column 4.

probability of making any gift, respectively, to religious organizations. Columns (3) and (4)

provide the corresponding information for secular organizations. The coefficients on the other

variables are omitted for brevity; we report them in the online appendix.

   With respect to (conditional) religious giving (columns (1) and (2)), the point estimates

indicate that the Millennials donate more (0.164 log points) than earlier generations, and the

probability that they donate is slightly higher (0.023 percentage points). While suggesting that

the Millennials give relatively more to religious causes, one must note that these effects are

estimated imprecisely. With respect to secular donations (columns (3) and (4)), the Millennials

give more (0.099 log points) conditional on making a gift, but are less likely (by 2.9 percentage

points) to make a gift at all. (The first coefficient is insignificant and the second is significant at

the 5 percent level.) Taking these findings together, it seems fair to say that the differentials we

estimate for total giving are not masking large differences in secular versus religious giving.

                                              Conclusion

   The popular press is replete with “hot takes” accusing the members of the Millennial

generation (born between 1981 and 1996) of being more selfish than their predecessors. The

purpose of this paper is to document whether or not such generational differences are actually

present in the data. Specifically, we have used panel data on charitable donations to analyze how

the philanthropic behavior of the Millennial generation compares to that of earlier generations.

We find that conditional on making a gift and taking into account differences in a rich set of

economic and demographic variables, Millennials give substantially more than members of

earlier generations. However, Millennials are somewhat less likely than their generational

predecessors to make any donations at all. Our results, then, do not offer strong support to either

side of the ongoing debate in the psychology literature on whether the Millennials are



                                                   15
particularly narcissistic.

   Now, any number of causal mechanisms could be behind these findings. For example, it could

be the case, as Billari and Liefbroer (2010) suggest, that the transition to adulthood is coming

later in the life cycle for recent generations. If so, then the correlations we document could be

due to differences with respect to when individuals assume adult responsibilities. Alternatively,

generational theory focuses our attention on differences in formative experiences across

generations. Here one notes that the Millennials came of age during the Great Recession, which

could have affected their attitudes toward philanthropy.

           Of course, the Millennial generation is still relatively young—the oldest members in our

sample are 33. As time moves on, it will be possible to make more definitive statements about their

donative behavior. Moreover, as noted above, while donations to charity are certainly important,

they are not the only expression of prosocial behavior. As more data on activities such as

volunteer work, membership in fraternal organizations, and so on become available, it will be

possible to make a more complete assessment of claims that the Millennials are particularly

selfish.

   †The figures in this table show the estimated coefficients on the Millennial indicator variable when the
  models from Tables 3 are estimated separately for religious and secular giving. Column (1) refers to the
  amount given to religious organizations, conditional on the amount being positive, and column (3) refers to
  the amount given to secular organizations, conditional on the amount being positive. Columns (2) and (4)
  refer to the probability of making a gift to religious and secular organizations, respectively. The
  coefficients on the other variables are omitted for brevity. Estimation is by ordinary least squares; standard
  errors (clustered at the individual level) are in parentheses.
