The Welfare Cost of Autarky:

                                            ABSTRACT


       The United States came close to complete autarky in 1808 as a result of a self-imposed embargo
on international shipping from December 1807 to March 1809. Monthly prices of exported and imported
goods reveal the embargo’s striking effect on commodity markets and allow a calculation of its welfare
effects. A simple general equilibrium calculation suggests that the embargo cost about 8 percent of
America’s 1807 GNP, at a time when the trade share was about 13 percent (domestic exports and
shipping earnings). The welfare cost was lower than the trade share because the embargo did not
completely eliminate trade and because domestic producers successfully shifted production toward
previously imported manufactured goods.

                                 The Welfare Cost of Autarky:

                  Evidence from the Jeffersonian Trade Embargo, 1807-1809



1. Introduction

       In theory, the gains from international trade are represented by comparing welfare at the

free trade equilibrium with welfare at the autarky equilibrium. In practice, such a comparison is

almost never feasible because the autarky equilibrium is almost never observed, except in unique

cases. One such case is Japan’s dramatic opening to the world economy in the 1850s, in which

domestic and world prices on comparable commodities exist for the period of Japanese autarky

and later free trade.1 Another exceptional instance is the United States during the period from

December 1807 to March 1809, when Congress imposed a nearly complete embargo on

international commerce at the request of President Thomas Jefferson. Unlike many trade

embargos, this one almost completely eliminated trade and was not compromised by widespread

smuggling.

       The Jeffersonian trade embargo provides a rare opportunity – a “natural experiment” if

you will – to observe the effects of a nearly complete (albeit short-lived) elimination of

international trade. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of the embargo

on the U.S. economy, such as its effect on the prices of traded goods and the degree of import

substitution, as well as provide a rough calculation of its welfare cost. Section 2 provides some

historical background on the embargo and describes its effect on trade. Section 3 sets out the

simple general equilibrium framework for evaluating the welfare effects of the embargo and

describes the data used to provide an estimate of the overall cost of approaching autarky. The

results suggest that the welfare cost of the embargo was about 5 percent of GNP in 1807, a time

when the ratio of exports to GNP was about 13 percent. Along with the embargo’s immediate

failure to achieve its objective of softening Britain’s policies toward neutral shipping, the high

economic cost of the measure helped persuade Congress to repeal it in March 1809, just fourteen

months after its imposition. Section 4 concludes the paper.



2. Historical Background

       The first decade of the nineteenth century was marred by near constant military conflict

between Britain and France in the Napoleonic Wars. As part of the war, Britain sought to

blockade the continent and to enforce this blockade by stopping the shipping of neutral

countries, especially the United States. The British navy patrolled the eastern U.S. coast and

regularly intercepted American vessels, conducted searches and seizures, confiscated ships,

cargo, and other property, and even impressed sailors (said to be British subjects) who were

evading military service. (France engaged in similar activities, but less intensely than Britain.)

American frustration over these actions steadily grew over time, but the United States had few

alternatives to deal with the situation. The main options were continued submission to the

British actions, declaring war on Britain in an attempt to force them to respect American

shipping, or enacting an embargo to safeguard American property and impose an economic

penalty on Britain.2

       After several provocations by Britain, the Jefferson administration opted for an embargo,

not only to protect domestic vessels and sailors from possible seizure, but to inflict economic


       2
           For background, see Hickey (1981).

costs on Britain in the hope of forcing them to change their policy. In December 1807, President

Jefferson requested that Congress enact a general embargo, and Congress quickly prohibited all

American ships from sailing to foreign ports and foreign ships from taking on any cargo in the

United States.3 Almost all accounts of the embargo considered it to have been effective, at least

initially. Very few American vessels appeared in European ports in 1808. Figure 1 presents the

tonnage of American ships entering into British ports during the period from 1801 to 1810.

While the tonnage entering in 1808 is not zero, that volume fell 80 percent from the previous

year.

        According to Heaton (1941, p. 189), there was “little effort to indulge in large-scale

defiance of the Embargo, at least until the end of 1808, when patience was becoming exhausted

and repeal seemed inevitable.”4 Although the data underlying Figure 1 are not available on a

monthly basis, the American tonnage entering Britain is likely to have been concentrated late in

1808. Late in that year, frustration with the embargo was high, its termination was widely

anticipated, and merchants were increasingly tempted to ignore it. After carefully comparing

U.S. and British price data and considering other quantity measures of direct and indirect trade




        3
         Although foreign ships were permitted to bring goods to the United States, few did so
during the embargo because they would have had to return empty. In addition, the non-
intercourse law prohibited the importation of many British manufactured goods.
        4
          “The ships and brigs which carried on the greater part of the transatlantic trade were in
general tied up in obedience to the Embargo, or they went down the coast to load goods in
readiness for the day when the light would change from red to green, and then returned to
anchorage in their home ports. . . . So far as the western hemisphere was concerned, smuggling
and embargo-breaking could not be prevented; but against Europe the Embargo was largely
effective. And if American ships did not go to Europe, British goods could not be brought back
in them.” Heaton (1941), p. 189. Virtually all of U.S. imports from Britain arrived on American
vessels during this era.
                                                -4-

between the two countries, Frankel (1982, p. 308) concludes that, although smuggling existed, it

was small: “the Embargo was well-enforced, so each country [the United States and Great

Britain] was reduced practically to autarky vis-a-vis the other.” There are many reports of

smuggling activity across Lake Champlain into Canada, but it is not believed that the volume of

such traffic was very significant.

       The highly controversial embargo was in effect for just fourteen months. Growing

domestic opposition to the trade restrictions, particularly in New England, forced Congress to

repeal the measure in March 1809.5 The consensus among historians is that the embargo failed

to achieve its objective because Britain and France refused to change their policies regarding

American shipping. This was not due to the failure to eliminate trade, but the failure of the trade

measures to weaken the political resolve in Britain to suppress neutral shipping in its effort to

strangle the French economy.6

       Although it did not completely eliminate U.S. trade, the embargo succeeded in having a

dramatic effect on commerce. Figure 2 shows the value of total U.S. merchandise trade

(merchandise exports of domestic produce plus re-exports, and imports) from 1800 to 1815.

Table 1 presents more detailed trade data for the years around 1807. The value of merchandise

exports of domestic produce fell from $49 million in 1807 to $9 million in 1808, a decline of



       5
          The embargo was replaced by non-intercourse act that continued to prohibit trade with
Britain, France, and their colonies and dependencies. Over the next four years, through the War
of 1812 until the Treaty of Ghent in 1813, trade was subject to varying degrees of formal
restriction, but none as draconian as the earlier embargo.
       6
         However, a later non-importation measure in 1811 coincided with an economic
downturn in Britain and apparently contributed to the British decision to lift some of its
draconian measures regarding American shipping. See Irwin (2002).
                                                -5-

over 80 percent. Net shipping earnings fell considerably less, by 45 percent, such that total

export earnings dropped 64 percent. Meanwhile, the value of imports for domestic consumption

fell from $85 million in 1807 to $45 million in 1808, a decline of nearly 50 percent. These

figures understate the impact of the embargo, however, because the government’s trade statistics

were collected for the fiscal year, not for the calendar year. Therefore, the figures for 1808 refer

to the period from October 1, 1807 to September 30, 1808, and thus include three months in

which the embargo was not in effect.

       Exports fell more sharply than imports in 1808 because of the timing of the embargo and

its effect on trans-Atlantic shipping (Heaton 1941, p. 190). After December 1807, no American

ship was allowed to leave the United States for a foreign destination. However, many American

vessels were then in British ports, where they would typically spend the winter months. To

encourage these ships to return home, Congress allowed merchants to bring into the country

previously purchased foreign goods. Thus, American ships returning from Europe in the spring

and summer of 1808 were permitted to unload their cargoes, but were not then permitted to

return to Europe. (Most ships involved in the trans-Atlantic trade made two round trips during

the sailing season.) As a result, exports fell immediately upon the imposition of the embargo

(because there could be no spring exports) and remained low throughout the year. By late 1808

and early 1809, as disregard for the embargo increased, some ships left U.S. ports in violation of

the law. On the other hand, imports did not fall as much because of the spring and summer ship

arrivals from Europe. But after that, few ships with foreign cargo arrived in the United States.

       The embargo had a dramatic impact on prices in the United States, driving down the

domestic prices of exported goods and driving up the domestic prices of imported goods. Figure
                                                -6-

3 presents the domestic prices of the four leading U.S. commodity exports on a monthly basis

from 1807 through 1809. Together, these four commodities – raw cotton, flour, tobacco, and

rice – accounted for about two-thirds of U.S. exports of domestic produce in 1807. Their prices

fell sharply in early 1808, consistent with the previous discussion of how the embargo affected

exports immediately by prohibiting American ships from departing for foreign ports. The

export-weighted average of the domestic prices of these commodities fell by about 27 percent

between December 1807 to June 1808.7 Prices bottomed out in the summer of 1808 and even

began to recover toward the end of the year. This is consistent with the evidence that merchants

were willing to violate the embargo as time went on.

       Unlike exports, U.S. imports were highly diversified and were not concentrated in just a

few key commodities. Figure 4 presents two price indexes for imported commodities in Boston

and Philadelphia during this period. Both indexes show that prices of imported goods failed to

rise in the spring of 1808, probably because imports continued to arrive in the port cities. Prices

began to shoot up by the fall of 1808, as the number of ships entering U.S. ports fell to a trickle

and imports became increasingly scarce. The price of imported commodities rose by about a

third as a result of the embargo: the index of wholesale prices rose 33.9 percent in Boston and

31.1 percent in Philadelphia between December 1807 and March 1809.8 Prices peaked around

the time the embargo was lifted in early 1809, and fell rapidly once trade was resumed.




       7
          The price data are in Cole (1938). The weights are 43 percent for cotton, 33 percent for
flour, 17 percent for tobacco, and 7 percent for rice, and come from Pitkin (1816).

         In Philadelphia, “The peak of prices for imported commodities occurred in March
1809, the month the embargo was repealed. At the time the index for imported commodities was
34.4 percent above the low of July 1807.” Bezanson, Gray, and Hussey (1936), p. 143.

       In terms of its effect on import and export prices, therefore, the embargo was roughly

equivalent to at least a 60 percent import tariff, perhaps larger if the United States was not a

small country and could affect world prices. Although it did not reach the point of complete

autarky as a result of the embargo, the United States was by mid- to late-1808 about as close to

being fully shut off from international commerce as it has ever been in its history.9 How much of

the gains from trade were sacrificed in this policy action?



3. Assessing the Gains from Trade

       This section sets out the simple general equilibrium framework that will be used to

calculate the welfare cost of the Jeffersonian trade embargo. The gains from trade can be

represented by the difference in the utility level associated with the free trade consumption

bundle and the utility level associated with the autarky production bundle. Following Grinols

and Wong (1991), the compensating variation change in welfare from an initial trading situation

(subscripted 0) to another (subscripted 1) can be expressed using the expenditure function:

(1)                                    )W = e(p1, u1) - e(p1, u0).

By the definition of the expenditure function,

(2)                            e(p1, u1) / p1@x1 = p1@y1 + (p1 - p1*)@m1 + B1,

where x is the vector of consumption, y is the vector of production, m is the vector of trade (mi /

xi - yi, such that imports are positive and exports are negative), p is the vector of domestic prices,



       9
         Figure 1 shows that the value of trade was lower in 1814 than in 1808, but this was due
as much to the war with Britain as to any formal policy measure. The calculations below will
focus on the shock between 1807 and 1808, two adjacent years in which the effects of policy can
be most clearly identified.
                                                  -8-

p* is the vector of world prices, B is any net transfers or borrowing from foreigners, and ‘@’

denotes the inner product. Equation (2) states that the value of consumption is equal to the value

of production plus tariff revenue -- represented by (p1 - p1*)@m1 -- plus transfers. As Grinols and

Wong show, the change in welfare can be rewritten as:

(3)                     )W = (p1 - p1*)@(m1 - m0) + (p1* - p0*)@(- m0) + (B1 - B0) + sC + sP,

where the terms sC and sP represent the substitution effects in consumption and production as a

result of the change in relative prices. Specifically, sC = p1@x0 - e(p1, u0) and sP = p1@(y1 - y0), and

these substitution effects are non-negative (sC $0, sP $0) if price-taking consumers optimize

subject to a budget constraint and price-taking producers maximize profits. Equation (3) can

also be rewritten in terms of domestic prices as:

(4)                             )W = (p1 - p1*)@m1 + p1@(- m0) + B1 + sC + sP.

        In the case where there are no international transfers and where the embargo is

completely effective (such that m1 is zero and the country is in autarky), this expression

simplifies to three terms: p1@(- m0), sC, and sP. Figure 5 illustrates these three components

graphically. The free trade situation consists of production at the point where the initial relative

price line p0 is tangent to the production possibility frontier, and consumption at the point where

p0 is tangent to the indifference curve U0. If all trade is eliminated, domestic prices become p1,

where the utility level U1 is tangent to the production possibility frontier. The compensating

variation welfare cost of eliminating trade and moving to autarky is represented by the distance

between the indifference curves U0 - U1, evaluated at domestic prices p1.

        Thus, the change in welfare is equal to the distance BC, i.e., )W = BC. This can be

decomposed as BC = AD - AB - CD, where AD represents the value p1@m0, AB is p1@x0 - e(p1, u0)
                                                -9-

= sC, and CD is p1@(y1 - y0) = sP. In other words, AD is the value of the previous volume of trade

at autarky prices, AB is the substitution in consumption and CD is the substitution in production

as a result of the change in relative prices. AD represents p1@m0 because DE is the value of

previous exports at autarky prices and AE is the value of previous imports at autarky prices, so

that AE - DE = AD (since by definition imports are positive and exports are negative).

       Equation (4) is a general formulation for a change in welfare and does not assume that all

trade is eliminated. In principle, each component of the equation can be calculated. In the

present case, the subscript 0 will refer to the pre-embargo (1807) situation and the subscript 1

will refer to the embargo (1808) period. Although data on U.S. trade in the early nineteenth

century is scanty, let alone data on production and consumption, sufficient data exists to generate

an approximate calculation of most components of equation (4). The calculation of each

component deserves some discussion.

AD: -p1@m0

       This is the most readily calculated component of the welfare change. We observe p0@m0,

which is simply the value of trade in 1807. The initial price vector is normalized to unity, such

that p0 = (1, 1, 1, 1) and m0 = (-48.7, -42.1, 34.0, 51.1), where the vector elements are exports of

domestic produce, shipping earnings, imports for consumption paying ad valorem duties, and

imports for consumption paying specific duties. (This distinction among imports will be

important for reasons that will become clear in the next calculation.) Re-exports have been

excluded from the calculation because the gains that accrued to the United States from such trade

is reflected solely in shipping earnings.

       In the vector m0, the values for domestic exports and shipping earnings are taken straight
                                               - 10 -

from Table 1. This table also presents the value of imports for consumption, but government

statistics only report the breakdown between ad valorem and specific duties for total imports, not

imports for consumption. The difference between total imports and imports for domestic

consumption is goods that were re-exported. The working assumption will be that imports for

consumption are divided in the same proportion as total imports between those subject to

specific duties (40 percent) and ad valorem duties (60 percent). It might be supposed that

imports subsequently re-exported consisted mainly of commodities from the West Indies (such

as sugar, coffee, etc.) that were subject to specific duties (and then rebated upon re-exportation),

but Pitkin (1816) indicates that re-exports also consisted of manufactures from Britain.10

       As previously noted, the domestic price of imported commodities rose about 33 percent

as a result of the embargo, and the domestic price of exported goods fell 27 percent. There is

little data available on domestic shipping rates between 1807 and 1808, although as Table 1

indicates shipping receipts fell less than domestic exports between 1807 and 1808.11 Therefore,

in the absence of better information, the maintained assumption will be that the price of shipping



       10
           “The valuable articles of colonial produce, such as sugar, coffee, spirits, cocoa,
pimento, indigo, pepper and spices of all kinds, were carried, either directly to Europe, or were
first brought to the United States, and from thence exported in American vessels. . . . The
manufactures of Europe, and particularly of Great Britain, as well as the manufactures and
produce of the East-Indies and China, have also been imported, and again exported, in large
quantities, to the West-Indies, to the Spanish Colonies in South America, and elsewhere. This
trade, which has been called the carrying trade, has, in some years, exceeded in value the trade of
the United States, in articles of domestic produce.” Pitkin (1816), p. 136.
       11
          International shipping rates rose during the embargo, due to the added risk of
undertaking a voyage. But the relevant data would be the price of domestic shipping services,
which presumably fell during the embargo. Pitkin (1816, p. 391) reports that tonnage engaged in
the domestic costal trade rose 23 percent in 1808 from the previous year, as ships normally used
for overseas trade were transferred to local trade.
                                                - 11 -

services fell the same 27 percent as domestic exports.

        Thus, the embargo price vector is p1 = (0.73, 0.73, 1.33, 1.33). The calculated value of -

p1@m0, which is also the estimated distance AD, is therefore $47 million.



CD: sP = p1@(y1 - y0)

        This component is somewhat more difficult to estimate. This measures the shift along

the domestic production possibilities frontier – producing more of the goods previously imported

and producing less of the goods previously exported – as a result of the change in domestic

relative prices.

        The scope for producers in the United States to start or to increase domestic production

of previously imported goods (import substitution) depends upon the type of imported good.

The ability of domestic firms to commence or increase production of manufactured goods, such

as cotton goods, glass, and iron, as a substitute for imports was quite substantial. Conversely,

nearly half of imports consisted of consumption items such as sugar, coffee, tea, spices, wine and

spirits, goods in which East Coast producers could not easily initiate production.

        Unfortunately, unlike the export statistics, the import statistics of this period do not

completely enumerate the types of goods imported, but they can help establish the general range

of potential import substitution by domestic producers. Imports subject to specific duties are

individually specified and consisted almost exclusively of the consumption goods mentioned

above (sugar, coffee, tea, wine, etc.) that domestic producers would have difficulty replicating.

All other imports paying ad valorem duties were not separately recorded, but included (among

other items) manufactured goods, where the possibility of import substitution was presumably
                                               - 12 -

high. As previously noted, about 40 percent of imports were subject to ad valorem duties.

       How much import substitution took place? Not much was possible, given the short

duration of the embargo; over a longer horizon, domestic producers would have been able to

establish much higher levels of output of previously imported goods. That said, the stimulus of

the embargo to domestic manufacturers (particularly around Philadelphia) was widely and

favorably noted at the time. The city of Philadelphia apparently did well during the embargo,

not just because income lost by merchants was shifted partly to lawyers (who benefitted from the

proliferation of maritime-related law suits) but because manufacturing production expanded in

such goods as carpets, cloth (from bedspreads to stockings), earthenware, glass, soap, lead and

shot, and chemicals (Sears 1921). As Frankel (1982, p. 301) notes, “There is historical evidence

that Americans were remarkably successful in 1808 at switching into the production of

manufactured goods when they were cut off from their usual source of supply.” Sokoloff (1988)

reports a wave of patent activity coinciding with the embargo.

       Other evidence suggests that domestic manufacturers elsewhere did not necessarily

prosper during the short period in which the embargo was in effect. The records of textile

manufacturers in New England indicates that they suffered considerably with the sudden

collapse of trade. According to Ware (1926, pp. 672, 677), these findings tend “to destroy the

theory that it was the embargo which, by cutting off foreign competition and throwing out of

employment labor and capital, gave the impetus and protection to the American industry which

enabled it to become firmly established. . . . By striking at the prosperity of the commercial

elements of the New England coast towns, it destroyed the purchasing power of the cotton

manufacturers’ chief market.”
                                                - 13 -

       Perhaps the most direct piece of evidence is from the Davis (2002) series on U.S.

industrial production during this period. Davis’s overall industrial production index actually

collapsed in 1808, falling 17 percent from 1807. However, the collapse was entirely due to the

fall in production by commercial and trade-dependent industries (such as merchant shipbuilding,

flour refining, fish curing, etc.) with virtually no change in the output of domestic infant

industries competing against imports (such as cotton and wool cloth production, etc.).12

Although this suggests that there was little immediate import substitution by domestic

manufacturers, the index fails to capture any increase in output from small producers, such as

local blacksmiths and glass blowers, household textile manufacturers, etc.

       Thus, information on production substitution is incomplete and the existing evidence is

mixed. In terms of calculating the value of production substitution, one extreme assumption is

that the United States could replace one-for-one the quantity of the previously imported

manufactured goods (i.e., imports subject to ad valorem duties) with domestic production of

those goods at the higher autarky prices. We also assume that domestic producers would not be

able to produce any imported goods subject to specific duties, including such commodities as

sugar, coffee, tea, wine, etc. Symmetrically, domestic production of the exportable goods and

shipping services would be assumed to fall one-for-one with the decline in the exports of those

items. In this one-for-one replacement case, then (y1 - y0) = (m1 - m0) with the non-ad valorem

imports zeroed out. Because m1 = (-9.4/0.73, -23.0/0.73, 16.0/1.33, 29.1/1.33), or (-12.9, -31.5,

12.0, 21.9), then m1 - m0 = (35.8, 10.6, -22.0, -29.2) and therefore (y1 - y0) = (35.8, 10.6, -22.0,

0). Then the net gain from the production shift is p1A(m1 - m0) = $4.7 million.

       This one-for-one replacement assumption is extreme for assuming that domestic

production of manufactures could substitute perfectly for imports, and that domestic production

of exportables would fall as much as exports declined. An alternative assumption is that

domestic producers could only produce half of the quantity of goods previously imported, and

were forced to reduce by half their production of goods previously exported. In this case, (y1 -

y0) = 0.5A(m1 - m0) = (17.9, 0, 5.3, -20.2, 0), and the net gain from the production shift is p1A(m1 -

m0) = $2.3 million. This case will be the central assumption, although the bounds on the welfare

cost will be explored using both full replacement and zero (substitution) replacement.



AB: sC = p1@x0 - e(p1,u0)

       The absence of any consumption data make any estimate of the consumption substitution

virtually impossible. The scope for consumption substitution was probably small: it is unlikely

that domestic consumption of flour and tobacco would increase significantly because their prices

had fallen – and the prices of manufactures increased – due to the embargo. It seems plausible to

assume that the scope for substitution in consumption is less than the scope for substitution in

production, which means that it would take a value of something less than $5 million. As an

initial guess, we will take the value of $2.3 million, the same value as the substitution assumed to

be achieved by domestic producers.

       Alternatively, we can crudely simulate the value of consumption substitution with a

simple Cobb-Douglas utility function in which consumption is assumed to be 80 percent of GNP

and the expenditure share on imported manufactures is 30 percent. Under Cobb-Douglas, the

elasticity of substitution is one, a higher value than is commonly used in computable general
                                               - 15 -

equilibrium models. This gives us an upper bound estimate on consumption substitution. In this

case, the change in relative prices brings about consumption substitution valued at $3.2 million.



Other Components

       The last two components of equation (4) are tariff revenue and net transfers in period 1.

Tariff revenue -- expressed as (p1 - p1*)@m1 -- is not zero because some imports were allowed

into the country in early 1808. The government reported tariff revenue to be $7.7 million in

1808, as noted on Table 1.13 Net transfers (B1) is derived from the constraint in equation (2): p1

(y1 - x1) + (p1 - p1*)@m1 + B1 = 0. Solving for B1 in the year 1808 yields the figure of $1.5

million. This helps correct for any distortion of the magnitude of the previous calculations due

to imbalanced trade.

       Table 2 presents the combined estimates of these various components of the welfare cost.

Column (1) presents the benchmark case using the figures calculated above. The components

sum to $33 million dollars. This welfare cost may be more usefully expressed as a percent of

GNP. Gallman (2000, p. 7) reports a figure of $680 million for nominal GNP in 1807, which is

somewhat higher than other estimates but otherwise seems reasonable.14 Taking this figure as a

rough benchmark, the welfare cost of the embargo was about 5 percent of GNP.




       13
           Recall as well that the customs figure for 1808 refer to October 1807 to September
1808 and cover a period when there was no embargo and when imports were still allowed in
despite the embargo. The figure for 1809 (October 1808 to September 1809) cover six months
when the embargo was effective.
       14
          Berry (1988) estimates that nominal GNP was $561 million in 1807. Contemporaries
put the number much lower, as Niles has a 1814 estimate of $642 for 1814 and Beaujour has an
estimate of $197 to $350 million for the period 1800 to 1810.
                                                 - 16 -

        What is a plausible range for this welfare cost? The first component (p1m0) is a best

guess and does not change; this also applies to tariff revenue and to B1. The production and

substitution components are subject to greater uncertainty. Columns (2) and (3) present lower

and upper bound calculation based on assumptions about substitution. Column (2) presents a

lower bound calculation in which domestic manufacturers can fully produce what was previously

imported and domestic farmers fully reduce production by the amount that exports decline. This

increases sP from $2.3 to $4.7 million, decreasing the welfare cost to $28 million, or 4 percent of

GNP. Columns (3) an alternative, higher bound calculations on the magnitude of the welfare

loss in which there is no production or consumption substitution at all. This increases the

welfare cost to $38 million, or 5.5 percent of GNP.

        These alternative calculations provide some plausible bounds on the likely true welfare

cost of the embargo. The welfare cost appears to be centered around 5 percent of GNP, but

could be as low as 4 percent or as high as something closer to 6 percent. In 1807, merchandise

exports and net shipping receipts were about 13 percent of GNP.

        In two classic papers on the cost of protection, Johnson (1960, 1965) presents some

different calculations that lend some support to these magnitudes. Johnson (1965) used a

constant elasticity of substitution utility function and a general specification for the production

transformation curve to arrive at the costs of self-sufficiency (autarky) in a computable two-

sector general equilibrium model. In the case where the share of national income spent on

importables under free trade is 0.20 and the elasticity of substitution in consumption between

importables and exportables is 0.5, for example, then a tariff of 76 percent would be sufficient to

induce autarky at a welfare loss of 5.2 percent of free trade utility level. If the elasticity of
                                                 - 17 -

substitution is 1.0, then the self-sufficiency tariff is 53 percent and the welfare loss is 4.0 percent.

These figures are remarkably close to the actual findings in this paper. Given that the calculation

is performed in a similar general equilibrium setting, perhaps this should not be too surprising.

        Johnson (1960) also derived the commonly used partial equilibrium measure of the cost

of protection as a percent of GDP as ½ " 0 (J/(1+J)2, where " is the ratio of imports to GDP in

the (initial) equilibrium, 0 is the absolute value of the arc elasticity of import demand, and J is

the average ad valorem tariff rate. In the present case, the ratio of imports to GDP is

approximately 0.13, and if we assume that the absolute value of the elasticity of import demand

is 2 and that the tariff rate is 70 percent, then the cost of protection is 2.2 percent of GDP. As is

commonly pointed out, this partial equilibrium formula yields relatively small figures for the

cost of protection.

        Thus, the massive disruption of trade caused by the embargo imposed a substantial one-

year loss on the U.S. economy, one that was not just a small fraction of a percent of GNP. There

is no doubt that 1808 was a difficult year for the U.S. economy. Berry’s (1988) real GNP

estimates fall 4.7 percent between 1807 and 1808. The year has been called a “depression” by

Thorp (1926, p. 116), who gives it the following description: “rigid embargo causes paralysis on

coast, gradually spreading inland; severe distress in New England; further sharp decline in

commodity prices to low point, third quarter; foreign trade completely checked.”

        It is difficult to consider the policy of embargo a success, given the cost it imposed on the

economy while failing to achieve its objective of changing British and French policy toward

American shipping. One person who almost perfectly anticipated the results of the embargo was

Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury. Writing in 1794, Hamilton was
                                               - 18 -

prescient about the potential impact of any trade embargo: “The consequences of so great and so

sudden a disturbance of our Trade which must affect our exports as well as our Imports are not to

be calculated. An excessive rise in the price of foreign commodities – a proportional decrease of

price and demand for our own commodities – the derangement of our revenue and credit – these

circumstances united may occasion the most dangerous dissatisfaction & disorders in the

community and may drive the governt. to a disgraceful retreat – independent of foreign causes”

(Syrett 1961, Vol. 16, p. 275).

       Hamilton proved correct not just about trade and revenue effect of the embargo, but about

the domestic disorder it caused and the eventual retreat of the government: New England

grumbled about secession and the growing domestic discontent with the embargo, and the

increasing willingness of merchants to violate it, led to its repeal without it having accomplished

any change in British policy. The political opposition generated by the embargo can be

illustrated by studying Congressional votes on the embargo. Table 3 shows the pattern of voting

across regions on the imposition and retention of the embargo in the House of Representatives.

The partisan division on the issue is readily apparent: Federalists completely opposed the

measure, while the Jeffersonian Republicans initially supported it but later opposed it. The table

shows that Republican support for the embargo was completely lost in New England and the

Mid-Atlantic states. New England merchants were most vocal in opposing the embargo, while

in the Mid-Atlantic the losses to merchants and the farming community (in terms of foregone

income and lower land prices) surely exceeded the gains to those starting manufacturing

establishments.

       Given that the major export crops came from the South, one might have expected strong
                                                - 19 -

opposition to the embargo in that region. Yet in the February 1809 vote, members from the

South were evenly divided about whether to retain the embargo or not. Jennings (1921) notes

several factors that may have muted Southern opposition to the embargo: the suspension of

bankruptcy laws, the non-perishability of Southern crops, and the deep seated hatred of Great

Britain. Despite these factors, there was little support in Congress for continuing the embargo in

early 1809.



4. Conclusions

       This paper has used the “natural experiment” of America’s trade embargo of 1807-1809

to calculate the total static losses from forgoing virtually all international trade. While the

United States did not achieve complete autarky in 1808, it came as close to economic isolation as

it ever has in its history. The best guess calculation of the static welfare cost of the embargo is

about 5 percent of GNP. The cost does not represent the total gains from trade, however,

because the initial trading equilibrium was one of restricted trade. Still, the embargo inflicted

substantial costs on the economy while it was in effect.
