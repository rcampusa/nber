                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the relation between ownership, corporate form, and innovation for a cross-section
of private and publicly traded innovating firms in the US and 15 European countries. A striking novel
observation emerges from our analysis: while most innovating firms in the US are publicly traded
conglomerates, a substantial fraction of innovation is concentrated in private firms and in business
groups in continental European countries. We find virtually no variation across US industries in the
corporate form of innovating firms, but a substantial variation across industries in continental European
countries, where business groups tend to be concentrated in industries with a slower and more fundamental
innovation cycle and where intellectual protection of innovators seems to be of paramount importance.
Our findings suggest that innovative companies choose the corporate form most conducive to R&D,
as predicted by the Coasian view of how firms form. This is especially true in Europe, where there
are fewer regulatory hurdles to the formation of business groups and hybrid corporate forms. It is less
the case in the US, where conglomerates are generally favored.

1. Introduction

Which corporate forms are most propitious to innovation? Is it standalone …rms …nanced by
Venture Capital (VC)? Is it conglomerate incubators, or looser business-group and corporate

alliance structures? While GE, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, DuPont or 3M are often mentioned
as examples of highly innovative conglomerate …rms in the U.S., there have also been many
prominent examples of VC-backed standalones in recent years, such as Amazon, Netscape, or

Google. Although VC-backed innovation has been less important in Europe, innovative activity
in conglomerates such as Philips or Nokia is highly visible, and business-groups in the vein of

Ericsson, Zeiss, Alstom and Novartis are also renowned innovators.

   Economists and business scholars have pointed to the advantages of conglomerates in fund-

ing R&D projects with cheaper internally generated funds (Gertner, Scharfstein and Stein,

1994 and Stein, 1997) while at the same time emphasizing the dark side of internal capital

markets, in terms of reduced …nancial discipline for poorly performing investments (Scharf-

stein and Stein, 2000). Seru (2007) …nds evidence consistent with this dark side of internal

capital markets: publicly traded U.S. conglomerates with above-average reallocation of funds

across divisions are less productive innovators than comparable stand-alone …rms. Similarly,

Guedj and Scharfstein (2004) compare clinical trials in the biopharmaceutical industry and …nd

that big pharmaceuticals …rms engaged in cancer research tend to initiate too many studies

but are quicker to terminate unpromising research than smaller (stand-alone) biotech …rms.
In contrast, Belenzon and Berkovitz (2008a) …nd European evidence that innovation tends to
be concentrated in business-groups and that business-group a¢ liates tend to engage in more

innovation than comparable stand-alone …rms.
   While these studies do not necessarily o¤er contradictory evidence - as business-groups have
a di¤erent governance structure than fully integrated conglomerates - they do suggest that the

link between governance and innovation is likely to be complex and that more systematic
evidence is required to have a better understanding on how governance a¤ects innovation.



                                              2
      In this paper we o¤er a more complete picture of the link between governance and innovation
by looking at a cross-section of innovating …rms in the U.S. and in 15 European countries. In
addition, we provide a broad conceptual framework that allows us to compare the relative

strengths of standalone …rms, conglomerates and business-groups in fostering innovation.
      Building on existing theories of conglomerate internal capital markets, we emphasize the
relative strengths of conglomerates in terms of cheaper internal R&D funding, better winner-

picking, and lower stigma of failure, versus the stronger intellectual property rights for innova-
tors in stand-alone …rms.1 Business-groups occupy a middle ground compared with conglomer-

ates and standalones. These are fuzzier and more diverse organizational forms with potentially

complex controlling stakes holding together a set of independently incorporated companies.

Business groups may be entirely composed of privately held entities or may combine both

privately held and publicly traded companies. Business groups may take the form of pyrami-

dal structures, where a single controlling company has direct or indirect controlling stakes in

multiple subsidiary companies, or business alliances, where the companies in the alliance are

connected through interlocking stakes.

      Business groups are rare in the U.S. and somewhat rare in the U.K., but they are om-

nipresent elsewhere in the world. Business groups have been associated with poor minority

investor protection and ine¢ cient rent extraction by controlling shareholders (see Johnson, La

Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer, 2000, and Bertrand, Mehta, and Mullainathan, 2002).
They are often seen as a consequence of poor legal investor protections in emerging market
countries, and also to some extent in developed ‘civil law’ countries. Accordingly, we model

business groups as in Almeida and Wolfenzon (2006) and allow for ine¢ cient diversion of funds
by controlling shareholders from …rms a¢ liated with a business group. Due to this ine¢ cient
diversion business groups involve greater ine¢ ciencies than conglomerates or standalones, other

things equal. However, business groups also have strengths in terms of cheaper internal R&D
funding and a lower stigma of failure relative to stand-alone …rms, as well as strengths in terms

      We mainly build on Gertner, Scharfstein and Stein (1994), Stein (1997) and Scharfstein and Stein (2000).

of stronger intellectual property rights for innovators relative to conglomerates.
   An important basic premise of our analysis is that innovating …rms tend to set up their
corporate governance to implement an e¢ cient environment to foster innovation. Thus, when

the observed choice of corporate form is a conglomerate or a business group we assume that
this is the revealed preferred choice of organization. In other words, a basic premise of our
analysis is a Coasian perspective on …rm organization. Thus, to the extent that a particular

corporate form is especially well suited for innovative activities, we expect this corporate form
to be more prevalent among innovative …rms in a given industry than among non-innovating

…rms.

   We base our analysis on a comprehensive data-set of both private and publicly traded

American and European …rms, and match all corporate patents granted by the United States

Patent and Trademark O¢ ce (USPTO) and the European Patent O¢ ce (EPO) to these …rms.

We also single out …rms that publish their research in academic journals. We have thus identi…ed

about 64.000 …rms that hold at least one patent from the EPO or USPTO, or have published at

least one scienti…c article in a science journal. Of these 64.000 …rms, about 60% are American,

11% German, 8% British, 4% French, and 5% are Italian. We matched 880.000 USPTO, 615.000

EPO patents, and 205.000 scienti…c publications. 75% of USPTO patents and close to 40% of

EPO patents are held by American corporation. Germany appears to be the most innovative

European country while holding 12% and 20% of USPTO and EPO patents, respectively.
For scienti…c publications, about 70% of the articles are published by U.S. corporations, 10%
German, and 3% French and British.

   Several surprising …ndings emerge from our analysis. First and foremost, while the overall
distribution of USPTO patents by ownership structure in the whole sample is 18% standalones,
74% conglomerates, and 8% business-group a¢ liates, in the U.S. this distribution is skewed

towards standalones and conglomerates, with 20% and 76% respectively of patents falling in
these categories, and only 4% of patents being held by business group a¢ liates. In Europe,
on the other hand, 20% of the patents are held by business-group a¢ liates, and 11% and 68%


                                                4
respectively are held by standalones and conglomerates. A similar pattern emerges for EPO
patents and scienti…c publications. There is also a wide variation in organizational form across
European countries. While Germany appears to resemble the U.S. in terms of concentration

of innovation in conglomerates (80%), French and Italian …rms are clearly skewed towards
business-group a¢ liates, with only 35% and 22% respectively of their patents being held by
conglomerates.

   Second, we distinguish between business-group a¢ liates that are wholly-owned by their
parent company, which are more likely to be fully integrated, and a¢ liates that have minority

shareholders. The presence of minority shareholders in an a¢ liate company establishes a sepa-

ration between the a¢ liate and its parent company in terms of retained pro…ts, patent holdings,

and resource reallocation. Business groups with partially owned a¢ liates are therefore more

decentralized corporate structures. Remarkably, in France 20% of innovation takes place in

a¢ liates with minority shareholders, while only 1% of innovation takes place in such a¢ liates

in the U.S. and Great Britain.

   Third, the U.S. distribution of innovating …rms is also heavily skewed towards publicly

traded …rms. Indeed, the fraction of patents held by publicly traded American corporations is

above 60%, while this fraction is only about 40% in Europe. In some large European countries

this picture is even more extreme. In France, only 9% and 18% of USPTO and EPO patents,

respectively, are held by publicly traded …rms, while in Italy these …gures drop to as low as 3%
and 7% respectively. Also, publicly traded innovating …rms in Europe are more likely to belong
to a business group, with more than 40% of innovating listed …rms belonging to a business-

group in France and Germany, compared with only 2% and 1% respectively in the U.S. and
Great Britain.
   Fourth, we …nd a substantial variation in organization structure across industries. Business

groups tend to be concentrated in industries where innovation takes a longer time, is more un-
certain, but has a higher payo¤ when it succeeds (such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology).
These innovative activities may be more vulnerable to hold-up problems and require greater


                                               5
protection of the intellectual property rights of the innovator. In contrast, conglomerates are
more prevalent in industries with rapid, incremental, innovations (such as computer hardware
and telecommunications) where the ability of conglomerates to identify the relevant innova-

tion and to quickly redeploy assets may give this organizational form an edge over business
groups. We …nd that European …rms are strongly skewed towards business groups in the latter
industries, while U.S. innovating …rms take the conglomerate form in more or less the same

proportion across all industries.
   Our …ndings are broadly consistent with a Coasian view on …rm organization form, which

is to say that …rms choose the corporate form that is best suited for fostering innovative activ-

ities. The alternative view in the literature is that organization form is chosen by entrenched

managers, or controlling shareholders, to suit their best interests at the expense of minority

shareholders and overall …rm e¢ ciency. By this latter view it is not obvious that one should

see any systematic di¤erence in organization form in a given industry and country across inno-

vative and non-innovative …rms. We examine whether innovative …rms are disproportionately

represented in a given organization category, using sales of about 3.5 million …rms as our

benchmark. We …nd that innovation is disproportionately concentrated in business-groups

in the pharmaceuticals industry, and disproportionately concentrated in conglomerates in the

telecommunications industry. This pattern is especially true in Europe, where there are fewer

regulatory hurdles to the formation of business groups and hybrid corporate forms. It is not
the case in the U.S., where conglomerates are generally preferred.
   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical

framework, section 3 overviews the data, section 4 reports the main empirical …ndings and
section 5 concludes.


2. A Simple Model

We set up a model with at least two business units, which can be stand-alone entities, divisions

in a conglomerate …rm, or units linked in a business group, with one parent company owning


                                               6
a controlling block in a separately incorporated …rm.
   1.Technological Assumptions
   There are N      2 business units with liquid assets Wi                     0 and a new R&D project. The

R&D project has …xed costs f > 0 at date 1 and a probability of success (a) at date 2.
The probability of success depends on how well the project is managed, or more formally, on
which action a 2 f0; 1g the project’s manager chooses. The project’s value to the business

unit conditional on success is given by v(a) > 0. A successful R&D project may also generate
spillovers to other business units worth s(a)                0. When the research is unsuccessful (with

probability (1    (a))) it yields no …nancial return.

   The project brings expected private bene…ts or costs to the managerial team undertaking

it. The bene…ts may come in the form of improved human capital and knowledge, better future

career prospects, enhanced reputation in the event of success. The costs may be the stigma

of failure when the research is not successful. Without loss of generality we normalize the net

bene…ts arising from simply undertaking the project to zero. We denote by b > 0 the private

bene…ts that come with success and by             > 0 the private costs associated with the stigma of

failure.

   We shall assume that:

                                b   1    (1        1)   <b    0       (1       0 );


so that the expected net private bene…ts to the manager are highest when the manager chooses
a = 0. Note that the latter inequality reduces to

                                         (b + )(        0      1)   > 0;

and therefore holds if and only if            1         0   < 0: We also assume that

                 (v1 + b)   1       (1   1)       f > 0 > (v0 + b)         0          (1   0)   f

These inequalities together with          < 0 mean that the innovative activity is equivalent to
taking a higher risk, higher expected payo¤ actions. In other words, R&D activities are high

                                                        7
risk, but also high reward activities. The above inequalities also mean that the R&D activity
is worth undertaking if and only if the manager can be induced to choose the high risk, high
reward, action a = 1.

   To simplify the analysis we also restrict attention to parameter values such that b        1

 (1   1 ).   The manager’s expected private costs from the stigma of failure when he chooses a = 1
are then greater than the private bene…ts from a successful innovation. Under this assumption

the manager has to receive some form of …nancial incentive to be willing to undertake the risky
innovative activity.


   2.Governance Assumptions and Firm boundaries

   We distinguish between three main types of …rms: standalones, conglomerates (with wholly-

owned a¢ liates) and business-groups with a¢ liates owned in part by minority shareholders.

   A standalone …rm is essentially a …rm with a single business unit. Such a …rm is run

by a manager with an equity stake su¢ cient to align incentives and is monitored by a large

blockholder, venture capitalist (VC), or creditor, who plays the role of an active monitor as in

Holmstrom and Tirole (1994). A standalone …rm is viable only if it is able to raise su¢ cient

funds to …nance the research, while preserving the manager’s incentives to conduct the research

and the monitor’s incentive to monitor.

   We assume that only a fraction        of the …rm’s value v(a) can be pledged to raise external

funds. The parameter       2 (0; 1) represents the fraction of R&D cash-‡ow that is capitalizable
by the …rm. It provides a simple measure of the …nancial development of a country. The

higher is     the more …nancially developed a country is. We assume that capital markets are

perfectly competitive for the pledgeable part of …rm value and for simplicity we normalize the
equilibrium required risk-adjusted return to zero.

   Following Holmstrom and Tirole (1994) we also assume that the timing of the contractual

relation between investors in the …rm, the VC monitor, and the entrepreneur is as follows:


  1. following an injection of funds in the …rm by investors, the monitor moves …rst by choosing


                                                 8
           whether to engage in costly monitoring or not;

     2. the R&D project manager moves second by choosing whether to take action a = 0 or
           a = 1, having observed whether the active monitor is monitoring or not;

     3. the R&D project either succeeds or fails;

     4. if it succeeds the proceeds from the project are distributed to all investors and the man-
           ager.


         Suppose that the active monitor decides to monitor the manager and incurs the monitoring

cost m > 0. Then as in Holmstrom and Tirole (1994), we assume that the manager’s net

private bene…ts are lowered by a fraction (1                        ), where        < 1.

         The manager must be incentivized to choose a = 1. If his …nancial stake in the project, , is

large enough he will choose a = 1 even though his private bene…ts are higher for a = 0. Formally,

the manager’s stake             must be such that the following incentive compatibility constraint holds:

                              ( v1 + b)     1       (1     1)        ( v0 + b)       0     (1   0)



or

                                                    V +             (b + )     0:

                                                                2
where         V     (v1   1    v0 0 ) and       =    1     0.

                                                                                                                3
         If there is no monitoring, on the other hand, the incentive compatibility constraint is:

                                                     V +        (b + )         0:

Monitoring is bene…cial if two conditions are satis…ed.
         First, it must be the case that the …rm cannot get su¢ cient …nancing in the absence of

monitoring. That is, the …rm should not be able to invest in R&D, by using all its internal

funds Wi and raising (f            Wi ) from outside investors, while at the same time granting su¢ cient
     2
         Note that under our assumptions V is strictly positive and          is strictly negative.
     3
         Since    < 0 the incentive constraint is clearly harder to satisfy with no monitoring than under monitoring.

                                                                9
…nancial incentives to the entrepreneur to choose a = 1 even though there is no monitoring.
Therefore, a …rst condition is that:


                                                (1      ) v1      1   <f           Wi


for any     such that
                                                     V +          (b + )           0;

or
                                                     (b + )
                                         [1 +               ] v1          1   <f         Wi :
                                                       V
     Second, the …rm must be able to get …nancing when there is monitoring. The active monitor

has an incentive to monitor and incur the monitoring cost m as long as his stake                                           in the …rm’s
                                                                                                               m
pro…t is large enough that               V      m. In exchange for the stake                               =    V
                                                                                                                    , which just ensures

that he will monitor, the active monitor is willing to invest an amount equal to his expected

equilibrium net return:       v1    1        m. Therefore, the standalone …rm is viable under monitoring

if

                              (1                ) v1    1     f           Wi            v1   1   + m;

or, substituting for    and        if:

                               (b + )                m                                                v1   1

Rearranging, this condition reduces to:

                                                 (b + )
                               [1 +                     ] v1          1        f    Wi + m:
                                                   V

     Clearly, for   large enough, and m and                  small enough this condition will be satis…ed given
our assumption that
                                                        v1    1   > f:

     A conglomerate …rm operates n                   2 business units that are wholly-owned subsidiaries. It

has corporate headquarters that make investment and R&D decisions for all divisions. A key


                                                              10
feature of conglomerate …rms is that pro…ts of subsidiaries are channeled to headquarters, who
report consolidated earnings to the …rm’s shareholders. Divisional managers typically cannot
be rewarded based on their division’s pro…t, and their incentive pay-component is generally

based only on conglomerate pro…ts and stock price. Moreover, divisional managers don’t own
the intellectual property they create, unless they negotiate a contract which explicitly gives
                                                         4
them the right to any innovation they create.

         On the other hand, divisional managers may be closely monitored by headquarters. Another
advantage of undertaking research in a conglomerate is that failure can be hidden to some extent

inside the …rm, so that there is a lower stigma of failure. Conglomerates also develop winner

picking skills, and bene…t from R&D spillovers on other divisions.

         For our formal analysis we assume that conglomerate …rms are composed of only two divi-

sions, A and B. We also simplify the governance of conglomerate …rms to the CEO’s role in

picking winner R&D projects and to the CEO’s active monitoring of division managers. We

model winner picking by assuming that a project selected by headquarters has a probability of

success        (a), where       1. We model CEO monitoring by letting the CEO monitor division

managers j = A; B at cost               and thereby lowering division managers’ private bene…ts by a

fraction (1        ). If the divisional manager’s research is successful, however, it is owned by the

…rm. Thus, division managers have lower powered incentives to pursue R&D in conglomerates.
5
    In our model, a divisional manager can only extract a small share                  of the direct value of the
innovation by, for example, threatening to leave and pursue his research at another …rm. Thus,
the divisional manager’s incentive constraint for choosing action a = 1 in a conglomerate is:

                      ( v1 + b)     1   + (1      1)          ( v0 + b)     0   + (1     0)    ;

or

                                               V +           (b + )    0:
     4
      Such contracts are not common and even when a contract grants intellectual property rights to the innovator
it is di¢ cult to enforce.
    5
      Divisional managers may get a share of conglomerate pro…ts, but due to moral hazard in teams problems,
they will have lower powered incentives than if they received a share of their own division’s pro…ts. For simplicity,
we ignore the …nancial incentives from shares in conglomerate pro…ts.

                                                         11
      Finally, conglomerates have the …nancing advantage of drawing on the sum of liquid assets
of both divisions, (WA + WB ), to fund a division’s R&D project. To summarize, in our model
a conglomerate picks the most promising R&D project from the divisions, thus ensuring a

probability of success of     1   in equilibrium. It …nances the project entirely with its own funds
(WA + WB ) and it incurs monitoring costs . Thus, the conglomerate’s expected return is given
by:

                                   (1    )v1   1   f      + WA + WB

provided that it can induce the divisional manager whose R&D project is picked to choose

action a = 1. Should     be so low that

                                                       (b + )
                                               <
                                                         V

then the division manager will choose a = 0, in which case we assume that the conglomerate

will not pick any R&D projects.


      A business-group of n       2 …rms is similar to a conglomerate …rm. It has a controlling hub

akin to corporate headquarters and multiple divisions. The key di¤erences with a conglomerate

are that: i) the business units are not wholly owned subsidiaries, but rather are independently

incorporated companies controlled by the group’s majority shareholders through a controlling
stake; ii) earnings of business units are not consolidated, and ownership of intellectual property

remains with the innovating business unit; iii) R&D project selection is more decentralized, so

that the group’s hub plays less of a winner picking role. The group mainly plays the role of an
internal capital market to fund R&D investments.

      We denote by ' the ownership share of the group and (1        ') the share owned by minority
shareholders. An important potential source of ine¢ ciency in business groups is the separation
of ownership and control of business units. This separation can give rise to ine¢ cient diversion

of business unit earnings by the controlling shareholders. We model this diversion as in Almeida
and Wolfenzon (2006) by allowing the controlling shareholders to “divert” d of earnings from


                                                   12
a unit in which they have a stake ' at a deadweight cost of
                                                             1 2
                                                    k(d) =     d.
                                                             2
Group owners then choose d to maximize:
                                                                1 2
                                              '(v      d) + d     d;
                                                                2
where          denotes the business unit’s earnings. As is easily established, the optimal amount of
diversion and the deadweight cost of diversion are then respectively:
                                          1     '                       (1       ') 2
                               d('; ) =              and k(d('; )) =                    :
                                                                             2
                                                 1 '
The earnings retained in the …rm–(v                    )–can be shared between the division manager and

all the owners. Thus division managers can be incentivized as in standalones based on the

non-diverted earnings. Moreover, the business unit manager’s private bene…ts can be reduced

through monitoring by the group’s controlling owners.

       As the literature on business groups has emphasized, the diversion of earnings by controlling

shareholders reduces the e¢ ciency of business groups relative to stand-alone …rms or conglom-
           6
erates.        The pervasiveness of business groups around the world (with the important exceptions

of the U.S. and Great Britain) suggests, however, that there is also a countervailing e¢ ciency
                                          7
improving role of business groups.            We argue that the e¢ ciency gain of business groups is due

to the stronger intellectual protection given to innovators in business units a¢ liated to business
groups, who can retain (partial) ownership of their patents.

       To summarize, business groups combine the R&D incentive bene…ts of stand-alone …rms with

the internal capital market bene…ts of conglomerates. Given equal R&D incentives, however,
   6
     There can also be diversion of funds from conglomerates with separation of ownership and control. For
simplicity we ignore this form of diversion in our model.
   7
     While, some commentators simply explain the existence of business groups as an ine¢ cient outcome caused
by managerial entrenchment, others point to the value adding role of business groups as providers of a substitute
source of funding for investment in environments where external capital markets are ine¢ cient due to inadequate
investor protection. Thus, the prevalence of business groups in emerging market countries is seen as a necessary
but transitory consequence of the underdevelopment of securities markets in these countries. However, as our
evidence highlights, business groups are also prevalent in advanced countries, with developed securities markets
and strong investor protections. Moreover, as we show, these groups tend to be both very competitive and
innovative.

                                                         13
business groups are less e¢ cient than conglomerates, as they involve both ine¢ cient diversion
of funds and less e¤ective winner-picking.


   3.Assumptions on external legal environment

   Besides   (the fraction of the value of innovations that is capitalizable) we introduce three
other key parameters to capture the external legal environment:      an intercompany dividend
tax,   the R&D project manager’s bargaining power, and         the stigma cost of failure. As we

argue in the next section, the main comparative advantages of the U.S. relative to the EU are
that U.S. securities markets free up a higher    and . Moreover, U.S. entrepreneurial culture

and bankruptcy laws also result in a lower . Against these comparative advantages the EU’s

main advantage is a lower .



3. Model Analysis

We divide the model analysis into two parts. We begin by considering the main tradeo¤s in

organizational form keeping the external legal environment …xed. In a second step we do a

EU-US comparative analysis by analyzing how changes in the parameters ( ; ; ) a¤ect the

equilibrium distribution of R&D across organizational forms.

3.1. Main tradeo¤s within a given legal environment

We consider in turn the choice between undertaking R&D in a stand-alone unit or inside a
conglomerate …rm, the pros and cons of a business-group and a conglomerate structure, and

…nally the choice between stand-alone and a¢ liation to a business-group.

3.1.1. Stand-alone …rm vs. Conglomerate: the costs and bene…ts of internal capital
       markets

Consider the funding of R&D projects in a conglomerate with two business units, A and B.

To facilitate comparisons with a stand-alone …rm we assume that only one of the two units
has a potential research project, say division A. We also assume that the conglomerate has


                                                14
su¢ cient internal funds or capital to be able to fund the project without raising external
funds, (WA + WB )         f . A conglomerate has lower costs of monitoring and greater winner-
picking skills, so that it will be more e¢ cient at R&D as long as it can provide adequate

incentives to choose action a = 1 to its divisional managers. Therefore, R&D is organized in a
conglomerate whenever divisional managers have su¢ cient incentives to choose action a = 1.
That is, whenever        is large enough that:

                                                         (b + )
                                              +                         0:
                                                           V

If   is too small then R&D may be organized in a standalone …rm provided that enough external

funding can be obtained, or:

                                           (b + )
                                   [1 +           ] v1        1     f        Wi + m:
                                             V

     In Figure 1 below we describe the parameter regions for which R&D takes place in respec-

tively a standalone …rm (SA) and a conglomerate (CL) in ( V; f                      Wi +m) space. The function

h( V ) is given by
                                                              (b + )
                                     h( V )       [1 +               ] v1       1
                                                                V
and the vertical line      V# is
                                                               (b + )
                                              V# =                        :



     For all values of    V        V# the incentive constraint for a = 1 in conglomerates is satis…ed

and R&D is organized in a conglomerate. For                   V <       V# , R&D is not e¢ cient in a conglom-
erate, but it may be sustainable in a standalone …rm provided that the parameter values for
( V; f     Wi + m) lie in the area (SA); that is, provided that (f                     Wi + m)    m lies below

h( V ). In situations where the hold-up problem is so severe that R&D projects cannot be
undertaken e¢ ciently in a conglomerate, innovators may still be able to undertake their R&D
project in a standalone …rm provided that the external …nancing needs of the R&D project



                                                         15
(f     Wi ) are su¢ ciently low, and/or the costs of monitoring the innovator (m) are su¢ ciently
low.
     Simple comparative statics results can be inferred from Figure 1. In particular, any upward

shift in the function h( V ) and any rightward shift in       V# will increase the region of R&D in
standalones relative to conglomerates. In other words, an increase in v1       1   makes R&D easier
to sustain in standalones and an increase in j        j makes it harder to sustain in conglomerates.

This suggests that high-risk-high-payo¤ R&D (with high j          j and high v1     1   is more likely to
be found in standalones than conglomerates.

                                     Insert Figure 1 here


     The role of Venture Capital (VC) in the US is mainly to target these types of innovations.

As we explain in the next section, we believe that in the EU in contrast to the US the role of

VCs is partly …lled by business-groups. The reason is that in the EU the capitalization of R&D

(as measured by ) is lower than in the US. Moreover the stigma of failure               is also higher.

3.1.2. Conglomerate vs. Business Group: internal capital markets, the cost of
       diversion and the intercompany dividend tax and intellectual property rights
       protection

Business groups can provide better protection of intellectual property rights of its business units

than conglomerates but they are exposed to ine¢ cient diversion of funds by their controlling
owners. Suppose that unit A is combined in a group with unit B, and as before suppose that
(WA + WB )       f . Let 'A denote the group’s ownership share in a¢ liate A and suppose that

'A is large enough that the group has adequate incentives to actively monitor the manager of
                                                                             1 'A
a¢ liate A. Recall that for every $1 generated by a¢ liate A a fraction             is diverted to the
                            1 'A
group and a fraction 1             is retained by the a¢ liate. Therefore, if the manager of A is

to e¤ectively undertake an R&D project (i.e. to choose a = 1) his stake must be at least equal

to
                                                 (b + )
                                        =               :
                                              V 1 1 'A

                                                 16
Setting         = 1, its maximum possible value, it is then straighforward to see that a business
                                                      1 'A
group with equilibrium diversion of funds                        is able to foster e¢ cient R&D in unit A as long
                               8
as        V      V given by:
                                                                   (b + )
                                             V =                    1 'A    :
                                                             1
         Since business-groups involve costs which are not incurred by conglomerates they will only
be the chosen organization form for R&D activities when adequate R&D incentives cannot be
                                                  1 'A
provided in conglomerates, or when            <              and       V 2 ( V ; V# ).

         But, even for these parameter values business groups may not be the chosen organizational

form if the tax burden in terms of intercompany dividend taxation exceeds the bene…t from

greater R&D incentives. Intercompany dividend taxes amount to

                                                        1         'A

in our model. Indeed, the reported (and undiverted) revenues by a¢ liate A in the event of a suc-
                                           1 'A                                                       1 'A

tercompany dividend tax of . If the tax rate                      is too high it may not be worthwhile for the

group to fund the R&D project in a¢ liate A.

3.1.3. Business Group vs. Stand-alone: diversion costs and the bene…ts of internal
       capital markets

The main advantage of Business groups over standalones is that they are able to tap the internal
capital of the entire group to fund new R&D projects. Given that business groups also involve
     8
     Note that the manager’s …nancial stake generally has to be higher than for a stand-alone, as a fraction
 1 'A
          of the …nancial value of the innovation is siphoned o¤ by the group. But note also that the higher is
the marginal cost of diversion , the less funds are diverted and therefore the lower is the manager’s …nancial
stake necessary to incentivize him to do research. Similarly and somewhat paradoxically, the higher is 'A –the
group’s stake in a¢ liate A–the lower is the manager’s …nancial stake necessary to incentivize him.
   9
     Intercompany dividend taxes are not the only cost of setting up a partially integrated business group. Other
tax rules, company registration rules, accounting rules concerning the consolidation of accounts and regulations
limiting the ‡exibility of holding company structures may result in other costs. Thus, for example in the US
the Public Utility Holdings Company Act of 1935 has substantially limited the scope for business groups in the
energy sector.

diversion costs, R&D will only be undertaken in a business group if it is not possible to fund
R&D in a standalone using costly external …nancing. This is illustrated in Figure 2 below.

                                     Insert Figure 2 here


   Again, simple comparative statics results can be seen from this …gure: an upward shift in
h( V ) increases the region of R&D in standalones and reduces the region in business groups

(BG). There is R&D in business groups for        V        V , only when it is not feasible in stand-
alones. When there is a rightward shift in     V , R&D in business groups is less likely. Such a

rightward shift may occur if   is lower, so that there is more potential for diversion of funds. We

therefore expect the share of R&D taking place in business-groups across European countries

to be inversely related to the ease of diversion allowed by the corporate legal environment in

each country.

3.1.4. Business Group vs. Stand-alone and Conglomerates: the bene…ts of internal
       capital markets diversion costs and intellectual property rights protection

We can combine the comparison of the three organizational forms into a single …gure (Figure

3) and obtain the following broad comparative statics insights for …xed country parameters

( ; ; ).

   Conglomerates will be a higher fraction of innovating …rms when there is a leftward shift in

 V# . This shift may be due to either a higher       or a lower   . One may expect industries with

many, incremental, innovations to have both higher         (through greater implicit incentives) and

lower      . These industries are therefore more likely to be dominated by conglomerates. Their
ability to quickly identify the relevant innovation and to quickly redeploy assets gives these

organizational forms an edge over business groups and standalones. Moreover, in these indus-

tries conglomerates can credibly o¤er adequate incentives for in house R&D without granting

formal ownership rights to the innovators.
   Business groups are likely to be more prevalent in industries with a slower and more fun-

damental innovation cycle, where       is higher (and      lower). These organizational forms may

                                                 18
not be the most e¢ cient in picking winners but they are able to provide better intellectual
ownership protection. To the extent that it is harder to divert funds ( is higher) we should
also see more innovating business groups, as   V is then lower. But a more e¢ cient VC sector

with lower monitoring costs (m) and/or lower costs of external funds will tend to reduce the
dominance of business groups in these industries.
   In general, we expect industry variation in the share of business groups among innovating

…rms across industries. However, we also expect this variation to be smaller in countries where
the absolute advantage of one organizational form due to the country’s regulations and laws is

stronger.

3.2. Main EU-US comparative predictions

Business groups have one major comparative advantage in continental European countries

relative to the US: the general absence of an intercompany dividend tax. In addition, there is

more of a stigma of failure in these European countries and …nancial markets are also somewhat

less developed. For all these reasons, we expect R&D to be concentrated in higher proportion

in business-groups relative to conglomerates and standalones in continental Europe than in the
US. For the same reasons, we expect to …nd more R&D activity in publicly traded …rms in

the US than in the EU. These simple predictions are indeed borne out in the data as we show

below.


4. Data

Our paper combines data from several sources: (1) ownership data from Amadeus for Euro-

pean …rms and from Icarus for American …rms (both are provided by BvDEP), (2) information

on patents from the United States Patent and Trademark O¢ ce (USPTO) and the European
Patent O¢ ce (EPO), and (3) scienti…c publications from Thomson Web of Knowledge.


                                               19
4.1. Ownership

The Amadeus and Icarus data sets contain detailed information on direct ownership links
between …rms. We sort …rms into four di¤erent categories based on their ownership structure:

(i) standalones, (ii) conglomerates, (iii) wholly-owned business group a¢ liates, and (iv) partly-
owned business-group a¢ liates.
    A …rm is categorized as a standalone if it has a single line of business and no parent

company, and as a conglomerate if it has more than one line of business. Many innovating
…rms in our sample are wholly-owned a¢ liates –they have a parent company that owns 100%

of their shares –and it is not entirely obvious how one should categorize these …rms. In some

cases a wholly-owned a¢ liate is an independent economic unit, but in other cases, it acts

more like a division in terms of its retained pro…ts and IP protection. We distinguish between

the two cases in the following way. We compute the share of assets that are held by the

company at the apex of the organization out of the total assets the organization holds. In case

this share exceeds a high-enough threshold (80%), we assume the organization is centralized

and categorize all of its wholly-owned a¢ liates as divisions.10 If the organization’s assets

are decentralized and spread across many a¢ liates, we assume the wholly-owned a¢ liates are

independent, and classify them under the business group category (a separate category named

wholly-owned business group a¢ liates). In the context of our model there is not much of

a di¤erence between a division of a conglomerate and a wholly-owned subsidiary. There is a
signi…cant di¤erence, however, between a division of a conglomerate and a partly-owned business
group a¢ liate (our fourth category), as the latter has both a parent-company controlling-

shareholder and other minority shareholders. As our model highlights minority shareholders
in business-group a¢ liates play a central legal and governance role in protecting intellectual
property owned by the a¢ liate …rm. Business groups establish an intra-company separation of

ownership and control. This separation puts minority shareholders at risk of expropriation by
  10
     If the apex company reports only consolidated accounts, we infer the unconsolidated assets held by the apex
company by subtracting the aggregated assets of all a¢ liates from the consolidated assets.



                                                      20
majority shareholders, as the literature on business groups has emphasized. However, European
Corporate Group Law imposes strict provisions on the reallocation of resources between group
a¢ liates, which provide an intellectual property protection to researchers in a¢ liate …rms.

These provisions practically make the group a¢ liate independent in terms of its assets, patents,
and retained pro…ts. Unlike for group a¢ liates, researchers in conglomerate divisions do not
have the same legal protection of intellectual property. Conglomerate headquarters can freely

reallocate assets, funds and IP rights across di¤erent units with no legal restriction or threat
of litigation by division stakeholders. Our comparative analysis focuses mostly on the relative

prevalence of partly-owned business group a¢ liates, conglomerates, and standalones.

       To fully characterize the ownership structure of …rms in our sample, we use ownership links

information for private and public American and European …rms from the ownership section

of the 2008 version of Icarus and Amadeus. To ensure that all ownership links truly represent

control, we make the following assumptions:


   1. for private subsidiaries, we keep only links where the shareholder has at least 50% of the

         voting rights, and

   2. for public …rms we keep only links where the shareholder has at least 20% of the voting

         rights. These two assumptions leave us with close to one million ownership links.11

   3. to infer group structure from these links we use the algorithm developed and described in
         Belenzon and Berkovitz (2008a). This algorithm constructs corporate ownership-chains

         and groups together …rms controlled by the same ultimate owner. Appendix A.1 provides

         more information about the ownership algorithm and group construction.
  11
    Erring on the side of caution, we de…ne control of a private …rm as owning at least 50% of the …rm’s voting
rights (excluding non-voting shares). Following previous literature on public …rms (La Porta et al. 1999; Faccio
and Lang, 2002; and others), which have a more dispersed ownership, we set the threshold for control of a public
…rm at 20%. All our results are robust to di¤erent numbers for these thresholds.




                                                      21
4.2. Patents and Scienti…c Publications

To create a …rm-level measure of innovation, we examine patent based indicators of technological
advances by …rms.12 We construct a novel database of European and American …rm patents

by matching all granted patent applications from the USPTO and EPO to the complete set of
…rms in Amadeus and Icarus. Our main source of information for patents granted between 1969
and 2002 is USPTO data as assembled in the NBER patent …le.13 Because our ownership data

is cross-sectional for 2008, we also include recently issued patents so as to address potential
concerns that the ownership structure we observe is not contemporaneous with the generation

of patents in our sample. We update the NBER patent …le for 2007 by extracting directly

from the USPTO website all patents granted between 2003 and 2007, adding about 750.000

patents to the original NBER patent data.14 For the EPO, our main information source is the

2007 publication of the PATSTAT database, which is the standard source for European patent

data and is published by the EPO. This database contains all European patent applications

and granted patents from the beginning of the EPO system in 1978 to 2007. For each USPTO

and EPO patent document we have information on the name of the …rm to which the patent

is assigned as well as the …rm’s address. We match the name and the address …elds from

the patent document to the name and address …elds in Amadeus and Icarus. Appendix A.2.

provides details about the matching procedure.

       Another innovation indicator is scienti…c publications in academic journals (Cockburn and
Henderson, 1998). We also look at scienti…c publications for two main reasons. First, not all
inventions are patentable, and even if they are, patents can vary substantially in quality. Sci-

enti…c publications, on the other hand, are not subject to the patentability selection problem,
  12
     We use patents data to measure innovative activity, because we do not have direct information on R&D
expenditures for private …rms. For a discussion on the use of patents data as a measure of inventive activity,
see Griliches (1990).
  13
     This database is described by Hall, Ja¤e and Trajtenberg (2001) and Ja¤e and Trajtenberg (2002).
  14
     The general pattern of results holds when focusing on recently granted patents. Table A3 reports the
distribution of patents by country and organization form for USPTO patents that were granted between 1996
and 2006. Only 1 percent of the American patents are held by partly-owned a¢ liates, as compared to 12% and
11% of French and Italian patents, respectively.



                                                     22
and they are generally regarded as indicators of high-quality research. Second, while patents
typically represent more directed and incremental research, scienti…c publications tend to be
the result of more basic and risky research (Belenzon and Patacconi, 2009). To measure the

publication activity of our sample …rms, we develop a data set of …rm scienti…c articles. The
world’s largest source of information on scienti…c publications is Thomson’s ISI Web of Knowl-
edge, which includes publication records on hundreds of international journals in the ‘hard’

sciences. Each publication has an address …eld which contains the authors’ a¢ liation. We
match all …rms (patenting and non-patenting) by name to the complete ISI database using the

author a¢ liation name and address …elds.1516


5. Empirical evidence

Several striking …ndings emerge from our analysis, as summarized in tables 1-3. First, while the

overall distribution of patents by ownership structure in the whole sample is 18% standalones,

74% conglomerates, and 8% business-group a¢ liates, in the U.S. this distribution is skewed

towards standalones and conglomerates, 20% and 76% of patents fall in these categories, and

only 4% of innovating …rms are a¢ liated with a business-group. In Europe, on the other hand,

20% of patents are held by business-group a¢ liates. A similar pattern emerges for EPO patents

and scienti…c publications. There is also a substantial variation in organizational form among
European countries. Germany resembles the U.S. in some ways, as 80% of its patents are held
  15
     It is important to note that we make no restrictions on the availability of accounting information for our
sample …rms. That is, every …rm that was matched to the patent or publications data sets is included in our
analysis. While the coverage of accounting information is likely to vary across countries, especially for very
small …rms, the coverage of names and addresses is rather constant across countries regardless of …rm size. The
general pattern of results continues to hold when we exclude …rms for which we have no accounting information,
or …rms with less than 20 employees (this threshold tends to reduce di¤erences in coverage across countries).
  16
     Although we do not exclude …rms from our sample if they do not report …nancial information, some inter-
esting observations emerge from examining only …rms for which …nancial information is available. Standalone
…rms tend to be substantially smaller than conglomerates and partly-owned a¢ liates, while conglomerates and
partly-owned a¢ liates do not di¤er much on size. The average standalone …rm has 177 employees (a median
of 20), and about $100 million in annual sales (a median of $8.3 million). The average conglomerate has
3.650 employees (a median of 136), and $918 million in annual sales (a median of $14.3 million). The average
partly-owned a¢ liate has 2.400 employees (a median of 214), and about $1 billion (a median of $65 million).
Comparing conglomerates to partly owned-a¢ liates, the di¤erent in mean size (annual sales) is not signi…cant
(a t-stat of -0.482).



                                                      23
by conglomerates and only 9% by business-group a¢ liates17 . In contrast, France is heavily
skewed towards business-groups, where only 35% of patents are held by conglomerates.
       Second, the presence of minority shareholders in innovating a¢ liates varies enormously

across countries. While in the U.S. and Great Britain only 1% of innovation takes place
in a¢ liates with minority shareholders, about 20% and 15% of French and Italian patents,
respectively, are concentrated in a¢ liates with minority shareholders.

       Third, the U.S. patents distribution is heavily skewed towards publicly traded …rms (table
2). Indeed, the fraction of patents held by publicly traded U.S. corporations is above 60%, while

this fraction is only about 40% for European …rms. This percentage also varies substantially

across European countries: in Germany, 57% of USPTO patents are assigned to publicly traded

…rms; in contrast, in France and Italy only 9% and 3% respectively of patents are assigned to

public …rms. Moreover, a large share of publicly traded …rms in continental Europe belong to

business groups: in France and Germany this percentage is above 40, while in the U.S. and

Great Britain only 2% of publicly traded …rms belong to a business group. Yet, in the U.S.

there is also a higher percentage of standalone publicly traded …rms compared with continental

Europe and Great Britain.

       Table 3 further highlights the di¤erences in the distribution of patents by ownership type

across countries. Panel A describes the top 20 American innovating …rms. Leading the list

is IBM with more than 43.000 USPTO patents. All American …rms in this table have the
same ownership structure: they are all conglomerates and are publicly traded. Panel B focuses
on British …rms, which resemble the American conglomerate structure.18 Panel C examines
  17
      The German data on conglomerate dominance in R&D, however, is driven mostly by four large …rms:
Siemens, Robert Bosch, Bayer and BASF. These conglomerates hold about 60% of all German patents. Ex-
cluding these organizations, business groups account for 21% of German patents, and conglomerates account
for 52%.
   18
      Ownership structure in Great Britain di¤ers somewhat from that in the U.S. While the parent company of
a British organization is usually publicly traded, all innovative a¢ liates in our sample are private companies. A
good example that illustrates this rather unique structure is GlaxoSmithKline. This pharmaceutical giant has
three of its a¢ liates appearing in the top 20 most innovative …rms (Beecham, Glaxo Group, and SmithKline
Beecham). Each …rm is wholly owned by GlaxoSmithKline holding-company. While the holding company
is publicly traded, none of the innovative a¢ liates are. Glaxo has two headquarters - GlaxoWellcome, and
SmithKline Beecham, and a holding company that wholly-owns the whole organization. We classify Glaxo as a



                                                       24
the leading innovating …rms in France. More than half of these companies are business group
a¢ liates, where seven of these have minority shareholders. Only 40% of the …rms are publicly
traded. For Germany (panel D), 20% of the German …rms are partly-owned business-group

a¢ liates. Lastly, 40% of the Italian …rms are partly-owned business group a¢ liates (panel E),
and only one Italian …rm is publicly-traded.19

    Another interesting observation relates to di¤erences in patent assignment in conglomerates

and business-groups. U.S. conglomerates usually assign patents to headquarters or to special
central intellectual property management divisions, and not to the division where patent was

generated. For example, IBM assigns almost all patents its divisions generate to its New-York

headquarters (as indicated by the assignee name on the patent records)20 . Other examples of

large conglomerates that adopt a central patent management structure include General Electric

(where 21,830 out of 22,348 of GE’s patents are assigned to its Global Research Center division

in New-York), and 3M (where 10,640 out of the 10,806 of 3M’s patents are assigned to its

headquarters, and the remaining patents are assigned to the wholly-owned IP management

subsidiary 3M Innovative Property).

    In contrast, business-groups have a decentralized patent assignment. We hypothesize that

the presence of minority shareholders makes it di¢ cult to simply transfer IP assets from the

inventing to the controlling …rm. In France, for example, L’Oreal holds 3,135 USPTO patents,

out of a total number of 4,882 patents assigned to the whole Nestle group. Assigning L’Oreal’s
patents to Nestle would be considered an expropriation of the rights of minority shareholders of
L’Oreal. The transfer of patents to the controlling entity requires some form of valuation and

compensation of shareholders of the originating …rm. This is likely to be a di¢ cult transaction,
conglomerate although it has two headquarters, and a holding company at the apex.
  19
     In table 3 we do not control for …rm age, which means that older …rms are more likely to appear on
the list of innovative …rms than younger ones. We examine the robustness of our …ndings by looking only at
recent patenting activity. Our list of most innovating …rms does not appear to be very sensitive to …rm age.
For example, the largest patentees in the USPTO between 2002 and 2006 are IBM (16.270 patents), Micron
Technology (8.383 patents), Intel (7.729 patents), Siemens (7.023 patents), and Robert Bosch (5.870 patents).
  20
     Interestingly, the pattern of scienti…c publications assignments is di¤erent than that of patent assignments.
Where all IBM’s patents are assigned to headquarters, academic publications are always assigned to IBM’s
research centers, mostly in Yorktown Heights New-York, Austin Texas and LA.



                                                       25
which is why patents mostly remain with the originating …rm.

   Why do we observe a high concentration of business-groups in Europe, but not in the U.S.?

Based on the history of business-groups in the U.S., a leading explanation in our view is the
tax treatment of intercompany dividends. These have been taxable in the U.S. since the great
depression, but are generally not taxable in continental European countries. Under the U.S.

tax system, dividend income transferred from a subsidiary to the parent company is subject to

a 7.5% tax. A similar tax does not exist in Europe. As described by Morck (2005), the U.S.

tax reform of the 1930’s was a response to the corporate scandals of the late 1920s, and the

Roosevelt administration’s belief that the proliferation of a¢ liate …rms in business-groups have

made these groups very opaque to outsiders, thus creating major governance, tax avoidance,

market power, and political in‡uence problems.

   In addition to introducing the inter-company dividend tax, the U.S. congress also abol-

ished consolidated tax …lings for business-groups, eliminated capital gains taxes on liquidated

controlled subsidiaries, and banned large pyramidal groups for controlling public utility com-

panies (the Public Utilites Holdings Company Act or PUHCA of 1935). These policies impose

a high penalty on organizing innovation in business-groups in the U.S. Thus, one would expect
to observe more business-groups, on average, in Europe, especially in industries where group

governance bene…ts are substantial.

5.1. Comparative analysis

Our theoretical analysis points to several predictions concerning the choice of organizational
form, in terms of both the country’s legal environment and …nancial development, and also the

nature of the innovation cycle in each industry. Hereafter the analysis is mostly based on the
number of EPO patents, where all …ndings are robust to using USPTO patents and scienti…c
publications.

                                               26
5.1.1. Comparison across countries

Three key country variables are likely to a¤ect the choice of organizational form: (i) the capital-
ization value of R&D projects, (ii) the deadweight cost of diverting funds from business-group

a¢ liates, and (iii) the presence or not of intercompany dividend taxes and other regulatory
constraints on the formation of business group. We take as a simple measure of capitalization
of future cash ‡ows the ratio of the country’s stock market capitalization and GDP. Our main

prediction is that innovators are more likely to undertake their R&D project in a standalone
…rm when they are able to raise more funds by capitalizing a bigger fraction of the innovation’s

expected value. Similarly, in countries where the diversion of funds from a¢ liates is harder

we expect to see more R&D activity organized in business group a¢ liates. Finally, countries

with higher intercompany dividend taxes and more regulatory constraints on business group

will have less R&D activity organized in business group a¢ liates.

       Table 4 summarizes general …ndings from the cross-country comparison. We rank countries

according to the three-year average ratio of stock-market traded value to GDP (Beck et al., 2000,

2007). As expected, the share of patents held by public …rms is much higher in the top …nancial

development quartile than in the lowest one (63.1% versus 18.0%). We also expect a higher

prevalence of standalones in countries with higher capitalization ratios. Interestingly however,

our …ndings are only partially consistent with the theory. While, as expected, standalones

are more prevalent than business-groups in the high-capitalization countries, they are also
more prevalent than conglomerates in low-capitalization countries. Business groups are much
more prevalent in low-capitalization countries (20.6% versus 1.6% of the patents are held by

partly-owned a¢ liates in low and high capitalization countries, respectively). This …nding
is consistent with the view that business-groups substitute for missing …nancial markets in
                         21
fostering innovation.
  21
     Note that the reverse causality may also explain this outcome, if the existence of business-groups impedes
the natural development of …nancial markets. Belenzon and Berkovitz (2008b) address this causality issue in
the following way. They analyze a key channel through which …nancial development a¤ects group a¢ liation
- internal capital markets. If …rms form business groups to create a substitute for underdeveloped …nancial
markets, we would observe a higher probability of group a¢ liation among …rms that operate in industries where


                                                      27
    We proxy the cost of diversion of funds from a¢ liates with the anti-directive index developed
by La Porta et al. (1997). This index measures the overall strength of a country’s minority
shareholders protection laws. In countries where these laws are stricter, it is more costly

to divert funds from one a¢ liate to another. Innovation in business groups should be more
prevalent in countries with stronger minority shareholders protection laws. Surprisingly, we do
not …nd support for this prediction. There is in fact a higher share of innovation in business-

groups in countries with relatively weak minority protection laws (9.3% in the lowest minority
protection quartile versus 1.5% in the highest quartile). There appears to be no substantial

variation in the distribution of patents across public and private …rms between countries with

weak and strong minority shareholders protection laws. This is again surprising in light of the

strong correlation between …nancial development and minority shareholders protection laws.

    To understand better what may be driving these results, we turn to a more detailed com-

parison of organizational forms across countries.


                                            Insert Table 4 here



Business groups vs.            Conglomerates In comparing business groups to conglomerates

we consider two factors: anti-group laws, and the strength of minority shareholder protection.

Anti-group laws and weak minority shareholder protection make business groups less attractive.

Anti-group laws are strong in the U.S., but hardly exist in Europe. Thus, other things equal, we
expect more innovation to be concentrated in business groups in Europe than in the U.S. Only

1.5% of U.S. and U.K. patents are held by partly-owned a¢ liates, while in continental Europe

11.2% of the patents are held by partly-owned a¢ liates. This percentage varies signi…cantly
across countries, reaching a high of 25% in France. This pattern is consistent with the theory.

Computing the ratio between patents held by partly-owned a¢ liates and conglomerates, leads to
the demand for external capital is higher, especially in countries with less developed …nancial institutions. Thus,
their econometric approach is to examine whether the di¤erence in the percentage of group a¢ liates between
industries with high and low external dependence becomes more pronounces as the country …nancial development
deteriorates. The evidence suggests that business-groups indeed substitute missing …nancial institutions.


                                                        28
a similar conclusion. In France 11.550 patents are held by a¢ liates with minority shareholders,
and 20.676 patents are held by conglomerates22 . The ratio between the number of partly-
owned a¢ liate and conglomerate patents for France is 0.56 (11.550/20.676), for Italy 0.62

(2.320/3.763), for Germany 0.0823 (10.949/135.220), for Great Britain 0.02 (631/30.809), and
for the U.S. 0.02 (3.417/198.006). These …gures imply that relative to conglomerates, partly-
owned a¢ liates are more prevalent in France and Italy than in the U.S., Great Britain, and

Germany.
       There is substantial variation in the anti-directive index across countries. For France, the

anti-directive index is 3, as compared to 1 for Germany. Our theoretical analysis predicts a

higher share of innovation in business groups in France than in Germany. The …ndings support

this prediction (a ratio of 0.56 for France versus a ratio of 0.08 for Germany). Yet, when we

compare Great Britain to Germany, the opposite ranking emerges: in Britain only 631 patents

are held by partly-owned a¢ liates, as compared to about 30.809 patents by conglomerates.

Indeed, minority shareholders in a¢ liates are very rare in Britain, which is a puzzle given that

Britain has unusually strong minority shareholder protections.


Standalones vs. conglomerates Standalones should be more prevalent than conglomerates

in countries with more developed …nancial markets (R&D capitalization value is higher). To

examine the prevalence of standalones relative to conglomerates we compute the ratio of the

number of patents held by standalones and the number of patents held by conglomerates. Our

…ndings are mixed. In the U.S., 23.970 patents are held by standalones, and 198.006 patents are
held by conglomerates. The standalones-conglomerates ratio, thus, is 0.12. For Great Britain,

France and Germany, the ratio is 0.17, 0.11, and 0.20, respectively. Compared to the U.S.,

standalones are relatively more prevalent than conglomerates in Great Britain and Germany,

     For business-groups, we focus only on a¢ liates with minority shareholders, because anti-group and minority-
shareholder protection laws typically do not apply to wholly-owned a¢ liates. When including also wholly-owned
a¢ liates, 50% of the French patents are held by business-groups.
  23
     The top four German conglomerates hold 94.180 patents in the EPO. Excluding these companies raises the
ratio between business group and conglomerate patents to 0.27.



                                                       29
and have a similar prevalence in France. For smaller countries in our sample, the ranking
is also unclear: Switzerland has a very high market capitalization, especially as compared
to the Netherlands. The standalones-conglomerates ratio in Switzerland, is 0.16, and in the

Netherlands it is 0.03. This ranking is consistent with our theoretical analysis, but when we
compare the Netherlands to France or Germany, which by our measure have lower stock-market
capitalizations, the …ndings become inconsistent with our theory.


Business groups vs.        Standalones Standalones are likely to represent a bigger share

of R&D than business-groups in countries where anti-group laws are strong and minority-

shareholder protection is weak. As the U.S. has both more restrictive anti-group laws and

stronger minority-shareholder protections than European countries, it is not entirely clear how

the U.S. would compare with Europe in terms of the relative shares of R&D in standalones

and business groups. However, as the tax costs of running a business-group are so high in the

U.S. relative to Europe, we expect innovating standalones to be more prevalent in the U.S.

than in Europe. Our evidence supports this prediction. The ratio between the number of

patents held by partly-owned business group a¢ liates and standalones in the U.S. is 0.14, and

is 0.19 in Europe. This ratio varies considerably across European countries: in Great Britain

the a¢ liates-standalones ratio is 0.12, in Germany is 0.41, and in France is 5.07.
   As for the e¤ects of minority-shareholder protections, our evidence is again mixed. While the

Germany-France comparison is consistent with our analysis, as minority-shareholder protections
are higher in France (at least as re‡ected by the anti-directive index), the comparison with Great
Britain is not. The ratio between business group and standalone patents in Great Britain is

much lower than in Germany and France, again despite the fact that minority-shareholder
protections in Great Britain are substantially higher.
   What could explain these mixed results on organizational form and country conditions?

There are three possibilities: (i) country conditions may be endogenously a¤ected by owner-
ship structure; (ii) unobserved and observed country heterogeneity make it hard to obtain a


                                               30
clean identi…cation, and; (iii) di¤erent industry specialization across countries may a¤ect the
aggregate distribution of organizational forms. To examine in greater depth the choice of orga-
nizational form across industries, we turn next to an analysis of organizational variation across

industries.

5.1.2. Comparing across industries

In industries with rapid, incremental, innovations the ability of conglomerate …rms to quickly
identify the relevant innovations and to quickly redeploy assets may give it an edge over business
groups. In contrast, in industries with a slower and more fundamental innovation cycle, the

intellectual protection of the innovator may be of greater importance, giving business groups

an edge over conglomerates. To explore these predictions, we look at four di¤erent industries:

pharmaceuticals and biotechnology as examples of industries with a long innovation cycle,

and computer hardware and telecommunications as examples of industries with rapid and

incremental innovations. Table 5 summarizes the main …ndings for EPO patents.


Business groups vs. Conglomerates By our theoretical analysis, innovation ought to

be more prevalent in a partly-owned business group a¢ liates than in a conglomerate division

in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industries, but not in the computer hardware and

telecommunications sectors. Our …ndings con…rm this prediction. In pharmaceuticals and

biotechnology the ratio between the number of business group patents and conglomerate patents
is 0.07, and 0.21, respectively24 , where in computer hardware and telecommunications the
respective ratios are substantially lower at 0.02 and 0.03.25

       Another interesting ranking emerges when comparing the U.S. to Europe. In the U.S., the
patent ratio of business-group-to-conglomerate patents for both pharmaceuticals and biotech-
  24
     When including patents by wholly-owned business group a¢ liates, the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology
ratios are 0.13 and 0.28.
  25
     When including patents by wholly-owned business group a¢ liates, the computer hardware and telecom-
munications ratios are 0.06 (354/5.876) and 0.11 (3.667/34.286). It is interesting to note that the majority
of business group patents are held by wholly-owned a¢ liates, especially in telecommunications, and not in
partly-owned a¢ liates, as in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.



                                                    31
nology is 0.01. In Europe, on the other hand, these …gures are much higher at 0.11 and 0.35,
respectively. The prevalence of business groups in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology is, thus,
strongly driven by European …rms. For computer hardware and telecommunications the re-

spective ratios are very small in both the U.S. and Europe, indicating that innovation activity
in partly-owned a¢ liates is very small.


Standalones vs. Conglomerates Standalones resemble partly-owned a¢ liates in terms of
their governance structure, and thus should have the same relative advantages over conglomer-

ates in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, but less so in computer hardware and telecommuni-

cations. Thus, the relative prevalence of standalones should be similar to that of partly-owned

a¢ liates. Our …ndings support this prediction. In pharmaceuticals and biotechnology the ratios

between standalone and conglomerate patents are 0.20 and 0.32, respectively, where in com-

puter hardware and telecommunications these ratios are substantially lower at 0.11 and 0.07.

Again, in industries where high-powered incentives are of greater importance, partly-owned af-

…liates are more prevalent. Standalones seem to be more prevalent in the U.S. than in Europe,

especially in biotechnology. This …nding is consistent with our theory, which predicts a higher

prevalence of standalones in countries where R&D capitalization value is higher, especially in

industries where the governance bene…ts of standalones are more pronounced.


Business groups vs. Standalones Partly-owned a¢ liates and standalones have a similar
governance structure. However, partly-owned a¢ liates can bene…t from the business-group

internal capital market. On the other hand, standalones face smaller diversion costs than
a business-group a¢ liate. These considerations imply that we would expect partly-owned
a¢ liates to be more prevalent than standalones in industries where winner-picking is more

important, especially in countries that do not have anti-group laws, and where minority pro-
tection is strong. Our …ndings, however, do not support this prediction: business-groups are
more prevalent as compared to standalones in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, than in com-



                                              32
puter hardware and telecommunications26 . A potential explanation is related to fund raising.
Standalones, especially those that operate in countries with less developed …nancial markets,
may …nd it easier to …nance projects that have a shorter development cycle. In this respect,

business-groups may be able to provide more stable …nancing for longer term and riskier re-
search projects.

5.2. Patent quality

So far our analysis focused on the number of patents. However, it is well recognized that the

distribution of patent quality is highly skewed, where a small portion of patents receive many

citations, and the majority of patents receive only few or no citations at all. Using the number

of citations a patent receives as our main quality indicator, table 6 compares the quality of

conglomerate and partly-owned a¢ liate patents (for brevity, we do not discuss the respective

comparison for patents by standalones). We control for cohort and technology area e¤ects using

the weighting scheme proposed by Trajtenberg (1990). For each patent, we divide the number

of citations it receives by the average number of citations received by all patents granted at the

same year and classi…ed under the same three-digit technology code.
       Panel A reports the comparison analysis for U.S. and Great Britain patents. Conglomerate

patents seem to be of higher quality than business group patents: the average conglomerate

patent receives 1.23 (weighted) citations, as compared to a business group patent that receives
on average 1.12 citations (the di¤erence in means is signi…cant at the 1% level). We also examine

the case of self-citations; where an inventor cites one of its predecessor patents. Self-citations

are commonly regarded as measures of cumulative innovation, and are typically associated
with greater private value (Hall et al., 2005). Conglomerate patents receive signi…cantly more

self-citations than business group patents (1.57 versus 0.98). Additional indicators of patent
  26
    The ratios between partly-owned a¢ liate and standalone patents are 0.37 and 0.66 in pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology, and 0.24 and 0.42 in computer hardware and telecommunications, respectively.


                                                    33
importance are generality and originality. These indicators measure the extent the knowledge
embodied in a patent ‘spills-over’to more technology areas (generality), or builds on knowledge
from many di¤erent technology …elds (originality).27 With respect to patent generality and

originality, conglomerates also seem to dominate. The average generality (originality) value
for a conglomerate patent is 0.278 (0.274), as compared to 0.266 (0.264) for a business group
patent (the di¤erence in means is signi…cant at the 1% level).

       We conduct the same comparison for continental European countries (panel B). Interest-
ingly, the opposite pattern of results emerges. Business group patents tend to be of higher

quality and concern more basic research than conglomerate patents. The average conglomerate

patent receives 0.71 citations, as compared to a business group patent that receives on average

0.88 citations (the di¤erence in means is signi…cant at the 1% level). Business group patents

are also more general and original: the average generality (originality) value for a conglomerate

patent is 0.231 (0.226), as compared to 0.264 (0.239) for a business group patent (the di¤erence

is signi…cant at the 1% level).


                                           Insert Table 6 here


5.3. Coasian or Entrenched organizational forms?

A basic premise of our analysis is a Coasian perspective on …rm organization, which is to say
that R&D intensive …rms tend to choose the corporate form that is best suited for fostering

innovative activities. Thus, we expect a corporate form that is particularly well suited for
  27
     We follow Trajtenberg et. al. (1997), and compute patent generality as the Her…ndahl-Hirschman Index
of the concentration of the citations a patent receives across three-digit technology …elds. The generality index
for patent i, dented by Gi , is:

                                                      X     CRij
                                                                   2
                                            Gi = 1
                                                       j
                                                            CRi

  Where, j denotes three-digit technology …elds, CRij is the number of citations received by patent i from
patents in technology …eld j; and CRi is the total number of citations received by patent i. For patent
originality, we use the same formulation, but for the distribution of the number of citations the patent makes
across technology …elds.




                                                       34
innovative …rms to be more prevalent among these …rms in a given industry than among non-
innovating …rms. The alternative view in the literature is that organization form is chosen by
entrenched managers, or controlling shareholders, to suit their best interests at the expense of

minority shareholders and overall …rm e¢ ciency. By this latter view it is not obvious that one
should see any systematic di¤erence in organization form in a given industry across innovative
and non-innovative …rms. In this section we explore the extent to which organization form di¤ers

between innovative and non-innovative …rms. Essentially, we examine whether innovative …rms
are disproportionately represented in a given organization category, using aggregated sales in

the same category as a benchmark. We say that patents are disproportionately represented in

one category over another, if the patent ratio of the two categories is higher than the sale ratio

of the same categories. For this comparison our sample includes close to 3.5 million …rms with

sales information.

       Table 7 summarizes the main …ndings. First, patents are disproportionately concentrated

in partly-owned a¢ liates relative to standalones, with patent and sales ratios of 0.57 and

0.33, respectively. This pattern is driven mostly by …rms in continental Europe, where the

patent and sale ratios are 0.84 and 0.56. In the U.S. and Great Britain, on the other hand,

these ratios are virtually identical at 0.14 and 0.12. Second, patents are disproportionately

concentrated in conglomerates relative to partly-owned a¢ liates (patent and sale ratios of

0.09 and 0.17). This pattern is much stronger in continental Europe, where the patent and
sale ratios are 0.17 and 0.42, respectively. In the U.S., these ratios are identical at 0.02.
Third, organization form varies substantially across industries. As in the previous section,

we focus on pharmaceuticals and biotechnology (panel B)28 , and telecommunications (panel
C). Consistent with the Coasian perspective, in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, innovation
is disproportionately concentrated in partly-owned a¢ liates relative to conglomerates (patent
  28
     We combine pharmaceuticals and biotechnology because many companies that operate in pharmaceuticals
also operate biotechnology. Unlike patents, where we can classify each patent to a technology …eld according to
its IPC code, it is much more di¢ cult to breakdown sales by industries, especially in conglomerates that usually
report consolidated accounts.




                                                       35
and sale ratios of 0.11 and 0.06). Yet again, this pattern is driven by European …rms. In the
U.S. alone, the patent and sale ratios are identical (0.01), while in Europe the patents ratio is
substantially higher than the sales ratio (0.18 versus 0.13). In telecommunications (panel C), on

the other hand, business-group patents are under-represented relative to sales in Europe (patent
and sale ratios of 0.04 and 0.08, respectively), and in the U.S., the patent and sale ratios are
e¤ectively zero. Finding disproportionately more conglomerate patents in telecommunications

is also consistent with the Coasian perspective, as we expect that in this industry conglomerates
are more conductive to R&D than business-groups.

5.4. Robustness

We conduct several robustness tests to check the sensitivity of our …ndings, focusing mostly

on the ownership algorithm, and organization form de…nitions. To ensure ownership shares

represent control, we keep only links where the shareholder has at least 50% of the voting rights

for private …rms, and 20% of the voting rights for public …rms. We check the sensitivity of our

results by experimenting with di¤erent control thresholds. The same pattern of results continue

to hold for thresholds of 40% and 25% for private …rms, and 10% for public …rms. Furthermore,

we construct business group structures using the algorithm developed by Almeida, Yong Park,
Subrahmanyam, and Wolfenzon, 2007 (AYPSW). Due to computational power constraints we

are not able to run their algorithm on our full set of …rms. While restricting the ownership
sample is problematic, the general pattern that emerges highly resembles the one generated
by our own algorithm. The advantage of AYPSW over our algorithm is that it better deals

with cases of cross-holdings (for example, …rm A control 50% of the voting rights of …rm B,
and …rm B controls 50% of the voting rights of …rm A).29 However, while cross-holdings are
prevalent in East-Asian countries, where the AYPSW algorithm was …rst implemented, we …nd
  29
    The main advantage of our algorithm over AYPSW is that it is better designed to e¢ ciently handle large
datasets on ownership ties.


                                                    36
that cross-holdings are very rare in Europe. Actually, only 0.01% of the ownership chains our
algorithm generates are associated with some form of cross-holdings.
   We distinguish between standalones and conglomerates by determining whether a …rm is

specialized or diversi…ed. We assume a …rm is diversi…ed if it operates in at least two di¤erent
two-digit industry SIC. The same pattern of results continue to hold when we de…ne diversi-
…cation at the one-digit SIC level. Moreover, we supplement the industry information with

data on the …rm patenting distribution across technology …elds. We check whether diversi…ed
…rms also tend to patent in more than one technology areas. We …nd that about 80% of the

conglomerates in our sample patent in more than one two-digit IPC …elds. The general pattern

of results continue to hold when we use the IPC …elds in de…ning conglomerates.

   We also distinguish between patents that were acquired by a business group and patents

that were generated internally. We use Zephyr to track changes in ownership structure through

M&As (table A1). We …nd that, on average, 9% of the …rms joined a business group between

1997 and 2007, where the remaining 91% are associated with an organic business group ex-

pansion. Our main …ndings continue to hold also when excluding patents that were acquired

through M&A.


6. Conclusion

This paper examines the relation between organization form and innovation for a cross-section

of private and publicly traded innovating …rms in the U.S. and 15 European countries. Several
new …ndings emerge from our analysis. First, while most innovating …rms in the U.S. are
publicly traded conglomerates, a substantial fraction of innovation is concentrated in private

…rms and in business groups in continental European countries. Second, there is a substantial
variation in organization form across industries. Business groups tend to be concentrated in
industries where innovation takes time, is highly uncertain, and where the intellectual protection

of the innovator may be of paramount importance. On the other hand, conglomerates are more
prevalent in industries with rapid, incremental, innovation where the ability of conglomerates


                                               37
to promptly identify the relevant innovation and to quickly redeploy assets may give it an edge
over business groups. Third, our …ndings are consistent with a Coasian view of how …rms
organize themselves: namely that R&D intensive …rms tend to choose the corporate form most

conducive to innovation. This is especially true in Europe, where there are fewer regulatory
hurdles to the formation of business groups and hybrid corporate forms. It is not the case in the
U.S., where tax and regulatory hurdles essentially eliminate any gains from forming business

groups, and where a highly visible VC and private equity sector provides an alternative to
business-group …nancing of R&D.

This section details the construction and output of our newly developed algorithm. The pur-
pose of the algorithm is to determine the structure of European business-groups based on the
Amadeus ownership database. The algorithm consists of two parts: a control-chain genera-
tor that constructs the ownership and control links between di¤erent European …rms, and a
name matching procedure that groups together …rms controlled by the same ultimate owner.
Our source of information is the ownership sections of the 2008 versions of Amadeus (for the
European subsidiaries) and Icarus (for the American subsidiaries).

A.1.1. The Control chain generator
The Amadeus ownership database includes detailed information on the percentage of owner-
ship between European corporate shareholders and their European subsidiaries. The data span
virtually all European countries (including Eastern Europe). Icarus provides similar informa-
tion for the United States. We develop an ownership algorithm that constructs the internal
structure of business-groups based on these inter-company ownership links. The main bene…ts
of the algorithm are: (i) it constructs the ownership chains without relying on the (often miss-
ing) information on whether an ownership link is direct or indirect,30 (ii) it completes missing
ownership links by transitivity, (iii) it identi…es cross-holdings, and (iv) it handles complex
ownership structures. These features allow us to develop robust measures of business-group
characteristics (such as group size).
    We include all ownership links from the Amadeus ownership database that represent a
control relation. For this, we make the following assumptions: for private subsidiaries, a share-
holder exerts control if its direct percentage of ownership is larger than 50. For public …rms,
the percentage of direct ownership has to be larger than 20 to represent a control relation (since
ownership is typically less concentrated in public …rms than in private …rms).31
    There are about 1 million direct ownership links that satisfy our control assumptions, where
291.974 shareholders control 789.557 subsidiaries. The average percentage of direct ownership is
91 with a median of 100 (59 percent of the ownership links represent a wholly-owned relation).
There are 1.369 public subsidiaries. For these public subsidiaries, the average percentage of
direct ownership is 53 with a median of 48. The input …le of direct ownership links generates
718.092 ownership chains. 69 percent of the chains include only two …rms (13 percent of the
chains include more than 3 …rms and 3 percent of the chains include more than 5 …rms). 63
percent of the chains are wholly-owned (for all levels in the chain). For chains where the apex in
an American or British …rms, 83 percent are wholly-owned, for German apex …rms, 60 percent
of the chains are wholly-owned, where for French apex …rms, only 25 percent are wholly-owned.
  30
     Indirect ownership links are very common in our data. Suppose, for example, that …rm A owns 60% of the
shares of B and that B owns 60% of the shares of C. In this case, …rm A has a direct ownership of 60% in B
and an indirect ownership of 36% in C.
  31
     Similar assumption was made by La Porta et al. (1999) and Faccio and Lang (2002).




                                                    43
A.1.2. Description of the algorithm
The algorithm follows three steps: (i) completes missing ownership links, (ii) generates lists
of all subsidiaries and parents for each company, and (iii) constructs the ownership chains
bottom-up.32 To illustrate our methodology, it would be useful to consider the following exam-
ple. Suppose Figure A.1 correctly describes the ownership structure of a business-group. The
ultimate owner (for example, a family) at the apex of the group controls 7 public and private
…rms. Amadeus provides detailed data on direct ownership links. Thus, our raw data include
the links A ! D, B ! F , C ! G, and D ! E. Note that the percentage of ownership for
the link C ! G has to be larger than 20 (because …rm G is public), where for the percentage
of ownership for all other links has to be larger than 50 (because the other subsidiaries are
private). Because there is no information about indirect ownership links, the link A ! E is
missing from the raw data. The …rst step of the algorithm is to complete missing links. As
we observe the ownership relations A ! D and D ! E, our algorithm infers the ownership
relation A ! E. Note that at this stage of the algorithm we still do not know whether the
ownership relation is direct or indirect (and if it is indirect, how many layers separate …rm E
from …rm A). The second step of the algorithm is to construct two lists for each …rm: share-
holders and subsidiaries. This step saves valuable running time, which is especially important
when dealing with large scale ownership data. The following table is generated:

                          Firm Shareholder Subsidiary
                           A        -        D, E
                           B        -          F
                           C        -          G
                           D       A           E
                           E      A, D         -
                           F       B           -
                           G       C           -

    Note that from step 1, we already know that …rm A is a shareholder of …rm E. Also, because
we assume the ultimate owner is a family, …rms A, B, and C have no corporate (European)
shareholder. The third and …nal step of the algorithm is to construct the structure of the group
based on the above ownership relations. Because of the missing links problem, our algorithm
does not assume that an ownership relation is direct; the only input the algorithm receives is
the existence of the ownership relation. We start with a …rm that has no subsidiaries from the
list generated in step 2. We illustrate the procedure for …rm E, which is the most interesting
in this example. Firm E is placed at the bottom of the ownership chain. Next, we move to
the shareholder list of …rm E. It includes …rms A and D. Starting arbitrary with A, place A
above E. Proceeding to …rm D, there are three possibilities for its location: (i) D is above
E and above A; (ii) D is above E, but below A; (iii) D is above E, but not below neither
above A (di¤erent ownership chain). For (i) to be the right structure, D has to appear in the
shareholder list of …rm A. From step 2, we rule this out. For (ii) to be the right structure,
D has to appear on the subsidiary list of …rm A. From step 2, this holds. Finally, for (iii) to
  32
    Unlike business groups in East Asia (such as the Japanese keiretsu), most European business groups are
organized in pyramids (Figure A.1). This means that interlocking shareholdings are not common and, therefore,
ownership chains can be constructed bottom-up.


                                                     44
be the right structure, A cannot appear on either the shareholder or subsidiary lists of …rm
D. From step 2, this is ruled out. At the end of this procedure, we have determined for each
ownership chain the highest shareholder …rm - we call this …rm the leading shareholder.
    Our algorithm fails in the case of cross-holdings. A cross-holding is an ownership structure
where a shareholder is also a subsidiary of its own subsidiary. For example, suppose we also
observe the ownership link E ! A. Our ordering procedure will not work because there is no
starting point: no …rm is placed at the bottom of the business-group and, therefore, the leading
shareholder cannot be determined.33 Yet, we observe only few cases of cross-holdings in the
data (0.5 percent of the ownership links are associated with at least one cross-holding).

A.1.3. Ultimate owner name matching
The next part of our algorithm groups …rms across ownership chains based on the name of
the ultimate owners. The name matching process deals with two main issues. First, ultimate
owner names are not standardized, i.e., the same name can be spelled di¤erently across sub-
sidiaries. Second, common names, especially for family members, may lead to ‘over-grouping’.
We deal with theses issues as following. First, we develop a name standardization procedure
that harmonizes the di¤erent string patterns in our data. Second, to ensure families are indeed
wealthy, we search for publicly available information, such as Forbes and The Economist, on
the largest 500 wealthiest families in our sample (for example, De Rotchild family, Nasi-Agnelli
family). For the other individual ultimate owners in our sample, we compute the frequency of
the appearance of the name in the ultimate owner population. In case this frequency is higher
  33
   A less ‘severe’case of cross-holding is where we observe E ! D. In this case, our algorithm constructs two
ownership chains: A ! D ! E and A ! D ! E, where both correctly characterize the ownership structure.
The leading shareholder is …rm A in both cases, which allows us to correctly group …rms into business groups.


                                                     45
than the median frequency, we assume the common name problem and do not include that ul-
timate owner in our sample. Our control assumptions may lead to cases where we miss-classify
…rms to groups. For example, suppose an ultimate owner controls 33 percent of …rm C, and
…rms A and B control each 33 percent of …rm C. Assuming …rm C is private, our algorithm will
not assign …rm C to a group. The ultimate owner fully controls …rm C (via its control of …rms
A and B), thus …rm C should be part of the group. To deal with this situation we take the
following step. For …rms that were not assigned to groups we extract a list of their immediate
shareholders (corporate and individuals). For each shareholder we already know whether it
belongs to a group and its ultimate owner (as indicated by the ownership algorithm). Then,
we examine whether an ultimate owner controls more than 50 percent of the stocks for private
…rms and more than 20 percent of the stocks for public …rms. In case the aggregated holding
of the ultimate owner meets these threshold, we assign the a¢ liate to the group.

A.2. Matching patent data
A.2.1. European Patent O¢ ce (EPO)
The matching between EPO patent applicants and Amadeus …rms has been a collaborative
project with the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and the Centre for Economic Performance
(CEP). This section is a brief summary of the matching procedure.
    Our main information source on patents is the 2007 publication of the PATSTAT database,
which is the standard source for European patent data. This database contains all bibliographic
data (including citations) on all European patent applications and granted patents, from the
beginning of the EPO system in 1979 to the end of 2007.
    We match the name of each EPO applicant listed on the patent document to the full name
of a …rm listed in Amadeus (about 8 million names). Since we are interested only in matching
patent applicants to …rms, we exclude applicant names that fall into the following categories:
government agencies, universities, and individuals. We identify government agencies and uni-
versities by searching for a set of identifying strings in their name. We identify individuals as
patents where the assignee and the inventor name strings are identical.
    The matching procedure follows two main steps. (i) Standardizing names of patent ap-
plicants. This involves replacing commonly used strings which symbolize the same thing, for
example “Ltd.”and “Limited”in the UK. We remove spaces between characters and transform
all letters to capital letters. As an example, the name “British Nuclear Fuels Public Limited
Company”becomes “BRITISHNUCLEARFUELSPLC”. (ii) Name matching: match the stan-
dard names of the patent applicants with Amadeus …rms. If there is no match, then try to
match to the old …rm name available in Amadeus. We need to confront a number of issues.
First, in any given year, the Amadeus database excludes the names of …rms that have not
…led …nancial reports for four consecutive years (e.g. M&A, default). We deal with this issue
in several ways. First, we use information from historical versions of the Amadeus database
(1995-2006) on names and name changes. Second, even though Amadeus contains a unique
…rm identi…er (BVD ID number), there are cases in which …rms with identical names have
di¤erent BVD numbers. In these cases, we use other variables for identi…cation, for exam-
ple: address (ZIP code), Date of incorporation (whether consistent with the patent application
date), and more. Finally, we manually match most of the remaining corporate patents to the
list of Amadeus …rms.


                                               46
    Some groups assign many of their patents to a single subsidiary. This subsidiary typically
does not innovate and its main purpose is to manage the intellectual property assets of the
group. We identify such …rms using their SIC classi…cation. We use information on the location
of the patent inventors to match the centrally-assigned patents to innovative a¢ liates. The
secondary assignment of these patents is based on a match between the address of the patent
inventor and the group a¢ liates. In case the address of the inventor matches multiple group
a¢ liates we make the following assumption: if only one of the a¢ liates innovates (as indicated
by the number of patents this a¢ liate already has), assign the patent to this innovative a¢ liate.
If more than one of the matched a¢ liates innovates, keep the original central assignment of
the patent. The secondary matching procedure increases the number of innovative a¢ liates by
about 250 …rms.

A.2.2. United States Patents and Trademarks O¢ ce (USPTO)
The procedure described above matches European …rms to patents registered with the EPO.
Yet, some European …rms register patents only with the USPTO, without applying to the
EPO. In order to identify the European …rms that only apply to the USPTO, we match the
complete set of Amadeus …rms to the name of the patent applicants from the USPTO. The
most updated patent database for the USPTO is the 2002 version of the NBER patents and
citations data archive. Because this database covers patent information only up to 2002 and our
accounting data go up to 2007, we updated the patent data …le by extracting all information
about patents granted between 2002 and 2007 directly from the USPTO website.34 Having
updated the USPTO patent database, we follow the matching procedure described above to
create the matched USPTO patent data for the Amadeus …rms.

A.3. Matching scienti…c publications
The largest database on scienti…c publications is the ISI Web of Knowledge (WoK) by Thomson.
This includes millions of records on publications in academic journals. The data is divided to
three main categories based on the publication type: hard sciences, social sciences, and arts
and humanities. Because we are interested in capturing investment in scienti…c research, we
focus only on the hard sciences section of WoK. This section includes publication records over
the period 1970-2007. The address …eld on each record indicates the a¢ liation of the authors
of the publication. This a¢ liation is typically either a research institution or a …rm. We use
the name appearing in this …eld and match it to the complete list of Amadeus …rms. We follow
the same matching procedure as described above for the EPO and USPTO patent matching.
Articles may have more than one author (the median number of authors per article is 2). In
this case, the address …eld would include multiple a¢ liations. We assign a scienti…c publication
to a speci…c …rm if the name of this …rm appears at least once in the address …eld of the
article. This procedure means that a single article can be assigned to more than one …rm, but
a …rm cannot be assigned more than once to the same article. For each article, we also extract
information on the number of times it was cited, the journal in which it was published, and the
year of publication. Information about the importance of journals is taken from the Journal
Citations Report index (JCR). Finally, European research institutions can be incorporated,
thus, they appear in Amadeus as potential …rms to be matched. To screen out such …rms,

                                                  47
we follow two steps. First, as for patent matching, we drop Amadeus names that include
strings that are associated with research institutions (such as, UNIVERSITY, RESEARCH,
INSTITUTION, etc.). Second, we manually examine the websites of …rms that have a large
number of publications but appear as small …rms in terms of their sales and number of patents.
For these …rms, we check whether their primary activity is research. In case the primary activity
is research, we exclude them from our matched sample.

A.4. Industry patent classi…cation
Table 7 summarizes the distribution of patents across selected industries. The classi…cation
of patents to these industries is based on the patent International Patent Classi…cation, as
following. Pharmaceuticals includes IPCs A61 (excluding A61B, A61K 38, A61K 39, and
A61K 48). Biotechnology includes IPCs A01H 1/00, A01H 4/00, A61K 38/00, A61K 39/00,
A61K 48/00, C02F 3/34, C07G 11/00, C07G 13/00, C07G 15/00, C07K 4/00, C07K 14/00,
C07K 16/00, C07K 17/00, C07K 19/00, C12M, C12N, C12P, C12Q, C12S, G01N 27/327, G01N
33/53, G01N 33/54, G01N 33/55, G01N 33/57, G01N 33/68, G01N 33/74, G01N 33/76, G01N
33/78, G01N 33/88, and G01N 33/92. Computer Hardware includes G06F 13/12, G11C, G065
15, and H01L. Telecommunications includes H04B, H04L, H04N, H04M, H04K, H04J, and
H04H.

Notes: This table examines the distribution of organizational form by country financial and legal conditions. For Market Capitalization, We rank
countries according to the three-year average ratio of stock-market traded value to GDP, based on Beck et al. (2000, 2007). We use the anti-
directive index developed by La Porta et al. (1997) to rank countries according to the strength of minority shareholders protection. The business-
group category includes only partly-owned affiliates.

Notes: This table reports mean comparison tests for measures of patent quality between conglomerates and partly-owned business group affiliates. The
unit of observation is patents from the USPTO over the period 1969-2007. Self citations are citations where the citing firm cites one of its predecessor
patents. Generality is defined as one minus the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of the concentration of the citations a patent receives across three-digit
technology fields. Originality is defined as one minus the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of the concentration of the citations a patent receives across three-
digit technology fields. *** indicates that the difference in means in significant at the one percent level.
