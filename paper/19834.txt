How Constraining Are Limits to Arbitrage? Evidence from a Recent Financial Innovation

                                              ABSTRACT

Limits to arbitrage play a central role in behavioral finance. They are thought to interfere with arbitrage
processes so that security prices can deviate from true values for extended periods of time. We describe
a recent financial innovation that allows limits to arbitrage to be sidestepped, and overvaluation thereby
to be corrected, even in settings characterized by extreme costs of information discovery and severe
short-sale constraints. We report evidence of shallow-pocketed “arbitrageurs” expending considerable
resources to identify overvalued companies and profitably correcting overpricing. The innovation
that allows the arbitrageurs to sidestep limits to arbitrage involves credibly revealing their information
to the market, in an effort to induce long investors to sell so that prices fall. This simple but apparently
effective way around the limits suggests that limits to arbitrage may not always be as constraining
as sometimes assumed.

Those who believe that stock prices can deviate from true values for extended periods of time

routinely appeal to the notion of “limits to arbitrage”. After all, as Friedman (1953) argues,

without constraints on arbitrage, rational investors should sell stocks that are overvalued, or buy

those that are undervalued, until prices return to fundamentals. However, real-world arbitrage is

both risky and costly, which introduces frictions in the arbitrage process that can cause

mispricing to persist (Harrison and Kreps (1978)). Without these frictions, behavioral finance

would not be possible (Brav, Heaton, and Rosenberg (2004)).

   In their survey of behavioral finance, Barberis and Thaler (2003) list three sources of

frictions which contribute to limits to arbitrage:

1. Fundamental risk: in the absence of perfect substitutes for the mispriced security, riskfree

   portfolios cannot be constructed and so arbitrage is risky;

2. Implementation costs (D’Avolio (2002), Gromb and Vayanos (2002), Lamont and Thaler

   (2003), Jones and Lamont (2002), Nagel (2005), and others): these include the costs of

   discovering a mispriced security, the costs of the resources needed to exploit a mispricing,

   transactions costs (commissions, bid-ask spreads, price impact), and short-sale constraints

   (margin requirements, lending fees, legal constraints preventing some investors from going

   short or from lending their stock to others);

3. Noise trader risk (DeLong et al. (1990)): in the short run, mispricing could get worse, forcing

   early liquidation of a position at a loss. As Shleifer and Vishny (1997) note, this can make it

   hard for arbitrageurs to persuade investors to finance their bets against mispricing: whenever

   a bet loses money, investors cannot tell whether the arbitrageur was wrong or whether prices

   moved even further from fundamentals. This fundamental uncertainty limits the capital

   available to arbitrageurs.

In this paper, we ask a simple question: How constraining are limits to arbitrage empirically? We

                                                                                                      1
address this question by studying a recent financial innovation designed to sidestep limits to

(risky) arbitrage. The innovation involves a set of “arbitrageurs” in the Shleifer-Vishny (1997)

mold who are constrained in their ability to raise capital from investors and therefore shallow-

pocketed. The arbitrageurs expend considerable resources identifying overvalued companies and

then risk (mostly) their own limited capital trading against these companies, despite high noise

trader risk and severe short-sale constraints in the form of exceptionally high lending fees, a

highly inelastic supply of shortable stock, and unusually expensive put options.

    Our main contribution is to show that even in this uninviting setting, arbitrage can succeed in

correcting mispricing. On average, the prices of target companies in our sample fall by 21.9%

over 3 months and by 56.8% over 12 months, net of market movements. These price corrections

are sufficiently large to make arbitrage profitable. We estimate that the arbitrageurs (or “arbs”

for short) earn cumulative abnormal profits averaging 18.2% over three months, net of short-sale

fees and risk-adjusted using the three Fama-French factors and momentum. Given that the arbs

stay in business, returns of this magnitude (which are not annualized!) are likely large enough to

cover the information discovery costs they incur in identifying and investigating their targets.

    How do the arbitrageurs sidestep the limits to arbitrage they face? Not by outgunning their

targets: the arbs in our sample are individuals or small boutiques with insufficient resources to

correct mispricing in the textbook manner of shorting what they believe to be overpriced stocks

until prices converge on the true value. Nor do they have the financial wherewithal to stand their

ground should noise traders drive prices even further away fundamentals. In other words, the

limits to arbitrage are real enough. 1

    But they are apparently easily surmountable. Our evidence shows that the arbs, once they

1
 And of course the arbitrage is risky, as the strategy involves a directional bet, albeit a high-conviction one that can
be partially hedged against general market movements. We nonetheless refer to the information producers as
arbitrageurs rather than as short-sellers, to distinguish them from uninformed short-sellers in the market who might
mimic their trades in the spirit of Abreu and Brunnermeier (2002).
                                                                                                                       2
have identified an overvalued company, take a short position and then do something we don’t

usually associate with arbitrageurs: they reveal their information to the market. While their short

position is necessarily small – given their own capital constraints, the high shorting fees, and the

shortage of shortable stock – it need only be large enough to cover their information discovery

costs for arbs to have an incentive to discover mispriced stocks in the first place.

   Why reveal the information? The arbs lack the financial firepower by themselves to correct

the mispricing through aggressive shorting; and the same short sale constraints the arbs face

likely also prevent other short-sellers from driving down the price. Revealing the information

publicly is a way to sidestep these capital and short sale constraints. The apparent aim of this

financial innovation is to engage the one group of investors who are not constrained: the target

company’s current shareholders (which we call the “longs”). If the longs can be persuaded to

sell, this will not only correct the mispricing but in the process also reduce noise trader risk by

accelerating price discovery.

   Textbook arbitrage has investors keep their information secret so as not to move prices too

quickly: if arbitrage is riskfree, every arbitrage trade is profitable and so the incentive is to keep

the arbitrage opportunity both alive and secret for as long as possible. Of course, the very act of

arbitrage will sooner or later reveal the arbitrageur’s information, through his trades and the price

mechanism. The arbitrage process we observe in our setting stands this logic on its head:

revealing the information voluntarily and thereby accelerating price discovery reduces the risk of

the arbitrage strategy and sidesteps the arbs’ limited-resource constraint.

   For this strategy to work, it is critical that the information the arbs reveal to the market is

credible – or else the longs will ignore it. We observe that the arbs in our sample argue their case

by way of highly detailed reports which they post publicly and for free. Compared to reports

published by sell-side equity analysts at investment banks, which have a tendency to be both

                                                                                                         3
optimistic and biased, the arbs’ reports tend to focus on questionable governance practices and

aggressive accounting (sometimes alleging fraud) and contain much more by way of new facts,

often assembled with the help of forensic accountants and professional investigators. 2 To make

their case, the arbs include many “smoking guns,” in the form of recorded phone conversations,

video surveillance, photographs, etc.

    We find that investors appear to listen. Volatility spikes up by 270% on average the day the

arbs post their reports, as market participants process the information. Turnover spikes by even

more, up by 366%, and liquidity improves in its wake, up by 181%. At the same time, prices fall

by 8.18% on average on the release day and then continue to drift lower over time.

    Very little of the price pressure comes from the short side of the market. While we see

evidence of the arbs building significant (albeit relatively small) short positions before releasing

their reports, once the reports are out, there is no further abnormal shorting activity. This reflects

a dramatic worsening in short sale constraints: the cost of initiating new shorts jumps by 52% on

average when a report is released, putting it in the 81st percentile of the distribution of all stocks

in CRSP. Over the next three months, the cost continues to climb, reaching the 90th percentile

(up by a total of 238% compared to the pre-release period). At the same time, the supply of

lendable stock available for borrowing falls and put options become unusually expensive.

    The price falls instead come about because of the trading behavior of the one group of

investors who are unconstrained: investors with long positions in the targets. We find that

turnover involving longs spikes by 415% on average when the arbs release their reports.

    Subsequent events usually prove the arbs factually right. For example, 35% of targets are

subsequently delisted, 38% replace their auditors or see their auditors resign, and 23% restate

2
  Prominent examples include Muddy Waters’ June 2011 report on Sino-Forest, a Chinese company listed in
Toronto which a year later went bankrupt, and Citron Research’s January 2011 report on China MediaExpress, a
Chinese company delisted from Nasdaq six weeks later. Around half of the companies in our sample are Chinese
firms listed in the U.S.; the other half are American.
                                                                                                               4
earnings. In fact, in only 19% of cases do subsequent investigations by the SEC, the Department

of Justice, or a stock exchange disprove the alleged facts contained in the reports. This is

remarkable given that our sample is unbiased: we have a complete, ex ante list of target

companies, rather than a self-reported selected list of only those that made money for the arbs.

    Our sample covers 17 arbs who between July 2006 (when daily short-sale data first become

available from DataExplorers) and December 2011 target 113 U.S. listed companies. We have a

total of 332 reports (around three per company on average), as some arbs post follow-up reports

with more information or in response to management and because other arbs sometimes post

reports of their own. The arbs are either individuals or small firms that trade for their own

account. The fact that they have short positions which will appreciate in value if the price falls is

prominently disclosed in the reports.

    Clearly, reports should only induce the longs to sell if the information they contain is

credible. When we condition investors’ responses on an arb’s track record, we find that only arbs

with a history of making claims that are subsequently confirmed are able to induce the longs to

sell and thereby put pressure on a target’s share price. And it is only credible reports that

generate profits for the arbs, net of shorting fees: without credibility, prices do not fall

significantly. This supports the mechanism we propose to sidestep the limits to arbitrage.

    Credibility matters, but not absolutely: to be listened to, an arb also has to have something

new to say. We show that reports that present new facts previously unknown to investors (e.g.,

resulting from on-the-ground detective work) result in longs selling and rapid price corrections

whereas reports that merely reinterpret known data do not. As a result, only reports that contain

“scoops” generate significant profits for the arbs. This too supports our proposed mechanism.

    Our paper primarily contributes to the behavioral finance and asset pricing literatures by

showing that limits to arbitrage may not always be as constraining as sometimes assumed. Even

                                                                                                    5
though the arbs in our sample target only a relatively small number of companies, our evidence

shows that limits to arbitrage can be sidestepped using the innovative arbitrage mechanism we

describe. The innovation involves credibly convincing investors that the target truly is

overvalued. While the primary audience for this message is the longs, without whom prices

would presumably not adjust (or at least not sufficiently quickly), a reputation for credibly

identifying overvalued companies might eventually allow some arbs to raise funds from

institutional and other investors. This would help overcome the limit to arbitrage identified by

Shleifer and Vishny (1997): the inability to persuade other investors to commit capital to an

investment strategy aimed at correcting mispricing.

    In addition, our paper also contributes to the growing literature on the role of short sellers in

producing and transmitting information in capital markets. There is little prior evidence on what

short sellers know and how they acquire information. Our unique data allow us to observe the

information discovery process at the level of individual information producers and to study how

the information the arbs discover is then incorporated in security prices. 3

    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 presents our sample. Section 2 gives a flavor of the

lengths to which the arbs go to discover mispricing and the resulting richness of the data they

assemble for their reports. Section 3 documents the market’s reaction to the release of these data

and the ensuing price correction. Section 4 attempts to pinpoint the mechanism by conditioning

the market’s reaction on the credibility of the arb and the content of the report. It also shows that

arbs make money – and prices are corrected – in even the hardest-to-short target stocks for which

limits to arbitrage would be expected to be the most severe. Section 5 concludes.

  Previous research on short sales finds that they predict lower subsequent returns (Figlewski (1981), Desai et al.
(2002), Cohen, Diether, and Malloy (2007), Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2008), Diether, Lee, and Werner (2009)),
target overvalued firms (Dechow et al. (2001), Hirshleifer, Teoh, and Yu (2011)), and often precede negative
corporate events such as negative earnings announcements, analyst downgrades, or financial misconduct
(Christophe, Ferri, and Angel (2004), Desai, Krishnamurthy, and Venkataraman (2006), Christophe, Ferri, and
Hsieh (2010), Karpoff and Lou (2010)), though Engelberg, Reed, and Riggenberg (2012) find short sellers are more
likely to trade after corporate events.

1. Sample and Data

1.1 Arbitrageurs and Reports

    The arbitrage strategy we describe relies on publicity to generate a return on information

production, so identifying the relevant “arbitrageurs” is relatively straightforward. Our sample

consists of all arbs who research companies, take short positions, and initiate coverage on at least

two U.S. listed target companies over our sample period (July 2006 to December 2011). Table 1

lists the 17 arbs in our sample. The pioneer is Manuel Asensio of Asensio & Co., which was

founded in 1992 and started publishing reports on overvalued companies in 1994. The most

prolific arb in our sample is Citron Research, which has been in business since 2001 and which

describes itself as an “activist short seller.” A firm that has come to prominence in the media is

Muddy Waters, which describes itself as a “pioneer in on-the-ground, freely published

investment research.”

    Because private firms in the U.S. do not generally have to make public disclosures, we are

unable to provide summary statistics on the 17 arbs. Inspection of their websites suggests that

they are either one-man-bands or small firms. Except for Kerrisdale, Bronte Capital, and Asensio

& Co., none of the arbs currently is, or has ever been, registered as an investment adviser or

broker-dealer with the SEC or FINRA, suggesting that the arbs generally do not manage money

on behalf of external clients (at least not in the U.S.). All, however, take short positions in the

companies they target.

    From the arbs’ websites, we download all 374 reports the arbs have published since July

2006 (when DataExplorers first makes daily shorting data available). 4 We ignore reports

published after December 2011, so that we have at least a year of post-report share prices in
4
  Three of the arbs (Kerrisdale, Absaroka, and OLP Global) restrict access to their websites to clients only while at
the same time making their reports publicly available via prominent third-party websites such as seekingalpha.com.
Four of the arbs (Chimin Sang, Ian Bezek, Shareholder Watchdog, and The Forensic Factor) do not have websites of
their own and disseminate their research solely via third-party websites. All our results are qualitatively unchanged
if we exclude these four arbs from the sample.
                                                                                                                   7
CRSP to identify price corrections and measure the arbs’ trading profitability. To check how

comprehensive our list of reports is, we use the Internet Archive (also known as the Wayback

Machine), which stores historical web pages. We find no instance of an arb removing any

reports, whether inconvenient or otherwise. In this sense, our set of reports is both

comprehensive and unbiased. We remove 30 reports on firms that are traded over-the-counter or

on the Pink Sheets (for which we have no share price or other trading data) and 12 reports on

firms that are listed outside the U.S. (for which we have no short selling data; this filter removes

perhaps the most famous target firm, Sino-Forest, which was listed in Toronto). This leaves us

with a set of 332 reports.

   The average arb publishes 20 reports over our sample period. As Table 1 shows, Citron

Research accounts for 106 of the reports, followed by Alfred Little with 37 reports, and Asensio

& Co. with 34 reports.

   In total, the arbs target 113 U.S.-listed companies between them over our sample period. This

means there are 2.9 reports per company on average. Of the 332 reports, 118 are “first” reports in

which a company is targeted by one of the arbs for the first time. (In five cases, two arbs initiated

coverage of the same company on the same day.) The remaining 214 are follow-on reports by the

same or another arb. Citron Research publishes the most first reports, 43, followed by Bronte

Capital at 10. Given its longer history, Citron also covers the largest number of targets, at 46.

(All our results are qualitatively unchanged if we exclude Citron from the sample.)

   To dispel the notion that the patterns we document are driven by Chinese companies listed in

the U.S., which have received bad press over the last few years, we note that far from all sample

companies are Chinese: 58 of the 113 companies come from China (51.3% of the sample) and

the remaining 55 come from the U.S. (48.7%). All our results are qualitatively unchanged if we



                                                                                                    8
exclude Chinese targets from the sample. 5

    For each target firm in our sample, we know the arb who first targeted it and the exact date of

each report. (We describe the target companies in Section 1.3 and the contents of the reports in

Section 2.) We also hand collect information on material events before and after a report is

released from SEC filings such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks and from Factiva. This gives us a

complete timeline of all material events surrounding the reports through December 2012.

    Table 1 reports, for each of the 17 arbs, summary statistics for abnormal share price returns

on the day a company first becomes a target, cumulative abnormal returns from the report date to

60 trading days later, and the arb’s profit (net of market movements and shorting fees and

assuming that the arb initiates his short position five days before releasing a report which is then

marked-to-market on a daily basis for the next three months). 6

    For 15 of the 17 arbs, share prices fall on average when coverage is initiated on a target.

Chimin Sang has the largest immediate market impact, averaging -19.9%, followed by Alfred

Little at -19.2% and Muddy Waters at -18.0%. The average arb averages an 8.5% price.

    Measured over the three months after initiation, 14 of the 17 arbs see prices fall even further

(adjusted for the three Fama-French factors and momentum). Over this timeframe, Asensio &

Co. has the largest price correction, averaging -58.9%, followed by Absaroka Capital

Management at -54.1% and GeoInvesting at -39.8%. For the average arb, prices fall by 18.6% on

average in the three months following the release of a first report. Only three arbs see prices

move against them on average over this timeframe.

    As an estimate of the arbs’ profitability, Table 1 reports estimates of the returns to a marked-

to-market borrow-and-hold strategy that shorts the target stock five days before the report day


5
  This mirrors Lee et al.’s (2013) conclusion that U.S. listed Chinese firms as a group do not differ much from their
U.S. counterparts, despite the bad press a minority of them have received.
6
  Results are not sensitive to this assumption, as we will see later.
                                                                                                                        9
and closes out the short position three months after the report is released. The returns are net of

shorting costs and risk-adjusted using the three Fama-French factors and momentum. (For all

variable definitions and details of their construction, see Appendix A.) By this measure, Asensio

& Co.’s reports yield the highest returns, averaging 61% over three months (not annualized),

followed by Absaroka Capital Management at 51.8% and GeoInvesting at 40.4%. For the

average arb, our borrow-and-hold strategy yields an average three-month return of 18.9%.

1.2 Other Data Sources

    We obtain equity lending data from DataExplorers, a research company that collects stock

and bond lending data directly from the security lending desks at the world’s leading financial

institutions. The database contains comprehensive information on the supply of shares available

for borrowing, the number of shares out on loan, and loan fees for over 85% of the global equity

lending market (though our subscription only covers the U.S. market). A detailed description of

the equity lending data can be found in Saffi and Sigurdsson (2011) and Jain et al. (2012).

Following convention, we proxy for actual short selling using shares out on loan. 7 Daily shorting

data are available from July 2006, which thus defines the beginning of our sample period.

    Daily price and trading data for the target companies are obtained from CRSP, accounting

data from Compustat, intra-day price data from TAQ, and option data from OptionMetrics.

1.3 Target Companies

    Table 2 characterizes the 113 target companies by providing a snapshot of firm

characteristics and shorting conditions as of one month before the release of the first report. At

that point in time, the average target has a market capitalization of $979.2 million, putting it in

the 54th percentile of the distribution of CRSP firms. It has a book-to-market ratio of 0.4 (equal

to the 30th percentile) and so comes from the growth part of the value-growth spectrum. Its daily

7
 During our sample, naked short selling is generally discouraged and short selling must be associated with stock
borrowing, suggesting that the number of shares out on loan is a good indicator for actual short selling.
                                                                                                                   10
share turnover of 2.35% of shares outstanding puts it in the right tail of the CRSP distribution

(71st percentile). It is relatively liquid, with an Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure of 0.04 (43rd

percentile). Its stock returns are unusually volatile, with a monthly standard deviation of 7.44%

(78th percentile).

   How easy would it be to short these companies’ stock? As Table 2 shows, it would be

expensive: one month before the first report is released, the average target company has a

shorting fee of 4 basis points a day (10.6% annualized), which is in the right tail of the CRSP

distribution (76th percentile). This reflects an unusually tight supply of lendable stock: on

average, only 4.85% of shares outstanding are available for borrowing (39th percentile). Putting

downward pressure on a target’s share price via the options market would also be difficult, as its

put options are unusually expensive: the ratio of the implied volatility of puts to the implied

volatility of calls on the target’s shares averages 1.15 (69th percentile). Absent short sale

constraints, the ratio would equal one.

   In sum, targets are growth companies of average size whose shares are heavily traded and

quite liquid. But they are also hard to arbitrage, as lending fees are high, lendable stock is tight,

and put options are pricey. And yet, as we will show, arbitrageurs manage to systematically

correct mispricing in spite of these limits to arbitrage.

2. Discovering Mispricing

   Figure A1 in the Appendix shows the cover pages of three representative reports in our

sample. In some ways, the reports resemble equity research notes written by sell-side research

analysts working for investment banks, but there are three important differences: 1) the arbs

typically go to a lot of trouble to uncover mispricing; 2) they consistently issue “strong sell”

recommendations (whereas sell-side analysts have a tendency to issue “buy” or “strong buy”

recommendations); and 3) they (legally) front-run the publication of their reports by taking short

                                                                                                    11
positions in the target stocks.

    All sample reports claim the target’s stock is overpriced, but they differ in the grounds for

their claims. Cases range from aggressive accounting that obscures the firm’s true value to

outright fraud. Based on a careful reading of the reports, we divide the sample into those reports

that convey the results of information production (i.e., the discovery of facts previously unknown

to investors) and those that result from information processing (i.e., the reinterpretation of

already known data). In this section, we aim to give a flavor of the lengths to which the arbs go

to discover mispricing and the resulting richness of the data they assemble for their reports.

2.1 Information Production

    The vast majority of the reports (285 of 332) reveal new information. Panel A of Table 3

tabulates the kinds of new information they contain. We distinguish between concerns regarding

financial reporting (such as accounting irregularities or misleading disclosure) and questionable

corporate governance practices (such as forgivable loans to executives) on the one hand, and

concerns that arise from “red flag” events (such as suspicious acquisitions, self-dealing,

undisclosed related-party transactions, and questionable insider trades) on the other hand.

    Since we only observe the targets that the arbs choose to report on, we cannot say how they

chose these targets in the first place. But there are some telltale signs. In each case, the arbs pick

up suspicious signals from publicly observable information that the market, arguably, had simply

missed or misinterpreted. Several targets caught the arbs’ attention due to unusual patterns of

behavior (for example, constantly raising equity from shareholders while claiming to have large

unused cash balances) or implausible, too-good-to-be-true margins. The following example

illustrates the latter:

    “[The company] boasts an unjustifiable 40%+ gross margin in the domestic business and reports
    operating margins 46% higher than its strongest competitor, which is over 8x its size. With all of the
    major competitors being much larger publicly traded companies with manufacturing facilities and cost
    structure similar or superior, I see no validity to the Company’s explanation of its high margins due to its
                                                                                                              12
   purportedly lower cost base and greater economy of scale.”

   Other telltale signs include the individuals behind the firms. Some Chinese target firms, for

example, used the services of a particular “promoter” to obtain a listing in the U.S., and once

some of the promoter’s companies became involved in regulatory investigations, his other clients

also came into the arbs’ crosshairs. In other cases, target firms shared a little known boutique

auditor that had become the subject of an investigation by the Public Company Accounting

Oversight Board for violating quality control and auditing standards.

   Once they have identified a potential target, the arbs follow up with in-depth investigations

that go well beyond what sell-side equity analysts typically engage in. Investigations may start

with an extensive document review, not only of existing filings and public records but also of

non-public or difficult-to-access documents such as purchase agreements, customer orders,

original auditor reports, tax returns, or the filings and documents of competitors. (A favorite, in

the context of Chinese companies listed in the U.S., is a comparison of Chinese-language filings

with local regulators and English-language filings with the SEC, which often reveals aggressive

accounting that flatters the company’s U.S. earnings.)

   In a process that can take many months, investigations often involve poking holes in claims

the target made in public disclosures (such as SEC filings) or conference calls. To this end, arbs

may contact target firms’ management to clarify doubts (and record the conversations); consult

industry experts for independent opinions; arrange authorized or unauthorized site visits,

accompanied by industry experts or private investigators; or put a target’s production facilities

under video surveillance. To illustrate,

   “Our on-site due diligence confirmed our thesis that the company is nowhere near the scale that it claims
   to be. On our visit, we saw a very small operation that appeared to be formerly government owned, and
   probably privatized for very little money. [The company] claims to have six legacy paper production lines,
   but despite our prior agreement to see all lines, it showed us only two. […] The equipment is clearly dated
   …”


                                                                                                           13
   Arbs may also visit a target’s distribution channels and customers to gauge the reliability and

strength of its revenue prospects, or contact the target’s business partners and competitors to

verify specific claims made by the target. For example, one arb conducted an extensive 10-city,

60-store channel check:

   “[T]he investigators were instructed to count the number of small kitchen appliance brands, note the
   prices each brand was selling for, and ask the store/department managers and at least two different sales
   clerks a short list of questions about their experience selling products manufactured by the company and
   its competitors. For purpose of verification, the investigators were also instructed to record the name,
   address, phone # of the stores, as well as the name and cell phone # of the managers they spoke to.”

This particular channel check revealed that the target’s sales were suspiciously slow given the

firm’s reported revenue growth. More generally, investigations can uncover falsely-reported

revenue or non-existent or suspicious customers.

   Once an investigation is completed, the evidence is assembled into a highly detailed report

that is subsequently disclosed to the investing public. To attract investors’ attention, the reports

often have catchy titles such as “Credibility is like virginity; once you lose it, you can never get it

back.” (See Table A1 in the Appendix for further examples.)

   In an effort to be convincing, the reports include in-depth coverage of the issues identified

during the investigation, often supplemented with scanned copies of original company

documents, photos (of production facilities or distribution channels), and links to videos taken

during site visits and audio recordings of conversations with target executives. (See Figure A2 in

the Appendix for examples.) In several cases, reports provide “smoking gun” evidence in the

form of audio clips of employees admitting misrepresentation, video clips contradicting

production claims, and irreconcilable discrepancies between foreign and U.S. filings. One

particularly egregious example involves evidence of fraud; the target was subsequently

investigated by the SEC:

   “We recorded a telephone conversation that contains an admission that [the company] is engaging in
   securities fraud.”
                                                                                                          14
    The costs and risks of this information discovery process are not trivial. Besides the difficulty

of obtaining evidence to support their suspicions, the arbs often face open resistance, and

occasionally hands-on obstruction, from target companies. The following example illustrates:

    “Surveillance efforts are costly and difficult to conduct under very threatening conditions. […] Agents
    first must spend a few weeks watching and evaluating factory operations to determine the production
    cycle, factory entrances, and security surrounding the facility. The expensive cameras must be hidden so
    that the company does not find them, typically quite some distance from the factory and requiring use of a
    good zoom lens. […] Sometimes the cameras get stolen, in which case a backup camera is always on
    hand. Each day the local operative replaces the camera batteries (usually in the darkness of night) and
    memory card. […] The local operatives […] have been detained, questioned, and beaten by company
    security.”

    The arbs also face the risk of being sued by their targets. In the words of the Wall Street

Journal (June 14, 2006), “What was already a difficult and sometimes gut-wrenching strategy

has only gotten harder in recent years. Nowadays, more of the companies that short sellers target

are fighting back with lawsuits. They also mount sophisticated public relations campaigns

against shorts.” 8 On a more positive note, the very real risk of lawsuits will, to some extent, keep

the arbs from making claims they cannot substantiate. This, in turn, will make it likelier that their

reports will be believed.

2.2 Information Processing

    While most of the 332 reports in our sample reveal new information and rely on hard

evidence to make their case, a minority of the reports instead present reinterpretations of already

known facts to argue that a target is overvalued. These reports are thus essentially opinions,

without new evidence, and so are more similar to “sell” recommendations issued by sell-side

research analysts. As such, we might expect them to have little more impact on share prices than

sell-side analysts tend to have when they downgrade a stock. 9 As we will see, our results are

consistent with this prediction.

downgrades to “sell” (Womack (1996), Loh and Stulz (2011)).

3. Correcting Mispricing

3.1 Reaction in the Equity Market

    How does the equity market react when the arbs release their reports to the public? Table 4,

Panel A documents the share price reaction to the release of a “first” report targeting a company.

On the release day (day 0), prices fall by an average of 8.18% (adjusted for the three Fama-

French factors and momentum); the median price fall is 5.2%, and fully 82 of the 113 releases

trigger a fall in price. (All three statistics are statistically significant at the 1% level.) When arbs

release follow-on reports on a target, returns are (not surprisingly) lower, averaging 2.59%, but

they remain both economically and statistically significant (see Panel B).

    These patterns suggest that the reports contain relevant and novel information which

investors take seriously. And investors appear to incorporate the information fairly rapidly. In

five cases, we know the exact time of the report release. Figure 1 below shows continuously

compounded raw returns over five-minute intervals during the eight trading hours before and

after the release of a first report. At least for these five reports, prices fall by more than 10%

within two hours of release.




                               Figure 1. Price Adjustment on the Report Date

    Table 4, Panel A reveals two further interesting patterns. First, between trading day -20 and
                                                                                                 16
trading day -6, target companies’ share prices rise by 4.43% on average, net of market

movements (p=0.003). This suggests that the arbs are not simply trend chasers. In fact, they may

be timing the release of their reports to coincide with price run-ups, which would increase the

expected profitability of their shorting strategy. Second, there is evidence of a modest pre-event

run-down in prices close to the report day: over the week leading up to release, returns fall by

1.31% net of overall market movements. This is marginally statistically significant (p=0.082)

and could suggest that the short positions the arbs build before releasing their information put

some moderate pressure on share prices.

   The striking difference between the gentle downward drift in the week leading up to the

release and the sizeable share price fall once the report becomes available to the public suggests

that the arbs are unable to build sufficiently large short positions to correct the mispricing on

their own. This is indicative of frictions in the arbitrage process, consistent with the challenging

shorting conditions for target stocks seen in Table 2. A natural response to these frictions is for

the arbs to release the information publicly and let the current shareholders (i.e., the “longs”) do

the work for them. As long as the arbs make enough money, in expectation, on whatever short

positions they could afford to build so that they can cover their information production costs, this

strategy will encourage information production, and hence price correction, even in cases where

limits to arbitrage appear to be binding.

   Just how big a shock to investors’ information sets the reports represent can be seen in Figure

2 below, which shows that volatility spikes when a report is released: on average, volatility

increases by 270% on the release day, compared to the firm’s baseline volatility estimated in a




                                                                                                      17
three-month window ending 21 trading days before the report day. 10 The dashed lines, which

represent 95% confidence intervals, indicate that this increase is highly statistically significant.

Volatility remains significantly elevated for the next five days, suggesting investors take up to a

week to process the information revealed in the average report.




                                     Figure 2. Average Abnormal Volatility

     The reports also trigger a massive increase in trading activity. Figure 3 shows that share

turnover (i.e., number of shares traded scaled by shares outstanding) begins to rise significantly

relative to the baseline around four days before the report day (perhaps because the arbs build

their short positions) and then spikes at 366% above the baseline on the release day (i.e., by

exp(1.538) – 1). In dollar terms, this represents a jump from an average baseline turnover of

$18.45 million per day to an average of $55.57 million on the release day. Turnover stays

significantly higher than normal for the next 23 trading days before returning to baseline levels.




10
  In this and subsequent figures, we compute percentage changes relative to a baseline estimated over a three-month
period ending one month before a report date. Specifically, the “abnormal” value of variable X is computed as the
log difference between X on day t and average daily X in a three-month period beginning 80 trading days and ending
21 trading days before a report date. The log increase in volatility in Figure 2 shown for day 0 is 1.308, meaning
volatility is exp(1.308) – 1 = 270% higher on day 0 than during the baseline period.
                                                                                                                18
                                Figure 3. Average Abnormal Turnover

   All this extra trading improves liquidity as measured by Amihud’s (2002) illiquidity

measure. Figure 4 shows that liquidity spikes on the release day at 181% above the average

firm’s baseline value (i.e., exp(abs(-1.033)) – 1) and remains significantly elevated for 28 trading

days. (Interestingly, liquidity is unusually high in the month leading up to the report date. This

coincides with the large pre-report price increases between trading day -20 and trading day -6

seen in Table 4, suggesting significant buyer interest in the target stocks ahead of the subsequent

report release.)




                        Figure 4. Average Abnormal Amihud Illiquidity Measure

                                                                                                     19
3.2 Reaction in the Short Sale and Options Markets

   Who is responsible for the additional trading? Clearly, each trade involves a buyer and a

seller, and only current shareholders (or “longs”) and short sellers can sell the stock. So the price

pressure we see on the report day either comes from increased short selling or from increased

selling by the longs. We first consider the short side of the market.

   Figure 5 tracks the contribution of short sellers to the trading spike by plotting the average

daily number of new shorts (scaled by shares outstanding) relative to the pre-event baseline. One

day before the release, shorts briefly spike at exp(0.508) – 1 = 66% above baseline (p=0.002),

perhaps as the arbs build or add to their short positions. The spike is, however, economically

small: on average, only 0.48% of outstanding shares are newly shorted on day -1. Given an

average day -1 market capitalization of $959.86 million, this means that new shorts amount to

only around $4.61 million in trading (i.e., 0.0048*$959.86m), not all of which will involve one

of our sample arbs. These small numbers underscore the fact that the arbs in our sample do not

have particularly deep pockets – and yet, as our results show, they have a large price impact and

manage to correct misvaluations.

   The spike in new shorts on day -1 is not only small but also short-lived. Beginning on the

release day itself, new shorts are no more numerous than during the pre-release baseline month.

Thus, new shorts do not appear to be responsible for the additional trading we saw in Figure 3.

This is somewhat unexpected. Abreu and Brunnermeier (2002) argue that arbitrageurs face

“synchronization risk”, meaning they do not know when other arbs will start targeting an

overvalued firm. If a critical mass of arbs is required for a shorting strategy to be profitable,

synchronization risk can lead to a coordination problem and so to insufficient arbitrage.

However, by publishing their information, arbs remove the synchronization risk; the publication

is essentially a coordination device. And yet we see no increase in shorting activity. Why not?

                                                                                                    20
                               Figure 5. Average Abnormal Short Trades

   The reason is simple. The lack of unusual activity in the shorting market, once a report has

been released, reflects a drastic increase in the cost of shorting and a concomitant fall in the

supply of lendable stock available for shorting. Figure 6a below shows that the cost of initiating

new shorts rises significantly one day before a report is released (perhaps in response to the arbs

building their short positions) and then jumps to 52% above the baseline on average on the

release day. It continues to drift higher, to a level 238% above the baseline by trading day 60

(i.e., exp(1.217) – 1). As Figure 6b shows, this puts the cost of initiating new shorts in the 81st

percentile on the release day, drifting up to the 90th percentile over the next three months.




      Figure 6a. Average Abnormal Shorting Fee              Figure 6b. Mean Percentile Rank

   Part of the reason for the cost increase is presumably an increase in demand by short sellers,
                                                                                                      21
but part of it appears to be the result of a fall in the supply of lendable stock. Anecdotally, some

targets put pressure on their shareholders to recall stock out on loan, to put a squeeze on short

sellers. 11 Figure 7, though noisy, shows that the supply of lendable stock becomes unusually low,

relative to the baseline, on the report date and remains at 20% to 30% below the baseline for the

next three months. Notably this occurs even while lending fees are exceptionally high.




                            Figure 7. Average Abnormal Supply of Lendable Shares

     In light of this tightening in the short sale market, market participants might try to trade on

the information revealed in the arbs’ reports via the option markets instead. However, this too

appears to be difficult. Figure 8 shows an uptick in put option trading on the report date among

the 69 targets with traded options, but the uptick is not statistically significant and anyway short-

lived.




11
   For example, a target company issued the following press release in response to the release of a report: “The
Company believes that short sellers’ attempts to drive down the stock price and harm the Company’s shareholders
are likely to increase […] In this context, the Company believes that an important way to protect shareholder value
is to limit short sellers’ ability to borrow stocks and shareholders can contribute by reviewing whether their
custodians or brokers are lending their shares to third parties.” (PR Newswire, August 3, 2011)
                                                                                                                  22
                       Figure 8. Average Abnormal Put Option Trading Volume

   Figure 9a shows why the put trading volume does not increase significantly when a report is

released: puts become unusually expensive. The implied volatility of put options (a measure of

put prices) drifts up significantly in the three weeks before the report date (consistent with some

arbs buying puts to profit from the negative information they are about to release) and spikes at

46% above baseline on the day a report is released (i.e., exp(0.377) – 1). Part of this spike

reflects the increase in volatility we saw in Figure 2 above, but whereas volatility quickly reverts

to the baseline, implied put-option volatility remains significantly elevated, at around 25% above

baseline, for the next three months. This suggests that puts are in unusually high demand.




                                                                                                  23
                           Figure 9a. Average Abnormal Cost of Put Options

    Another way to see that puts become expensive – beyond what is reasonable given the

(temporary) increase in volatility shown in Figure 2 – is to compare the implied volatilities of

puts to the implied volatilities of calls with the same strike price and exercise date. (For all

variable definitions and details of their construction, see Appendix A.) By put-call parity, the

implied volatilities of puts and calls must be identical and so the ratio of put and call implied

volatilities should be one – unless there are significant costs of carry, such as short sale

constraints. Figure 9b shows that puts begin to depart from parity three days before the report

date on average, with the ratio settling at 10% above the pre-event baseline once the report has

been released and remaining there for the next three months. This is consistent with short sale

constraints becoming even tighter, making puts unusually expensive. As Figure 9c shows, once

the arbs release their reports, target companies’ put prices move into the top quartile of the CRSP

distribution.




                                                                                                    24
     Figure 9b. Abnormal Cost of Puts Relative to Calls             Figure 9c. Mean Percentile Rank

      In summary, the companies targeted by the arbs in our sample are simply too hard to

arbitrage directly – through shorting or put options – for publication of the reports to act as a

coordination device in the sense of Abreu and Brunnermeier (2002). 12 Another mechanism is

therefore needed.

3.3 Reaction by Long Investors and Price Correction

      The patterns in Figures 5 to 9 show that neither new shorts nor trading in the options market

are likely to be the main cause of the report-day price falls shown in Table 2. As we have noted,

this is not surprising, given that the targets have many of the characteristics traditionally

associated with short sale constraints and limits to arbitrage. What then explains the price falls?

The answer is trading by the one group of investors who are unconstrained: investors with long

positions in the target companies’ shares. Figure 10 illustrates that the spike in overall trading

volume we saw in Figure 3 is driven by a massive increase in trading by the longs. On the report

day, long trading is 415% above the baseline (=exp(1.639) – 1) and stays significantly elevated

for the next month.




12
 But see Zuckerman (2011) for evidence of synchronized arbitrage involving public announcements in a setting
where limits to arbitrage are much less likely to be binding.
                                                                                                               25
                              Figure 10. Average Abnormal Long Trades

   While data limitations prevent us from signing the direction of the long investors’ trades, the

share price falls on the report day seen in Table 2 make it highly likely that longs are net sellers

(the alternative being that they sell to each other). Figure 11 shows what happens to target

companies’ share prices as the longs sell: not only do prices fall, by 8.18% on the report day,

they continue to drift lower over the next three months to end down 21.9% net of market

movements. At no time over this window do prices recover.




                   Figure 11. Cumulative Abnormal Returns Around Report Releases

   Though not shown in the figure, the mean cumulative abnormal return is -56.8% over the 12

                                                                                                   26
months following the release of a report, with 80 of the 113 targets experiencing negative

abnormal returns. This suggests that the information the arbs release usually proves correct.

3.4 How Accurate Are the Reports?

     The reports not only make an impression on investors; they also influence the SEC, the stock

exchanges – and of course trial lawyers. Using SEC filings and Factiva searches, we find that

through the end of 2012, 53% of targeted companies are involved in class action lawsuits, 35%

are delisted by an exchange (usually out of public-interest concerns), and 25% are formally

investigated by the SEC or the Department of Justice (occasionally for fraud). 13 In fact, only

19% of the 285 reports that raise material concerns (rather than simply claiming a company is

overvalued based on a reinterpretation of known data) are subsequently disproved by

independent parties such as the SEC, the DoJ, or an exchange.

     Moreover, subsequent actions taken by the target companies indirectly confirm that the arbs’

information is usually accurate. Through the end of 2012, 80% of targets change management,

38% replace the auditor or see their auditor resign, and 23% restate their earnings.

3.4 Do Arbs Make Money on Their Information Production?

     While we do not know the costs involved in producing the information contained in the

reports, our data allow us to estimate the arbs’ trading profits. Assuming that they take a short

position five days before the report day (which looks consistent with the patterns found in

Figures 5 and 6a) and then follow a marked-to-market borrow-and-hold strategy, their

cumulative abnormal profit equals the negative of the cumulative abnormal return shown in

Figure 11 above minus the cumulative shorting fee.

     Figure 12 shows that this borrow-and-hold strategy turns profitable as soon as the report is

released, making an average return of 8.13% on the report day and a cumulative abnormal profit

of 18.2% over the first three months. These profit estimates are conservative to the extent that

they ignore the potential for additional – and leveraged – returns through the use of put options.

They also ignore that arbs, knowing that their reports will cause short-term spikes in volatility,

could potentially set up profitable trading strategies in the options market (such as zero-beta

straddles or butterflies) designed to capitalize on the volatility spikes.




                 Figure 12. Average Cumulative Abnormal Profit Around Report Releases

   Are these trading profits likely to cover the arbs’ information production costs? An 18.2%

risk-adjusted return net of shorting fees implies dollar gains of $182,000 on an initial short

position of $1m, $364,000 on an initial short position of $2m, $546,000 on an initial short

position of $3m, and so on – plus whatever profits the arbs can make through option trading

strategies. While we cannot know for sure, these numbers seem sufficient to cover analyst

salaries, private investigators, and so on.

4. Pinpointing the Mechanism

   The results so far suggest that the arbs do not have deep enough pockets to correct the

mispricing on their own, given the short-sale constraints surrounding their targets. Our

conjecture is that the arbs attempt to circumvent these constraints by making their information

public in an effort to persuade the longs to sell. This would be consistent with the observed
                                                                                                     28
massive increase in trading by the longs. If successful, this strategy will not only result in a price

correction that translates into gains on the arbs’ short positions; it will also reduce noise trader

risk by making it less likely that prices diverge even further from fundamentals in the short-run

and thereby put a squeeze on the arbs’ short positions.

     For this strategy to work, the reports have to contain credible information. In Section 4.1, we

show that more credible reports result in more rapid price corrections and larger profits to the

arbs. Section 4.2 adds nuance to this result by showing that reports that go beyond claiming a

stock is overvalued (by providing new information that is costly to acquire) elicit larger and

speedier market reactions. Section 4.3, finally, shows that arbs make money even in the hardest-

to-short cases in our sample.

4.1 Credibility

     Reports should only induce longs to sell if the information they contain is credible. The arbs

clearly understand this: many prominently post their past performance on their websites. For

example, Citron Research maintains a list of its targets that have subsequently been targeted by

regulators – more than 50 as of January 2014 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left).

     Rather than relying on these posts, we construct our own measure of credibility. Specifically,

to determine whether a report is likely to be credible, we examine each arb’s prior track record,

on the assumption that arbs with a stronger track record are more readily believed when they

target a stock. We measure an arb’s track record at time t as the rolling mean of the three-month

cumulative abnormal returns of all his previous reports (issued at least three months before time

t, to avoid look-ahead bias) that are independently confirmed by a third party (such as the SEC,

the DoJ, or an exchange). 14 Using all 332 reports in our sample, we then code a report issued at

time t as more credible if the arb’s prior track record produced profits (a negative rolling mean

14
  We require each arb to have issued at least two reports before we compute a track record. Results are not sensitive
to the choice of a three-month window.
                                                                                                                  29
CAR), and as less credible otherwise. This yields 167 reports coded as more credible and 36

reports coded as less credible. 15 Note that an arb’s track record evolves over time such that he

can gain or lose credibility depending on how accurate his reports prove to be. The final column

of Table 1 reports what fraction of each of the 17 arbs’ reports is coded as more credible.

     Table 5, Panel A splits the sample by this measure of credibility. When a more credible arb is

the first to issue a report on a target, the target’s share price falls by an average of 12.5% on the

report day, net of market movements (p<0.001). This is a significantly larger than the -4.5%

average price fall for less credible reports, which in turn is not significantly different from zero

(p=0.15). If we include follow-on reports by this or other arbs, the pattern is similar: more

credible reports are greeted with a significant price fall averaging 5.8% on the release day

(p<0.001), compared to a price fall of only 2.1% for less credible reports (p=0.091).

     Turnover tells a similar story. Both overall turnover and trading involving longs respond

significantly more strongly, on the report day, to more credible reports. As Figure 13 below

shows, the difference is stark and persists for many days.




                             Figure 13. Abnormal Long Trades Sorted by Credibility

     Consistent with these turnover patterns, prices converge faster in response to more credible

15
   We lose 129 of the 332 reports, in part because we require at least two reports to compute a track record; in part
because we require that prior reports are at least 60 trading days old before we can classify the current report as
more or less credible; and in part because reports that allege overvaluation based merely on a reinterpretation of
already known data are excluded.
                                                                                                                    30
reports. As a result, a borrow-and-hold strategy initiated five days before the release day of a

more credible report becomes immediately profitable upon release and generates abnormal

profits, net of shorting fees, averaging 16.2% by day +60. The rapid speed with which the price

correction occurs implies a much reduced noise trader risk. Less credible reports, in contrast, do

not move prices significantly, either on the release day or with any kind of lag. By day +60, for

example, cumulative abnormal profits average a more modest and statistically insignificant

11.4% net of shorting fees (p=0.130).




                       Figure 14. Cumulative Abnormal Profits Sorted by Credibility

4.2 Nature of Information Discovery

   Credibility appears to be necessary but is probably not sufficient to ensure the longs will

listen. What likely also matters is what the arb has to say. Table 5, Panel B splits the sample of

first reports into those that convey the results of information production (i.e., the discovery of

facts previously unknown to investors) and those that result from information processing (i.e.,

the reinterpretation of already known data). The report-day returns average -10.2% when a report

reveals new information (p<0.001), compared to a statistically insignificant -1.7% when the

report merely claims a stock is overvalued based on a different interpretation of known data

(p=0.375). In other words, investors largely ignore claims of overvaluation if not backed up by

new facts and hard evidence. The difference between the two cases is highly statistically

                                                                                                     31
significant (p=0.001).

   Turnover tells a similar story: both the overall increase in turnover and the reaction by longs

is significantly stronger for reports that go beyond claiming a stock is overvalued by providing

new information that is costly to acquire. In fact, as Figure 15 shows, mere claims of

overvaluation do not appear to influence long trading much at any horizon.




                         Figure 15. Abnormal Long Trades Sorted by Type of Report

   These patterns imply that arbs who produce new information should make higher profits than

arbs who merely process existing information to arrive at their opinion. Figure 16 bears this

prediction out. It shows average cumulative abnormal profits for a marked-to-market borrow-

and-hold strategy that shorts a target company’s stock five days before the first report is released

and holds the stock for three months, net of shorting fees. Evidence-based reports that convey the

results of information production generate significant profits as soon as they are released,

peaking at 22.7% by day +60 on average. Opinion-based reports that merely claim a stock is

overvalued, on the other hand, have a harder time convincing investors of their case and end up

never making significant profits (not even after three months).




                                                                                                   32
                     Figure 16. Cumulative Abnormal Profits Sorted by Type of Report

4.3 Shorting Costs

   Our results suggest that arbs who credibly reveal novel information are able to persuade long

shareholders to sell and thereby contribute to a price correction which in turn generates an

economically meaningful return for the arbs on their information production. We next show that

this is true in even the most constrained, hardest to short stocks in our sample.

   We use two measures to capture shorting cost: the level of the shorting fee and the supply of

lendable stock available for borrowing. For the first measure, we sort target stocks by the

average daily shorting fee during the trading month ending one month before the first report and

split the sample at the median. Figure 17a shows that the arbs make significant three-month

abnormal profits in high-shorting-fee stocks, even net of shorting fees. The cumulative abnormal

profits average 18.6% (p=0.006), very similar to the average profit of 19.2% on low-shorting-fee

stocks (p=0.006). In other words, gross returns (i.e., returns due to price corrections) are

sufficiently greater in high-shorting-fee stocks to make up for the higher shorting fees, such that

net returns end up being very similar – despite the difference in the cost of building the initial

short position. This implies that when shorting fees are high, the arbs predominantly target

companies that are more glaringly mispriced in the light of the information produced.




                                                                                                     33
                    Figure 17a. Cumulative Abnormal Profits Sorted by Shorting Fee

   We obtain qualitatively similar results with our second measure of shorting cost. When we

sort on the supply of lendable stock available for borrowing, again splitting the sample at the

median, we find that the arbs make money, net of shorting fees, regardless of the level of

shorting costs. If anything, they make greater returns in the harder-to-borrow stocks, averaging

24.2% (p=0.002) after 60 days, than in easier-to-borrow stocks, averaging 14.4% (p=0.019),

though the difference is not statistically significant (p=0.296).




              Figure 17b. Cumulative Abnormal Profits Sorted by Supply of Lendable Stock

   Table 5, Panels C and D show that the high- and low-shorting-cost subsamples experience

similar spikes in turnover and in long trading when a report is released to the public, whether we

sort on shorting fees or the supply of lendable stock. This is consistent with our proposed

mechanism: if, as we propose, the price correction emanates not from the shorting market (whose


                                                                                                   34
features Panels C and D sort on) but from long shareholders’ responses to the negative

information revealed in the reports, it should make no difference how severe a set of short-sale

constraints a target company happens to have.

5. Conclusions

   We report evidence of (risky) arbitrage correcting mispricing (and doing so profitably) in a

setting characterized by costly information discovery, arbs with shallow pockets, severe short

sale constraints, and a high risk of mispricing persisting – that is, a setting theory suggests should

suffer from severe limits to arbitrage.

   The financial innovation that allows the arbs to circumvent these limits to arbitrage relies on

credibly revealing their information to the market, in an effort to induce the unconstrained

investors – i.e., the longs – to sell. This not only helps overcome short-sale constraints but also

accelerates the price correction and thereby reduces the risk of noise traders moving prices even

further from fundamentals in the short-run, which might otherwise force the arbs to liquidate

their short positions at a loss. Credibility is key: arbs who lack (or lose) a track record of

producing reliable new evidence are ignored by investors and so do not move prices. Producing

new evidence also is key: arbs who simply express the opinion that a stock is overvalued, based

purely on existing data, are similarly ignored by investors.

   In principle, revealing the information creates the potential for coordinated action by multiple

arbitrageurs to overcome the synchronization problem that Abreu and Brunnermeier (2012) talk

about. But our results show that not even that is enough, on its own, to correct mispricing in our

setting. The reason is that the short-sale constraints are quite severe for our target stocks, limiting

the scope for coordinated action. And yet these limits to arbitrage can still be sidestepped, as

long as the information is sufficiently credible to convince the longs to sell.

   In conclusion, our results suggest that limits to (risky) arbitrage need not be as constraining

                                                                                                      35
as previously assumed: they can be sidestepped by the novel arbitrage mechanism we identify in

this paper. This mechanism appears to have become increasingly popular. While we know of

only three arbs who practiced it up to 2008, the mechanism was adopted by four new arbs in

each of 2009 and 2010 and by six in 2011.

     Our evidence also illustrates why financial markets need short sellers to function well. While

some short sellers may indeed be speculators who do little more than destabilize share prices, as

is often alleged, the short sellers in our sample are information producers who help correct

mispricing and thereby help make markets more efficient. This is all the more remarkable given

that many targets in our sample were held by highly sophisticated investors who apparently did

not spot the overvaluation until it was too late. 16

  According to media reports, investors that lost substantial amounts when arbs revealed their information include
Paulson & Co. (with a $468m loss on Sino-Forest) and C.V. Starr & Co. (with a $6.5m loss on ChinaMedia
Express). Other prominent investors who have suffered from the price fall upon the information release include
Blackrock, Vanguard, Hartford Investment Management, Apollo Global Management, and Henderson Global
Investors.

Appendix A. Variable Definitions.
Outcome variables

Returns and profits:

CAR is the cumulative abnormal return over a specified event window. It is constructed using the Fama-French-
Carhart benchmark. Factor loadings are estimated in a one-year pre-event window ending 61 trading days before the
report date, and cumulative abnormal returns during the specific event window are calculated using this estimated
model as a benchmark.

Cumulative abnormal profit measures the return to a borrow-and-hold strategy that goes short the stock on day t,
marks the position to market on a daily basis, and closes out the position on day T. It is measured as the negative of
the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) net of the cumulative daily shorting fee.

Daily trading and shorting variables:

Turnover is defined as the total number of shares traded (CRSP variable vol) in a day divided by the number of
shares outstanding (CRSP variable shrout).

New shorts/shares outstanding is the number of new shorts initiated (as proxied by the number of new shares on
loan) on a given day divided by the number of shares outstanding (CRSP variable shrout). The number of daily new
shares on loan is obtained from DataExplorers (now owned by Markit), a securities lending data provider.

Long trades/shares outstanding is equal to the difference between turnover and new shorts/shares outstanding (as
defined above). In other words, it is the number of traded shares on a given day that are not attributable to short
sellers, divided by the total number of shares outstanding (CRSP variable shrout).

Shorting fee is the daily cost of initiating new short positions (i.e., the daily cost of borrowing new shares from
equity lenders). Data are obtained from DataExplorers (now owned by Markit), a securities lending data provider.

Supply of lendable stock is defined as the number of shares available for borrowing on a given day divided by the
number of shares outstanding (CRSP variable shrout). Data on shares available for borrowing are from
DataExplorers (now owned by Markit), a securities lending data provider.

Daily variables constructed using intra-day data from TAQ:

Volatility is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared continuously compounded returns over the day.
Following Avramov, Chordia, and Goyal (2006), we compute the continuously compounded returns using TAQ
prices sampled every five minutes. When stocks do not trade at exactly five-minute intervals, we use the trade price
closest to the five-minute mark. Results using quote prices are very similar. The variable is winsorized at the 1% and
99% to reduce the impact of outliers.

Amihud’s (2002) illiquidity measure is defined as the average, over a day, of the absolute value of the five-minute
continuously compounded return multiplied by 1,000,000 which then is divided by the dollar trading volume within
the same five-minute interval. We compute the continuously compounded returns using TAQ prices sampled every
five minutes. Results using quote prices are very similar. The variable is winsorized at the 1% and 99% to reduce the
impact of outliers.

Daily options-related variables (from OptionMetrics):

Put-call trading volume ratio is constructed as follows. First, for each pair of traded put and call options with the
same strike price (OptionMetrics variable strike_price) and exercise date (OptionMetrics variable exdate), we
compute the put-call ratio of the daily trading volume (OptionMetrics variable volume). Second, we compute the
weighted average of the daily trading volume ratios for all the put and call option pairs, weighted by open interest
(OptionMetrics variable open_interest) on the corresponding put-call option pair for a given stock.


                                                                                                                        39
Put option implied volatility is the weighted average of the implied volatility of all traded put options on a day for a
given stock, weighted by open interest (OptionMetrics variable open_interest) on each of the traded put options for
that stock. The implied volatility measure for each traded put option is obtained directly from OptionMetrics
(variable impl_volatility).

Put-call implied volatility ratio is constructed as follows. First, for each pair of traded put and call options with the
same strike price (OptionMetrics variable strike_price) and exercise date (OptionMetrics variable exdate), we
compute the put-call ratio of the daily implied volatilities (OptionMetrics variable impl_volatility). Second, we
compute the weighted average of the daily implied volatility ratios for all the put and call option pairs, weighted by
open interest (OptionMetrics variable open_interest) on the corresponding put-call option pair for a given stock.


Firm characteristics (measured as of the most recent calendar month-end before a first report):

Market capitalization is defined as the product, reported in millions, of the end-of-month share price (CRSP
variable prc) and the total number of shares outstanding (CRSP variable shrout).

Book/market ratio is measured as the ratio of a firm’s book value of equity (Compustat item seq + txditc - pstkrv) to
its market value (Compustat item prcc multiplied by Compustat item csho).

Monthly volatility is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared daily returns (CRSP variable ret) over a
month.

Monthly Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure is constructed as follows. We use daily CRSP data (CRSP variables
ret, prc, and vol) to calculate the ratio of absolute stock return (multiplied by 1,000,000) to dollar trading volume for
each day, after which we average these daily ratios over a month.


Short-seller characteristics

Credible is defined as follows. We examine the arb’s prior track record, on the assumption that arbs with a stronger
track record are more readily believed when they target a stock. We measure an arb’s track record at time t as the
rolling mean of the three-month cumulative abnormal returns of all his previous reports (issued at least three months
before time t, to avoid look-ahead bias) that are independently confirmed. (Confirmatory actions include charges by
regulators, earnings restatements, class action lawsuits, trading halts, or delisting notices by exchanges.) We require
each arb to have issued at least two reports before we compute a track record. A report issued at time t is coded as
more credible if the arb’s prior track record produced profits (a negative rolling mean CAR) and as less credible
otherwise. Credible is set to missing for reports that raise only (over)valuation concerns without providing new facts
previously unknown to investors.

Figure A2. Examples of Photos and Video Snapshots Contained in Reports
Panel A shows a photo of a target firm’s production assets (left) that the report compares to a photo of the more modern looking production assets of the firm’s
main competitor (right). Panel B shows snapshots of video clips of a different target firm’s manufacturing site taken on two different dates (the video on the left
was taken three months before the video on the right), both showing an apparent lack of commercial activity of a scale commensurate with the company’s
financial reports.

Table 1. Summary Statistics for the 17 Arbitrageurs.
The sample contains 17 arbitrageurs who target 113 firms with a total of 332 reports over the period from July 2006 to December 2011. Note that there are 118
first reports on 113 target companies, as two arbs released first reports on the same day in the case of five target companies. The table presents, for each of the 17
arbs, summary statistics on the number of reports and target firms as well as post-release returns and profits and the credibility of a report. The year started is the
year in which the arb first released a report. (Citron Research and Asensio & Co. started before the beginning of our sample period.) For variable definitions and
details of their construction, see Appendix A.

Table 3. Information Discovery and Report Contents.
The table provides a breakdown of the 332 sample reports according to whether they convey the results of
information production (i.e., the discovery of facts previously unknown to investors) or whether they result from
information processing (i.e., the reinterpretation of already known data). The former type of report contains concerns
regarding financial reporting, governance, or “red flag” events. Panel A presents a frequency breakdown of the main
concerns based on our reading of the reports. The latter type of report, tabulated in Panel B, essentially claims a
stock is overvalued based on a different interpretation of known data.

Table 4. Cumulative Abnormal Returns Around Report Releases.
This table reports Fama-French/momentum four-factor cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) of target firms
measured over different event windows leading up to the release of a report and for the report-day itself. Panel A
focuses on first reports. Panel B focuses on follow-on reports. For variable definitions and details of their
construction, see Appendix A. We perform a two-sided t-test for mean CARs, a Wilcoxon test for median CARs,
and generalized Z test for the number of negative CARs, and use ***, **, and * to denote significance at the 1%,
5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 5. Abnormal Returns and Trading by Type of Report and Shorting Cost.
This table reports average abnormal return and trading statistics on the report date in subsamples sorted by the
credibility of the report (in Panel A), the nature of the information discovery (in Panel B), and the cost of shorting as
measured using either shorting fees (in Panel C) or the supply of lendable stock available for borrowing (in Panel
D). Since the credibility-based subsamples in Panel A include follow-up reports for the same target, we also report
abnormal returns on the day the first report is released. Panels B, C, and D include only first reports. Panels C and D
focus on the 91 targets for which data on shorting fees and the supply of lendable stock are available as of the
baseline period (one month before the release of the first report). For variable definitions and details of their
construction, see Appendix A. We use ***, **, and * to denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level (two-
sided), respectively.
