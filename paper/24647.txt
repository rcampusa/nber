                                           ABSTRACT

A headline result from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment is that emergency room (ER) utilization
increased. A seemingly contradictory result from the Massachusetts health reform is that ER utilization
decreased. I reconcile both results by identifying treatment effect heterogeneity within the Oregon
experiment and extrapolating it to Massachusetts. Even though Oregon compliers increased their ER
utilization, they were adversely selected relative to Oregon never takers, who would have decreased
their ER utilization. Massachusetts expanded coverage from a higher level to healthier compliers.
Therefore, Massachusetts compliers are comparable to a subset of Oregon never takers, which can
reconcile the results.

1   Introduction

Findings from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment are considered the “gold standard” for
evidence in health economics because they are based on a randomized lottery. The state of Oregon
conducted the lottery in 2008 as a fair way to expand eligibility for its Medicaid health insur-
ance program to a limited number of uninsured individuals. The lottery also effectively created
a randomized experiment that facilitated evaluation of the impact of expanding health insurance
coverage.
    A headline finding from the Oregon experiment is that health insurance coverage increased
emergency room (ER) utilization (Taubman et al., 2014). Legislation requires that emergency
rooms see all patients regardless of coverage, so the uninsured often access the healthcare system
through the ER. There was hope that coverage would decrease ER utilization, either because of
substitution toward primary care or because of improved health. However, it is plausible that
coverage increased ER utilization because formerly uninsured individuals could visit the ER at
lower personal cost after gaining coverage. The sign and magnitude of the treatment effect of
insurance coverage on ER utilization are important for policy evaluation because care provided in
the ER is expensive, but the insured may value additional ER care below its cost.
    The finding that ER utilization increased in Oregon was particularly surprising because previ-
ous evidence from an expansion of insurance coverage due to the Massachusetts health reform of
2006 showed that ER utilization decreased or stayed the same (Chen et al., 2011; Smulowitz et al.,
2011; Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Miller, 2012). Unlike the Oregon policy, the Massachusetts
reform was a natural experiment that did not involve randomization. Therefore, it is tempting to
dismiss results based on the Massachusetts reform and to focus on results from Oregon as the
definitive answer for how insurance expansions affect ER utilization. Discussion of the Oregon
experiment and the Massachusetts reform in the New York Times has done just that (Tavernise,
2014).
    However, when results from two experiments give different answers, it need not be that one
experiment must be flawed. Instead, it could be that each experiment yields a different local

                                                2
average treatment effect (LATE), in the terminology of Imbens and Angrist (1994). If each LATE
is derived from the same underlying marginal treatment effect (MTE) function, as introduced by
Björklund and Moffitt (1987) and further developed by Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005),
Carneiro et al. (2011), Brinch et al. (2017), and Cornelissen et al. (2018), among others, then it is
possible to use the MTE function to recover the two different LATEs. In this paper, I demonstrate
that it is possible to reconcile the Oregon and Massachusetts results as two different LATEs that
arise from a common MTE function.
   I begin by providing background on the Oregon and Massachusetts policies and the data used to
study them. In my view, the most important difference between the policies is that they expanded
coverage to individuals who likely differed in their underlying health and the impact that coverage
would have on their ER utilization. The Oregon policy expanded Medicaid coverage to uninsured
low-income individuals who entered a lottery. In contrast, the Massachusetts policy expanded
coverage statewide to higher-income individuals with more coverage options available to them
who might have enrolled mainly to avoid a penalty. On this basis, individuals who gained coverage
in Oregon might have been sicker and more eager to increase their ER utilization upon gaining
coverage.
   To allow the impact of health insurance on ER utilization to differ across individuals who differ
in their probability of gaining coverage under the Oregon and Massachusetts policies, I specify a
heterogeneous treatment effects model in which the “treatment” is health insurance coverage. I be-
gin with an MTE model shown by Vytlacil (2002) to assume no more than the LATE assumptions
of Imbens and Angrist (1994). I do so to make it easier to evaluate the underlying assumptions.
   Combining the model with data, I find comparable adverse selection into health insurance in
Oregon and Massachusetts. I identify adverse selection by comparing outcomes and covariates
that measure health in the absence of insurance coverage across “always takers” who are treated
regardless of the policy, “compliers” who are treated if and only if the policy is in place, and
“never takers” who are untreated regardless of the policy, in the terminology of (Angrist et al.,
1996). In Oregon, I find adverse selection in terms of ER utilization, previous ER utilization, and


                                                 3
self-reported health. In Massachusetts, I also find adverse selection in terms of self-reported health.
The Massachusetts reform expanded coverage from a higher level than did the Oregon experiment,
so the model implies that I should compare the Massachusetts compliers to a subset of the Oregon
never takers. Patterns in self-reported health support the comparison of Massachusetts compliers
to Oregon never takers and show that adverse selection is quantitatively similar in both contexts.
   Next, I build on my adverse selection findings to identify and compare treatment effect hetero-
geneity in both contexts. To do so, I make an ancillary assumption beyond the LATE assumptions
that allows selection and the treatment effect to vary linearly with the fraction treated. I motivate
linearity in selection with my findings on adverse selection, and I build on those findings by al-
lowing the treatment effect to vary as selection varies. Under this ancillary assumption, I estimate
an MTE function in Oregon that shows that the treatment effect decreases from always takers to
compliers to never takers, such that even though the average treatment effect on compliers is posi-
tive, the treatment effect on never takers is negative. Under an additional shape restriction, I show
that previous ER utilization, a proxy for health, explains this treatment effect heterogeneity. In
Massachusetts, I recast results from my previous work (Hackmann et al., 2015) in terms of the
model with the ancillary assumption to show that they also imply an MTE function in which the
treatment effect on health care utilization is decreasing from always takers to compliers to never
takers.
   Given comparable adverse selection and treatment effect heterogeneity in both contexts, I rec-
oncile the results from both contexts by extrapolating the Oregon MTE function to Massachusetts.
Reweighting the Oregon MTE reconciles the positive LATE in Oregon with the negative LATE
in Massachusetts by comparing Massachusetts compliers to a subset of Oregon never takers, who
would have decreased their ER utilization. Accordingly, the reweighting predicts a decrease in
ER utilization for Massachusetts compliers. This prediction is arguably economically significant
because it is of the same order of magnitude as the decrease found by Miller (2012), but it is not
statistically significant, which is unsurprising given imprecision in the underlying Oregon LATE.
While the prediction provides a summary measure, I would not want to rely on it alone for the


                                                  4
reconciliation, especially without evidence that supports the strong assumptions on which it relies.
Rather, I see the findings that motivate the assumptions, specifically the findings of comparable
adverse selection and treatment effect heterogeneity in Oregon and Massachusetts, as important
components of the reconciliation that are not reflected in a single point estimate.
   I do not claim that my approach is the only way to reconcile the Oregon and Massachusetts
findings. It is possible to posit a myriad of theories for why the Oregon and Massachusetts LATEs
could differ, and it is difficult to reject them on the basis of two data points that represent two
LATEs. However, my approach incorporates several data points in a way that is disciplined by
the model, and it can reconcile the LATEs without additional theories. Furthermore, my approach
could incorporate some additional theories. For example, it implicitly incorporates some supply-
side differences by allowing the treatment effect to change with the fraction treated. Moreover,
my approach is feasible given the available data. My analysis of the Oregon MTE shows that
the meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity is across the unobservable that separates always
takers from compliers from never takers, which is related to observable differences in self-reported
health but not related to differences in other available observables. Accordingly, I demonstrate that
an alternative approach that uses available observables to reweight the LATE from Oregon cannot
reconcile the results.
   In the process of reconciling the Oregon and Massachusetts results, I contribute to the empirical
and theoretical literature on adverse selection. Previous work on the Oregon experiment has not
emphasized adverse selection. My own previous work on the Massachusetts reform (Hackmann
et al., 2012, 2015) has reported adverse selection in Massachusetts using an extension of the Einav
et al. (2010) cost curve test. By recasting these results in terms of the MTE model that builds on
the LATE assumptions, I ground them in terms of a familiar framework from the treatment effects
literature and formalize the distinction between adverse selection and treatment effect heterogene-
ity. This distinction is less clear in my previous work and in other work that relies on the Einav
et al. (2010) cost curve test, which can find selection heterogeneity, treatment effect heterogeneity,
or a combination of the two, depending on the particular cost curve.


                                                  5
    I also contribute to the literature on treatment effects. The MTE literature generally focuses on a
single context, but I use treatment effect heterogeneity within Oregon to reconcile results across the
Oregon and Massachusetts contexts. As the foundation for reconciliation, I introduce the concept
of selection heterogeneity, which generalizes the concept of “selection bias” from the MTE and
LATE literatures (see Heckman et al., 1998; Angrist, 1998). Selection bias is not identified under
the LATE assumptions, but I demonstrate that it is possible to identify a special case of selection
heterogeneity under the LATE assumptions with outcomes as well as covariates. Using the concept
of selection of heterogeneity and my associated empirical findings, which show adverse selection,
I interpret and motivate an ancillary assumption beyond the LATE assumptions that allows me
to identify treatment effect heterogeneity. This assumption has been made in the MTE literature
without such motivation (Brinch et al., 2017). Throughout, I present my results using simple
figures that I developed for an earlier version of this paper (Kowalski, 2016). All of the content
from that version has been subsumed here, except for content on bounds that are uninformative
in this context. I use that content to provide informative bounds in the context of a clinical trial
on mammography (Kowalski, 2020b). In my only other closely related work (Kowalski, 2020a),
I explicitly do not break any new ground, but I demonstrate with stylized examples how recent
advances from the treatment effects literature, inclusive of contributions made here, can inform
external validity. I co-developed the Stata command mtebinary (Kowalski et al., 2018) to make the
calculations performed here widely accessible for reconciliation of results from future experiments.

2   Background and Data

The focus of my work is on reconciling a positive LATE in Oregon with a negative LATE in
Massachusetts, not on evaluating the Oregon experiment or previous analysis of it, which has been
discussed in Baicker et al. (2013, 2014), Taubman et al. (2014), and Finkelstein et al. (2016). How-
ever, I provide some brief background on the Oregon experiment and the Massachusetts reform that
motivates that approach that I take to reconcile the results.
    The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment expanded Medicaid coverage to uninsured individ-



                                                  6
uals who entered a lottery that took place from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009. Entrants
were only required to provide eligibility documentation if they won. Therefore, many individuals
who were already eligible for Medicaid entered the lottery, perhaps unaware of their eligibility.
Many such individuals enrolled in Medicaid even if they lost the lottery, perhaps because an emer-
gency room facilitated submission of their eligibility documentation after they received uncom-
pensated care. On the other end of the spectrum, many lottery winners did not enroll in Medicaid,
either because they did not submit eligibility documentation, or because they did not meet the
eligibility requirements, which included income below the federal poverty level, or both.
   The Massachusetts reform of 2006 expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured individ-
uals statewide through a variety of mechanisms: an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and other
subsidized coverage to individuals with incomes below three times the federal poverty level, re-
forms on the individual health insurance market, a mandate that employers had to offer coverage
or pay a penalty, and a mandate that individuals had to enroll in coverage or pay a penalty. Mas-
sachusetts had a very high rate of coverage before the reform, and coverage expanded to a higher
level after the reform. However, coverage was still not universal.
   I analyze the Oregon experiment using publicly available individual-level data. I am able to
replicate the LATE of 0.41 reported by Taubman et al. (2014) almost exactly, limited only by minor
changes made to the publicly available data to hinder identification of individuals with large and
uncommon numbers of ER visits. However, that LATE is obtained from a regression that includes
controls for previous ER utilization as well as the number of lottery entrants from a household. It
would not be valid to obtain a LATE without any control for the number of lottery entrants because
the probability of winning the lottery was only random conditional on the number of entrants.
Therefore, I control for the number of lottery entrants nonparametrically by restricting my analysis
sample to the 19,643 individuals that were the only members of their household to enter the lottery
from the full sample of 24,646 individuals with administrative data on their visits to the ER. By
doing so and excluding controls for previous ER utilization for simplicity, I obtain a smaller and
statistically insignificant, but still positive, LATE of 0.27.


                                                    7
      I analyze the Massachusetts reform using individual-level data that I previously used to analyze
the Massachusetts reform in Kolstad and Kowalski (2012) and Hackmann et al. (2015). Estimates
from the literature on the impact of the Massachusetts reform on ER utilization (Chen et al., 2011;
Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Miller, 2012; Smulowitz et al., 2011) reflect enrollment in the entire
state. Therefore, it is important that I do not attempt to reconcile estimates using Massachusetts
data that are restricted to a subset of the population, such as individuals eligible for Medicaid.

3     Model

I begin with a model shown by Vytlacil (2002) to assume no more than the LATE assumptions.
To ensure that I do not introduce any ancillary assumptions before doing so explicitly, I follow the
exposition from Heckman and Vytlacil (2005) closely. I extend that exposition by illustrating the
model with simple figures and by presenting it in terms of variables relevant to the Oregon and
Massachusetts contexts.

3.1    First Stage: Enrollment

In line with the results that I aim to reconcile, I specify a binary treatment D that represents enroll-
ment in Medicaid in Oregon and enrollment in any health insurance coverage in Massachusetts.
Let VT represent potential utility in the treated state, and let VU represent potential utility in the
untreated state. The following definition relates realized utility V to the potential utilities:

                                        V = VU + (VT −VU )D.                                         (1)

I specify the net benefit of treatment in terms of the potential utilities as follows:

                                      VT −VU = µD (Z, X) − νD ,                                      (2)

where µD (·) is an unspecified function, Z is an observed binary instrument, X is an optional ob-
served vector of covariates, and νD is an unobserved term with an unspecified distribution. Vytlacil
(2002) shows that the additive separability in (2) is equivalent to the LATE monotonicity assump-
tion of Imbens and Angrist (1994). In the Oregon context, Z indicates winning the lottery. In the
Massachusetts context, Z indicates that the reform has occurred, which I also interpret as “winning


                                                   8
the lottery” for parallelism. Individuals with Z = 0 are lottery losers. I refer to them as the “control
group.” Individuals with Z = 1 are lottery winners. I refer to them as the “intervention group.” I
need different terminology for the intervention group (Z = 1) and the treated group (D = 1) be-
cause, in both contexts, not all lottery winners are treated. To derive an equation for treatment as a
function of the lottery outcome, I assume

A.1. (Continuity) The cumulative distribution function of νD conditional on X, which I denote
     with F(· | X), is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

A.2. (First Stage Independence) The random variable νD is independent of Z conditional on X.

A.3. (Instrument Relevance) µD (Z, X) is a nondegenerate random variable conditional on X.

Under A.1, the transformation of νD by the function F(· | X) is a normalization that yields UD =
F(νD | X), which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, as I show for completeness in Appendix
A. Since νD enters negatively into the net benefit of treatment, I interpret UD as the normalized
“unobserved net cost of treatment.” The further imposition of A.2 implies the following treatment
equation, which states that individuals are treated if their unobserved net cost of treatment is weakly
less than a threshold:
                                 D = 1{UD ≤ P(D = 1 | Z = z, X)}.                                   (3)

I show the derivation in Appendix B for completeness. Under A.3, the threshold is different for
lottery winners and losers with the same vector of covariates X, which yields the following two
cases:
                                       
                                       
                                        1{UD ≤ pCX }, if Z = 0
                                       
                                  D=                                                                (4)
                                       
                                        1{UD ≤ pIX },
                                                           if Z = 1

where pCX = P D = 1 | Z = 0, X) is the probability of treatment in the control group conditional
on X, and pIX = P D = 1 | Z = 1, X) is the probability of treatment in the intervention group
conditional on X.
   These two special cases of the treatment equation allow me to identify three distinct ranges of
the unobserved net cost of treatment, UD . As originally shown by Imbens and Rubin (1997) and

                                                   9
Vytlacil (2002), the three ranges of UD correspond to ranges for always takers, compliers, and never
takers. I show these ranges in Figure 1 using data from the Oregon experiment. Within my analysis
sample, 15% of lottery losers enroll and 41% of lottery winners enroll. Accordingly, in Figure 1,
I depict pC = 0.15 and pI = 0.41, omitting the X subscript. In the top line of Figure 1, I depict
the lottery losers. By (4), treated enrolled lottery losers have unobserved net cost of treatment UD
in [0, 0.15]. Treated lottery losers are always takers. In the middle line of Figure 1, I depict the
lottery winners. By (4), the untreated lottery winners have unobserved net cost of treatment UD in
(0.41, 1]. Untreated lottery winners are never takers. In the bottom line of Figure 1, I depict UD for
lottery losers and winners on the same axis, and I label the implied ranges of UD for always and
never takers. Individuals with values of unobserved net cost of treatment UD in the middle range,
(0.15, 0.41], enroll in Medicaid if they win the lottery, but they do not enroll if they lose the lottery.
These individuals are compliers.

    Figure 1: Ranges of UD Show Ordering from Always Takers to Compliers to Never Takers

   Z=0          D=1                                          D=0


   Z=1                     D=1                                          D=0


                Always        Compliers                        Never Takers
                Takers
            0       pC = 0.15           pI = 0.41                                                    1
                                 UD : unobserved net cost of treatment


   The ordering from always takers to compliers to never takers along UD is an ordering across
an important margin: the margin of treatment takeup. In Oregon and Massachusetts, as enrollment
expands, always takers enroll first, followed by compliers, followed by never takers. There could
be several mechanisms for this ordering, all of which are captured by the unobserved term UD . The
model does not require me to specify what is included in UD . Instead, it gives me a framework that
I can use to examine which factors separate always takers from compliers and never takers.




                                                   10
3.2    Second Stage: ER Utilization

I relate treatment D to realized ER utilization Y as follows:

                                        Y = YU + (YT −YU )D,                                      (5)

where I specify potential ER utilization if treated YT and if untreated YU as follows:

                                        YT = gT (X,UD , γT )                                      (6)

                                        YU = gU (X,UD , γU ),                                     (7)

where gU (·) and gT (·) are unspecified functions, X is the same optional vector of observed covari-
ates from the first stage, UD is the normalized unobserved net cost of treatment from the first stage,
and γT and γU represent additional unobserved terms with unspecified distributions in the second
stage. To make sure that average treated and untreated potential outcomes are defined for each X,
I assume:

A.4. (First and Second Stage Independence) The random vectors (νD ,γT ) and (νD ,γU ) are inde-
       pendent of Z conditional on X.

A.5. (Treated and Untreated) 0 < P(D = 1 | X) < 1.

A.6. (Second Stage Technical Assumption) The values of E[YT ] and E[YU ] are finite.

While A.4 implies A.2, I introduce them both to separate the first and second stage assumptions.
As a whole, because I have only made stylistic changes to the model presented by Heckman and
Vytlacil (2005), by the proof of Vytlacil (2002), the model, given by the utility equations (1)

      I illustrate implications of the model graphically in Figure 2 using data from Oregon. Along
the vertical axis, I depict the unobserved net cost of treatment UD as I do in Figure 1. Along the

this figure, I illustrate how the model makes it possible to derive average outcomes for always

                                                      UD : unobserved net cost of treatment

Note. The number of ER visits represents the total number of visits to the emergency department during the study pe-
riod from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009. Treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. pC is the probability
of treatment in the control group, and pI is the probability of treatment in the intervention group. Some differences
between statistics might not appear internally consistent because of rounding.


          To derive average outcomes for always takers, compliers, and never takers, I begin by consid-
ering average outcomes in groups formed by the interaction of the treatment and the instrument.
Treated individuals in control must be always takers, so the average treated outcome of always
takers is E[YT |0 ≤ UD < pC ] = E[Y |D = 1, Z = 0]. In Figure 2, I plot this value of average ER
utilization from the Oregon experiment, 1.89 visits, over the support of the unobserved net cost
of treatment UD for always takers, using a dotted line to indicate that it represents an average


                                                                    12
treated outcome. Untreated individuals in intervention must be never takers, so the average un-
treated outcome of never takers is E[YU |pI ≤ UD ≤ 1] = E[Y |D = 0, Z = 1]. I plot this value, 0.85
visits, over the support for never takers, using a dashed line to indicate that it represents an av-
erage untreated outcome. Derivation of the average treated outcome for compliers is somewhat
more involved. Treated individuals in intervention are always takers and compliers, so the average
treated outcome among always takers and compliers is E[YT |0 ≤ UD < pI ] = E[Y |D = 1, Z = 1].
I plot this value, 1.61 visits, over the relevant support. The average treated outcome of compli-
ers is a weighted average of the average treated outcome among always takers and compliers and
the average treated outcome of always takers. Because I can determine the weights and the re-
quired average outcomes from the figure, I can back out the average treated outcome of compliers
                                  pI E[YT |D=1,Z=1]−pC E[YT |0≤UD <pC ]
as E[YT |pC ≤ UD < pI ] =                        pI −pC                 .   I plot this value, 1.45 visits, using a
lighter dotted line over the support for compliers. The derivation of average untreated outcomes
                                                                      (1−pC )E[YU |D=0,Z=0]−(1−pI )E[YU |pI ≤UD ≤1]
of compliers is similar such that E[YU |pC ≤ UD < pI ] =                                 pI −pC                     .   I
plot this value, 1.19 visits, using a lighter dashed line over the support for compliers.
    Figure 3 removes the intermediate steps of the derivation from Figure 2 to isolate the average
outcomes of always takers, compliers, and never takers. The difference in visits between treated
and untreated compliers is equal to the LATE, as shown by Imbens and Rubin (1997). I depict the
LATE with an arrow to indicate that it has magnitude and direction. The positive LATE of 0.27 is
consistent with the headline finding of Taubman et al. (2014), who show that insurance increases
ER utilization for compliers. Figure 3 provides more information than the LATE alone. As shown
by Angrist (1990) and Angrist and Krueger (1992), it is possible to calculate the LATE even if
it is not possible to calculate the average outcomes of always takers, compliers, and never takers
depicted in Figure 3.1 This additional information can call into question whether the LATE applies
to always and never takers, who represent substantial and distinct groups. Always takers visited
    1 Calculation of the average outcomes depicted in Figure 3 requires the ability to calculate average outcomes formed

by the interaction of the treatment and the instrument. In contrast, calculation of the LATE only requires the ability to
calculate average outcomes formed by the treatment and the instrument separately. Using the Wald (1940) approach,
the reduced form E[Y |Z = 1] − E[Y |Z = 0] is equal to 0.07, and the first stage E[D|Z = 1] − E[D|Z = 0] is equal to
0.26. Dividing the reduced form by the first stage yields a LATE of 0.27 visits, which is equal to the LATE reported
in Figure 3.

the ER 1.89 times, compliers visited 1.45 times if enrolled and 1.19 times if not, and never takers
visited 0.85 times. These differences in the average outcomes across always takers, compliers, and
never takers could reflect selection or treatment effect heterogeneity.

3.3                      Definitions of Selection and Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

I define selection and treatment effect heterogeneity on Y along UD using the following functions:

                                             Selection Heterogeneity:    MUO(x, p) = E [YU | X = x,UD = p]

                                      Treatment Effect Heterogeneity:     MTE(x, p) = E [YT −YU | X = x,UD = p]

          Selection + Treatment Effect Heterogeneity:                     MTO(x, p) = E [YT | X = x,UD = p] ,


                                                                    14
where x is a realization of the optional covariate vector X and p is a realization of the unobserved
net cost of treatment UD .
   I refer to the first function as the “marginal untreated outcome (MUO)” function, and I use it to
define “selection heterogeneity,” a term that I use to capture positive and negative selection, also re-
ferred to as “adverse” and “advantageous” selection in the insurance literature. The MTE literature
uses the MUO function as an intermediate function in the derivation of the second function, the
“marginal treatment effect (MTE)” function of Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005). How-
ever, the literature does not use the MUO function to define selection heterogeneity (see Carneiro
and Lee, 2009; Brinch et al., 2017). Instead, the MTE literature and the LATE literature focus on
the following definition of “selection bias” (see Heckman et al., 1998; Angrist, 1998):

                             Selection Bias: E[YU | D = 1] − E[YU | D = 0].                         (8)

I demonstrate that selection heterogeneity generalizes selection bias by expressing (8) as the fol-
lowing weighted integral of the MUO function:
      Z 1h
              1     n                                                  o
                      P(Z = 0) 1{0 ≤ p < pC } + P(Z = 1) 1{0 ≤ p < pI }
       0 P(D = 1)
              1     n                                                  oi
        −             P(Z = 0) 1{pC ≤ p < 1} + P(Z = 1) 1{pI ≤ p < 1} MUO(p) dp.
           P(D = 0)
The first term of the integrand is the average value of the MUO function conditional on receiving
treatment. The second term is the average value of the MUO function conditional on not receiving
treatment. This weighted integral shows that selection bias is a function of the fraction of lottery
winners, P(Z = 1), unlike selection heterogeneity. To the extent that selection bias is intended to
capture a real-world phenomenon, it is undesirable for it to be an explicit function of the experi-
mental design used to estimate it. Furthermore, selection bias is not identified without an ancillary
assumption because the untreated outcome for always takers is not observed. However, I show that
a different policy-relevant special case of selection heterogeneity is identified without an ancillary
assumption.
   Turning to the last function, which I refer to as the “marginal treated outcome (MTO)” function,
I emphasize that it defines the sum of selection heterogeneity plus treatment effect heterogeneity.

                                                  15
The literature considers the MTO and MUO functions as intermediate inputs in the derivation of
the MTE function, but it does not make a meaningful distinction between them (see Brinch et al.,
2017). It is tempting to assert that there should be no meaningful distinction between the MTO
and MUO functions because it should be possible to rename the treated as the untreated and vice
versa. However, doing so would have material implications because it would reverse the sign of
the treatment effect. The treatment effect has magnitude and direction: it is equal to YT − YU ,
not |YT − YU |, so the distinction between treated and untreated is material to the definition of the
treatment effect. Therefore, the distinction between treated and untreated is also material to the
definition of treatment effect heterogeneity. Reversing the definition of the treatment would imply
that treatment effect heterogeneity is heterogeneity in the untreated outcome minus the treated
outcome, so there would still be a meaningful distinction between the MUO and MTO functions.
Heterogeneity in untreated outcomes would represent the sum of selection and treatment effect
heterogeneity, and heterogeneity in treated outcomes would represent selection heterogeneity.

4   Findings

I have three main findings. First, I find evidence of comparable adverse selection within Oregon
and Massachusetts along the unobservable that separates always takers from compliers from never
takers. Massachusetts compliers have similar self-reported health to a subset of the Oregon never
takers, and are thus healthier than Oregon compliers given the adverse selection I find. Second, I
use this evidence of adverse selection to motivate an ancillary assumption to estimate treatment ef-
fect heterogeneity. I find that treatment effect heterogeneity in Oregon is decreasing such that even
though compliers increase their ER utilization upon gaining coverage, never takers would decrease
their ER utilization upon gaining coverage. I present comparable evidence of decreasing treatment
effect heterogeneity in Massachusetts. Third, using the Oregon experiment as the “gold standard,”
I extrapolate treatment effect heterogeneity from within the Oregon experiment to Massachusetts,
and I reconcile the positive LATE in Oregon with the negative LATE in Massachusetts. I show that
the observables available in both settings cannot reconcile the results via LATE-reweighting.

4.1     Comparable Adverse Selection in Oregon and Massachusetts

4.1.1     Adverse Selection in Oregon

I identify a special case of selection heterogeneity using a test that I refer to as the “untreated
outcome test.” This test rejects selection heterogeneity if the test statistic, the average untreated
outcome of compliers minus the average untreated outcome of never takers, is different from zero.
I derive the average untreated outcomes required for the test statistic in the discussion of Fig-
ure 2. The untreated outcome test is similar or equivalent to tests proposed by Bertanha and
Imbens (2014), Guo et al. (2014), and Black et al. (2017), which are generalized by Mogstad et al.
(2018).2 I emphasize that the untreated outcome test is also equivalent to the Einav et al. (2010)
cost curve test for selection heterogeneity if applied to uninsured ER utilization. Relative to the
literature, my innovation with respect to the untreated outcome test is that I show that it identifies
selection heterogeneity without any assumptions beyond the LATE assumptions. This follows be-
cause having defined selection heterogeneity via the MUO function in an MTE model that assumes
no more than the LATE assumptions, I express the untreated outcome test statistic as the following
weighted integral of the MUO function:
                                                                Z 1
      E[YU | pC < UD ≤ pI ] − E[YU | pI < UD ≤ 1] =                   (ω(p, pC , pI ) − ω(p, pI , 1)) MUO(p) dp,
                                                                 0

with weights ω(p, pL , pH ) = 1{pL ≤ p < pH }/(pH − pL ), where the first term represents the av-
erage untreated outcome of compliers (pC < UD ≤ pI ) and the second term represents the average
untreated outcome of never takers (pI < UD ≤ 1). Randomization drives identification by creating
a distinction between never takers and untreated compliers.
      Applying the untreated outcome test to the Oregon experiment, I reject the null hypothesis of
selection homogeneity. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 1, when they are not enrolled in Medicaid,
   2I   refer to the Bertanha and Imbens (2014) test as “similar” to the untreated outcome test because the authors
develop it for a regression discontinuity context, but it is effectively equivalent. However, the authors do not interpret
it as a test of selection heterogeneity; instead, they interpret it as one component of a test for external validity. Guo
et al. (2014) propose a test that is equivalent to the untreated outcome test as one component of a test for unmeasured
confounding, but they also do not discuss it as a test for selection heterogeneity. Black et al. (2017) propose a test
that is equivalent to the untreated outcome test as a test for selection bias on the untreated outcome, which they define
with their test statistic. They do not discuss how their definition of selection bias relates to the MUO function or to the
definition of selection bias from the literature.


                                                           17
compliers visit the ER an average of 1.19 times, while never takers visit 0.85 times. The difference
of 0.34 visits, reported as the untreated outcome test statistic, is statistically different from zero.
To calculate the standard error of the test statistic, I use a nonparametric bootstrap. Specifically,
I calculate the standard error as the standard deviation of the estimates over 1,000 replications.
Under the model, compliers enroll in Medicaid before never takers, so the selection heterogeneity
that I find indicates adverse selection along the unobservable that separates compliers from never
takers.

              Number of ER Visits for Always Takers, Compliers, and Never Takers




Note. Standard errors from a nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 replications are in parentheses. The shaded cells
report extrapolated values from MTE-reweighting via (9)–(11) for treated individuals (N=4,725) and untreated indi-
viduals (N=14,897). The number of ER visits represents the total number of visits to the emergency department during
the study period from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009. Treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. Some
differences between statistics might not appear internally consistent because of rounding.



    Next, I characterize adverse selection in terms of observables. To do so, I define selection
heterogeneity on X along UD :

                             Selection Heterogeneity on X:          E [X | UD = p] ,

which captures how the covariate vector X changes with the unobserved net cost of treatment
UD . I identify selection heterogeneity on X by comparing the average covariate vectors of always
takers, compliers, and never takers. The calculation of the average covariate vectors for always
and never takers is analogous to the calculation of average outcomes for always and never takers.

                                                        18
However, even though average outcomes of compliers should depend on whether they win or lose
the lottery, average covariates of compliers should not. Therefore, I weight the average covariates
of compliers who win and lose the lottery by their respective probabilities:
                                  h p                                  pC                       i
                                        I
   E[X | pC < UD ≤ pI ] = P(Z = 1)          E[X | D = 1, Z = 1] −            E[X | D = 1, Z = 0]
                                    pI − pC                         pI − pC
                                 h 1− p                            1 − pI                      i
                                          C
                        +P(Z = 0)           E[X | D = 0, Z = 0] −           E[X | D = 0, Z = 1] .
                                   pI − pC                         pI − pC
Like selection heterogeneity on Y , selection heterogeneity on a single covariate can be either pos-
itive or negative between compliers and never takers. It can also be either positive or negative
between always takers and compliers.
   I begin by examining self-reported health. I only observe self-reported health for a subset of
the individuals in the Oregon administrative data who were surveyed. Self-reported health was
elicited after randomization, and Finkelstein et al. (2012) shows that Medicaid improved self-
reported health. That is, there is a treatment effect on self-reported health. To ensure that my
examination of selection heterogeneity is not contaminated by treatment effect heterogeneity, I
only compare the self-reported health of untreated individuals: compliers who lost the lottery and
never takers.
   As shown in Table 2, within Oregon, I find that never takers are less likely to be in fair or
poor health than untreated compliers, and the difference is statistically significant. Therefore, I
find adverse selection on self-reported health that is consistent with the adverse selection on ER
utilization that I find using the untreated outcome test. This adverse selection indicates that never
takers are healthier than compliers, which may be one reason they visit the ER less frequently.
It would also be interesting to examine whether there is adverse selection from always takers
to compliers, such that compliers are healthier than always takers. However, I do not observe
untreated self-reported health for always takers because it was elicited after randomization.
   To that end, I turn to previous ER utilization as an alternative proxy for health because I ob-
serve it for all individuals, including always takers. Specifically, for each individual in the Oregon
administrative data, I observe the total number of pre-period ER visits from January 1, 2007, to

Note. Standard errors from a nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 replications are in parentheses. Data for the Mas-
sachusetts health reform are taken from pooled annual samples of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) from years 2004–2009 and restricted to ages 21–64 (the age range of the Oregon sample). For the Mas-
sachusetts health reform, treatment is an indicator that equals one for individuals with any form of health insurance
(“Do you have any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or govern-
ment plans such as Medicare?”). The instrument is an indicator that equals one in the post-period of the expansion on
and after July 2007. For the Oregon experiment, treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. “Age” is measured in
year 2008 for the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment and in year 2006 for the Massachusetts health reform. “Fe-
male” is a binary indicator for the sex of the respondent. “English” is a binary indicator that equals one for individuals
in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment who requested materials in English and that equals one for individuals in
the BRFSS who completed the interview in English. The number of pre-period visits is measured before the study
period from January 1, 2007 to March 9, 2008. “Fair or Poor Health” equals one when individuals self-report having
fair or poor health on a 5-point scale. a Number of observations in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment with
nonmissing self-reported health: 5,833. Number of observations in the BRFSS with nonmissing self-reported health:
62,161. Some differences between statistics might not appear internally consistent because of rounding.

March 9, 2008. I report the average pre-period ER utilization for always takers, compliers, and
never takers by cumulative visits in Table 2. As reported, 45% of always takers, 35% of compliers,
and 31% of never takers had at least one previous ER visit, and the differences across groups are
statistically significant. Therefore, I find adverse selection on previous ER utilization, not just from
compliers to never takers, but also from always takers to compliers.
    To further illustrate how previous ER utilization varies from always takers to compliers to
never takers, Figure 4 plots statistics on previous ER utilization from Table 2. Always takers are
more likely to have at least one, at least two, at least three, and at least four previous ER visits
than compliers. Similar relationships hold between compliers and never takers. Furthermore, the
relationships appear approximately linear in the unobserved net cost of treatment UD .

Note. The number of pre-period ER visits represents the number of ER visits before the experiment took place from
January 1, 2007 to March 9, 2008. Treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. pC is the probability of treatment in
the control group, and pI is the probability of treatment in the intervention group.

   Not all observables exhibit such a clear selection pattern. As shown in Table 2, age, sex, and
English-speaking status exhibit patterns that are not even necessarily monotonic from always takers
to compliers to never takers. Therefore, these observables may not drive adverse selection on ER
utilization. In contrast, self-reported health and previous ER utilization, which are both proxies for
health, may drive adverse selection on ER utilization.

4.1.2   Adverse Selection in Massachusetts

Just as I find adverse selection on self-reported health in Oregon, I also find adverse selection
on self-reported health in Massachusetts. Table 2 shows that 21% of untreated Massachusetts
compliers are in fair or poor health, whereas 18% of Massachusetts never takers are in fair or
poor health. As in Oregon, I do not examine self-reported health of always takers because I only
observe them when treated, so their self-reported health could include a treatment effect. Unlike in
Oregon, I do not examine previous ER utilization as an alternative proxy for health because I define
the Massachusetts intervention as after reform and the Massachusetts control as before the reform,
so it is unclear what “previous” ER utilization should represent. In Table 2, I provide evidence of
selection heterogeneity on other observables available in Oregon and Massachusetts. It shows that
always takers are more likely to speak English than compliers.
   Not only is there evidence of adverse selection in terms of self-reported health in both contexts,
but also these selection patterns are quantitatively similar across contexts. Before I can compare
selection patterns in Oregon to selection patterns in Massachusetts, I must assess where the Mas-
sachusetts compliers should lie along the support of the Oregon unobserved net cost of treatment
UD . Recall that in Oregon, the fraction treated among the control group is pC = 0.15, and the
fraction treated among the intervention group is pI = 0.41. These values partition the support of
the unobserved net cost of treatment UD . Therefore, an alternative interpretation of UD is that it
represents the fraction treated among the intervention or control groups. As UD increases from 0
to 1, the fraction treated increases from 0% to 100%.
   As a starting point for comparison, I interpret UD as the fraction treated among the entire
state population before and after the reform in Massachusetts, just as I can interpret it as the frac-

                                                 22
tion treated among the intervention and control groups in Oregon. Whereas the literature takes
difference-in-differences approaches to account for trends in coverage, I only consider a single
difference (before versus after the reform) for simplicity because I show in Kolstad and Kowalski
(2012) that an additional difference that accounts for national trends has very little impact on the
coverage results. Before the Massachusetts reform, the coverage rate in Massachusetts was among
the highest in the nation. According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data used
to examine coverage in Kolstad and Kowalski (2012), the fraction treated increased from 89% be-
fore the reform to 94% after the reform. I label the probability of health insurance coverage before
and after the reform in Massachusetts as pCMA = 0.89 and pMA
                                                          I  = 0.94 along the top axis of Fig-
ure 5. For comparison, I re-label the Oregon probabilities as pCOR = 0.15 and pOR
                                                                               I = 0.41 along the

bottom axis. The comparison implies that Massachusetts compliers are comparable to the subset
of Oregon never takers with an unobserved net cost of treatment between 0.89 and 0.94.
   Institutional details suggest it is reasonable to compare Massachusetts compliers to a subset of
Oregon never takers. The Massachusetts reform included a mandate that required individuals to
pay a penalty if they did not have health insurance. In contrast, the Oregon reform did not include
a penalty. The Massachusetts penalty may have induced individuals who would have been never
takers in the Oregon context to take up coverage and thus become compliers in the Massachusetts
context.
   Patterns in adverse selection on self-reported health provide quantitative evidence that Mas-
sachusetts compliers are comparable to a subset of the Oregon never takers. Figure 5 plots the
fraction of untreated compliers and never takers who report fair or poor health at the midpoints of
the relevant supports of the unobserved net cost of treatment UD in Massachusetts and Oregon. It
also plots lines of best fit within Massachusetts and Oregon. These lines use the observed points
within each state to predict self-reported health at other values of UD . The Oregon prediction is
quantitatively close to the values observed in Massachusetts, demonstrating that the health of Mas-
sachusetts compliers is like that of Oregon never takers with UD between 0.89 and 0.94. These
predictions also demonstrate that there is merit in linear extrapolation of Oregon heterogeneity.

4.2                                    Comparable Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Oregon and Massachusetts

4.2.1                                   Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Oregon

To identify treatment effect heterogeneity on ER utilization along UD , I make an ancillary assump-
tion beyond the model:

AA.1. (Linear Selection Heterogeneity and Linear Treatment Effect Heterogeneity) In (6) and (7),




                                                                                    24
        for k ∈ {T,U}, specify gk (X,UD , γk ) = αk + βkUD + γk , where E [γk | UD = p] = 0. Therefore,

                        MUO(p) = E [YU | UD = p] = αU + βU p

                        MTE(p) = E [YT −YU | UD = p] = (αT − αU ) + (βT − βU ) p

                        MTO(p) = E [YT | UD = p] = αT + βT p.

Brinch et al. (2017) impose an assumption equivalent to this assumption to examine the impact of
family size on child outcomes; Olsen (1980) imposes linearity of the MTO function to examine
the impact of family size on maternal outcomes; and several other papers impose linearity of the
MTE function in other applications (see Moffitt, 2008; French and Song, 2014). Applied work that
extrapolates to all other policies using the LATE also makes a stronger, implicit assumption that
there is no treatment effect heterogeneity, which implies that the MTE function is linear and has
zero slope. I impose AA.1 instead of the weak monotonicity assumption from Brinch et al. (2017)
that I make in the context of a clinical trial on mammography in Kowalski (2020b) because the
resulting bound on the treatment effect for always takers is uninformative about treatment effect
heterogeneity here.
   In the Oregon context, the empirical evidence of adverse selection provides motivation for
AA.1. The evidence of approximately linear adverse selection heterogeneity with respect to previ-
ous ER utilization motivates the assumption that selection heterogeneity is linear. Furthermore, the
evidence of adverse selection with respect to self-reported health indicates that the unobserved net
cost of treatment UD captures health. Therefore, the assumption that treatment effect heterogeneity
is linear allows the treatment effect to vary with health as selection varies with health. I note that
AA.1 allows for selection and treatment effect heterogeneity to have slopes of different signs and
magnitudes. I also note that AA.1 allows for the possibility that there is no selection or treatment
effect heterogeneity, which occurs when the MUO and MTE slope coefficients are both equal to
zero.
   Figure 6 depicts the MTO, MUO, and MTE functions within the Oregon experiment under
AA.1. On the vertical axis, the two points labeled with filled circular markers indicate the average


                                                   25
outcomes of always takers and treated compliers, which fall at the median of the support for each
group on the horizontal axis. These two points identify the intercept and slope of the MTO func-
tion, depicted with a dotted line. The two points labeled with filled square markers identify the
intercept and slope of the MUO function, depicted with a dashed line. I depict the MTE function,
the vertical difference between the MTO and MUO functions, with a solid line. As shown, the
MTE function is positive for low levels of enrollment and negative for high levels of enrollment,
even though the LATE is positive. The downward slope of the MTE function indicates that the
treatment effect of insurance on ER utilization decreases as the unobserved net cost of treatment
UD increases.

Note. Standard errors from a nonparametric bootstrap with 1,000 replications are in parentheses. The number of ER
visits represents the total number of visits to the emergency department during the study period from March 10, 2008
to September 30, 2009. Treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. pC is the probability of treatment in the control
group, and pI is the probability of treatment in the intervention group. Filled markers indicate average values of MUO,
MTO, and MTE identified without AA.1, whereas unfilled markers indicate average values of MUO, MTO, and MTE
identified with AA.1. Some differences between statistics might not appear internally consistent because of rounding.

    Given the evidence that health improves as the unobserved net cost of treatment increases, a

                                                                           26
natural question is whether differences in health explain treatment effect heterogeneity. To answer
this question, I quantify how much treatment effect heterogeneity I can explain with observables,
particularly those that proxy for health. To do so, I incorporate observables into the MTE function
using a shape restriction commonly used in the MTE literature (see Cornelissen et al., 2018; Brinch
et al., 2017; Carneiro and Lee, 2009; Carneiro et al., 2011; Maestas et al., 2013). In my context,
the shape restriction requires that included observables X and the remaining unobserved net cost
of treatment UD have additively-separable impacts on ER utilization with and without Medicaid. I
incorporate the shape restriction into AA.1 to obtain the following alternative ancillary assumption:

AA.2. (Linear Selection Heterogeneity and Linear Treatment Effect Heterogeneity with Covariate
     Shape Restriction) In (6) and (7), for k ∈ {T,U}, specify gk (X,UD , γk ) = δk0 X + λkUD + γk ,
     where E [γk | X = x,UD = p] = 0. Therefore,

                MUO(x, p) = E [YU | X = x,UD = p] = δU0 x + λU p

                MTE(x, p) = E [YT −YU | X = x,UD = p] = (δT − δU )0 x + (λT − λU ) p

                MTO(x, p) = E [YT | X = x,UD = p] = δT0 x + λT p.

I present an algorithm for estimation of these functions that simplifies the Heckman et al. (2006)
algorithm in Appendix D.
   To evaluate whether health explains treatment effect heterogeneity, I incorporate proxies for
health into the MTE function. Since self-reported health was elicited after randomization, it rep-
resents an outcome as opposed to an observable for treated individuals, and I do not incorporate
it into the MTE function as an observable. However, I do incorporate previous ER utilization into
the MTE function because it represents an observable for all individuals.
   Incorporating previous ER utilization into the MTE function via AA.2, I find that previous
ER utilization can explain the entire decrease in treatment effect from always takers to compliers
to never takers. Incorporating indicators for each of four visit ranges (zero pre-period visits, one
pre-period visit, 2 to 3 pre-period visits, and 4 or more pre-period visits) into the MTE function, I
obtain a separate MTE(x, p) for each visit range. As depicted in Figure 7, the MTE(p) function,

Note. The number of ER visits represents the total number of visits to the emergency department during the study
period from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009. Pre-period ER visits refers to a group of indicators for visiting
the ER 0 times, 1 time, 2–3 times, and 4 or more times during the pre-period from January 1, 2007 to March 9, 2008.
Treatment represents enrollment in Medicaid. pC is the probability of treatment in the control group, and pI is the
probability of treatment in the intervention group. In this figure, the function for 1 pre-period ER visits has been
shifted downward slightly to make it easier to discern from the function for 2–3 pre-period ER visits.


which does not incorporate observables, has a pronounced downward slope, indicating substantial
unexplained heterogeneity in treatment effect. However, when I incorporate controls for previous
ER utilization into the MTE(x, p) function, the negative slope disappears, and the slope becomes
slightly positive. The remaining slope in the MTE with observables is not of a meaningful mag-
nitude. Therefore, previous ER utilization can explain all of the treatment effect heterogeneity in
MTE(p).
            Looking beyond the slope of the MTE function to its level reveals a clear monotonic relation-
ship between pre-period ER visits and the treatment effect of Medicaid enrollment on subsequent
ER visits. As depicted in Figure 7, the MTE(x, p) for individuals with 4 or more pre-period visits
is always positive, and the MTE(x, p) for individuals with zero pre-period visits is always nega-


                                                                            28
tive. This figure demonstrates that individuals with high numbers of ER visits in the pre-period
increase their ER utilization upon gaining coverage, while individuals with zero ER visits in the
pre-period decrease their ER utilization upon gaining coverage.3 The institutional details of the
Oregon experiment provide a plausible mechanism for why individuals with the highest number
of pre-period ER visits have the largest treatment effects. Given that the ER can help to facilitate
Medicaid enrollment, it could be possible that some individuals enrolled in Medicaid precisely be-
cause they showed up at the ER to receive care. Therefore, it is possible that individuals who were
the most likely to enroll in Medicaid were also the most eager to increase their ER utilization, lead-
ing them to have the largest treatment effect of enrollment on ER utilization. The evidence shown
in Figure 7 combined with institutional details from the Oregon experiment suggest that observable
variation in previous ER utilization, a proxy for health, can explain treatment effect heterogeneity.
In particular, these results suggest that health improves from always takers to compliers to never
takers, and treatment effects decrease from positive to negative as health improves.
    Not all observables can explain treatment effect heterogeneity. When I include age, sex, and
English-speaking status as well as their two-way interactions in the MTE, substantial heterogene-
ity remains unexplained. I compare unexplained heterogeneity across various MTE functions in
Figure 8. To do so, I present the expectation of the MTE function with respect to covariate x
E[MTE(x, p)], which averages included observed heterogeneity across all individuals. Consistent
with the depiction in Figure 7, the inclusion of pre-period ER visits in MTE(x, p) results in a
function that is flatter than MTE(p). Therefore, the inclusion of pre-period ER visits decreases
unexplained heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In contrast, the inclusion of the other observ-
ables in MTE(x, p) results in a function that is steeper than MTE(p). Therefore, the inclusion of
these other observables increases unexplained heterogeneity in the treatment effect. My analysis
demonstrates that the choice of which observables to include in the MTE function matters.
   3 Itis plausible for individuals with zero pre-period visits to have a negative treatment effect because the pre-period
is 14 months long, but the main study period is 19 months long, so some individuals that did not have an ER visit in
the pre-period might have one in the post-period if and only if they do not enroll in Medicaid.

4.2.2                      Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Massachusetts

I have shown that treatment effects on ER utilization decrease from always takers to compliers to
never takers in Oregon. I do not observe ER utilization in the BRFSS data, so I cannot examine
treatment effect heterogeneity on ER utilization using those data. Furthermore, none of the studies
that examine the impact of the Massachusetts reform on ER utilization use comparable individual-
level data,4 and I cannot identify average outcomes of always takers, compliers, and never takers
     4 Chenet al. (2011) use data on ER visits from the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy
aggregated to the quarter level, but they do not use data on insurance. Miller (2012) uses the same data on ER
visits aggregated to the county-quarter level, matched to county-level data on insurance before the reform because
individual-level data on ER utilization and insurance coverage before and after the reform are not available. In Kolstad
and Kowalski (2012), we use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which contains



                                                                      30
with the available aggregate data.
    However, I can examine total health care utilization as a proxy for ER utilization. Taubman
et al. (2014) report evidence from the Oregon experiment that shows that ER spending and total
health care spending are complements. If that is the case, then a decreasing treatment effect on total
health care spending implies a decreasing treatment effect on ER utilization along the unobserved
net cost of treatment UD .
    To examine treatment effect heterogeneity on total health care utilization within Massachusetts,
I recast results from my previous work on the Massachusetts reform from Hackmann et al. (2015)
in terms of the MTE model with ancillary assumption AA.1. As a measure of total health care
utilization, I consider total insurer costs measured in terms of the log premium. In Figure 9, I
reproduce Figure 8 from Hackmann et al. (2015) using notation consistent with the MTE model
while preserving notation from the original figure in lighter typeface. I interpret the marginal cost
function estimated in Hackmann et al. (2015) as a marginal treatment effect function because it
represents the difference between insurer costs on behalf of the insured and insurer costs on behalf
of the uninsured. Whereas the Einav et al. (2010) cost curve test interprets both the insured and
uninsured cost curves in terms of selection heterogeneity, I emphasize that the interpretation of
the curves depends on whether they represent cost curves among the insured or uninsured. Het-
erogeneity in costs among the insured reflects selection plus treatment effect heterogeneity, but
heterogeneity in costs among the uninsured reflects selection heterogeneity only. In Hackmann
et al. (2015), without the benefit of the separate definitions of selection and treatment effect het-
erogeneity that depend on whether costs are on behalf of the insured or uninsured, I interpret the
cost curve in Figure 9 as a function that captures only adverse selection, but I interpret it here as
a function that captures treatment effect heterogeneity. This Massachusetts MTE function, like
the Oregon MTE function, is downward sloping, indicating that in both contexts, the treatment
effect of insurance on utilization decreases as the unobserved net cost of treatment UD increases.
all the necessary elements except ER utilization. We also use the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP)
National Inpatient Sample (NIS), which contains the necessary elements on the individual level, but it is restricted to
individuals who were admitted to the hospital. The data from Smulowitz et al. (2011) are even more restricted because
they only include individuals who visited the ER at a convenience sample of 11 Massachusetts hospitals.

using weights ω(p, pL , pH ) = 1{pL < p ≤ pH }/(pH − pL ). These weights are special cases of
general weights for MTE-reweighting given by Heckman and Vytlacil (2007). Unlike the weights
used by Brinch et al. (2017), these weights allow me to recover the exact values of the LATE and
the average outcomes for Oregon always takers (0 ≤ UD ≤ pC ), compliers (pC < UD ≤ pI ), and
never takers (pI < UD ≤ 1) reported in Table 1. These weights also allow me to predict an untreated
average outcome for Oregon always takers, a treated average outcome for Oregon never takers, and
separate average treatment effects for Oregon always and never takers, as reported in the shaded
cells of Table 1 and the unfilled points of Figure 6. These predictions indicate that if always takers
were not enrolled in Medicaid, then they would visit the ER 1.35 times, implying a positive always
taker average treatment effect of 0.54 visits. In contrast, if never takers were enrolled in Medicaid,
then they would visit the ER 0.55 times, implying a negative never taker average treatment effect
of 0.29 visits.
    To extrapolate treatment effect heterogeneity from Oregon to Massachusetts, I begin by reweight-
ing the Oregon MTE(p) over the implied support of the unobserved net cost of treatment UD for
Massachusetts compliers (pCMA < UD ≤ pMA
                                      I ) via (11). I demonstrate the approach graphically in

Figure 10 by reproducing MTE(p) from Oregon and labeling the support for Massachusetts com-
pliers. As depicted, the extrapolated Massachusetts LATE predicts that the Massachusetts reform
decreased ER utilization by an average of 0.57 ER visits among Massachusetts compliers. To put
the magnitude of this result in context, Miller (2012) finds that Massachusetts compliers decreased
their ER utilization by 0.67 to 1.28 visits per person per year, depending on the empirical strat-
egy.5 The decrease that I find over the 19 months from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009
translates into a decrease of 0.36 visits per person per year (=(0.57/19)*12), which is smaller but
still negative. Therefore, reweighting of the Oregon MTE(p) function can reconcile the increase in
    5 Other estimates from the literature are not directly comparable. Chen et al. (2011) does not provide an estimate but

reports no change in ER utilization based on figures that compare ER utilization in Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
and Vermont over time. The Kolstad and Kowalski (2012) estimate shows that hospital admissions from the ER
decreased by 2.02 percentage points after the reform relative to before the reform in Massachusetts relative to other
states. The Smulowitz et al. (2011) estimate shows that low-severity visits to the ER decreased by 1.8% after the
reform relative to before the reform for publicly-subsidized and uninsured patients relative to insured and Medicare
patients.

Note. The number of ER visits represents the total number of visits to the emergency department during the study
period from March 10, 2008 to September 30, 2009. For the Massachusetts health reform, treatment is an indicator
that equals one for individuals with any form of health insurance (“Do you have any kind of health care coverage, in-
cluding health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or government plans such as Medicare?”). The instrument is an
indicator that equals one in the post-period of the expansion on and after July 2007. For the Oregon experiment, treat-
ment represents enrollment in Medicaid. “Age” is measured in year 2008 for the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment
and in year 2006 for the Massachusetts health reform. “Female” is a binary indicator for the sex of the respondent.
“English” is an indicator variable for individuals in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment who requested materials
in English and that equals one for individuals in the BRFSS who completed the interview in English. The specification
with common observables (age, female, English) includes all two-way interactions. “C” stands for “Compliers” and
“NT” stands for “Never Takers.” pCOR is the probability of treatment in the control group in Oregon, pOR  I the proba-
bility of treatment in the intervention group in Oregon, pCMA the probability of treatment in the control group in the
Massachusetts reform, and pMA I   the probability of treatment in the intervention group in the Massachusetts reform.




       Next, I refine the extrapolation to account for differences in observables between Oregon and

                                                                          34
Massachusetts. The only observables that are available for all individuals in the Oregon and Mas-
sachusetts data are age, sex, and English-speaking status, reported in Table 2. To account for these
observables in the extrapolation, I evaluate the Oregon MTE(x, p) at the Massachusetts covariate
vector XMA , and I reweight the resulting function over the support for Massachusetts compliers. I
depict the extrapolation in Figure 10. The resulting LATE that accounts for Massachusetts observ-
ables implies an average decrease of 0.79 visits over an approximately 19-month period, which
implies an annual decrease of 0.50 visits (=(0.79/19)*12). This prediction is even closer to the
Miller (2012) estimates.
   Although my estimates can reconcile the results in terms of magnitudes, the extrapolated Mas-
sachusetts LATE is imprecise in both specifications. While the extrapolation provides a summary
measure of the reconciliation exercise, it should not and does not constitute the entire reconcil-
iation exercise. Rather, the extrapolation builds upon the evidence of comparable selection and
treatment effect heterogeneity in the two settings that helps to justify the underlying assumptions.
All of these components together comprise the reconciliation exercise.
   Beyond imprecision, another concern with the extrapolation is that it averages the Oregon MTE
function over a support of the unobserved net cost of treatment UD that is far from the support for
Oregon compliers. In this support, the linearity assumptions may not be appropriate. However,
the estimated MTE function crosses the horizontal axis relatively close to the support for Oregon
compliers, at an unobserved net cost of treatment UD equal to 0.48, such that the MTE function
is negative in more than half of its support. Therefore, even if the true Oregon MTE function is
not linear at the extremes of the support, the extrapolation still qualitatively shows that coverage
decreases ER utilization for many never takers, some who are relatively similar to compliers in
terms of their unobserved net cost of treatment UD .

4.3.2   LATE-Reweighting with Common Observables Cannot Reconcile LATEs

Finally, I consider whether I could have reconciled the positive LATE in Oregon with the negative
LATE in Massachusetts using LATE-reweighting (Hotz et al., 2005; Angrist and Fernandez-Val,
2013). One limitation of LATE-reweighting is that it only incorporates observables that are avail-

                                                35
able in both contexts. The only observables available for all individuals in the Oregon and Mas-
sachusetts data are age, sex, and English-speaking status. Another limitation of LATE-reweighting
is that it requires discretization of the observables, and it is unclear which discretization to use.
To illustrate a plausible approach, I calculate a LATE within each joint realization of age (an in-
dicator that age is at least the Oregon median), sex, and English-speaking status in Oregon. I
then take a weighted average of these eight LATEs according to the joint frequency of the three
variables among Massachusetts compliers. This approach yields an increase of 0.23 visits among
Massachusetts compliers, which is positive and therefore cannot reconcile the results.
    It is not surprising that this approach to LATE-reweighting cannot reconcile the results because
the observables on which it is based cannot explain treatment effect heterogeneity within Oregon.
However, it is not clear that it would be possible to reconcile the results with LATE-reweighting
even if a wider array of observables were available in both contexts. Taubman et al. (2014) report
LATEs within many subgroups in Oregon, and almost all are positive. Any reweighting of pos-
itive LATEs from Oregon with positive weights from Massachusetts would not yield a negative
estimate required to reconcile the results. Furthermore, even LATE-reweighting with observables
that can potentially explain treatment effect heterogeneity within Oregon, such as previous ER
utilization, would not necessarily reconcile the results. LATEs only give treatment effects on com-
pliers, even within subgroups determined by observables. My analysis of the Oregon MTE shows
that the meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity is across the unobservable that separates al-
ways takers from compliers from never takers, not across compliers with different observables.
MTE-reweighting effectively allows me to extrapolate from Oregon to Massachusetts using an
unobservable that captures health.

5   Conclusion

I aim to shed light on why ER utilization increased following the Oregon Health Insurance Ex-
periment but decreased following the Massachusetts reform. In both Oregon and Massachusetts, I
find comparable evidence of adverse selection along the unobservable that separates always takers,



                                                 36
compliers, and never takers. These patterns indicate that health improves from always takers to
compliers to never takers. I also find comparable treatment effect heterogeneity, indicating that the
effect of insurance on ER utilization decreases always takers to compliers to never takers. In Ore-
gon, differences in health explain this treatment effect heterogeneity. Although Oregon compliers
increase their ER utilization upon gaining coverage, Oregon never takers, who are healthier, would
decrease their ER utilization upon gaining coverage.
   I extrapolate my findings from within the Oregon experiment to the Massachusetts reform.
Given higher levels of coverage in Massachusetts, Massachusetts compliers are comparable to a
subset of Oregon never takers. Like Oregon never takers, Massachusetts compliers report bet-
ter health than Oregon compliers. Upon gaining coverage, individuals in worse health – Oregon
compliers – increase their ER utilization, while individuals in better health – Oregon never takers
and Massachusetts compliers – decrease their ER utilization. Therefore, even though the results
seem contradictory, I can reconcile the increase in ER utilization induced by the Oregon Health
Insurance Experiment with the decrease in ER utilization induced by the Massachusetts reform.

Appendix

Appendix A        Proof that UD is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1

Per the “probability integral transformation” (see Casella and Berger (2002, page 54)), the cumu-
lative distribution function of any random variable applied to itself must be distributed uniformly
between 0 and 1. Therefore, the uniformity of UD is not a separate assumption of the model. A
random variable Y is distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 if and only if FY (c) = c for 0 ≤ c ≤ 1.
Therefore, the following shows that UD is distributed uniformly between 0 and 1, where I omit
conditioning on X for simplicity:

                  FUD (u) = P(UD ≤ u)

                         = P(F(νD ) ≤ u)

                         = P(νD ≤ F −1 (u))



                                                 37
                         = F(F −1 (u)) = u.                   (F absolutely continuous under A.1)


Appendix B        Derivation of the Treatment Equation

Medicaid enrollment D is given by

             D = 1{0 ≤ VT −VU }

                = 1{0 ≤ µD (Z, X) − νD }

                = 1{νD ≤ µD (Z, X)}

                = 1{F(νD | X) ≤ F(µD (Z, X) | X)}                   (definition of F(· | X) from A.1)

                = 1{UD ≤ F(µD (Z, X) | X)}                           (UD = F(νD | X) by definition)

                = 1{UD ≤ P(D = 1 | Z = z, X)},

where the last equality follows from

               F(µD (Z, X) | X) = P(νD ≤ µD (Z, X) | X)

                                = P(νD ≤ µD (z, X) | Z = z, X)                  (νD ⊥ Z | X by A.2)

                                = P(0 ≤ µD (z, X) − νD | Z = z, X)

                                = P(0 ≤ VT −VU | Z = z, X)

                                = P(D = 1 | Z = z, X).


Appendix C        Derivation of Average Outcomes

Under the assumptions of the model, I identify the expected value of YT for always takers as
follows, suppressing X for simplicity:

     E[Y | D = 1, Z = 0] = E[YU + D(YT −YU ) | D = 1, Z = 0]                                 (by (5))

                         = E[YT | D = 1, Z = 0]

                         = E[YT | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pC , Z = 0]       (by (4), where pC = P(D = 1|Z = 0))

                         = E[gT (UD , γT ) | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pC , Z = 0]                            (by (6))

                         = E[gT (UD , γT ) | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pC ]                    (Z ⊥ (UD , γT ) by A.4)

                                                38
                           = E[YT | 0 ≤ UD ≤ pC ].

Derivations for compliers and never takers are similar.

Appendix D         Estimating MTO(x, p), MUO(x, p), and MTE(x, p)

The steps below estimate the functions MTO(x, p), MUO(x, p), and MTE(x, p) of the form

               MTO(x, p) = δT0 x + λT p

               MUO(x, p) = δU0 x + λU p

               MTE(x, p) = MTO(x, p) − MUO(x, p) = δT0 − δU0 x + (λT − λU ) p.
                                                            


First, estimate a propensity score, pb, for each individual in the sample by fitting D = φ0 + φ1 Z +
φ20 X + φ30 (X 0 Z) + ε and using φb0 , φb1 , φb2 , and φb3 to predict D conditional on Z and observables
X. Second, estimate the average treated outcome (ATO) function, defined as ATO(x, p) = E[YT |
X = x, 0 ≤ UD ≤ p] = δeT0 x + e
                              λT p, by conditioning the sample on treated individuals (D = 1)
and using OLS to estimate Y = δeT0 x + e
                                       λT pb + ζT . To recover the parameters of the MTO function
                                                                                d[pATO(x,p)]
from the estimated parameters of the ATO function, note that MTO(x, p) =             dp      .   Therefore,
MTO(x, p) = δeT0 x + 2e
                      λT p = δT0 x + λT p. So, estimates of the MTO parameters can be constructed
as follows: δT = δeT and λT = 2e
                               λT . Third, estimate the average untreated outcome (AUO) function,
defined as AUO(x, p) = E [YU | X = x, p < UD ≤ 1] = δeU0 x + e
                                                             λU p, by conditioning the sample on
untreated individuals (D = 0) and using OLS to estimate Y = δeU0 x + e
                                                                     λU pb + ζU . To recover the
parameters of the MUO function from the estimated parameters of the AUO function, note that
               d[(1−p)AUO(x,p)]
MUO(x, p) =         d(1−p)      .   Therefore, MUO(x, p) = δeU0 x − e     λU p = δU0 x + λU p. So, an
                                                                    λU + 2e
estimate for λU can be constructed as λU = 2e
                                            λU , while the estimate for δU is equal to the estimated
δeU with its constant coefficient shifted down by e
                                                  λU . Fourth, construct the estimate for MTE(x, p)
using the estimated parameters of MTO(x, p) and MUO(x, p).
