The Impacts of Renminbi Appreciation on Trades Flows and Reserve Accumulation in a Monetary
Trade Model

                                               ABSTRACT

Given the rapidly growing reserves in Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan) and the pressures from
trading partners to revalue, there is a need to examine commercial policy in more than a pure barter
model. Here we evaluate the joint impacts of exchange rate appreciation on trade flows and country
surpluses using a general equilibrium trade model with a simple monetary structure in which the trade
surplus is endogenously determined in the exchange rate setting country and the exchange rate is exogenous.
We illustrate its application to the Chinese case using calibration to 2005 data. Our results, while elasticity
dependent, suggest that the impacts of Renminbi (RMB) revaluation on the surplus are proportionally
larger than on trade flows, and that changes in trade flows can be substantial. Different treatments
of China's processing trade have small impact on changes in China's trade flow under RMB appreciation,
but significant impacts on the change in the surplus. Results are elasticity dependent; larger substitution
elasticities in preferences yield larger effects on trade flows and the surplus.

1.   Introduction

Given the rapidly growing reserves and trade surpluses both in major Asian exporters
(China, Japan, Korea) and elsewhere (India, Russia) it is clearly unsatisfactory both to
analyze commercial policy in these countries in pure barter trade models, and to
separately analyze the impacts on trade and reserve accumulation of exchange rate
changes. Despite this, currently available literature focuses on either trade policy
changes ignoring monetary structure, or trade impacts of exchange rate changes in
structures where trade pattern changes do not follow from a trade model. Here, we
attempt to bridge this gap using a trade model with simple monetary structure in
which the surplus is endogenous. We abstract from all asset holding and intertemporal
effects and money is simply a medium of exchange reflecting a transactions demand.
Money is non neutral since domestic monetary policy does not accommodate to the
fixed exchange rate, and there is excess supply of foreign exchange to the central bank.
The central bank accommodates this by making domestic currency inconvertible and
absorbing all excess foreign exchange offered.


Nowhere are these issues more pronounced than in Chinese case, where reserves now
exceed $1 trillion and annual surpluses approach $20 billion. This has generated
intense pressure on China to revalue, and as a result there has been substantial interest
in the potential impacts of a significant Renminbi revaluation on trade flows and
patterns, as well as in the size of revaluation which might ultimately be needed to
restore external sector balance.


Most of the available literature uses econometric models with no explicit trade
structure. Park (2005), for instance, using the Oxford Economic Forecasting model,
finds that if China revalued by 10% the Chinese trade surplus would fall by $15
billion. Kamada and Takagawa (2005), employing the Asian Economy Model, report
that a 10% appreciation of the RMB would cause the aggregate Chinese trade surplus
to fall by 0.5% of Chinese GDP. However, as the IMF (2005) notes few of these


                                                                                        2
studies report changes in China’s exports and imports. Marquez and Schindler (2006),
using an autoregressive distributed lag model, find that a 10% appreciation of the
RMB would reduce China’s share of world exports by 0.5% and China’s share of
world imports by 0.1%.


Other studies of Renminbi revaluation use general equilibrium models in which
monetary structure is absent. The IMF (2005), utilizing a partial equilibrium
framework, conclude that a 10% Renminbi appreciation would reduce China’s trade
surplus by $10 billion. Willenbockel (2006), using a general equilibrium model with
different fixed labor supply and unlimited labor supply assumptions simulates a
revaluation of the RMB by 4%, and finds that a 4% RMB revaluation, would increase
China’s exports by 10.5% or 13.6%, and exports would fall by 10.7% or 11%
depending upon the assumptions used.


Another commonly held view in China is that given China’s large processing trade
and the importance of FDI inflows for trade performance, trade impacts will be small
as most export costs are already effectively foreign currency denominated. FIEs, for
instance, which use FDI for platform export production currently account for around
60% of both China’s exports and imports, but have wage costs of around $ 30 billion
compared to sales of perhaps $400 billion. Trade impacts of RMB revaluation are also
acknowledged to be elasticity dependent, but there are no reliable estimates of
relevant elasticity parameters for China and estimates for other countries are typically
used.


In our model, we characterize reserve accumulation as driven by government or
central bank policy which sets non accommodative monetary policy given the
exchange rate and simply absorbs any supply of foreign currency it is offered (dollars)
at the set exchange rate maintaining inconvertibility of domestic currency. We thus
develop a simple monetized extension of a conventional trade model with the added
structure that the trade surplus (and surplus induced additions to reserves) is
                                                                                       3
endogenously determined. To our knowledge this structure, while simple, is novel.


We use a calibrated form of this model using 2005 data1 forward scaled from both the
Chinese 2000 input-output table and international source for earlier years when
surpluses were smaller. We thus calibrate to the actual 2005 surplus. We use a 2
country format, and using this calibrated model we are able to compute
counterfactuals and assess the potential impacts of both small to relatively mild
revaluations of the Renminbi (5%-10%) as well as a larger revaluation (20%). Our
results show larger percentage impacts on the trade surplus than on trade flows
directly. Trade flow impacts, in turn, depend critically on the elasticity parameters
used in the model.

2.   China’s trade flows, foreign exchange reserves and foreign exchange rate
     regime


As the more complex model which follows is designed to be reflective of the situation
in China, we first discuss relevant background information on China’s policy regime.
Both reserve accumulation in China and the large trade surplus are a reflection of the
joint exchange rate and monetary policies pursued by China’s monetary authorities.
The RMB was inconvertible and its exchange rate was pegged to the dollar through
the 1960’s to the early 1990’s. With significant domestic inflation, excess demand for
foreign exchange resulted with (in the 1980’s and early 1990’s) associated black
market activity. The RMB was devalued to approximately its current level in the early
1990’s, and inflation has slowed since. And with sharp growth in exports and inflows
of FDI, excess demand for foreign exchange has been replaced by excess supply. This
has been absorbed by the central bank through reserve accumulation, with the RMB
inconvertible.


The indications are thus of a significant and growing RMB misalignment especially
from 2002 on, with the Chinese government maintaining rigid exchange rate
regulations and a peg of the RMB against the US Dollar at a fixed rate. In July 2005,
when around 70% of the reserves were in US bank notes, under the pressure from the
US government, the Chinese government announced an effective 2.4% revaluation of
the RMB against the dollar and committed to future exchange rate targets in terms of
a trade-weighted currency basket.


Given the potential inflationary consequences of large accumulation of foreign
reserves, the Chinese government partially sterilizes its foreign reserve acquisitions by
issuing central bank bills and bonds as well as through controls on bank lending.
Despite these sterilization efforts, M1 grew by 19% in 2003 and 16.9% in 2005, but
given strong Chinese growth, inflation as measured by the CPI rose from 1.2% in
2003 to 1.8% in 2005 (NBS, 2003, 2005).

                                                                                        5
On the trade side, between 2000 and 2004, the average growth in China’s imports and
exports exceeded 20% and kept growing in 2005 and 20062. The resulting trade
surplus sharply increased China’s foreign exchange reserves (See Figure 1). In 2005,
the trade surplus also increased due to a slowing down in the growth rate of imports,
following restrictions that the Chinese government introduced in 2004 to cool the
boom, and a growth in exports of apparel, following the abolition of the multi-fiber
agreement (MFA) in January 2005. However, with continuing export growth in many
sectors, not just in apparel, by 2006, China’s foreign exchange reserves had reached
$1 trillion in comparison with only $165 billion in 2000.

  The growth rates for China’s exports and imports in 2005 and 2006 are: 28.4% and 27.2% for exports, 17.6%
and 20.0% for imports.

                                                                                                              6
While China’s rapid accumulation of US dollar reserves has been primarily driven by
a growing trade surplus over 10 years, other factors have also contributed. One has
been   net inward FDI flows which, while growing at a relatively moderate pace,
average around $60 billion per year. Speculative portfolio and other investment
inflows in anticipation of a RMB appreciation are also believed to have played an
important role in China’s reserve accumulation.


In the last year or so, reserves have increased by more than $100 billion. The pressure
on Chinese authorities to revalue the RMB has correspondingly grown, and with it
have come concerns over the impact of any significant further revaluation on
performance, and especially trade performance. Arguments that little impact will
result focus on a significant processing component of trade in which both inputs
(imports) and outputs (exports) are foreign currency denominated, and elasticities
which have to be unrealistically high for significant impacts to occur. The alternative
view that impacts will be larger focuses on a range of factors which will fuel larger
impacts including FDI inflows and changes in speculative capital flows.




                                                                                      7
3.   A simple monetary trade model of the Chinese exchange rate and trade
     regime


To analyze the impacts of RMB appreciation we use a simple trade model with
monetary structure. In this impacts on speculative capital flows and FDI inflows are
put on one side, and it is the endogeneity of the trade imbalance via reserve
accumulation to support a fixed exchange rate. This additional monetary structure is
missing in other related modeling work such as Willenbokel (2006).


We depart from classical monetized extensions of real side barter type trade models
where money is neutral. In such models, in a two country world each with a national
money and a simple fixed velocity transactions money demand, once the domestic
money stocks are specified exchange rates are endogenously determined. There are no
effects of introducing money on consumption, production or trade. Any change in
either or both country money stocks results in a change in the exchange rate between
the national monies, but with no impact on real trade flows. Alternatively, if a fixed
exchange rate is specified then monetary policy in the two countries has to be
accommodative in the sense that the ratio of the two national money stocks must be
consistent with the fixed exchange rate.


In these simple models money is only a medium of exchange and no financial assets
enter. There is also no time structure and a single period world is assumed. A simple
transactions money demand and fixed money stock determines prices of goods in
terms of money. In the money neutral case, a strict separation between real and
monetary phenomena applies in that relative goods prices are determined by the real
side of the international economy and the country price levels (and hence money
prices) are determined by the money stock.


Our approach is to specify a monetary regime in a model with monetary
non-neutralities reflecting the actual Chinese exchange rate and monetary regime. In
                                                                                     8
this, model with monetary non-neutralities monetary policy is non accommodative to
the chosen fixed exchange rate, and this implies either excess demand for or excess
supply of foreign exchange. China was an economy in which up to the mid-1990s
there was significant excess demand for foreign exchange with associated rationing
and black markets, but from the mid-1990s on the excess demand regime became one
of excess supply. By maintaining the inconvertibility of the Renminbi foreigners are
prevented from sales of foreign exchange at better rates, and the exchange rate is
maintained by the central bank buying foreign currency to absorb this excess supply
through additions to reserves. This, in turn, supports the Chinese surplus on trade
account. This is equivalent to intervention based stock piling to support a price control
(in this case the fixed exchange rate, see Iman and Whalley (1982)).


Later, we use a calibrated numerical model of China with a production side and
monetary structure to analyze the impacts of changes of exchange rates in this regime,
but we first exposit a simple version of this structure. We consider a simple 2 good
(good 1 and good 2) 2 country (country 1 and country 2) pure exchange world, where

X 1 and X 2 are the initial endowments of goods 1 and 2 in countries 1 and 2.
   1    1       2              2     j
X1 , X 2 , X1           and X 2 ( X i ) denote the demands for good i ( i=1,2 ) in country j

( j=1,2 ).


Each country is assumed to have a representative consumer with a utility function:
                    j
        U j (Xi )              i=1,2, j=1,2                                         (1)



Unlike in a conventional trade model, we incorporate the endogenously determined
trade surplus directly into the two country budget constraints. We also assume that the
surplus country is predetermined as country 1 ( China) and the deficit country as
country 2 (the rest of the world) and Country 1 fixes its exchange rate and has
non-accomodative monetary policy. Country 2 will be assumed to fix its money stock.
This implies that jointly countries 1 and 2 exhibit relative money stocks inconsistent
                                                                                           9
with the fixed exchange rate and monetary non neutralities result. We assume this to
be a reflection of policy choices by country 1.


              −
Denoting e as the fixed exchange rate chosen by country 1 (China), and S as the
endogenously determined surplus denominated in the currency of country 2 (the rest
of the world), the budget constraint for country 1 is
                       −
        p1 X 1 + e p 2 X 2 = p1 X 1 − eS
                   1                   1
                                                                                (2)


and, for country 2:
        1
          p1 X 1 + p 2 X 2 = p 2 X 2 + S

        e
Unlike in real side models that accommodate trade imbalance as exogenous transfers,
                                                     −
here S is endogenously determined, given e and relative domestic money stocks.

If, for simplicity, we assume a velocity of circulation of unity in both countries, and a
money stock in country 1 of m 1 and in country 2 of m 2 , money demand and supply
equations are:
        p1 X 1 + p1 X 1 = m 1
                   1               2
                                                                                (6)
and
        p2 X 2 + p2 X 2 + S = m 2

Adding demand supply equalities in goods gives equation (8) and (9)
        X1 + X1 = X1

                                                                                (8)



                                                                                       10

Equation     (3)-(9)         thus   give   a   system   of   7   equations   in   7        unknowns

country 1 given the setting of m 2 in country 2. Thus, if county 1 is China and it

changes the exchange rate for a given m 1 there will be real side effects. In this

model, the exchange rate setting acts as price intervention now supported by stock

piling of foreign exchange. Changes in e in turn directly impact on S,                as well as on
real side quantities and trade.


We can illustrate how this simple system operates with a simple numerical example.
We assume the utility functions in (1) to be Cobb Douglas and use the parameter
settings generated by calibration to an artificial data set in Table 1. We then compute
                                                                                       −
an equilibrium for this structure and investigate the impacts of changes in e on S and
other real side variables.


Simulation results outlined in Table 1 shows that with appreciation of the currency in
country 1 (exchange rate reductions of 5%, 10% and 20%), country 1’s imports
increase, while its exports decrease. The trade surplus decreases, and as we suggest
earlier, the proportional effects of changes in the exchange rate on the surplus ( S ) are
                                                                      1           2

If, instead of changing e , we instead increase the money stock in country 1 by the

same percent as the change in exchange rate, increasing m 1 causes goods prices in

country 1 to fall and this increases country 1 exports, and the trade surplus falls. In

4.   A simple trade-monetary model structure for China with production and
     processing trade


We next assess the impacts of RMB revaluation in a more complex model with
sectoral detail, production structures, and also consider the role of processing trade.
We calibrate the model to 2005 data and again perform counterfactuals. We set out our
procedures for constructing a model benchmark data set later. In this, we use data for
earlier years which we first scale to 2005 for changes in intervening years. 2005 is
used as the base year since the surplus was considerably larger than in earlier years. A
key element of this more complex model of China is its treatment of processing trade.
Processing trade uses imports as inputs and applies value-added in upgrading for
exports. Imports for this purpose are differentiated from those entering final demands.
We thus treat a part of imports as for final consumption, and a part for use as
intermediate inputs, which are effectively for re-export from China. In 2005,
processing trade accounted for 41 percent of China’s imports from the world, and 55
percent of China’s exports to the world (NBS. 2005). Other imports are dominated by
oil and raw materials. The model incorporates a fixed exchange rate regime similar to
that in the simple model discussed above. We consider 3 sectors: agriculture and
energy, manufactures and other sectors (including services) which account for 12.4%,
47.3% and 40.3% of GDP in 2005, and of 44.8%, 23.8% and 31.4% of employment.
We incorporate processing trade into the production structure only in the China part of
the model; the rest of the world is scaled to reflect its relative size compared to China,
but is modeled in full form as a distinct economy.


On the production side in China, we consider a 3 sector system, in which processing
trade is specially treated. The production function in each sector in country 1( i ) is



        Yi = g ( Li , K i , N 2i )
          1         1    1     1
                                      i=1, 2, 3                                   (10)

where    i refers to different goods, and Yi , Li , K i , N 2i         are the outputs of

                                                                                          14
                                                                             1   1          1
country 1, labor and capital inputs, and the processing trade input. pl i , pk i , pn 2i

are the prices of labor, capital and processing trade inputs in country i.

                                            1



Country 2’s production involves only labor and capital inputs, with no processing
trade input, as follows:

        Yi = g ( Li , K i )
          2               2             2



First order conditions are:

                              ∂g
        pl i = p 2i
              2
                                                                                     (12)
                          ∂Li
                                 2




                               ∂g
        pk i = p 2i

                                     2



Final demands for commodities in country 1 and country 2 as modeled as derived
from CES nested utility functions defined over composites of similar domestically
produced and imported goods. This structure allows us to directly incorporate
substitution elasticity parameters into the model as the substitution elasticity between
similar domestic and imported goods which can then be directly related to import
demand elasticities, This yields a relatively conventional Armington type trade model
but with different production structures in the two countries.


Maximizing country 1’s utility yields demands from the solution to a 2 stage
budgeting problem, ie:

                      {   1

in country 1 for good i produced in country1 (2), and S is the surplus.


Country 2’s demand are similarly derived by maximizing a nested CES utility
function defined over CES composites of imported goods from country 1 and
domestically produced goods.

As before, we assume each country’s money supply is fixed, and each country has a
constant velocity transactions demand. In equilibrium, this implies:



        ∑         p1 Di + ∑ p1 Di                                      = m1

                                                                                                                              (15)

and

        ∑                                  + ∑ p 2 Di + S = m 2
                                  22                              12
                  p 2 Di


Adding demand supply equalities in goods gives
        Di + Di                            = Yi

An equilibrium can be computed for this system similarly to that for the example

                                            −
counterfactual experiments for changes in e and /or m 1 . We also incorporate a tariff

on imports into the model, and are able to analyze the effects of trade policy changes
in the presence of the monetary non-neutralities specified.

5.   Data and parameterization


Our model incorporates 2 countries and 3 traded goods (agriculture and energy,
manufactures, and other sectors) and we build a model compatible benchmark
equilibrium data set for calibration (see Dawkins, Srinivasan and Whalley 2001). We
use a base year of 2005 since the surplus in China was larger in that year than earlier
and we scale earlier years data to this base. The two countries in our simulations are
China and the rest of the world. Due to the multi-country character of the data set,
ensuring model consistency of data is a problem in building the benchmark data. We
jointly use data from GTAP on trade, production, and consumption as well as China’s
latest input-output table. We first use sectoral gross output, total import and export for
China and the rest of the world from GTAP 5 database for 1997. We use data from
China’s 2000 input-output table yielding China’s gross output, and totals for imports
and exports. Using share data from GTAP and China’s data from the input-output
table, we generate China’s sectoral gross output, import and export data for 2000.
China’s exports are taken as imports by the rest of the world from China. All data is
scaled to 2005 as follows. Sectoral exports scaled to 2005 according to the China’s
exports data from NBS and sectoral share in 2000. Then exports are kept unchanged.
In adjusting benchmark data to reflect the 2005 surplus, imports are instead scaled for
consistency with the 2005 surplus, this implies aggregate surplus for China is
compatible with the surplus actually observed in the year. Gross output for the rest of
the world and China are also scaled to 2005 that reflect GDP growth rate from the
2000.


We incorporate processing trade data into the basecase data set as follows. We split
total imports of China into final and intermediate demand components. The shares of
imports for final and intermediate use are calculated using data from the NBS of
China3. Intermediate imports are an element of domestic demand. Table 2 reports the

3
  China’s customs compiles statistical data on imports for final and intermediate use by good each year. Due to
lack of such data for 2005, we use the aggregate share of intermediate imports of the total according to the NBS.

                                                                                                                    18
base case data for China and the rest of the world use in our calibration.


For simplicity, we use Cobb-Douglas production functions to represent the technology
of the 2 countries with shares calibrated to the 2005 benchmark data. In the case of
China, share parameters extend to the use of processing trade inputs. On the demand
side, we use CES composites and initially set substitution elasticities to equal to 2 in
both countries. We use this as the central case although the literature provides
different estimates of this key elasticity. Many of the estimates of domestic and
import good substitution are around 2 or greater than 2 (See Betina (2003)). Table 3
reports parameter values in production and preferences generated by calibration, as
well as shares of intermediate imports in China’s imports that are used in
counterfactual analysis.

         The currency unit used here for Chinese domestic currency is artificial in that we set it to 8.277RMB which is
         the exchange rate of the US dollar to Renminbi in 2002, this implies that 1 unit RMB* equals 1 US dollar before
         we scale all the data for 2005. This convention is adapted so that in calibration all equilibrium prices will be
         unity.

           which is about $276 billion, and share about 41% of the total import. As the processing trade in China is occurred
           mostly in manufacturing trade rather than in agriculture and services sectors, we shift all processing trade inputs
           into the manufacturing sector, and thus the share here is 56.6%.

6.   Model results for joint trade and surplus impacts of Renminbi revaluation
     and changes in monetary policy


We have used our calibrated model to simulate the impacts of RMB revaluation
jointly on China’s trade flows and the trade surplus. We firstly consider appreciations
of the RMB by 5%, 10% and 20% respectively with a fixed money stock in both
China and the rest of the world. Then we fix the RMB exchange rate and increase the
money stock in China to assess the effects of changes in money stocks on trade flows
and the surplus. We are also able to analyze trade policy changes in a monetary
model.


Results are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 shows that with appreciations of the
RMB of 5%, 10% and 20% respectively, China’s imports increase in quantity terms
by around 11.8%, 25.7% and 61.5% for these cases, and exports fall in corresponding
cases by 9.7%, 18.9% and 35.8%. China’s trade surplus falls in larger percentage
terms by 12.7%, 25.8% and 53.7% for these cases, mostly due to changes in the
quantity of net trades. With Renminbi revaluations of 5%,10% and 20%, the surplus
decreases by $12.9 billion, $26.3 billion and $54.6 billion respectively; small changes
in prices also influence the change in the surplus. Thus, as in the earlier numerical
example, the proportional change in the surplus is much larger than the change in
trade flows.



We then increase China’s money stock m 1 by 5%, 10% and 20%, the same

percentage changes as for the exchange rate. With the resulting increase in the price
level in China, China’s imports increase by 11.8%, 24.4% and 51.4% , and China’s
exports fall by 9.7%, 18.1% and 31.8%. The trade surplus falls by 16.7%, 33.1% and
65.1% in these cases. Again, the proportional change in the surplus is considerably
larger than the change in trade flows.

We next turn to the impacts of changes in exchange rates that actually occurred in
China between 2005 and 2006. China’s reforms in the exchange rate regime started in
July 2005. From then to the end of 2006, China’s RMB appreciation was close to
2.4% ( the exchange rate for the US dollar to RMB decreased from 8.27 in 21st July,
2005 to 8.0702 in 30th Dec 20058) and M1 increased by 11.8% in 2005 according to
the NBS (NBS,2005). This RMB appreciation together with China’s increasing
money stock9 had significant impacts on foreign currency reserves. Our simulations
show that without China’s jointly using a revaluation of the Renminbi and a monetary
loosening, the surplus would have increased by a further 11.4% (Table 6), while
imports would increase of further 7.7% and export fall a further 8.2% under the model
assumptions.


We also use the model to assess the impacts of tariff rate changes on trade flows and
the surplus. We assume different tariff rates on manufactures of 6%, 8%, 10% and
12% and eliminate them. Results are reported in Table 7. With the resulting decrease
in import prices, China’s imports increase by 6.2%, 8.0%, 9.8% and 11.4%. Exports
show very small impacts and in this model, in contrast to a non monetary trade model,
the adjustments induced by the import rise are nearly all on the surplus which
increases between 4.3% and 7.9%. In contrast to barter economies in which tariff acts
as a tax on exports, here the buffer stock of endogenous reserve accumulation
removes this effect.


It is not surprising that our simulation results are elasticity dependant, and the key
parameter in the model is the substitution elasticity between domestic and foreign
products in the utility function. Table 8 provides simulation results under changed
substitution elasticities in CES demand functions only for China from 0.5 to 2.
Changes in China’s import are sensitive to this elasticity, while change in exports to
the rest of the world shows almost no change. The resulting changes in China’s

As we discussed earlier, processing trade in our model is specially treated and
changes in model treatment impact results. We change the share of processing trade
by altering the proportion of imports to domestic demand in the base case data used in
calibration. Result in Table 9 show cases in which variations in the impacts of RMB
revaluation on China’s surplus are large, but the variations in impacts on trade flow
change are smaller. These results reflect the dampening effect of processing trade
inputs on revaluation effects. The larger the processing trade, the more that both
inputs and outputs are foreign currency denominated and the smaller the impacts on
the surplus.




                                                                                    30
7.   Conclusion


Here we show how the impacts of changes in exchange rates and monetary policy can
be analyzed in a trade model with a simple monetary structure in which the trade
surplus is endogenously determined and exchange rate policy is exogenous. In this
model, money is non neutral. We illustrate the model’s application using a calibrated
Chinese model incorporating 2005 data. We find that impacts of revaluation
Renminbi on the surplus are proportionally larger than on trade flows. Impacts on
trade flows and the surplus are both substantial.


A separate treatment of China’s processing trade is also incorporated into the model.
Varying the fraction of imported intermediate to total imports has little effect on the
impacts of trade flow changes under different degree of revaluation, but has a
significant influence on the surplus due to changes in net trade.    These impacts are
also elasticity dependent. Our results show that larger substitution elasticities between
domestic and foreign production in demand in China yields larger effects on trade the
flow and the surplus.


Since Chinese policymakers implemented current and capital account liberalization
measures in 2005 aimed at addressing macroeconomic imbalances, we also analyze
these. Our simulations show that these policies had an impact in depressing the
growth in the surplus, which would otherwise have been larger.
