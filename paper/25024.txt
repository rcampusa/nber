Deduction Dilemmas: The Taiwan Assignment Mechanism

                                       ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the properties of the Taiwan mechanism, used for high school placement
nationwide starting in 2014. In the Taiwan mechanism, points are deducted from an applicant's
score with larger penalties for lower ranked choices. Deduction makes the mechanism a new
hybrid between the well-known Boston and deferred acceptance mechanisms. Our analysis sheds
light on why Taiwan's new mechanism has led to massive nationwide demonstrations and why it
nonetheless still remains in use.

1    Introduction
In June 2014, more than five hundred parents and teachers marched down Ketagalan Boule-
vard in Taipei the capital city of Taiwan. The protestors were marching against a new
mechanism used to assign students to senior high schools. Fiercely protesting parents held
placards stating, “fill out the preference form for us,” while others complained that the ad-
missions process was akin to “gambling” (I-chia 2014). Due to this pressure and calls for
his resignation, education Minister Chiang Wei-Ling subsequently issued a formal public
apology for the new high school admissions system (CNA 2014a).
    What are the protestors complaining about, and why is there so much turmoil associated
with Taiwan’s new high school assignment mechanism? This paper investigates this question
by studying the properties of Taiwan’s new assignment mechanism, a brand-new assignment
mechanism (to our knowledge), which represents a generalization of widely-studied mech-
anisms based on the student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm and the Boston or
immediate acceptance mechanism.
    Taiwan, like many other countries and regions, has recently launched a series of reforms
to standardize and centralize its secondary school system. At the turn of the century, rising
Taiwanese high schoolers took an admissions exam consisting of five subjects, with a total
score of 700 points. Students submitted their ranking over schools, and those with a higher
score chose first. For the next decade, an essay component was added to the admissions
exam. Local districts were free to use other performance measures aside from exams (such
as Chinese and English, music or sports) and to choose how to convert these measures to a
total score.
    In 2014, the Senior-High School Education Act established a Comprehensive Assessment
Program for Junior High School students. This act changed how each of the five subjects
on the admissions exam were scored, placing them into discrete categories: excellent, basic
(pass), and needs more work (not pass). To separate high performing students, excellent
was further split into A, A+, and A++. During 2014, more than 200,000 pupils took the
Comprehensive Assessment Exam and applied to schools in their district of residence.
    Aside from changing the admissions criteria, Taiwanese authorities also changed the
assignment mechanism, introducing a deduction system. Loosely speaking, in Taiwan’s
deduction system, a students priority is reduced based on the order in which preferences are
ranked. Table 1 lists the schedule of points employed in 2014 across the largest districts in
Taiwan. For instance, in Jibei, the largest district with over 60,000 applicants, a student’s
score at her second choice is reduced by 1, the score at her third choice is reduced by 2, and
so on. In Yunlin district, no points are deducted for the first four choices, and 2 points are




                                              3
deducted from choices five through eight.1 The deduction system has now been in place for
the last five years, from 2014-2018.
   There are many signs that the deduction system is one of the major reason for nationwide
protests. For instance, an article in the China Post states (Wei 2014):

It is outrageous that the students have to have points deducted from their scores because they
     fill out the wrong slots; it is because of this that many students with A+ in all subjects
       eventually have to go to the same school with those who have achieved lower scores.

Despite calls to move towards different system where “students can choose the school they
want according to their results,” senior Taiwanese leadership has decided to retain the de-
duction system and has only slightly modified the extent to which points are deducted from
choices.
     While economists have studied the properties of other school choice mechanisms, the
deduction system represents a brand new class of matching mechanisms, which we term the
Taiwan mechanism. Our goal in this paper is to analyze the properties of the Taiwan
mechanism to provide insights into the developments in Taiwan.
     To our knowledge, the only other paper to study the new system in Taiwan is Hsu (2014),
who investigates properties of the new scoring system. Balinski and Sönmez (1999) and
Abdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez (2003) initiated the formal research on the mechanism design
approach to school choice. This paper is most closely related to Ergin and Sönmez (2006) and
Pathak and Sönmez (2008). Both papers consider the equilibrium of the preference revelation
game induced by the Boston mechanism under different assumptions on player sophistication.
Since preference-driven priority mechanisms are a generalization of the Boston mechanism,
the results contained in this paper can be seen as a generalization of those earlier papers.
Motivated by Chinese college admissions, Chen and Kesten (2017) introduce application-
rejection mechanisms with a parameter governing the permanency-execution period. Since
it is possible to map a particular schedule of deduction points to the permanency-execution
period, the results in this paper are related. Finally, there is a large literature on student
assignment mechanisms. We refer interested readers to Pathak (2016) for a recent survey
of the school choice literature and Sönmez and Ünver (2011) for a broader survey of the
matching literature.
     In the next section, after introducing the model and formal definitions, we examine the
incentive properties of Taiwan mechanisms, showing that they can be compared in terms of
manipulation based on a natural ordering on their deduction points. In Section 3, we analyze
the equilibrium of the preference revelation game induced by the Taiwan mechanism. With
  1
   In some public documents, the deduction is described in terms of added points, where more points are
added for higher ranked choices.


                                                  4
this characterization in hand, we turn to comparisons between the Taiwan mechanism and
a mechanism based on the deferred acceptance algorithm. We briefly examine extensions of
our result to the more general case when all schools do not have the same priorities. Finally,
the last section concludes.


2         Model
2.1         Primitives
The ingredients of a school choice problem are a finite set of students and schools, each
with a maximum capacity. Each student has a strict preference over all schools as well as
remaining unassigned. Each student has priority score at each school.
   Formally, a school choice problem consists of:

    1. a set of students I = {i1 , ..., in },

    2. a set of schools S = {s1 , ..., sm },

    3. a capacity vector q = (qs1 , ..., qsm ),

    4. a list of strict student preferences PI = (Pi1 , ..., Pin ), and

    5. a list of strict school priority score profiles π = (πs1 , ..., πsm ), where πs is school s’s
       priority scores over I.

    For any student i, Pi is a strict preference relation over S ∪ {∅} where ∅ denote being
unassigned option and sPi ∅ means student i considers school s as acceptable.2 For any
student i, let Ri denote the “at least as good as” relation induced by Pi . We denote the rank
of school s under preference relation Pi with rs (Pi ), i.e., rs (Pi ) = |{s0 ∈ S ∪ {∅}|s0 Pi s}| + 1.
For any school s, the function πs : {i1 , . . . , in } → R is the priority score profile at school s
where πs (i) > πs (j) means that at school s, student i has higher priority than student j. We
denote the priority order of school s over students implied by πs with πs , i.e. i πs j if and
only if πs (i) > πs (j). Let πmax be the maximum score possible.
    We fix the set of students, the set of schools and the capacity vector throughout the
paper; hence the pair (P, π) denotes a school choice problem (or simply a problem). The
outcome of a school choice problem is a matching. Formally a matching µ : I → S ∪ {∅} is
a function such that |µ−1 (s)| ≤ qs for any school s ∈ S.
    We refer to µ(i) as the assignment of student i under matching µ. With slight abuse of
notation, we use µ(s) instead of µ−1 (s) in the rest of the paper.
    2
        In the rest of the paper, we consider ∅ as a “null” school such that q∅ = |I|.


                                                          5
      A matching µ is Pareto efficient if there does not exist another matching ν such that
  ν(i)Ri µ(i) for all i ∈ I and ν(j)Pj µ(j) for some j ∈ I. A matching µ is individually
  rational if there is no student i such that ∅Pi µ(i). A matching µ is non-wasteful if there
  is no student-school pair (i, s) such that sPi µ(i) and |µ(s)| < qs . A matching µ is fair if
  there is no student-school pair (i, s) such that sPi µ(i) and πs (i) > πs (j) for some j ∈ µ(s).
      A matching µ is stable if it is individually rational, non-wasteful, and fair. A matching
  is student-optimal stable if it is the best stable matching for students.
      A mechanism, denoted by ϕ, is a systematic procedure that selects a matching for
  each problem. We let ϕ(P, π) denote the matching selected by mechanism ϕ in problem
  (P, π) and ϕ(P, π)(i) denote the corresponding match of student i, and ϕ(P, π)(s) denote
  the corresponding set of students assigned to school s. We say a mechanism ϕ satisfies a
  given property if ϕ(P, π) satisfies that property for any (P, π). For instance, a mechanism is
  stable if ϕ(P, π) is stable for any (P, π).
      We say a mechanism ϕ is vulnerable to manipulation in (P, π) if there exists i and
    0
  Pi such that
                                    ϕ(Pi0 , P−i , π)(i)Pi ϕ(P, π)(i),
  where P−i = (Pj )j6=i . A mechanism ϕ is strategy-proof if there is no problem (P, π),
  student i and a preference order Pi0 such that

                                   ϕ(Pi0 , P−i , π)(i)Pi ϕ(P, π)(i).

  In other words, a strategy-proof mechanism is not vulnerable to manipulation in any problem.


  2.2      Taiwan Mechanisms
  In this paper, we are interested in a new class of mechanisms which includes celebrated
  student-proposing deferred acceptance mechanism and the Boston or immediate acceptance
  mechanism. We call this class of mechanisms as Taiwan Mechanisms. To define a Taiwan
  mechanism, we first give the description of the two well-known member of this class of
  mechanisms.
      For any given (P, π), the student-proposing deferred acceptance (DA) mechanism selects
  its outcome through the following algorithm:

Step 1: Each student i applies to her best choice, possibly ∅, according to Pi . Each school
        s tentatively accepts the best qs students among all applicants according to πs and
        rejects the rest.
      ..
       .



                                                  6
Step k: Each student i applies to her best choice which has not rejected her yet, possibly ∅,
        according to Pi . Each school s tentatively accepts the best qs students among all
        applicants according to πs and rejects the rest.

              The algorithm terminates when there are no more rejections and students are assigned
              to the choices they have applied in the last step.

     For any given (P, π), the Boston mechanism (BM) selects its outcome through the fol-
  lowing algorithm:

Step 1: Each student i applies to her best choice, possibly ∅, according to Pi . Each school
        s permanently accepts the best qs students among all applicants according to πs and
        rejects the rest. Each accepted student and her assigned seat are removed.
         ..
          .

Step k: Each remaining student i applies to her k th choice, possibly ∅, according to Pi . Each
        school s permanently accepts the best students among all applicants according to πs
        up to the number of its remaining seats and rejects the rest. Each accepted student
        and her assigned seat are removed.

              The algorithm terminates when there are no more rejections.

       A Taiwan mechanism can be implemented by deducting points and then applying DA
  to the resulting problem. More formally, we first define a deduction rule denoted by
                                  |S|+1
  λ = (λ1 , λ2 , ..., λ|S|+1 ) ∈ R+     such that λ1 = 0 and λk ≤ λk+1 for any k ∈ {1, 2, ..., |S|}.3
  We denote Taiwan mechanism associated with deduction rule λ by T M λ . For a given
  problem (P, π), the outcome of T M λ is simply DA(P, π̂ λ ) where for each student-school pair
  (i, s),
                                           π̂sλ (i) = πs (i) − λrs (Pi ) .
  When deduction points are zero, the associated Taiwan mechanism produces the same out-
  come as DA. When deduction points are very large, the associated Taiwan mechanism pro-
  duces the same outcome as BM. That is, for any (P, π), if λ1 = (0, 0..., 0), then
                                                 1
                                           T M λ (P, π) = DA(P, π)

  and if λ2 = (0, πmax , 2πmax , ..., |S|πmax ), then
                                                2
                                          T M λ (P, π) = BM (P, π).
     For any two deduction rules λ and λ0 , λ > λ0 if λk ≥ λ0k for all k ∈ {1, 2, ..., |S| + 1} and λk0 > λ0k0 for
     3

  some k 0 ∈ {1, 2, ..., |S| + 1}.


                                                         7
    The fact that the Taiwan mechanism can be implemented as DA with different inputs
means that it inherits some properties of DA. Since DA mechanism is non-wasteful and indi-
vidually rational, for any λ and (P, π), T M λ (P, π) is non-wasteful and individually rational.
    Through the choice of a deduction rule, it is possible for the class of Taiwan mechanisms
to produce the same outcome as a large number of other mechanisms. Aside from DA and
BM, the First Preference First (FPF) mechanisms used in England described by Pathak
and Sönmez (2013) are in the class of Taiwan mechanism where the deduction schedule is
allowed to depend on the school. FPF mechanisms were outlawed in more than 150 Local
Education Agencies by English Parliament in 2007. Since the Chinese Parallel mechanisms
described by Chen and Kesten (2017) span the DA and BM extremes, they can also be
represented as a Taiwan mechanism. In particular, a deduction schedule would be related to
the permanency-execution period in the Chinese parallel mechanism. If the choices within an
execution period all have the same deduction points, and the deduction points in an earlier
block are all sufficiently larger than those in a later block, then such a deduction schedule
produces the same outcome as the Chinese Parallel mechanism.
    We make the following two assumptions throughout the rest of the analysis. Since we
are motivated primarily by policy developments in Taiwan, we assume that all schools share
the same strict priority score profiles.
Assumption 1. For all s, s0 ∈ S πs = πs0 .

    In Taiwan, student priority score is determined by a combination of measures including
test scores in Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School Students and it
applies to all schools. Examples of deduction rules are shown in Table 1. Appendix A
examines whether our results generalize for situations other than Taiwan, where priorities
may differ by school. We also assume that there is no ties in the deducted priority scores.

Assumption 2. For any preference profile P , there is no ties in the deducted priority after
applying the deducted rule λ to the problem (P, π). That is, for ∀P, s ∈ S, π̂sλ (i) = π̂sλ (j)
implies that i = j.
   To understand the properties of Taiwan Mechanisms, we start with the following example:
Example 1. Suppose that there are four schools, S = {a, b, c, d}, each with one seat, and
four students, i1 , i2 , i3 , and i4 . The original priority scores of students for each school s ∈ S
is: πs (i1 ) = 100, πs (i2 ) = 50, πs (i3 ) = 11 and πs (i4 ) = 0. The preferences of students are as
follows:
                                           Pi 1 : a b c d ∅
                                           Pi 2 : a b c d ∅
                                                                   .
                                           Pi 3 : b c d a ∅
                                           Pi 4 : c a d b ∅

                                                 8
  We consider two different deduction rule: λ1 = (0, 41, 45, 51, 51) and λ2 = (0, 110, 220, 330, 330).
                                                      1        2
The corresponding adjusted priority orders for π, π̂ λ and π̂ λ are:
                                                                1                         2

The table orders applicants at schools from left to right, so that, e.g., πa (i1 ) > πa (i2 ) >
πa (i3 ) > πa (i4 ).
Under problem (P, π), the matching produced by DA is:
                                                 !
                                     i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                   .
                                     a b c d
                                                                                                      1
The matching produced by the Taiwan mechanism with deduction λ1 , i.e. T M λ , is:
                                               !
                                   i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                 .
                                   a c b d

The matching produced by BM is:
                                                                     !
                                                  i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                                         .
                                                  a d b c

This last matching is identical to that produced by the Taiwan mechanism with deduction
               2

2.3    Comparing Incentives Across Mechanisms
We have observed that in the limit when deduction points are very large, the Taiwan mecha-
nism reduces to BM and when deduction points are all zero, it reduces to a serial dictatorship
(equivalently DA). A serial dictatorship is a strategy-proof mechanism, while BM is highly
manipulable. Does this comparison extend to intermediate values of the deduction rule?
    Since BM is a highly manipulable mechanism, it is natural to expect that as we increase
the deduction (and approach BM), the mechanism becomes more manipulable. To formalize
this idea, we use the criteria to compare incentives across mechanisms developed by Pathak
and Sönmez (2013). Recall that mechanism ϕ is vulnerable to manipulation in (P, π) if there
is at least a student i who gets strictly better allocation by altering her report.


                                                        9
Definition. Mechanism ψ is more manipulable than ϕ if

  (i) in any (P, π) such that ϕ is vulnerable to manipulation ψ is also vulnerable to manip-
      ulation, and

  (ii) there exists some (P, π) such that ψ is vulnerable to manipulation but ϕ is not.

If only (i) is satisfied, then we say that ψ is at least as manipulable as ϕ.

    Returning to Example 1, we consider a new deduction rule: λ3 = (0, 9, 20, 30, 30). Note
                                                                                   3           1
that λ3k < λ1k for each k > 1. Then the adjusted priority orders induced by π, π̂ λ , and π̂ λ
are:
                                                                 3                      1
                                     π                    π̂ λ                   π̂ λ
                      a:   i1   i2       i3   i4    i1   i2      i4   i3   i1   i2      i3   i4
                      b:   i1   i2       i3   i4    i1   i2      i3   i4   i1   i3      i2   i4 .
                      c:   i1   i2       i3   i4    i1   i2      i3   i4   i1   i2      i4   i3
                      d:   i1   i2       i3   i4    i1   i2      i3   i4   i1   i2      i3   i4

                                                                                              1     1
      The outcome of the Taiwan Mechanism with deduction λ1 , i.e. T M λ (P, π) = DA(P, π̂ λ ),
is:                                                            !
                                                   i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                                 .
                                                   a c b d
If student i2 instead reports b as the top choice, then i2 obtains a better outcome than under
                                                               1
truth-telling. She has a higher score than i3 and i4 under π̂bλ when she ranks b as top choice.
             1
Under T M λ , student i1 never applies to school b. Therefore, at school b, student i2 is not
rejected and is assigned to the more preferred school b when she ranks b as top choice.
                              3
    On the other hand, T M λ produces:
                                                       !
                                         i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                         ,
                                          a b c d
                                                                                                        3
which is the same as DA(P, π). One can easily see that no student can manipulate T M λ
in (P, π).
    This example illustrates how manipulation possibilities increase as we increase deduction
points in the T M class. Our first proposition shows the pattern is more general than this
specific example.

Proposition 1. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, if λ1 > λ2 , then T M with deduction rule λ1 ,
          1                                                                  2
i.e. T M λ , is more manipulable than T M with deduction rule λ2 , i.e. T M λ .


                                                         10
Proof. We first show that there exists at least one (P, π) such that no student can manipulate
        2                                                  1
T M λ but some student can manipulate T M λ . Suppose λ1k = λ2k for all k < k̄ and λ1k̄ > λ2k̄ .
Let S = {s1 , ..., sk̄ , ...}, I = {i1 , ..., ik̄ , ...}, and qs = 1 for all s ∈ S. Student ik has the
k th highest score under π. Student ik prefers school sk as top choice for all k < k̄ and
student ik prefers ∅ as top choice for all k > k̄ + 1. Preference of ik̄ is: sk Pik̄ sk+1 for
all k ≥ 1. School sk̄ is the only acceptable school for ik̄+1 . Let πs (ik̄ ) − λ1k̄ < πs (ik̄+1 ) <
                              1                       2                                      2
πs (ik̄ )−λ2k̄ . Then, T M λ (P, π)(i) = T M λ (P, π)(i) for all i ∈ I \{ik̄ , ik̄+1 }, T M λ (P, π)(ik̄ ) =
        1                                                                   1
T M λ (P, π)(ik̄+1 ) = sk̄ . Then, student ik̄ can manipulate T M λ by ranking sk̄ as top choice
                                              2
but no student can manipulate T M λ .
                                  1                                           2
     Next, we show that T M λ is at least as manipulable as T M λ . We present two observa-
tions and three lemmas that we use in the proof.
Observation 1. For any (P, π), λ and i ∈ I, if sPi s0 then π̂sλ (i) ≥ π̂sλ0 (i).
       Observation 1 follows from the fact that λk ≤ λk−1 for any λ.
Observation 2. For any (P, π), there exists a unique stable matching which is the outcome of
the serial dictatorship (SD) mechanism under π and P .4 Hence, the unique stable matching
is also Pareto efficient.
   Observation 2 follows from the fact that πs = πs0 for any s, s0 ∈ S. With slight abuse of
notation, we use π(i) instead of πs (i) in the rest of the proof.
Lemma 1. For an arbitrary (P, π), let µ be the unique stable matching and ν be another
matching such that ν 6= µ. Then, there exists a student i such that µ(i)Pi ν(i) and µ(j) = ν(j)
for any student j with π(j) > π(i).

Proof. By Observation 2, µ is Pareto efficient and µ = SD(P, π). Since µ is Pareto efficient,
ν 6= µ implies that there exists a student i0 such that µ(i0 )Pi0 ν(i0 ). Without loss of generality,
let i be the student with the highest priority score under π who prefers µ to ν. On the
contrary, suppose there exists a student j with π(j) > π(i) and µ(j) 6= ν(j). Without loss of
generality, let j be such a student with the highest priority score under π. Then, ν(j)Pj µ(j).
However, this contradicts with the fact that µ is the outcome of the SD mechanism and i is
the student with highest score who prefers µ to ν.

   We consider sequential version of the DA mechanism introduced by McVitie and Wilson
(1970) in which students apply according to a predetermined order χ one at a time and in
each step the student who has the highest rank in χ among the ones whose offer has not
been tentatively accepted applies.
   4
       Notice that, under Assumptions 1 and 2, DA(P, π) = SD(P, π).




                                                    11
Lemma 2. For arbitrary (P, π), λ, and χ consider any step k of the sequential DA mecha-
nism under (P, π̂ λ ) such that there is only one student i who has not been tentatively accepted
by some school in S ∪ {∅}. If school s that i applies to in step k tentatively accepts her offer,
then i is assigned to s when the sequential DA terminates.

Proof. Let tk̄ = π̂s̄λ (ī) such that student ī applies in step k̄ of sequential DA to school s̄.
    In step k of sequential DA, student i is tentatively accepted by school s if either the
number of tentatively accepted students in step k − 1 by s is less than qs or there exists a
student j who is tentatively accepted in step k − 1 by s and π̂sλ (i) > π̂sλ (j). If the prior case
holds, then the mechanism terminates and the desired result follows. If the later case holds,
by Observation 1 and the fact that in each future step at most one student is not tentatively
assigned tk0 < π̂sλ (i) for any k 0 > k. Therefore, i will not be rejected by s.

Lemma 3. For arbitrary (P, π) and λ, let µ = DA(P, π) = SD(P, π) and ν = T M λ (P, π) =
DA(P, π̂ λ ). If µ =
                   6 ν, then there exists a student who can manipulate T M λ in (P, π).

Proof. First, we define an axiom, known as population monotonicity, that we use throughout
the proof.5 A mechanism ϕ is population monotonic if for any (I, S, q, P, π) after removal
of any student i the assignment of all remaining students are (weakly) improved, i.e. ϕ(I \
{i}, S, q, P−i , π|(I \ {i}))(j)Rj ϕ(I, S, q, P, π)(j) for all j ∈ I \ {i} where π|(I \ {i}) is the
restriction of π on students in I \ {i}.
    By Lemma 1, there exists a student i such that µ(i)Pi ν(i) and µ(j) = ν(j) for any
student j with π(j) > π(i). Since TM is non-wasteful, there exists a student k such that
                                        λ
ν(k) = µ(i) and π(i) > π(k) ≥ π̂µ(i)        (k). Under (P, π̂ λ ), we consider sequential DA for an
order χ such that student i is the last student under χ. First note that, when it is i’s
turn all seats at µ(i) are tentatively filled. Otherwise, i would be matched to µ(i) or better
school under ν. By the population monotonicity of (sequential) DA mechanism, when it is
i’s turn to apply there exists at least one student j 0 who is tentatively accepted by µ(i) and
           λ
π(i) > π̂µ(i)           λ
              (k) ≥ π̂µ(i) (j 0 ). This follows from the fact that under the tentative matching
attained just before i’s turn student k is assigned to weakly better school than ν(k) = µ(i)
and when the sequential DA terminates it selects matching ν. Hence, Lemma 2 implies that
student i can get µ(i) by ranking it as top choice.

   Now we are ready to give our proof for Proposition 1. Let µ be the student optimal
                                                                                        1
stable matching, i.e. µ = SD(P, π) = DA(P, π), and ν 1 and ν 2 be the outcomes of T M λ
         2
and T M λ , respectively. By Lemma 3, if ν 1 6= µ, then there exists a student j who can
                 1
manipulate T M λ . We need to consider two more cases.
  5
      We also use population monotonicity in the proof of Proposition 3.




                                                     12
                                                                                              2
     Case 1: ν 1 = ν 2 = µ. Suppose i can get school s by manipulating T M λ . For both
         1                2
(P, π̂ λ ) and (P, π̂ λ ), we consider the sequential DA mechanism for an order χ in which
i applies last. Let ν̄ 1 and ν̄ 2 be the tentative allocations obtained just before i’s turn
            1                 2
for (P, π̂ λ ) and (P, π̂ λ ), respectively. By the fact that ν 1 = ν 2 = µ and Lemma 2 and
Observation 1, ν̄ 1 (s0 ) = ν̄ 2 (s0 ) = µ(s0 ) and for all s0 Pi µ(i). Since i can get s by manipulating
       2                                                           2
T M λ , there exists a student ī ∈ ν̄ 2 (s) such that π̂sλ (ī) < π(i). Then, by the fact that
               1
λ1 > λ2 , π̂sλ (ī) < π(i). Hence, Lemma 2 implies that i can get s by ranking it as top choice
                1
under T M λ .
     Case 2: ν 2 6= ν 1 = µ. By Proposition 2 (see Section 3.1), ν 1 and ν 2 are Pareto efficient
under preference profile P . Hence, there exists at least one student k who prefers ν 2 (k) to
ν 1 (k). Let I¯ = {i ∈ I|ν 2 (i)Pi ν 1 (i)} and k ∈ I¯ have higher priority score than all other
students in I,    ¯ i.e., π(k) > π(j) for each j ∈ I¯ \ {k}. That is, ν 1 (i)Ri ν 2 (i) for each i ∈ I
with π(i) > π(k). Since ν 1 = µ = SD(P, π), there exists at least one student ī such that
π(ī) > π(k), ν 2 (k) = ν 1 (ī) and ν 1 (ī)Pī ν 2 (ī). Let s = ν 2 (k) = ν 1 (ī). Then, by the stability
                         2                            2          2
of ν 2 under (P, π̂ λ ), we have π(k) ≥ π̂sλ (k) > π̂sλ (ī). Then, by the fact that λ1 > λ2 ,
              2             1                         1
π(k) > π̂sλ (ī) ≥ π̂sλ (ī). Then for (P, π̂ λ ), we consider sequential DA mechanism for an
order χ in which k applies last. Let ν̄ 1 be the tentative allocation obtained just before k’s
turn for λ1 . By the fact that ν 1 = µ and Lemma 2, ν̄ 1 (s0 ) = µ(s0 ) for all s0 Pk µ(k). Hence,
                                                                                          1
Lemma 2 implies that k can get s by ranking it as top choice under T M λ .

    Within the class of Taiwan mechanisms, BM involves very large deduction points. There-
fore, Proposition 1 implies the following corollary.

Corollary 1. BM is more manipulable than any other Taiwan mechanism.

Proposition 1 relates to a statement of a high school principal in Tapei, who remarked
(CNA 2014b):

                as long as the deduction system exists, problems can not be solved.

    That is, the greater the amount of deduction, the more manipulable the mechanism is,
with manipulation only completely eliminated by DA, which sets all deduction points to
zero.
    There have been several changes to deduction schedules since the system was first launched
in 2014. Table 1 reports on these changes for 15 Taiwanese districts. In most cases, dis-
tricts have relaxed the deduction schedule from the first year. For instance, in Gaoxiong,
each choice has a weakly smaller deduction in 2014 than in 2015. The same applies when
we compare 2015 to the three years between 2016-2018. The two largest districts by num-
ber of applications, Jibei and Zhongtou, also changed their deduction schedules to reduce

                                                     13
the amount of deduction. Proposition 1 implies that each of these changes have made the
mechanism less manipulable. However, not all changes involves moves to less manipulable
mechanisms. For instance, in Jinmen, there were no deductions in 2014, while in 2015-2018
there were deductions for each choice after the first.


3     Equilibrium Analysis
3.1    Characterization
Proposition 1 compares the incentives generated by the mechanisms in T M class. We now
turn to analyzing the equilibrium properties of these mechanisms, by considering the Nash
equilibrium of the (simultaneous) preference revelation game induced by a Taiwan mecha-
nism, or hereafter the Taiwan game under complete information.
    Following Pathak and Sönmez (2008), we assume there are two types of students. Many
families report confusion about the new Taiwanese mechanism, but some have spend con-
siderable effort learning about the rules of the mechanism. Let N and M denote the set of
sincere students and sophisticated students, respectively. For each i ∈ N , the strategy space
of student i is {Pi }, so i can only submit her true preference. We motivate this modeling
choice by the fact that some participants may not understand how deductions change their
incentives. In the case of BM, there is evidence of heterogeneous levels of sophistication (see,
e.g., Pathak (2016) for examples). For each j ∈ M, student j’s strategy space is all strict
preferences over schools including being unassigned option.
    Similar to Pathak and Sönmez (2008), we define the augmented priority scores of sincere
and sophisticated students as follows.


Definition. Given a problem (P, π) and deduction rule λ, construct an augmented pri-
ority score list π̃ as:
     (i) For each school s, adjust each sincere student i ∈ N priority score according to
π̃s (i) = πs (i) − λrs (Pi ) (i.e., apply the deduction rule to sincere students for school s)
     (ii) For each school s, keep each sophisticated student j ∈ M priority score unchanged
π̃s (j) = πs (j).

   By using Example 1, we illustrate that the unique Nash equilibrium outcome and the
unique stable matching under the augmented priority scores coincide.

Example 1 (cont). In Example 1 with deduction rule λ1 , suppose student i1 and i3 are
sincere and student i2 and i4 are sophisticated. Students i1 and i3 each have only one strategy


                                              14
corresponding to truth-telling: abcd and bcda, respectively.6 Independent of the strategies
played by the other students, i1 gets school a in any equilibrium outcome. Moreover, student
i2 gets school b when she ranks it as first choice and i3 gets school b when i2 does not rank
b as first choice. Hence, in any equilibrium i2 ranks b as top choice and gets it. Similarly,
when i2 ranks b as top choice, student i4 can get school c by only ranking it as top choice.
Hence, there is a unique Nash equilibrium outcome:
                                                            !
                                                i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                              .
                                                a b d c
The augmented priority orders associated with π̃ are:

                                           a:    i1   i2   i4   i3
                                           b:    i1   i2   i3   i4
                                                                   .
                                           c:    i1   i2   i4   i3
                                           d:    i2   i1   i4   i3


The only stable matching under (P, π̃) is
                                                                !
                                                i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                            ,
                                                a b d c

which is the same as the unique equilibrium outcome.
   The observation that the Nash equilibrium outcome is related to the stable matching of
an augmented problem is more general than this example.
       We first show that under problem (P, π̃) there exists a unique stable matching.

Proposition 2. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, for arbitrary (P, π), λ, M and N , let π̃ be
the augmented priority score list. Under (P, π̃) there exists a unique stable matching and it
is Pareto efficient.

Proof. By using a recursive procedure, under (P, π̃), we show that one can always find a
student who has the highest priority among the remaining students at her top choice among
the remaining schools and we remove that student and a seat from that school. This student
will be matched to her top choice among the remaining ones in any stable matching and
there will not exist a possible welfare improvement trade between the remaining students
and this student.
   6
     For the sake of expositional simplicity, we do not include the strategies in which ∅ is not ranked as the
last choice.



                                                      15
    Let ik be the student who has the highest score in π among the students remaining in
Step k ≥ 1 of this procedure. We start with Step 1 in which all students and all seats are
available. By our construction, i1 has the highest priority at her top choice no matter she
is sophisticated or sincere. Moreover, she will be assigned to her top choice in any stable
matching, and therefore her welfare cannot be improved by trading with the other students.
We remove i1 and one seat from her top choice and consider the remaining students and
schools in Step 2.
    Suppose our claim holds for the first k − 1 steps of this procedure. Now consider Step
k. If ik is a sophisticated student, then she has the highest priority among the remaining
students at all remaining schools. Hence, the claim holds. Suppose ik is a sincere student.
Let s1 be her top choice among the remaining schools. If the student with the highest
priority for s1 among the remaining ones prefers s1 most, then we are done. Otherwise, we
consider the student i1 6= ik with the highest priority at s1 among the remaining students
and her most preferred school among the remaining ones denoted by s2 6= s1 . Note that,
ik cannot have higher priority than i1 at school s2 . If the student with the highest priority
for s2 among the remaining ones prefers s2 most, then we are done. Otherwise, we consider
the student i2 ∈/ {i1 , ik } with the highest priority at s2 among the remaining students and
her most preferred school among the remaining ones denoted by s3 ∈       / {s1 , s2 }. Note that,
ik and i1 cannot have higher priority than i2 at school s3 . By finiteness, we will eventually
find a student i and school s such that i has the highest priority at s among the remaining
students and i prefers s most among the remaining schools. Hence, in any stable matching
i is assigned to s and there cannot be a welfare improving trade involving student i.

   Next, we consider the preference revelation game under T M λ for any λ.

Proposition 3. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, for arbitrary (P, π), λ, M and N , let π̃ be
the augmented priority score list. Then, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium outcome of
this game and it is Pareto efficient and equivalent to DA(P, π̃).

Proof. By our construction of π̃, when each sophisticated student i ranks DA(P, π̃)(i) as
top choice and each sincere student j plays Pj , T M λ selects DA(P, π̃) and no sophisticated
student can benefit from deviation. Hence, DA(P, π̃) is a Nash equilibrium outcome and by
Proposition 2 it is Pareto efficient.
    Since under (P, π̃) there exists a unique stable matching (see Proposition 2), we will prove
that there cannot be a Nash equilibrium outcome which is not stable.
    On the contrary, let Q be a Nash equilibrium profile and the outcome of T M λ under
this strategy profile is µ, i.e., T M λ (Q, π) = µ, and µ is not stable under (P, π̃). Note that,
T M λ (Q, π) = DA(Q, π̂ λ ) where π̂ λ is the implied by (Q, π) and deduction rule λ.


                                               16
     If matching µ is individually irrational, then there exists a student i who is assigned to
an unacceptable school, i.e. ∅Pi µ(i). Since Qj = Pj for each j ∈ N and T M λ is individually
rational, i cannot be a sincere student. Then, individual rationality of T M λ implies that
ranking ∅ as top choice is a profitable deviation for i.
     Suppose µ is wasteful or not fair. Then, there exists a school-student pair (s, i) such that
sPi µ(i) and either |µ−1 (s)| < qs or π̃s (i) > π̃s (j) for some j ∈ µ−1 (s). Under both cases, we
consider sequential version of DA under (Q, π̂ λ ) such that i applies last. We first suppose
the former case holds. Since Qj = Pj for each j ∈ N and T M λ is nonwasteful, i cannot be a
sincere student. Then population monotonicity of DA implies that i can profitably deviate
by ranking school s as top choice. Now, we consider the latter case. By our construction if
i ∈ N and π̃s (i) > π̃s (j) then π̂sλ (i) > π̂sλ (j). Hence, i cannot be a sincere student. If i is
a sophisticated student, then the fact that DA is population monotonic, the construction of
π̃, and the proof of Lemma 2 imply that i can profitably deviate by ranking school s as top
choice.


3.2    Becoming Sophisticated
Many families report confusion about the new Taiwanese mechanism, but some have spend
considerable effort on learning about the rules of the mechanism. In the context of our
example, a student who becomes sophisticated becomes (weakly) better off, as we show
next.
                                                                                     1
Example 1 (cont.) In Example 1, if i2 and i4 are sophisticated, under T M λ the unique
equilibrium outcome is                         !
                                  i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                  .
                                   a b d c
Student i3 gets her third choice. If i3 becomes sophisticated, then the augmented priority
orders associated with π̃ are:
                                       a:   i1   i2   i3   i4
                                       b:   i1   i2   i3   i4
                                       c:   i1   i2   i3   i4
                                       d:   i2   i1   i3   i4

The unique equilibrium outcome when i2 , i3 and i4 are sophisticated is
                                                   !
                                   i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                     .
                                    a b c d

Hence, by becoming sophisticated, i3 is better off.


                                                 17
   This example illustrates a more general phenomenon summarized by our next proposition.


Proposition 4. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, consider arbitrary (P, π), λ, M and N . If a
sincere student i ∈ N becomes sophisticated, then under the equilibrium outcome of T M λ , i
becomes (weakly) better off.

Proof. Suppose that π̃ 1 is the augmented priority score profile when i is sincere, and π̃ 2 is
the one when i becomes sophisticated. By definition, for all s ∈ S π̃s1 (j) = π̃s2 (j) for all
j 6= i and π̃s1 (i) ≤ π̃s2 (i). That is, i is improved under the associated priority orders when she
becomes sophisticated. By Proposition 3, under both cases the unique equilibrium outcome
is equivalent to DA(P, π̃ 1 ) and DA(P, π̃ 2 ), respectively. Since, DA respects improvement in
priorities (see Balinski and Sönmez (1999)), DA(P, π̃ 2 )(i)Ri DA(P, π̃ 1 )(i).

   When one sincere student becomes sophisticated, she obtains a weakly better assignment.
Does this imply that other sophisticated students obtain weakly worse assignments? The
answer turns out to be no, as the following example illustrates.

Example 2. We slightly modify Example 1 by changing the preferences of i2 and i4 as
follows: aPi2 bPi2 dPi2 c and dPi4 cPi4 aPi4 b. Suppose initially only i4 is sophisticated. Then,
           1
under T M λ the unique equilibrium outcome is
                                                        !
                                           i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                          .
                                            a d b c
                                                                                 1
Now consider the case where i2 becomes sophisticated. Then, under T M λ when i2 and i4
are sophisticated the unique equilibrium outcome is
                                                        !
                                          i1 i2 i3 i4
                                                            .
                                          a b c d
Therefore, student i4 is better off after i2 becomes sophisticated. Note that, DA mechanism
also selects the same outcome when all students report their true preferences.


3.3    Changing Mechanisms
Given that the Taiwan mechanism is manipulable, it is natural to consider what the con-
sequences of adopting a non-manipulable mechanism. The most natural alternative in this
setting is DA, which is strategy-proof for students (Dubins and Freedman 1981, Roth 1982)
and increasingly in use (Pathak and Sönmez 2013, Pathak 2016). When schools share the
same priority, DA reduces to a serial dictatorship. In a serial dictatorship, we process appli-
cants in order and offer each applicant his or her most preferred school with seats remaining.

                                                18
                                                                                               1
Example 1 (cont.) In Example 1, student i3 is assigned a better school b under T M λ
than school c under the serial dictatorship mechanism.

   This result is related to comments made by Education Minister Chiang Wei-ling, who
remarked (Wei 2014):

           no new policy would be carried out unless it would “benefit all students.”

Proposition 4 shows that sophisticated students may lobby against changing the mechanism
and that the Taiwanese mechanism favors sophisticated students, since deduction only ap-
plies to sincere students. Indeed, it is consistent with the reluctance of Taiwanese authorities
to abolish deduction rules in the face of massive condemnation and street protests.
    However, it is not the case that all sophisticated students obtain a weakly better as-
signment under the Taiwan mechanism than under DA. This is a sharp contrast to earlier
comparisons between BM and DA in Pathak and Sönmez (2008). Example 2 shows that the
only sophisticated student i4 may actually prefer DA over the Taiwan mechanism.


4    Conclusion
A new nationwide system to assign children to high school in Taiwan generated widespread
turmoil and protests. In this paper, we have studied the incentive properties of this mech-
anism and characterized the equilibrium of the induced preference revelation game. Our
results show that any mechanism using deduction is manipulable, and that the scope for
manipulation increases with the size of deduction. The Taiwanese mechanism has a unique
equilibrium, which can be characterized in terms of a stable matching of an alternative econ-
omy. It is not possible to provide a strong comparison of the welfare of students in the
Taiwan mechanism compared to strategy-proof alternative.
    Our analysis provides a rationale for the reluctance of Taiwanese authorities to move to
a strategy-proof alternative, illustrating a broader dynamic seen with manipulable mecha-
nisms used in school choice and elsewhere. Changes in market designs rarely involve Pareto
improvements for all participants, and these participants may stand in the way of mechanism
changes.

A       Beyond Taiwan: Heterogeneous Priorities
In this appendix, we examine two examples of deduction mechanisms without assumption
1 and show that Proposition 1 and 3 no longer apply. The first example we consider shows
that opportunities for manipulation need not increase with higher levels of deduction.

Example 3. There are five schools S = {a, b, c, d, e} and five students I = {i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 , i5 }.
Let qs = 1 for all s ∈ S. The priority scores of students for schools are as follow: πa (i1 ) = 100,
πa (i3 ) = 98, πa (i4 ) = 97, πb (i2 ) = 99, πb (i3 ) = 98, πc (i3 ) = 87.5, πc (i4 ) = 86, πc (i5 ) = 100,
πd (i4 ) = 100, πd (i5 ) = 90, and πe (i3 ) = 100. The preference of students are as follows:

                                           P i1 : a ∅
                                           P i2 : b ∅
                                           P i3 : a b       c e ∅ .
                                           P i4 : a c       d ∅
                                           P i5 : d c       ∅

     We consider two deduction rules: λ = (0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2) and λ0 = (0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7). Given λ,
P and π, the implied priority scores profile π λ is: πaλ (i1 ) = 100, πaλ (i3 ) = 98, πaλ (i4 ) = 97,
πbλ (i2 ) = 99, πbλ (i3 ) = 97, πcλ (i3 ) = 85.5, πcλ (i4 ) = 85, πcλ (i5 ) = 99, πdλ (i4 ) = 98, πdλ (i5 ) = 90,
                                                                                            0      0
and πeλ (i3 ) = 98. Given λ0 , P and π, the implied priority scores profile π λ is: πaλ (i1 ) = 100,
   0                0                0               0                0                  0                0
πaλ (i3 ) = 98, πaλ (i4 ) = 97, πbλ (i2 ) = 99, πbλ (i3 ) = 96, πcλ (i3 ) = 80.5, πcλ (i4 ) = 84, πcλ (i5 ) =
         0                0                   0
98, πdλ (i4 ) = 93, πdλ (i5 ) = 90, and πeλ (i3 ) = 93.
     In this example, there is an Ergin (2002) cycle under π̂ λ and π and such a cycle does not
                 0
exist under π̂ λ .
     In this problem, T M λ selects:
                                                                       !
                                                i1 i2 i3 i4 i5
                                         µ=                               .
                                                 a b e d c
                               0
    In this problem, T M λ selects:
                                                                     !
                                                i1 i2 i3 i4 i5
                                       ν=                                .
                                                a b e c d

   Under T M λ , student i4 can manipulate her preferences by ranking c at the top and the
outcome is                                              !
                                      i1 i2 i3 i4 i5
                                ν=                        .
                                      a b e c d
                                                                                           0
On the other hand, no student can benefit from manipulation under T M λ .


                                                       23
   Next, we show that under Taiwan mechanism, it is possible for there to be a unique Nash
equilibrium outcome in weakly undominated strategies, but that outcome is not stable under
augmented priorities. This example slightly modifies the previous one.

Example 4. There are five schools S = {a, b, c, d, e} and six students I = {i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 , i5 , i6 }.
Let qs = 1 for all s ∈ S. Suppose all students are strategic. The priority scores of students
for schools are as follow: πa (i1 ) = 100, πa (i3 ) = 99.5, πa (i4 ) = 97, πb (i2 ) = 99, πb (i3 ) = 98.5,
πc (i3 ) = 90, πc (i4 ) = 86, πc (i5 ) = 100, πd (i4 ) = 100, πd (i5 ) = 90, πe (i3 ) = 100, and
πe (i6 ) = 99.5. The preference of students are as follows:

                                          P i1 : a ∅
                                          P i2 : b ∅
                                          P i3 : a b       c e ∅
                                                                 .
                                          P i4 : a c       d ∅
                                          P i5 : d c       ∅
                                          P i6 : e ∅

     We consider the following deduction rule: λ = (0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2). Given λ, π and P , the
implied priority scores profile π λ is: πaλ (i1 ) = 100, πaλ (i3 ) = 99.5, πaλ (i4 ) = 97, πbλ (i2 ) = 99,
πbλ (i3 ) = 97.5, πcλ (i3 ) = 88, πcλ (i4 ) = 85, πcλ (i5 ) = 99, πdλ (i4 ) = 98, πdλ (i5 ) = 90, πeλ (i3 ) = 98
and πeλ (i6 ) = 99.5.
     Note that, i1 and i2 can obtain their top choices by submitting their true preferences
and they may not be assigned to their top choices if they do not rank them as top choice.
Hence, in any weakly undominated strategy i1 and i2 rank their true top choice at the top.
Independent of the other students ranking, student i4 and i5 can get one of their top two
choices by submitting their true preferences.7 Moreover, submitting something else is weakly
dominated by their true preference profile.
     Similarly, if i6 ranks an unacceptable school at the top she may be assigned to it and
ranking ∅ as top choice is weakly dominated by her true preference profile. That is, for all
students except i3 submitting true preference is weakly undominated strategy. For such a
strategy profile i3 ’s best response is ranking e as top choice. Otherwise she will be unassigned.
The corresponding equilibrium outcome is:
                                                                        !
                                              i1 i2 i3 i4 i5 i6
                                     µ=                                     .
                                               a b e c d ∅



   7
    This holds when i1 , i2 , and i6 have priority scores lower than 70 for c and d and i3 has priority score
lower than 90 for d.
