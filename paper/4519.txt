       In pricing primary-market options and in making secondary markets, financial

intermediaries depend on the quality of forecasts of the variance of the underlying assets.

Hence, the gain from improved pricing of options would be a measure of the value of a

forecast of underlying asset returns. NYSE index returns over the period of 1968-1991 are

used to suggest that pricing index options of up to 90-days maturity would be more accurate

when: (1) using ARCH specifications in place of a moving average of squared returns; (2)

using Hull and White's (1987) adjustment for stochastic variance in Black and Scholes's

(1973) formula; (3) accounting explicitly for weekends and the slowdown of variance

whenever the market is closed.

1 Introduction
When distributions of asset returns are time varying, forecasts of asset-return variance
are valuable. Even passive investors need periodic variance forecasts to calibrate asset
allocation. More critically, financial intermediaries who must offer competitive bids
on primary-market options, or make market in outstanding options, need continuous
updating of variance forecasts.
    Since the variance of the underlying asset return is the only unobserved variable in
the Black and Scholes's (1973) valuation formula for options,' updates of variance are
the major contestable input to valuation of contingent contracts by direct parties or
financial intermediaries.
    Emphasis on improved variance forecasts also calls for a corresponding adaptation
of the pricing model that will explicitly account for stochastic volatility. When variance
risk is not priced,2 and the return distribution can be well approximated by a diffusion
process, the Hull and White's (1987) model is acceptable. Operationally, we must aver-
age the would be Black—Scholes prices for all possible variance rates over the life of the

option, using a variance forecasting algorithm to generate the probability distribution
of future variance rates. Another nuisance with stochastic volatility is that we cannot
invert observed option prices to obtain the correct implied volatility — a widely used
practice since Schmalensee and Trippi (1978).
    A natural criterion for choosing between any pair of competing methods to forecast

    'However, as Brenner and Galai (1986) observe, it is not all that clear which asset should be observed
to obtain the risk-free rate in the Black—Scholes formula.
  2The volatility of the variance of an underlying asset will not be priced if it is non-systematic.
When the variance is priced, the Black—Scholes formula in the Hull and White's (1987) model must be
amended to account for a deficiency in the asset risk premium. See McDonald and Siegel (1984) and
Heston (1992).
the variance of the rate of return on an asset would be the expected incremental profit
from replacing the lesser forecast with the better one. We used this principle in Engle.
Hong, Kane and Noh (1993) to estimate the profit from improving variance forecasts
in pricing one-day index options (see also an application by Mu.ller (1991) at BARRA).
and reported that the evidence favored GARCH forecasts.3 Obviously, implications that
apply to trading options of only one day maturity have little practical use. The role of
variance forecasts in pricing options of longer maturity is the focus of this paper.
    When daily variance forecasts are used to price options of longer maturities, the
persistence of changes in the variance rate affects the economics of pricing options in two
ways: first, the greater the volatility of the variance rate over the life of the option, the
more acute the need for an option-pricing model that accounts for stochastic volatility.
Moreover, a significant correlation of changes in the variance rate with economic factors
will worsen the accuracy of the Black—Scholes model, and reduce the remedial potential
of the Hull—White adjustment. Second, the greater the volatility and persistence of
changes in the variance rate, the greater the benefits from using one-day forecasts for
longer-maturity options. Put another way, if changes in the variance do not persist,
then the value of one-day forecasts for longer horizons will deteriorate quickly.
    In this paper we measure the economic value of two innovations in forecasting daily
variance rates: first, we use GARCH forecasts as an alternative to a moving average of
squared returns; second, we introduce a weekend calendar variable to the estimation and
forecasting algorithm to account for how long the market is closed, and the degree of

     We compared GARCB(l,l) to three versions of a moving average of squared residuals. Each forecast
algorithm was used to provide a rolling daily forecast of the NYSE-index return variance. We used three
alternative lengths of past observations to estimate the parameters: 300 days, 1,000 days and 5,000 days.
The twelve time series of forecasts were used to price and hypothetically trade one-day options. The
GARCE forecasts were decidedly superior in the NYSE sample for 1962 — 1990. Using an estimation
interval of 1,000 days was slightly better than either 300 or 5,000 days.

-:   slow-down of the variance rate during the time the market is closed. We also measure the
     value of using the Hull—White algorithm with the Black—Scholes option-pricing model
     to account for stochastic volatility in conjunction with the improved variance models.
        In section 2 we describe the variance forecasts for the NYSE index that are used
     in the exercise. In Section 3 we use Hansen and Hodrick's (1980) method to compute
     volatility of overlapping return series. SVe also compute critical values to test the sig-
     nificance of mean estimators of the return series for fixed ratios of overlapping period
     to sample period. In Section 4 we use the return history of the NYSE index over the
     period, 1968— 1991, to determine the realized payoffs to hypothetical options of various
     maturities on the NYSE index. We use these payoffs to examine the profitability of var-
     ious index-option trading strategies related to variance forecasts. Section 5 concludes
     the paper.


     2 The Variance-Forecast Algorithms
     Engle, Hong, Kane and Noh (1993) used twelve different specifications to generate
     alternative daily forecasts for the variance of the returns on the NYSE index and used
     these forecasts to price one-day options on the NYSE index. They operated a simulated
     market in these options as follows. Each day, differences in the variance forecasts of
     the twelve algorithms resulted in different reservation prices for one-day options on
     the underlying index. These differences triggered trades in the options among twelve
     hypothetical agents, each using one of the forecast algorithms. An agent with a higher
     variance forecast had a higher reservation price for the one-day option. Hence this agent
     would huy a straddle (one call and one put option) on a $1 share of the NYSE index
     from any of the other eleven agents with lower forecast/reservation prices. The exercise

                                                 3
price for these straddles was set at Si plus the risk-free rate, and a trade between two
agents was executed at the average of the reservation prices of the two agents, that is,
at the average of the bid/ask prices. Upon expiration of each one-day straddle over the
period 1962 — 1990, the realized daily returns on the NYSE were used to compute the

profit from each daily trade between each pair of agents. Overall, ARCH models showed
the highest profits and smallest standard deviations. A moving-average of 300 squared
residuals was the nearest competitor to ARCH forecasts.
     In this paper we extend the setting by supposing that on every day, at the money
options, straddles are traded with maturities from one day to one year. Positions are held
to maturity when profits are revealed. Consequently, traders must forecast volati]ities up
to one year ahead, and account for uncertain volatility in pricing straddles. We consider
several models. We use the 300 day moving-average as a simple variance estimate for
all horizons. Of the ARCH family of specifications first introduced by Engle (1982) and
surveyed in Bollerslev, Chou, and Kroner (1992), we use the GARCH(1,1) specification
for the NYSE return series:




                                   = a0+e
                                   =   b0 + b1_1 + b2h_1.                                (1)



     In order to generate variance forecasts of horizons from one day up to T days, the
most recent 1,000 daily observations are first used to estimate the parameters a0. b0,    b2

in   equation (1). The forward volatility forecasts are then computed from:




                                             4
                            = b5 b1e + b2h
                             =   b0   + blE[c÷k_lIwt1 + b2h11+s...1

                             =   b5     (b1 + b2)htt+k.1 , k =   2,... ,T,              (2)


where ht,,+k is the prediction of ht5 at time i. The average volatility is (lIT) '_. h,.,÷s.
We denote this forecast as GARCH.
   We expect the mean and variance of the return from market close to close to be
affected by calendar time, that is, mean and variance from Friday close to Monday close
are expected to be greater than, say, from Wednesday close to Thursday close, and more
so for long weekends. However, French and Roll (1986) showed that the variance rate
slows down significantly in days when the market is closed. In an attempt to capture
this phenomenon, we modify (1) and (2) multipllcatively as follows.




                     =   d[b0 + di1(b1c_1+ b2h,_1)]
                     =

                     = d+k{bo +                              + b2htf+k..lJ}

                     = d5{b5 + dJ1[(b1 + b2)h,,kj]} , k = 2,... , T,                     (3)


where d, is a calendar days variable that gives the number of calendar days between the

close of the previous trading day (t — 1) and the close of the trading day t. As explained
below. d, in the variance equation is raised to the power S which measures the average


                                                5
speed of the variance rate over the d calendar days of trading day t. As before, h+5
is the variance forecast made at date t for date t + k. We denote the GARCH forecast
adjusted for market closures by GARCH-D.

      Assuming that variance surprises are independent of economic factors, we can use the
Hull—White modification to the Black—Scholes formula. In order to test the potential
economic value of the Hull—White modification we use (2) as follows. For each date
    + k; k = 1,... , T, we generate 1,000 sets of e+(j);j = 1,... ,1000, from a standard
normal distribution. For each j     we   calculate the average daily variance rate over the
k = 1,... ,T days to maturity of the option, and use this variance rate to calculate
a price which is contingent on the j—th path. The average of these prices (over j =
1        1000 iterations) is the Hull and 'White's (1987) modified price. "iVe denote these
integrated prices by GARCH-I. A forecast that uses weekend dummies throughout the
integration will be denoted GARCH-DI.



3 Computation of Volatility of Overlapping Expected re-
   turn series
To show that one variance forecast method outperforms other methods significantly, we

need to compute standard errors of the mean of the return series to employ a t—test.
Hansen and Hodrick (1980) suggested a method to compute standard errors for overlap-
ping observations. Recently, Richardson and Stock (1989) proposed a different inference
based on a novel asymptotic argument. The difference is whether we treat multi-day
return series as stationary processes or non-stationary processes.
     Let R,,, be the one day return from options trading, which is assumed to be unpre-



                                              6
dictable from past values, except for a constant i. That is




                                                                                            (4)


where E[e,Iei_i, E_2, . . . ,    = 0 and E[((1/T) '_ E[eIe,_i, E,_2,           ,      * as
T — co by assumption. Also, assume that sup,E[e] < oo.

    Let's consider the following J—period returns


                         X+(J) = E Rm,+j_, t 0,... , T — J

and the regression


                                X,,(J) = (J)Z(J) + m÷(J),                                   (5)


where , in our case, Z(J) is 1. This case is not considered by Richardson and Stock
(1989) but the analysis is similar.
   The null hypothesis that we are interested in is H0 (J) = 0. Testing whether /3(J)
is zero requires constructing a standard error for /3(J). Asymptotic justification of the
conventional computation of standard error in the ordinary least squares(OLS) estimator
of 3(J) requires that the errors be serially uncorrelated. Consequently, one strategY is
to define the sampling interval to be equal to the return interval, the J—period. In such
non-overlapping samples, the number of observations can be small, even though the raw
sample is large. However, if we use data sampled more finely than the forecast interval.

   4By assumption, the returns are allowed to be conditionally heteroskedastic. However, IGARCH
process violates the assumption that sup,E[e1 < oo. See Engle and Bollerslev (1986).
we need to consider the serial correlation of errors in estimation. Hansen and Hodrick
(1980) proposed a variance estimator using specific weights on sample autocovariances
of errors and regressors. The standard theory assumes that the overlap iii the data
(denoted by J) is fixed as T —        so     that J/T —+   0.   11 we assume, as in Richardson
and Stock (1989), that J/T        6, then the conventional t—ratios of the coefficients in
regression analysis have different asymptotic distributions. Under the assumption that
J/T      8, the OLS estimate of the coefficient of the regression (5),




                                     =                  x,j(J),                            (6)


diverges as T —* m,   and (J)/../ has a limiting distribution given as a functional of
Brownian motions.5

   Hansen and Hodrick's (1980) variance estimator of/3(J) is computed as follows,

4 Estimation of the Value of Variance Forecasts with a
      Simulated Market in Index-Options of Various Maturi-
      ties
The objective is to estimate the potential profit from improving the variance forecast
when pricing options of various maturities. By using a simulated option market instead


                                             9
of observing actual index-option prices, we are able to circumvent perennial difficulties
that plague empirical studies of option prices: non-synchroneity of option and stock-
prices, market depth, the wild card delivery option, and dividend protection as well as
limited maturity dates and strikes. Thus, with a simulated index-option market, the
Black-Scholes model need only be reconciled with the fact that variance is stochastic.
     Table 2 shows average straddle prices that were written every day between 1968
—   1991   on one dollar's worth of the NYSE index, with an exercise price of Si plus
the risk-free rate (for the life of the option). These average prices are categorized by
maturity (in calendar days) for the alternative forecasting methods: MA, GARCH.
GARCH-I, GARCH-D and GARCH-DI. The interesting feature of these prices is that
GARCH prices are lower than MA prices for maturities shorter than three months and
GARCH prices are greater than MA prices for maturities longer than nine months.
For maturities up to 50 days, integration over alternative GARCH forecasts shown
by the GARCH-I column, produced higher average straddle prices than the GARCH.
However, for maturities in the range of 60 — 365 days, integration produced smaller
average straddle prices. Finally, adjusting GARCH and GARCH-I variance forecasts
to account for weekends increases average straddle prices for maturities up to 14 days
and decreases average straddle prices for maturities greater than 14 days, compared to
GARCH prices.
     Table 3 shows the annualized rate of return from a daily investment in straddles on
the NYSE index by two hypothetical agents one using MA and the other using GARCE
variance forecasts. Each day, each agent invests one dollar in each maturity (1 to 365
days) of straddles. The transaction price is the average of the reservation prices of the
agents based on their private variance forecasts. The position in each straddle is held


                                            10
to maturity, and the agent who takes the short position in a given maturity (due to a
lower variance forecast), invests the SI proceeds from writing the straddle plus the $1
endowment in the NYSE-index portfoliio for the life of the straddle. Upon maturity
each position is settled according to the actual level of the NYSE index on the maturity
date. Because the agents trade every day straddles of various maturities, holding periods
overlap. The straddles are always written on one dollar's worth of the NYSE index, with
an exercise price of $(I+r1), where the risk-free rate is taken from the one month T-bill
yields. The trades are executed at the average of the variance-forecast driven reservation
prices of the two agents.
   The first column of Table 3 shows the maturity of the traded straddles; there are
5,921 observations for each maturity. The third column in Table 3 shows the time
weighted annualized rate of return to the GARCH agent from the cash flows received
from, and paid to, the MA agent in lieu of settlements of the maturing straddles — based
on the history of the NYSE index over the period 1968— 1991. The fourth column and
fifth column in Table 3 enumerate the annualized rate of return to the MA and the
GARCH agents from investing in the NYSE-index portfolio on days when they took
short positions. The sixth and seventh columns shows the total annualized rate of
return of the MA and the GARCH agents from the entire trading activity. Because the
investment in the NYSE index augments the short positions, the competition between
the agents is not a zero sum game.
    The Flansen—Hodrick standard errors are given in parenthesis next to average rate
of returns and in the seventh column ordinary standard errors are given in the same
parenthesis as well. The difference between these two standard errors is growing as the
 maturity increases. For 1—year option, the Hansen—Hodrick standard error is ten times


                                             11
greater than the ordinary standard error! The eighth column compute t-ratios for the
total annualized rates of return of the GARCH agents in the seventh column using the
Hansen—Hodrick standard errors. Those that are significant at 5% can be chosen by the
critical values of the Table 1 in the previous section.
   Table 3 shows enormous rates of return to the CARd agent (at the expense of the
MA agent) from trades of short-term options: 1,903% for one-day options. The rates of
return are monotone decreasing with maturity up to 90 days and then increase again.
While at 22—days maturity the 126% annualized return is statistically and economically
significant, it is obvious that the apparent advantage of the CARCH forecasts over the
MA forecasts is fading with the forecast horizon. Above 22—days maturity, the average
rate of return is an economically significant 100% at maturity of 24 days. but is no
longer statistically significant. Note that the average rates of return to the CARCH
agents are positive for all maturities, and are still at 29% for a 1—year maturity.
   The return from investing short position proceeds in the market are not too different
for both agents, indicating that none specialized in short positions. While the higher
average straddle price (up to 90—days) from MA variance forecasts (Table 2) would have
us expect that the MA agent would take less short positions, proceeds from investing
short positions show that the variance in straddle prices swamps the mean difference
between the methods, and that the MA and GARCH agents' short/long psitions are
similarly distributed. The bottom line is that the GARCH forecasts are economically.
and statistically, significantly better than the MA forecasts in pricing options of up to
22 days maturity, for which the GARCH agent earned an average return of 126% from
the MA agent.
   Tables 4 — 6 present results from repeating the straddle trading exercise replacing



                                            12
the GARCH agents of Table 3 with improved GARCH forecasts. Table 4 presents the
results from integrating the straddle price from the Black—Scholes formula over the
GARCH forecasts based on the distribution of forecasting errors from past forecasts to
implement the Hull and White correction. The rates of return earned by the GARCH-I
agent are markedly better than those earned from the MA agent by the GARCH agent.
In Table 5 GARCH-D agent accounts for the weekend effect by using equation (3). The
rates of return earned by the GARCH-D agent for short maturities are better than
those by the GARCH agent from MA agent. The improvement in the forecasts fades
with maturity, and becomes insignificant for maturities over 20 days. Tables 6 shows
the results from incorporating the weekend effect into the integrated GARCH forecasts.
The average annualized return for a 28-days maturity is 112% (compared with 59% for
the GARCH agent), and is still statistically significant.
   Figure 2 plots the cumulative percentage returns to the GARCH and GARCH-DI
agents from the MA agent by maturity. The graphs show the economically significant
improvement that can be obtained by integrating the forecast with the Hull-White
method and accounting for the weekend effect.
   Tables 7 — 9 measure the value of the improved GARCH forecasts by trading against

a GARCH agent. Tables 7 shows that the GARCH-I forecasts are economically and
statistically better than the GARCH forecasts for up to 90—days maturity. Incorporating
both improvements yields better rates of return for almost all maturities.


5 Conclusions
The return history of the NYSE suggests that the choice of variance forecasts for pricing
index options can make a significant economic difference to investors. The impact on

investment in index options from choosing between different one-day forecast methods
used in this paper apply to options of maturity of up to one month. An important
step in improving variance forecasts is to make Hull and White's (1987) modification
to Black and Scholes's (1973) formula. Moreover, incorporating the weekend effect into
the parameter estimation and forecast specification is also important.
   Using simulated option markets has circumvented the problems of market depth.
price synchroneity, dividend protection and delivery options. Thus these results are
not subject to objections grounded in problems that plague empirical work with actual
option prices. The stage is now set to investigate actual option prices and attempt to
isolate price events that result from changing variance forecasts from those that result
from one of the market imperfections that traders are facing.

and set 5o = 0. The functional central limit theorem(FCLT)7 states that the random
function {(1/v')S[TAl}, A E [0, 1], weakly converges to a standard Brownian motion
