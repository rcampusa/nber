                                          ABSTRACT

   Catholic churches in Renaissance Florence supported themselves overwhelmingly from the
contributions of wealthy citizens. The sale of private chapels within churches to individuals was a
significant source of church funds, and facilitated a church construction boom.
   Chapel sales offered three benefits to churches: prices were usually far above cost;
donor/purchasers purchased masses and other tie-in services; and they added to the magnificence of
the church because donors were required to decorate chapels expensively.

   Donors purchased chapels for two primary reasons: to facilitate services for themselves and their
families, such as masses and church burials, that would speed their departure from Purgatory; and
to gain status in the community. Chapels were private property within churches, but were only
occasionally used directly by their owners. The expense of chapels and their decorations made them
an ideal signal for wealth, particularly since sumptuary laws limited most displays of wealth.

   To overcome the contributions free-rider problem, these churches sold private benefits not readily
available elsewhere, namely status and salvation.

I. Introduction

The United States has long been “the land of nonprofits.” When Alexis de Tocqueville visited in

1831-32, he noted America’s distinctively widespread and successful use of voluntary

associations (de Tocqueville 1835).2 In recent decades, secular nonprofits in the United States

have grown dramatically in size and importance. But the nonprofit as a crucial player in society

is neither an exclusively modern nor predominantly American phenomenon, and many

nonprofits have a religious base. Our paper considers the operation of a historic, non-American,

religious-based nonprofit: the Roman Catholic Church. The most important nonprofit in

Renaissance Florence, the Church had two clear objectives: to address the needs of the

parishioners, and to build churches in order to propagate the faith. To meet these objectives and

to grow as an institution, the Church needed substantial private support from donors.It sold

private chapels within churches were sold to get such support, and these sales brought in

significant tie-in revenues from burials, funerals, and commissioned masses. The monies

supported the construction, expansion, and renovation of churches, and the religious services

celebrated in the chapels provided employment for many priests and members of religious

orders. Those who provided financial support enjoyed the satisfaction of contributing to noble

and spiritual endeavors. But they also reaped considerable private benefits, notably status,




                                                                                                                     1
permanent recognition, and expectations of salvation. The Church thus sold benefits to donors to

raise private funds, and transformed the private funds into public goods.

       This “transformation” of contributions from wealthy merchants and bankers involved the

production of art. In Renaissance Florence, the Church played a major role in stimulating the

visual arts, architecture, and music, though this was not the mission of this institution. (Support

of the arts is often a role of modern nonprofits, but the history of the Church demonstrates how

faith-based organizations can deliver public services in this area.) Most visitors to Florence today

assume that the extraordinary examples of religious art and architecture were commissioned by

the local church, and that each church was largely controlled by the Vatican. In fact, most church

art was privately commissioned and privately owned, and the local churches had a large degree

of local autonomy. Even the chapels themselves, which contained most of the art, remained

private property until modern times. The sale, decoration, and staffing of private chapels played

a fundamental role in the fundraising and financing of local churches in Renaissance Florence.

The art produced benefited not only the donors, but also the general public and the Church. Most

Florentines believed that works of art contributed to the glorification of God, the dignity of the

Church, and the status of the city.

       This paper focuses on Florentine churches over about 250 years. This period begins about

1280, when construction began on the first two churches to contain significant numbers of

private chapels, the late Medieval basilicas of Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella. It ends in

the early 1530s, when Renaissance Florence became a duchy, and the Medici family began to

exercise much greater control over local churches, and specifically on the sale and decoration of

private chapels. Sections II, III, IV, and V address the historical context of our analysis. Section

II looks at the similarities between the functions and needs of modern nonprofits and the




                                                                                                       2
Renaissance Church, and how the selling of chapels provided a useful way to raise money.

Section III discusses the currency and prices of Renaissance Florence, and the reasons for our

chronological and geographic focus. Section IV discusses the layout of Renaissance churches,

including a description of private chapels, and the construction of these spaces. Section V

explores funding, especially for construction costs, with special attention to the sale of private

chapels.

       Sections VI and VII consider why churches offered such spaces for sale, and why donors

bought them. Section VI addresses the supply side of chapels, reviewing the experience of three

major churches. It argues that local churches supplied private chapels because the benefits they

received -- the direct payments for the chapels, tie-in revenues, and enhancements to the church -

- substantially outweighed the costs. Section VII looks at the demand for chapels. Why were

donors willing to pay significant amounts to obtain and decorate private chapels, and to pay for

masses in these spaces? It argues that the demand arose because the donors could buy benefits

not available elsewhere, primarily salvation and status. (Similarly, the donation of a building to a

university both establishes a form of immortality for one’s name and enhances one’s status.)

Section VIII consists of some short concluding remarks.



II. Renaissance and Modern Nonprofits

1. The Renaissance Church as a nonprofit. Lester Salamon noted that all nonprofits share six

characteristics: they are organized, private, self-governing, voluntary, public benefit in nature,

and they do not distribute any surplus or profits (Salamon 1999, 10-11). Clearly, the Renaissance

Church in Italy was a highly organized and self-governing institution. It can, on the whole, be

considered voluntary: though virtually all Italians were Roman Catholics, and Church regulations




                                                                                                     3
demanded participation in certain activities, most people rarely attended mass. The Church also

fits the “functional definition” of nonprofits, that they work in the public interest or for public

purposes.3 In Renaissance Italy, it offered several essential services that the local government

could not or would not provide: education for children, charity for the poor, medical assistance

for the sick, and of course meeting spiritual needs.

       In theory, there were severe non-distribution constraints within the Renaissance Church:4

the abbot of a monastery, for example, could not simply pocket surplus revenue. Nevertheless,

the power of the Church and the high degree of local authority led to widespread abuses. Perhaps

the most infamous example is one that stirred protests by Martin Luther in the early 1500s. After

the Archbishop of Magdeburg, Germany, raised considerable funds through the sale of

indulgences, he sent half to Rome for the construction of the church of St. Peter’s, and kept half

to pay off his debt with the local banking family. Among local churches in Florence, however,

the profit derived from the sale of chapels and masses was used primarily to construct, maintain,

and staff the building.

2. Free-riders and private beneficiaries. The most critical challenge to many nonprofits,

regardless of era or locale, is to secure financial support. Nonprofits that provide

subsidized benefits to the community, but receive insufficient government funding to

provide them, need support from private parties. Rarely will altruistic concerns be

sufficiently powerful to ensure the needed funding. As Mancur Olson (1965)

demonstrated in The Logic of Collective Action, voluntary organizations (those that lack

coercive powers to tax) confront serious free-rider problems. Few individuals will

provide substantial support to a truly collective undertaking; all will seek to capitalize on

the contributions of others.




                                                                                                      4
        Olson perused the American landscape, and found that successful nonprofit

organizations had found a clever solution. They provided private benefits that are not

readily available elsewhere in exchange for contributions. For example, the American

Medical Association, once very powerful, could charge stiff dues because it provided its

members with a valuable referral network. Similarly, as we shall see, the churches of

Renaissance Florence provided individuals with salvation aids -- private masses,

indulgences, and intramural burial spaces -- in exchange for contributions.

        Olson also briefly observed that individuals donate to charity “because of a desire

for respectability or praise.” We provide strong evidence that such status-seeking

motivated church contributions in late Medieval and early modern Italy. In particular, it

motivated major donations to purchase chapels and significant expenditures to decorate

them. Whether in Renaissance Florence or modern America, nonprofits capitalize on

their distinctive capability to convey status. They publicly associate the donor with other

distinguished individuals and families, and provide a socially acceptable way to signal

one’s wealth.5

3. Profits from the Provision of Private Benefits. To sell at a high markup, nonprofits

must focus on goods and services where they have market power. Modern churches that

own regular businesses can at best charge a modest “feel good” premium beyond market

price. Big premiums require major advantages in the market. Many wealthy churches

accumulate their wealth by providing the hope for a better afterlife in exchange for

contributions. The most successful in this domain, such as the Mormon church, which

requires tithing to stay in good stead, are often very explicit about possible states for

one’s eternal life.




                                                                                              5
       What net profit does a nonprofit receive when it provides a private benefit in

exchange for a contribution? Its net is the whole contribution less fundraising costs and

the costs of providing benefits to donors. Most Renaissance churches offered private

masses, which could reduce the time that donors would spend in Purgatory. These

services required private masses, which led to the need for priests to conduct them.

       Physical structures offer a different story. Contemporary universities tend to sell

buildings at or sometimes below cost. However, they often sell rooms and spaces within

them as well. Such double sales afford the potential for profit. The amount of profit

depends significantly upon how essential the building is for the nonprofit. A needed dorm

essentially reaps a 100 percent surplus from any donations; the university would have

built the structure even if it did not receive outside funds. But if the new building will

house some little-used museum, say, even a contribution of the full construction cost may

entail a loss, since the land will likely be given for free, and maintenance will be

required.

       We demonstrate that chapels provided a wonderful way to finance the

Renaissance church. First, the monopoly on afterlife benefits allowed churches to sell

their goods and services -- chapels and masses -- at prices well above cost. Second,

though chapels were sold to private parties, donors were rarely physically present in their

chapels. These individuals selected and paid for the expensive decorations within

chapels, and both the art and architecture added significantly to the magnificence of

churches. Third, the church, like the modern university selling buildings, could boost

prices due to the status benefits donors received.




                                                                                              6
          The benefits to a church from the sale of a private chapel can be summarized as

follows:

Benefits = [price of chapel – cost of chapel]
        + value of benefits from tie-in sales
        + value to church of decorated chapel.


The last term is what the church itself would have paid to secure the decorated chapel if

no one would donate it. Our analysis shows that chapels generally sold at prices far above

cost; the term in brackets was solidly positive. The two additional terms made the

proposition of selling private chapels even more attractive.

4. Residual claimants. One characteristic feature of for-profit organizations is a clear

residual claimant, namely the shareholders. This implies that all parts of the organization

are working toward a common purpose. In many contemporary nonprofits, it is not clear

who is the residual claimant. Theoretically, it would be the board, but they are not

allowed to take any surplus. It might be posited that the board’s preferences will guide

the allocation of the surplus, but directors of the same nonprofit may have vastly different

ideas of what the organization should do. Interestingly, the intended residual claimants in

monastic churches were the religious orders, whose members had taken vows of poverty.

They could not accept sums of money beyond living expenses, but they could accept

prestigious buildings and beautiful decorations. These made their lives more pleasant,

raised the respect of their profession, and, by adding to the glorification of God,

contributed to one of the stated goals of the nonprofit to which they had dedicated their

lives..

          Lay people usually dominated the building committees of Medieval and

Renaissance churches, and thus they often made key decisions on chapel sales. This was



                                                                                               7
the situation in the church of Santo Spirito, where the building committee did not

maximize revenues from the sale of chapels. Rather, it set low prices for some of the

most prestigious chapels, which were purchased by members of the building committee.

It is not clear to what extent this was self-dealing, as opposed to representing rewards for

past and contemplated future contributions.

5. Focus on posterity and mission drift. Nonprofit organizations can last much longer

than the human life span. Harvard University has passed the 350-year mark, and the

Catholic Church is into its third millennium. Conspicuous association with such an

institution -- say by paying for a named and long-lived physical structure it uses --

provides a form of immortality. Such immortality is not achievable through either family

or personal possessions, which change their names and ownership. How can a nonprofit

assure current donors that the assets promised in return for their contribution will not be

taken back in the future? Part of the answer is that since the nonprofit must continue to

raise new funds, current management has to show fidelity to past donors; drawing down

an endowment or allowing physical structures to languish can sound a death knell for a

nonprofit.

       Nevertheless, nonprofits can compromise their mission if they have a strong fundraising

orientation, especially one that relies heavily on the sale of private benefits. An organization may

shifts its goals in order to attract donors and funds. Fundraising performance often becomes a

prime marker of the success of the organization’s leader, which further shifts his activities. In

addition, donors may gain some control over the organization, and influence its direction. The

original objectives of the organization then receive relatively less emphasis, and new goals

emerge. With time, the mission of the organization tends to drift.




                                                                                                    8
        The history of the Catholic Church helps illustrate these dangers. In the late Medieval

period, it began to sell private benefits in order to support itself, and then to grow in numbers of

physical structures and personnel. The activities surrounding these sales noticeably influenced

the behavior of the individual churches involved. To support their staffs, many churches became

virtual mass and funeral factories for a small number of wealthy benefactors. Partially as a

reaction against these abuses, the Vatican in the late sixteenth century took an increasing active

role in regulating the sale of privately-owned chapels. By the nineteenth century private

ownership of chapels had virtually disappeared, though private burial areas in churches can still

be purchased today.6 The Church, like other nonprofits, must balance its focus on posterity, and

thus its fundraising activities, with efforts to limit the drift of its original mission.



III. Measures for and Focus of the Analysis

1. Prices and currency. Most studies of Renaissance art and architecture provide prices in florins

only, but these figures are difficult to compare, given the ever-increasing value of the florin in

the Renaissance, and they are even harder to relate to our own times.7 Following the example of

Richard Goldthwaite, we compare prices to the rate of pay for unskilled construction workers,

which remained extremely stable at roughly ½ lira per day from 1350 to 1527. A full-time

laborer could hope to work at most about 270 days a year, given the large number of religious

holidays. Goldthwaite (1980) estimated that during the entire period under consideration one

“man-year” of unskilled labor was worth about 150 lire; the total yearly cost to provide one adult

with essentials was 55 to 75 lire.8

2. Chronological and geographic limits. We focus on Florence from about 1280 through the

1530s, for three reasons. First is the extraordinary reputation enjoyed then and now by the art and




                                                                                                       9
architecture produced in late Medieval and Renaissance Florence. The Church not only

employed and encouraged the patronage of major artists, but also played a crucial role in the

preservation of their work. Most surviving Renaissance works were made for private chapels in

churches, and many of these objects and structures are now owned or protected by modern

nonprofits.

       A second reason to focus on Florence is the unusually rich quantity, quality, and variety

of surviving documentation. The best known original source are the records of the Catasto; these

and related financial records were made on several occasions in the 1400s and beyond. Other

significant documents include the private account books kept by merchants, a type of financial

record particularly popular in Florence, and the account books and memorials kept by churches.

Though this treasure trove of documentary material is exceptional for a major Renaissance city

in Europe, it is highly fragmentary in comparison with the material available for modern

economic studies.

       As a result of the abundant source material, there are far more studies on the history and

society of medieval and Renaissance Florence than on any other Italian city. The research of five

scholars has been particularly important for this paper: Richard Goldthwaite (1968, 1980, 1993)

on the construction industry, banks, and private wealth; Sharon Strocchia (1992) on Tuscan

funerary rituals; and Samuel Cohn (1988, 1992) on wills in Tuscany.9 In addition, the Ph.D.

dissertations by Annegret Höger (1976) and Ena Giurescu (1997) offer crucial information on

the origins of private chapels in Florence. Remarkably, given the plethora of research and

publications on Renaissance architecture, no study has established a complete financial record of

the total expenses and funding sources for the construction of a church. Very few sustained

studies address the phenomenon of private chapels over the course of our period.10




                                                                                                 10
       A third motivation for our geographic focus is that private citizens played a particularly

large role in the economy and government of late medieval and Renaissance Florence. Bankers

and merchants paid for the vast majority of the church decorations, and made substantial

contributions toward the construction of churches. Perhaps in no other city were so many

churches remodeled or rebuilt in order to accommodate private chapels. The economic

sophistication of the Florentines, their abundance of liquid wealth, and their business leaders’

need to display their status all contributed to the success and refinement of this fundraising

instrument for the leading Renaissance nonprofit (Goldthwaite 1993). The direct funding of the

Renaissance Church in Florence by private individual and family donors provides a useful

parallel to modern American nonprofits.



IV. The Organization and Construction of Churches

1. Definitions. Since the Middle Ages, every major city in Europe has had a cathedral, the

principal church of the diocese, which contained the cathedra or throne of the bishop, and

several parish churches under the bishop’s direct supervision.11 In addition, vast numbers of

monastic churches were built in this period; these constitute most of the examples in our study.

Monastic churches were open to the general public but designed to meet the needs of the

religious community that lived in the adjacent monastery or convent. Nearly all were basilicas;

that is, they had an oblong plan and longitudinal axis, usually consisting of a central nave and

side aisles. Transept arms extended from both sides of the main chapel or high altar, both located

at the end of the nave (figures 1, 3). Two significant architectural features in monastic churches

were the choir, an enclosed structure usually located in front of the high altar, where the

members of the order prayed and sang, and the rood screen, which bisected the nave, keeping




                                                                                                    11
women in the area further from the high altar.12 The “religious” were the members of the orders -

- the friars, nuns, monks, and canons. Most male religious were not priests, so they could

participate in but not officiate at mass. The most prominent orders throughout Europe, including

Tuscany, were the Franciscans and Dominicans. Both were mendicant orders; their rule

embraced collective poverty. The friars had no personal property, and thus they had to seek

donations to support themselves, their churches, and their mission goals.

2. Private chapels. During our period, the term “chapel” referred to any area where mass was

conducted, and was virtually synonymous with altar. Altar tables were attached to the side and

entrance walls of churches, to columns, and even to rood screens. In this paper, however, we

usually use chapel in the modern sense, to refer to a discrete architectural area, with the altar

table opposite the entrance. A chapel could be a spatial box defined by three walls, with the

fourth side originally closed off by a metal gate, as in the churches of Santa Maria Novella and

Santa Croce (figures 1-5), or a shallow niche, as in the church of Santo Spirito (figures 6-7). In

most churches such spatial boxes were built in both arms of the transept; in many churches, such

as San Lorenzo, chapels of this type also lined the side aisles.

       Most chapels and wall altars were private property. The main exceptions in Florence

were the Cathedral, which did not have private chapels, and the high chapels in some monastic

churches, which remained the property of the religious orders. The rights to private chapels were

sold most often to individuals or families, including brothers and extended clans, but at times to

groups such as lay brotherhoods or trade associations.13 The main function of chapels was as a

setting for memorial masses, not a place for individuals to attend mass. In addition, many private

chapels provided burial places for donors and their families.




                                                                                                     12
       In Florence, the first churches with significant numbers of private chapels are in two

basilicas built for the leading mendicant orders, which were both rebuilt in the late 1200s and

early 1300s. The Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella has four spatial box chapels in the

transept (figures 1-2), and the slightly later Franciscan church of Santa Croce has ten (figures 3-

5). In the later middle ages, the new class of extremely wealthy and status-conscious merchants

created a strong demand for private chapels. By the late 1300s, these chapels had became

popular across Europe, especially in affluent commercial cities such as Florence, and they line

the walls of most late Medieval and Renaissance churches.

       The sale of private chapels strongly affected church architecture. In fifteenth-century

Florence, architects created plans that allowed for more of these privately-owned spaces (see

Saalman 1993; Goldthwaite 1993, 122-23). In San Lorenzo and Santo Spirito, for example,

Brunelleschi abandoned the tradition of wall altars along the aisles and made plans for a series of

spatial chapels (figures 6-7). The advantages of this arrangement were sufficiently great that

other churches, including Cestello, were remodeled, and the designs for new churches provided

for spatial chapels along the side walls (figure 8).

       For most practical purposes, these chapels were private property, and identified as such

by conspicuous inscriptions, coats of arms, and banners. Chapels were purchased, left to heirs,

and in many cases resold. Other than priests, few people ever entered these spaces. Since the

spatial box chapels were located in the transept, beyond the rood screen, they were off limits to

women, and men would have found them locked with gates. From a distance, visitors could

appreciate the architecture and decorations in private chapels. However, the main images of

many altarpieces were covered by curtains or shutters.14 The paintings would be visible on

special occasions, such as feast days or when masses were held at these altars.




                                                                                                    13
       Prestigious chapels were expensive. In the late 1400s, Piero del Tovaglia reasoned, “If I

spend 2,000 florins on my townhouse (palazzo), my dwelling on earth, then 500 devoted to my

residence in the next life seem to me money well spent.” This wealthy Florentine evidently

planned on spending 500 florins for his private chapel and tomb (Kent 1995, 183). The purchase

price of a private chapel constituted only a part of the total cost, often less than half. The related

tie-in expenses were furnishing the chapel with an altar and required liturgical instruments,

decorating the space, and providing funds for priests to say masses. In the late 1400s, Filippo

Strozzi, spent 300 florins (16 man-years) on a chapel in Santa Maria Novella -- the standard

price for a private chapel in a main church -- and over 900 (48 man-years) on the decorations and

the tomb within (Sale 1976). (The Strozzi chapel is in the right transept, adjacent to the main

chapel; figure 1). The magnificence of the church benefited from such furnishings and

decorations, and the coffers of the church benefited directly from the payment for masses.15

These additional responsibilities constitute one significant difference between chapels and

traditional private property. If owners failed in these obligations, they could lose the right to the

chapels, as happened repeatedly in various churches during our period. A second unusual

characteristic of chapels as private property is that their owners rarely visited them. Most donors

probably went only a few times a year.

       As context for these figures, in 1427, tax (Catasto) officials established the expected

maintenance cost of a single adult at 14 florins, just under half of one man-year.16 The yearly

income of higher government officials in the fifteenth century was 100-150 florins, and that of a

manager in a merchant-banking house was 100-200 florins. Many of the patrons discussed in this

paper were extremely affluent, with a personal wealth declared in Catasto records at between

5,000 and 10,000 florins. In 1427, Cosimo de’ Medici was worth 100,000 florins (3,137 man-




                                                                                                     14
years). Other financial records reveal that the personal assets of some prominent donors were

considerably higher: Niccolò di Jacopo Alberti was worth 340,000 florins (10,741 years) in

1377, and Filippo Strozzi was worth 116,000 florins (6,138 man-years) in 1491.17

3. Church Construction Boom. Florence witnessed an explosion in the number and size of its

churches in our period. This development was not a response to demographic expansion. Even

by the mid-1500s, the population had not regained its level of 1348 when the Black Death wiped

out between half and two-thirds of the residents. Nevertheless, the number of churches had

dramatically increased, and many of the older buildings had been extensively restored. The

quantity of these monuments, the modern style of their architecture, and the quality of the art

they contained, were not necessary for the traditional functions of the Church: masses,

confession, charity, and education. However, the construction boom brought several advantages

to the priests and religious in local churches. The new or renovated buildings enhanced the

prestige of the Church and religious orders, and they attracted considerable additional funds that

permitted an increase in the number of the priests and religious, and the quality of their lives.

4. Public Goods from Church Construction. Most Florentines believed that the construction or

major renovation of a church brought two major public goods. First, churches glorified God, the

Virgin, and the Saints -- a larger, more beautiful building was interpreted as expressing greater

praise to these holy figures, a benefit to all residents in the city. Within the religious orders, this

view had to be balanced against the ideals of austerity and simplicity, especially those

championed by St. Francis. For his followers, indeed for all Christians, the primary justification

for such buildings and their decoration was the glorification of God. New and renovated

churches added to a city’s beauty and reputation, another public good for its residents. This view

was often expressed both explicitly and implicitly by Medieval and Renaissance sources. This




                                                                                                      15
was a period of extraordinary competition between neighboring Italian city-states, such as

Florence, Siena, and Pisa. This atmosphere encouraged governments and citizens to praise their

cities in public and private. A wide range of surviving documents, from formal decrees and

academic discourse to travel books and private journals, describe the beauty and justify the

reputation of cities by celebrating their major architectural monuments, especially each city’s

Cathedral and most prominent churches.

          Some of the public goods attributed to local churches benefited a defined population, and

might be thought of as “bounded” public goods. In a modern society, this term could apply to a

public park in the suburbs, which overwhelmingly helps local residents, though outsiders may

use it occasionally. In our period, the residents of Florence and most other large European cities

had an extremely developed sense of belonging to particular neighborhoods (Eckstein 1995).

Florence was divided into four quarters, each of which was partitioned into districts. The

construction or renovation of a local church would add to the beauty of the entire city, but would

especially improve the status of a particular neighborhood. In addition, Medieval and

Renaissance accounts often refer to churches and the art within as fulfilling an obligation to holy

figures, and expressed the hope that such commissions would bring more benefits. These

obligations and hopes were felt most strongly by those who worshiped in the new or renovated

church.

5. Construction Costs. The single largest expense for local churches was construction costs for

the church and related buildings. Other major expenses fall into three main categories: church

decoration, including stained glass windows, frescoes, statues, and altarpieces; staff living

expenses for the religious, including room, board, and clothing; and religious functions,

including liturgical objects, special vestments, and candle wax. Local churches employed




                                                                                                  16
architects and workers to construct buildings or chapels. Private individuals rarely paid for these

expenses directly but they did hire artists to decorate private chapels, and they purchased the

many objects needed for masses at private altars.

       Partial construction costs for several fifteen-century churches in Florence have been

collected and analyzed by Goldthwaite. The most complete data are for Santo Spirito, largely

rebuilt between 1477 and 1491 (figures 6-7). For these years, the detailed account books itemize

construction costs of 83,172 lire (554 man-years) for the main church. In 1449-50, the much

smaller church of San Pancrazio was said to cost 5,500 florins (176 man-years).18 For the

medium-sized church of San Salvatore, the merchant Castello Quaratesi bequeathed 14,000

florins (523 man-years) in 1465, but when the building was completed at the end of the century,

the private chapels were then sold to raise additional funds.19

6. Chapel costs. Original documents and modern authors often indicate the price of chapels, or

the amount of money left in wills for these spaces, but the cost of actually building chapels is

rarely discussed, and is extremely difficult to determine. Since some churches had considerable

market power in chapel sales, the gap between price and cost might be great.

       One extremely valuable source is the account book for the church of Cestello (Luchs

1977; figure 8). In the early 1480s, this church was built with uninterrupted nave walls which led

to the only chapel, the high altar. In 1488, plans were made to add eight new chapels in the nave,

four on each side. To build them, the side walls had to be pierced and new spatial box chapels

added, a process much more costly than building chapels in a new church. The Cestello patrons

paid 50 to 70 florins (2.2 - 3.1 man-years) for their chapels, about a quarter of the price of

chapels at Santo Spirito at the time. Only the Cestello sums correspond to actual building costs.

Most of its chapels cost between 50 and 60 florins to build for the walls only, excluding the




                                                                                                   17
window, altar table, and decorations.20 Documents for San Lorenzo also provide some

information on chapel costs. Here the nave was build to include side chapels; between 1463 and

1465, patrons paid 125 florins (5.5 man-years) each to the masons responsible for building the

church. This figure probably includes at least some of the cost of the side aisles, and perhaps of

the central nave as well.

7. Construction decisions. Only the Vatican could grant approval for construction of all chapels,

and thus for the creation or transformation of local churches. This meant that all major proposals

needed powerful political and religious backers, and generous payments to numerous members

of the ecclesiastical hierarchy were common. Approval, however, did not translate into financial

support or a tax. In a typical arrangement, a religious order was offered a piece of publicly

owned or private land, together with some funds for construction. Over a long period, the

religious raised additional monies to build. The difficulty of this enterprise helps explain why the

construction of major churches often took a century or longer.21

       The role of the Vatican should not be overstated; the Roman Catholic Church was less

centralized in the Medieval and Renaissance periods than after the Council of Trent in the 1560s.

Even after that date, the Vatican had a more modest role than today in directing local churches.

In the period under study, local churches were run by priors or abbots, named (or at least

approved) by the local bishops. Priors made most decisions regarding day-to-day operations of

the church, but major decisions were subject to approval by Rome.22 The decision to construct,

expand, or renovate a church could be made in many ways, and for a wide variety of reasons.

Surviving evidence indicates a very fluid situation that was not regulated by any single procedure

or governing body. Proposals could be advanced from a city government, ruling family, wealthy

merchant, or religious order.




                                                                                                   18
       In late Medieval and Renaissance Italy, the management of construction projects,

including new churches, was usually directed by the opera, the “board of works” or “building

committee.”23 The operai, or committee members, were responsible for all major decisions

concerning the new structure: they raised and distributed funds, selected the architect, approved

plans and subsequent alterations, authorized contracts, hired laborers, and purchased materials.

They could determine costs and prices of chapels, though sales had to be approved by

ecclesiastical officials. Though members of religious orders might serve on a building

committee, this institution was dominated by laymen, usually wealthy, respected figures from the

local community. Within the city of Florence, most of the powerful church officials, influential

building committee members, and principal donors to churches belonged to only a few clans.

This was particularly true of monastic churches, since each prominent family would often

support and send a family member to a particular religious order. When negotiations were

conducted by churchmen and committee members who belonged to the same or allied families,

interests often coincided nicely.



V. Funding Church Construction

       There were three potential sources for the funding of Florentine churches: the

government; the Church, i.e., the Vatican and religious orders; and individual donors. We now

consider what each group contributed for what and when.

1. Government Funding. In the 1400s, the construction of most Florentine churches was

supported by private donations, usually in exchange for chapels, and not by contributions from

the government, Vatican, or religious orders. As a result, government funding does not play a

significant role in our model of how the Renaissance Church transformed private funds into




                                                                                                   19
public goods. As we shall see, however, government grants seem to have served as “seed

money” for the construction of several Medieval churches, which then turned to the private

sector for additional support. Before 1400, substantial government funds had been given to the

three most prominent new churches in Florence -- the Cathedral, Santa Maria Novella, and Santa

Croce -- and the commune had plans to finance the church of Santo Spirito.24 Santa Maria

Novella and Santa Croce, both built in the late 1200s for new mendicant orders, were the first

churches in Florence to contain significant numbers of private chapels.25 According to Giurescu

(1997), the contributions given by the commune of Florence, together with some unrestricted

private donations, covered the basic construction costs of both churches. Despite such support,

both churches relied heavily on funds raised through the sale of chapels and their

accompaniments.

2. Vatican and Religious Orders. The main financial support from the popes and cardinals for

church construction and renovation provided for the basilicas under the direct control of the

Vatican and the titular churches of individual cardinals. In the 1200s and early 1300s, the

Vatican played a major role in encouraging the new mendicant orders, and contributed to the

building and decoration of their churches. In later periods, however, the Vatican and the religious

orders usually viewed local churches as sources of income, not as recipients for their largesse.

Tithes, for example, were collected at the local level, but they were not given to local churches.

Most of these funds remained with the local ecclesiastical officials, who would give a percentage

to the Vatican, and to the individuals or organizations that actually collected the tithes, such as

the Medici bank.

3. Private Donations and Indulgences. Beginning in the mid-1200s, a series of Vatican

regulations provided crucial support for local churches. These bulls allowed for the burial of




                                                                                                      20
laymen within the walls of the churches and for the sale of indulgences. With the invention of

Purgatory in the late medieval period, Christians learned that the souls of most people would

reach heaven only after spending an extended period in this transitional area. Priests could

absolve the guilt of sinners, but they still had to repay their debt to God by suffering punishment.

According to the theory of indulgences, the period of punishment could be reduced by various

types of good deeds, including donations. In the late 1400s, for example, Cardinal Albert of

Brandenburg calculated that the indulgences he had obtained for himself could reduce his stay in

Purgatory by 39,245,120 years.

       The fundraising opportunities offered by the sale of indulgences attracted many church

officials. One possibility was to sell written indulgences to those who visited the church. In

Florence, it was more popular to offer indulgences at no cost to visitors on certain days,

guaranteeing high attendance. For example, a papal bull of 1344 informed the faithful that they

could reduce their stay in Purgatory by 515 days by attending mass on Thomas’ feast day at

Santa Maria Novella (Giurescu 1997, 207). The indulgences given for attending masses in

specific chapels naturally raised the prestige of those spaces; this encouraged contributions by

private individuals to purchase and decorate such chapels.

       The most direct way to gain indulgences was to donate cash or property. In 1476, Pope

Sixtus IV sold indulgences that benefited the souls of the dead to raise funds for the

reconstruction of St. Peter’s in Rome. The mendicant friars, who took vows of personal poverty,

were well suited to warn moneylenders and traders about the punishments awaiting those with

ill-gotten riches, and to encourage them to make substantial donations. A series of bulls from the

1200s gave the Dominican and Franciscan friars in Florence the authority to accept funds in

exchange for reducing the punishment for usury (Giurescu 1997, 2-3). This practice, however,




                                                                                                   21
was not always accepted. Saint Antoninus, the Archbishop of Florence in the mid-1400s,

objected to this type of barter for salvation. (Even today, the question of what constitutes an

acceptable quid pro quo for donations is often an issue with nonprofits, and Antoninus’ concerns

fall in this category.26)

        The desire to reduce one’s time in Purgatory surely encouraged some of the generous

unrestricted grants left to Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce. Giurescu states that these funds,

combined with the substantial contributions from the commune of Florence, paid for the

construction of the main body of both Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce (figures 1-5). This

includes the nave and transept, the latter with rows of chapels. Regulations about indulgences

and burial encouraged private donations to churches across Europe. In his study of nearly 3,400

wills drawn up between 1276 to 1425 in six central Italian cities, Cohn (1992) documented a

major change in the years following the plague of 1362-1363 (and not immediately after Black

Death in 1348, as generally expected). In the earlier period, he found a large number of small,

unrestricted grants to churches or other institutions, such as hospitals. Testators rarely asked the

institutions for anything in return. In the later period, Cohn found a smaller number of far larger

gifts, and these grants were usually restricted. As part of the growing “cult of remembrance,”

testators arranged their bequests to obtain burial rights, private chapels, and commemorative

masses.



VI. The Supply Side: Benefits to Churches from the Sale of Chapels and from Tie-In Sales

1. Sale of Chapels. Our principal argument is that churches were eager to sell private chapels as

part of their fundraising strategy. Such sales produced significant additional benefits because

donors also had to pay for other goods and services, such as chapel decoration and masses. The




                                                                                                   22
churches also received the benefit of more magnificent structures, both in scale and in

decoration. Basically, what the churches received far exceeded any costs of provision. Though

magnificent churches provided benefits to the neighborhoods and the worshippers, the biggest

beneficiaries from the chapel sales were the priests and members of religious orders associated

with the individual churches. They were able to work in beautiful surroundings, participate in a

vibrant and growing institution, and secure employment.27 We begin our discussion of supply by

considering chapel sales at three major churches.

a. Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce. By the 1330s, the friars at both Santa Maria Novella

and Santa Croce had sold the patronage rights to most of the original transept chapels. In

exchange for the purchase of a chapel, and the commitment to outfit and decorate it, a donor

received the chapel together with a stipulated number of perpetual masses in the chapel and the

right to burial there. This exchange established a pattern for raising funds that was imitated in

virtually all Florentine churches for the rest of our period and beyond. The history and reasons

behind the friars’ dramatic and influential decision to sell chapels are rarely discussed, and few

documents clarify these crucial points. According to Giurescu, the mendicant orders sought

funds from the wealthy merchants of Florence only after the completion of the transept and nave

of Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce. But one previous document suggests a very different

scenario.

       In his testament of 1292, the banker Donato Peruzzi left 200 lire (9.3 man-years) for a

chapel to be built in the nearby church of Santa Croce, if plans for enlarging the church were

completed within ten years of his death (Borsook and Tintori 1965, 95, Appendix I, A).28 Donato

was still alive in 1299, so he witnessed the beginning of the construction of new transept at Santa

Croce in 1294. The friars gave the Peruzzi family a chapel in the south transept at an unknown




                                                                                                     23
date, but presumably before Giotto painted his celebrated frescoes there (figure 5; about 1311-

16). Donato Peruzzi surely discussed his plans with the Franciscan friars before he drew up his

will, and he clearly believed that it was possible to purchase a chapel in the church soon to be

built. The friars probably intended to assign him one of the chapels on either side of the high

altar, given that the chapels at the end of the transept were a later addition. Nevertheless,

Peruzzi’s plans to leave funds do not mean that he financed construction -- laborers had to be

paid in cash daily. The transept was built primarily with public funds; only after the friars

received the bequest did they cede one of the chapels to the Peruzzi.

       The Franciscan friars may have always intended for one or more chapels in the transept

to be sold to donors. This could even help explain why they built ten chapels in the transept,

whereas the earlier church of Santa Maria Novella has only four (figures 1, 3). This hypothesis

suggests that the government grants served as “seed money” that allowed the Franciscans to

build their church, and thus obtain further funds from the private sector. Donato Peruzzi’s will

leaves open the possibility that at least some of the Santa Croce chapels were built on

speculation. There is no doubt that the patronage rights for most of the transept chapels were sold

after their construction. In 1334, Riccardo de’ Bardi paid 200 florins (11 man-years) for his

chapel in Santa Maria Novella. The price to obtain the rights to the high chapel was considerably

higher. In his will of 1348, Albertaccio di Lapo degli Alberti left 2000 florins (67 man-years) for

the endowment and decoration of the main chapel in Santa Croce, plus another 500 florins (17

man-years) for the materials and construction of his tomb.

       Individual donations played an even more important role in the construction of the end

chapels in the transepts of both churches. This type of chapel was defined by Marvin

Trachtenberg as exceptional for its size, often double that of “standard” transept chapels; its




                                                                                                   24
location at the end of the transepts; and its elevation, atop a flight of stairs (Trachtenberg 1996;

figures 1, 3). The construction history and unusual shape of these chapels indicate that they were

built as additions to the transept, and were not part of the original plans for the churches.

According to a new and convincing hypothesis by Giurescu, wealthy private individuals left

substantial funds to build these new spaces only after the standard chapels were completed.

Donors thus commissioned the exceptional chapels, supplied construction costs, and altered the

shape of the churches. The chapel at the end of the north transept in Santa Croce, for example,

was built only after Michele Castellani, in his will of 1383, left 1,000 florins (24.4 years) for the

construction costs.

b. Santo Spirito. The sale of private chapels also played a principal role in supplying the

construction costs for Santo Spirito (Luchinat and Capretti 1996; figures 6-7). In 1433, the

Augustian friars decided to rebuild their church. The new church, designed by Brunelleschi, was

built between 1477 and 1491. According to the analyses of Goldthwaite, the construction was

“largely financed by the sale of its many chapels” (Goldthwaite 1980, 100). If the donations

given for the thirty-nine chapels contributed three-quarters of the total cost (83,172 lire), the

average price would be about 1,600 lire (10.7 man-years), or about 262.3 florins. Here we can be

relatively certain that the chapel price far exceeded the cost of building it. Each chapel consists

of two steps and a shallow niche framed in local limestone; the flanking columns outside the

chapels can be considered part of the side aisle. The additional cost of each chapel, in

comparison to building a straight wall, would hardly add up to even 50 florins, the cost of

piercing the wall and adding a chapel to the church of Cestello, implying at least an 80 percent

profit on selling cost.29




                                                                                                       25
       The prices of the chapels at Santo Spirito, and at most other churches, were set by

members of the opera. In theory, the Church would want the opera to maximize income derived

from the sale of chapels. Since all chapels are the exact same size and shape, it should charge the

highest prices for those in the best spots, close to the high altar. In fact, the very opposite took

place on several occasions (Burke 1999). Each member of the opera obtained a chapel, creating

the potential for self-dealing. At least some paid highly discounted rates, e.g., only 50 to 100

florins (2.2 - 4.4 man-years) for chapels in the transept; other donors, who were not members of

the opera, had to pay higher fees, e.g., 150 florins, for less prestigious chapels in the nave. In the

1480s and 1490s, the price for at least six transept chapels was 300 florins (17.3 man-years).30

But one of the most desirable chapels, behind the high altar, was given at no cost to Luca Pitti, a

member of the opera. The friars intervened directly in the decision-making process in order to

reward the local banker, of whom they said, “with his wisdom he has increased the income of the

said opera.” Pitti evidently received a chapel after he had made a large donation to the building

committee. As with many nonprofits today, major donors were given valuable gifts in

recognition of previous donations, and in hope of future ones. This important example shows that

even with extensive documentation, recorded evidence about what churches received for chapels

is likely to understate their long-term receipts.

2. Tie-In Arrangements with the Sale of Chapels. Donors were expected to outfit and adorn their

chapels at their own expense. Though the church did not profit directly from these activities, it

received honorably decorated spaces at no cost. Donors also purchased additional services from

the church, sometimes at a later date. The most important such services were paid private

masses, and funerals and burials.




                                                                                                       26
a. Outfitting chapels. Each chapel needed an altar table and crucifix, as well as the objects used

during the mass, including missals, candlesticks, chalices, bells, ewers, cloths, censers, and

priestly vestments (Gardner 1994). In prestigious chapels these objects were made of precious

metals, and were often more expensive than the paintings and sculptures. For his chapel in Santa

Maria Novella, for example, Filippo Strozzi spent 135 florins (6.1 man-years) between 1488-90

on priestly vestments alone. For the altar table, tomb, and marble relief sculpture of the Madonna

and Child, Filippo and his heirs paid 437 florins (25 man-years) to the sculptor Benedetto da

Maiano.

b. Decorations. Many chapels had altarpieces (usually painted), elaborate frames, frescoes, or

stained glass windows, and more prominent chapels often had several of these decorations

(figures 2, 5, 7). These objects, together with the tombs in chapels, comprise the vast majority of

the Renaissance church art that we admire today. These decorations were not required for the

celebration of the mass, though altarpieces did fulfill the obligation that an image or inscription

must identify the person, object, or mystery to which the altar was dedicated. During our period,

the average cost for an altarpiece by a respected artist was about 100 florins, but some works

naturally cost much more. For the fresco decorations in the Strozzi chapel, Filippino was paid

350 florins (19.3 man-years). Cohn’s analysis of wills made by Tuscans of widely different

social classes, from humble shopkeepers to wealthy bankers, showed that the average sum left

for sacred art was about 27 florins, about 10 percent of the average sum left for obtaining a

chapel (Cohn 1992, 245).

c. Paid Private Masses. Like many nonprofits in the modern era, the Renaissance church offered

services for a fee: paid private masses. Donors invariably left funds for masses to be held in their

chapels; for the churches, these represented a form of tie-in sale. These masses usually consisted




                                                                                                  27
of post mortem commemorations, and masses in honor of the patron saint(s) of the chapel and of

the donor. These commemorations often included a meal, which could range from a simple

repast for the celebrant to banquets for a large number of priests, friars, and other invited guests.

The study of one community of friars shows that during eight months of 1528, the friars ate

commemorative meals on more than one day in three (36.6 percent of days). This type of

privately sponsored remembrance led to Luther’s charge that the clergy “ate” off the dead

(Strocchia 1992). Payments for masses provided much of the income for most priests, and one

modern scholar even observed that late medieval churches had become “veritable mass factories”

(Oakley 1979, 118).

       For a set fee, donors could pay for a number of masses to be said soon after a funeral.

Among the most popular funeral formulas was the Gregorian mass series, which consisted of one

mass daily for thirty days after death. In 1490, this option cost about 1 florin (14.3 man-days).

Wealthy donors, however, often requested many more masses: in 1411, the testament by the

widow of Andrea Cavalcanti left provisions for one thousand masses, to be held within the first

two months after her death, in a chapel in Santa Maria Novella. Across Florence, churches

performed thousands of funerary masses each year.

       Donors could also set up anniversary masses; these were usually officiated on the date of

the donor’s death, and on the feast day of the saint to whom the chapel was dedicated. To

guarantee these complex and continuing services, testators placed restrictions on their gifts, often

including inspection by heirs, with the threat of substituting alternative charities if wishes were

not met.31 In the 1400s, the average bequest for masses was 15 florins per year. Usually donors

gave or shared the ownership of a farm or shop with the church; these properties were rented out

to third parties, which provided income to pay for the masses. A new development in late 1400s




                                                                                                      28
was short-term anniversary masses, to be performed 5, 10, or 25 years after death. These less

frequent and cheaper services allowed shopkeepers and small tradesman to provide for their own

spiritual well-being and remembrance. At the other end of the economic scale, some very

wealthy donors created “chaplaincies,” endowed positions designed to guarantee the singing of

mass for the souls of specified persons (Colvin 1991, 152-89).32 A substantial endowment was

required to support these chaplains; in 1433, for example, Luca di Marco left 1,000 florins (35

man-years) for the construction of his chapel in the church of San Lorenzo and the support of an

associated chaplaincy. To ensure that masses were carried out, donors often left only a small sum

as a base salary (“prebend”) for the chaplain, and a much higher amount for the performance of

liturgical duties. By offering a range of options, from short-term anniversary masses to

chaplaincies, price discrimination was introduced into the sale of remembrances.33

d. Burials and funerals. Funerals and burials brought considerable sums to local churches.

Wealthy patrons regularly spent far more on funerals than on the altarpieces and frescoes that so

captivate modern visitors to churches and museums. In the 1400s, the cost of prominent funerals

ranged from 300 to 700 florins (8.1 - 19.6 years), excluding the price of tombs or

commemorative masses, but a few exceptional funerals cost far more -- up to one hundred man-

years.34

   Most of this money was spent on candle wax, funeral clothes, and processions; payment for

them did not go to the local churches. The friars and priests were paid directly to participate in

the funerary procession, and they also received the appropriate clothes; this fabric could be

reused or sold. At major funerals, the large wax candles were often lit for only a brief period,

then donated to the church where the event took place. This constituted a significant tie-in

benefit for the church, given the remarkable amount of expensive wax purchased for funerals.




                                                                                                     29
The standard amounts were 10-20 pounds for artisans, and 50-60 pounds for physicians and

notaries, but wealthy citizens might purchase ten times this amount. At the small church of San

Pier Maggiore, burial revenues from cloth, wax, and clerical fees account for 22 percent of the

total income in the plague year of 1374, and a respectable 10 percent in a sampling of years with

more normal mortality rates between 1374 and 1413 (Strocchia 1992, 91).

3. Private Chapels and Employment. If the Renaissance churches became mass and funeral

“factories,” they needed increasing numbers of workers to maintain their production. Many

churches brought in outside priests on a contract basis to perform post mortem commemorations.

This practice became so widespread that an official decree in 1517 condemned clergy who

neglected duties at their own churches in order to celebrate masses at other institutions for pay.

Over time, however, the demand for privately sponsored masses and prayers called for an ever-

expanding number of priests and friars, allowing the religious orders to dramatically increase

their numbers. This in turn led to the need for new or enlarged living quarters, and the

construction of these convents and monasteries was often supported by private donations. The

dramatic growth in the size of the religious orders, and in the number of priests and religious,

created many new opportunities for promotion -- new churches needed priors, and religious

orders needed to fill their hierarchies.



VII. The Demand Side: Benefits to Donors from the Purchase of Chapels

The incentives for churches to sell private chapels are clear. They needed vast funds for the

construction, embellishment, and staffing of ecclesiastical structures, and they reaped a

handsome profit and a continuing source of revenue from tie-in sales. But why should donors

pay significantly above cost, or even just pay significantly, to purchase chapels that were so




                                                                                                     30
rarely used by them and their families? Good will and altruism would not be sufficient

motivation, but the purchase of private chapels offered many benefits not available anywhere

else. We analyze the two primary benefits: the hope of a speedy passage through Purgatory

would help the donors in the afterlife; and the status one reaped from being known as a generous

donor to the church provided both immediate benefits and posthumous fame.35

1. Afterlife. Funerary masses and burial within private chapels offered the possibility of

alleviating the pains of Purgatory, a service that could not be purchased outside the Church.

Donors rarely discussed this point in the surviving statements about chapels. Filippo Strozzi, for

example, wrote about why he contributed funds to the renovation of three churches: “God having

conceded temporal goods to me, I want to be grateful to Him for them” (Sale 1976, 18).36 But the

owners of individual chapels, familiar with theory of indulgences, must have considered their

purchase and embellishment of these spaces to be good deeds that would count in their favor

when they died. More directly, they paid for private masses in the expectation that these would

advance the exit from Purgatory.

       Tombs located in chapels could also help donors in the afterlife. Saint Antoninus

spelled out three advantages of burials within churches: the saints honored by the church

would intercede on behalf of the deceased; the faithful, coming to church, would see the

tomb and pray for the deceased; and the dead would be assured of rest undisturbed by

demons (Gaston 1987, 131). Starting in the mid-1200s, a series of papal bulls gave

Franciscan and Dominican friars permission to bury the faithful inside their churches, an

honor previously reserved for the religious. The powerful desire for intramural burials led

patrons to buy burial plots in the pavement of churches, and in the crypts below.37




                                                                                                  31
       For Renaissance Florentines who did not have a personal or family chapel, a

prime motivation for acquiring one was to have burial ground -- but the wish to be buried

in a church does not sufficiently explain the proliferation of memorial chapels. Most

families who had chapels in the transepts of Santa Maria Novella, Santa Croce, and Santo

Spirito had at least one other chapel in a different church, and only one of these spaces

was used for burial. Moreover, an omnipotent God would know who the donors were; a

specific chapel associated with one’s name was not needed.

2. Status. Girolamo Savonarola, the prior of San Marco in the 1490s, and (in)famous

today for his bonfire of the vanities, understood that status was a major benefit of owning

a chapel. The Dominican friar complained that he could not convince wealthy men in

Florence to give 10 florins to the poor, but they would give 100 florins just to put their

coat of arms on a chapel. He accused the merchants: you do this “for your honor, not for

the honor of God.” Statements by donors themselves support Savonarola’s view. When

Giovanni Tornabuoni drew up a contract for the fresco decoration of the high chapel in

Santa Maria Novella (figure 2), he presented this commission as “exaltation of his house

and family,” as well as “an act of piety and love of God…and [for] the enhancement of

the said church and chapel.” High status within one’s local community was often

identified by Renaissance authors as a goal in and of itself. It also brought other benefits.

One could make advantageous marriage agreements for one’s self or children. Status

fostered the acquisition or retention of power in a period of constantly shifting political

alliances; the Medici, for example, were banished from Florence three times over the

period studied. Power in turn brought wealth.




                                                                                                32
       Status was predominantly a function of wealth and social ties that often could not

be demonstrated directly, particularly since religious leaders advocated humility and self-

effacement. Sumptuary laws and local traditions also significantly limited displays of

conspicuous consumption. Thus, substantial expenditures on publicly displayed

prestigious works were often the best way to signal one’s status and wealth. Many

Renaissance texts present the construction of buildings, especially religious ones, as a

virtuous activity, exemplifying the donor’s “magnificence.” When one paid for a specific

commission like a chapel, one’s identity could be prominently displayed. Patrons tried to

distinguish themselves through the placement, type, and decoration of their chapels.

       Private chapels succeeded in signaling status for two main reasons: they were

exclusive and highly visible. In major Tuscan churches, the price of a chapel was beyond

the means of all but the wealthy. According to Cohn (1992, 214), the average sum left for

a chapel between 1276 to 1425 was 208.9 florins, excluding costs of masses and

decorations; this is more than the total assets of most testators.38 The even higher cost of

decorating, outfitting, and staffing chapels strengthened the signal. Thus, if the chapel

was finely decorated with luxurious materials or with works by respected artists, it further

enhanced the donor’s status. In effect, viewers could calibrate the donor’s status by

considering the size and intricacy of works, the cost of the materials, the distinction of the

artists, and the location within the church.

       Though entry into many chapels was blocked by gates, men in the church could

easily gaze above and through the barriers at the decorated spaces. Private chapels

displayed large and colorful indications of ownership: names, coats of arms, emblems,

and banners. Savonarola himself fumed that donors had their symbols placed “on the




                                                                                                 33
back of vestments, so that when the priest stands at the altar, the arms can be seen well by

all the people.” In the early fourteenth century, one donor even obliged the friars at Santa

Maria Novella and Santa Croce to proclaim each year, before the congregation, how

generous he had been (Cohn 1992, 104-107). The Renaissance patrons who used their

chapels and decorations to signal and advance their status would have little to learn from

modern-day philanthropists.



VIII. Conclusion

Many nonprofit organizations have shown themselves to be remarkably durable. Long life for

such organizations requires solid financing. Yet such organizations are in the public benefits

business, which raises the free-rider dilemma. Many of the most successful modern nonprofits

offer donors private benefits, often status and a form of immortality, in exchange for

contributions. This mechanism helped drive Harvard University's recent $2.6 billion capital fund

drive. The University received 490 gifts of $1 million or more. Natural modesty, security

concerns, and a desire to avoid solicitations by other nonprofits might motivate many donors to

make their gifts anonymously. Those whose goal was merely to “give back to the University”

might provide money to general funds, such as the scholarship pool; as opposed to a named

specified purpose, such as a professorship or building wing, which gives lasting recognition. But

94.5% of donors chose to be identified, and 84.2% of these gifts were made to named purposes.39

Presumably Harvard's contemporary donors shared some of the status and immortality goals as

donors to churches in Renaissance Florence. They were securing a permanent link to a

prestigious and long-lived institution.




                                                                                                 34
         Starting in the late Medieval period, Florence’s churches found an essential new

instrument to to raise money, which allowed them to build and thrive: the sale of private chapels.

This “commodity” was highly valued, could not be produced by others, and brought in

considerable related benefits to the church. Since status was a donor goal, more prestigious

churches could charge far higher prices. Beyond status, donors received burial locations, a form

of immortality and, with the purchase of accompanying masses, the hope for a shorter stay in

Purgatory. The citizenry had their city beautified, their God glorified, and magnificent churches

where they could worship. Thus the major nonprofits of Renaissance Florence, its churches,

supported themselves by effecting a market transaction that exchanged private benefits for public

goods.

 For an action to be an effective signal, the prestigious group must find it less costly to take than
would others. For example, a college degree is less costly for smarter people to secure, and a
costly chapel is more likely to be purchased by someone who is rich. See Spence 1974,

 The price of buildings, chapels, and their artistic decorations were usually calculated in florins,
an internationally recognized gold-based coin, but wages and living expenses were usually given
in lire. Between 1350 and 1500, the value of the lire to the florin fell in half from 3.5:1 to 7:1
(Goldthwaite and Mandich 1994; Cipolla 1990). Different currencies were used for different
types of items. Similarly, some countries today employ dollars for major transactions, but the
local currency for day-to-day purchases.

 Man-year figures are always approximate, and we round off those above 20. Goldthwaite’s

 By way of contrast, most private chapels in Venice were owned by brotherhoods or scuole.
Though the purchasers of chapels received private property in return, they were regularly
described in Renaissance Italy as benefactors, and we refer to them as donors.

  Some modern nonprofits that have constructed named buildings upon merely receiving their
construction costs -- or worse, just a fraction of them -- have encountered financial difficulties.
Many nonprofits now push hard to get some assurance of support for maintenance, recognizing
that they may have to settle for fewer and less grand buildings.
16
  The Catasto was a financial statement that included assessments of real estate and liquid
wealth; this provided the basis for the government to levy forced loans. For practical purposes,
such loans can be compared with taxes. See Goldthwaite 1968.

 For the declared worth of many prominent Florentines, see Molho 1994. For Cosimo de’
Medici, see Kent 2000; for Niccolò Alberti, see Strocchia 1992, p. 77; for Filippo Strozzi, see
Goldthwaite 1968, pp. 60, 63.

 Construction of the cloister, or living quarter for the friars, was included in the figure for San
Pancrazio but not for Santo Spirito.
19
 This approach is much in the spirit of the contemporary university, which sells a building to
one person, then rooms within it to others. Often such rooms are not sold until years after the
building is completed.
20
  No explanation is given for the considerable differences in construction costs, which ranged
from 50 to 70 florins.
21
  Many modern nonprofits also have construction activities lasting more than a century, though
rarely for a single building.
22
 A modern analogy might be a state university system or a large private university; most
appointments and financial decisions are made by the local colleges and universities, and are
generally approved by the chancellor.
23
     On this institution, see Haines and Riccetti 1996; and Goldthwaite 1980, pp. 90-94.
24
  As discussed below, the construction funds for Santo Spirito were raised from the sale of
private chapels, but starting in 1445, the friars there and at Santa Maria del Carmine did receive
proceeds from a salt tax to help offset expenses.
25
     All information relating to the early history of these churches derives from Giurescu 1997.




                                                                                                      41

  For example, what edge, if any, should the children of large donors have in getting into
prestigious colleges?
27
  Thus, support of a church might be thought of as a “directed good.” Though providing benefits
to a general public, a directed good provides dramatically disproportionate benefits to a small
segment of the population. In the contemporary context, the provision of education is often
identified as a public good, since it produces a better citizenry. But citizen X is the
overwhelming beneficiary from his or her education, so that education is a directed good.
28
 The original Latin document refers to “libras,” which most authors render as libbre (pounds),
but in this context presumably indicates the lire coin.
29
 This comparison understates Santo Spirito’s profits, because it was planned to include side
chapels, but these were added to Cestello.
30
  Blume 1995, p. 172, note 33, records the price of 300 florins for the Biliotti, Ridolfi,
Lanfredini, and Dei chapels. In 1493 the Nerli chapel cost 300 florins, and in 1495 the Segni
chapel cost the unusually high price of 500 florins (31 man-years). See Luchs 1977, p. 159, note
5. The Luti chapel cost 300 florins, see Burke 1999.
31
  Donors to modern universities have equivalent concerns about fidelity to their wishes, and
sometimes stretch contributions over time to establish precedents and make fidelity more likely.
32
 For San Lorenzo, see Gaston 1987, pp. 112-113. For prices for chaplaincies, often combined
with those for transept chapels, see Elam 1992, pp. 157-180.
33
  In the world of academia, these arrangements might be compared to a conference, an annual
lecture, and an endowed professorship.
34
  The following examples are discussed in Strocchia 1992: 1353 (Acciaiuoli), 5,000 florins; 1377
(Alberti) 3,000 florins or 94.8 years; 1429 (Medici), 3,000 florins or 93.1 years; 1432
(Tornabuoni), 1056 florins or 36.4 years; 1491 (Strozzi) 1,222 florins or 64.7 years, for
ceremonies in Florence and Naples.
35
  Surviving evidence rarely allows us to determine the relative importance of these two benefits
for any given donor, though the type of decoration may indicate the weight given to salvation or
status.
36
 In the same letter of 1477, Filippo wrote, “God having granted us His grace, there is no harm in
our recognizing it in some way.”
37
  According to Cohn’s (1992, 143) analysis of Tuscan testaments, only 20 percent of wills made
in the period before 1363 indicate a specific burial location, but in the early 1400s, two-thirds are
specific.




                                                                                                  42

  This figure covers the period 1276 to 1425, during which the florin changed value dramatically,
and so it cannot be converted into a single man-year equivalent. These figures apply to several
cities and the surrounding countryside, so the prices of a chapel in Florence was certainly far
higher.
