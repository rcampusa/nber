                                          ABSTRACT

I review evidence of rising policy uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies, drawing heavily
on newspaper-based measures. Examples from countries around the world illustrate the role of
political and policy developments as drivers of fluctuations in economic uncertainty. I also
highlight the prominent role of trade policy as a source of uncertainty and stock market volatility
since March 2018, when U.S.-China tensions began to escalate. Lastly, I offer remarks on the
interplay between policy uncertainty and economic performance.

    I.      Rising Policy Uncertainty

         Figure 1 displays a monthly index of Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) for the United
States that I developed with Scott Baker and Nick Bloom. 1 In constructing this index, we aim to
capture uncertainty about who will make economic policy decisions, what economic policy
actions will be undertaken and when, and the economic effects of policy actions (or inaction) ­
including uncertainties related to the economic ramifications of "non-economic" policy matters,
e.g., military actions. To do so, we first count articles in 10 leading U.S. newspapers that contain
the following triple of terms: "economic" or "economy"; "uncertain" or "uncertainty"; and one
or more of "congress," "deficit," "Federal Reserve," "legislation," "regulation" or "White
House." Next, we scale the raw EPU count by the number of all articles in the same paper and
month, standardize the variability of the scaled EPU counts, and average over newspapers by
month. Finally, we normalize the mean index value to 100 from 1985 to 2009. Thus, the index
value of 284 in January 2019 is 2.84 times its 1985-2009 average.
         Our U.S. EPU index spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11
attacks, major fiscal policy battles from 2011 to 2013 and in reaction to the June 2016 Brexit
referendum, Donald Trump's surprise election victory in November 2016, and escalating trade
policy tensions in 2018 and 2019. The EPU index tends to rise in recessions, but many of the
largest spikes and highest index values occur during the long, ongoing expansion that began in
the second half of 2009. Measures of policy uncertainty derived from textual analysis of the
Federal Reserve System's periodic Beige Books and from transcripts of quarterly earnings
conference calls of publicly listed firms exhibit similar time-series patterns. 2 Baker et al. (2014)
present and discuss evidence that policy-related economic uncertainty in the United States
followed an upward trajectory in the 1960s and 1970s, stabilized somewhat in the 1980s and
1990s, and rose again after the late 1990s.
         Using the same approach, we and others construct monthly newspaper-based EPU indices
for 20 additional countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, Spain,
Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 3 We rely on own-country newspapers in constructing the

national EPU indices and perform all searches in the language of the newspaper. To help develop
suitable E, P and U term sets, we consulted persons with native fluency and economics expertise
in the relevant language and country. Our P term set differs across countries for reasons both
obvious (e.g., using "BOJ" for Japan) and idiosyncratic (e.g., inclusion of "customs duties" for
India). Monthly data for all 21 national EPU indices are available and regularly updated at
www.PolicyUncertainty.com.
       To construct an index of Global Economic Policy Uncertainty, I proceed as follows in
Davis (2016): First, I re-normalize each national EPU index to a mean of 100 from 1997 (or first
year) to 2015. Second, I impute missing values for certain countries using a regression-based
method.4 This step yields a balanced panel of monthly EPU index values for 21 countries from
January 1997 to the present. Third, I compute the Global EPU index value for each month as the
GDP-weighted average of the 21 national EPU index values, using GDP data from the IMF's
World Economic Outlook Database. Figure 2 plots the resulting index.
       The Global EPU index rises sharply in reaction to the Asian and Russian Financial
Crises, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Global Financial
Crisis in 2008-09, the European immigration crisis in 2015, and several other developments.5 It
fluctuates around consistently high levels from mid 2011 to early 2013, a period characterized by
recurring sovereign debt and banking crises in the Eurozone, intense battles over fiscal and
healthcare policies in the United States, and a generational leadership transition in China. Seven
of nine members on the Standing Committee, China's most powerful decision-making body,
were slated for retirement in 2012. Other senior leadership bodies in China experienced similarly
high turnover rates due to retirement, leading Li (2011) to characterize 2012 as the fourth
"generational transfer of power" in the history of Communist China. Two previous generational

(2019) for Japan, Kroes et al. (2015) for the Netherlands, Ghirelli et al. (2019) for Spain, and
Armelius et al. (2017) for Sweden. EPU data for the other countries are updates to the indices
developed in Baker et al. (2016) and new indices that we developed using the same methods.
4 For example, I regress the EPU index for Australia from 1998 onwards on contemporaneous EPU

index values for all countries with no missing data. I then use predicted values from this regression
to impute the missing Australian values for 1997.

transitions coincided with tragedy and turmoil in the form of the Cultural Revolution and the
1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.
       Eurozone developments in the period from mid 2011 to early 2013 include a rescue
package for Portugal in May 2011, a bailout package for Greece in July 2011 (amidst widespread
speculation that Greece would leave the Eurozone), large yield increases on Spanish and Italian
government bonds in August 2011, April 2012 and June 2012, a May 2012 election in which
most Greek voters rejected a proposed bailout agreement, and multiple extraordinary actions by
the European Central Bank in response to these and other developments. Across the Atlantic,
bitterly partisan disputes over the direction of U.S. fiscal policy led to a "debt-ceiling" fight in
summer 2011 that threatened to curtail critical government functions and delay payments on U.S.
Treasury securities, and an extraordinary "fiscal cliff" episode with last-minute resolutions of
major uncertainties about tax and spending policies. Uncertainties surrounding U.S. healthcare
policy were also extraordinarily high in this period. For example, an appellate court struck down
the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare") in August 2011, concluding that Congress lacked the
constitutional authority to require individuals to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty, and
threatening the viability of the entire Act.6 The issue remained unsettled until June 2012, when
the Supreme Court reversed the appellate court in a surprise, closely divided decision. 7
       Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its military incursions in eastern Ukraine led
to international sanctions and an uncertain environment that curtailed foreign investment in
Russia and contributed to its weak economic performance (European Parliament, 2016). The
Russia-Ukraine conflict and its unsettled nature harmed the Ukrainian economy as well and
deterred foreign investment there (Morelli, 2016). China's aggressive pursuit of sovereignty
claims in the South China Sea has raised concerns about threats to ship-borne trade in some of
the world's busiest international waters.8 Recent geopolitical tensions in the Persian Gulf, U.S.-
led economic sanctions on Iran, and the Iranian seizure of oil tankers in the Straits of Hormuz
have renewed concerns about petroleum supplies.9

       Syria has been the epicenter of a many-sided military conflict and humanitarian
catastrophe since 2011, with devastating consequences and highly uncertain long-term
implications. The catastrophe produced a flood of migrants into neighboring countries and
Europe in 2014 and 2015, stoking security fears, creating anxiety about social and economic
consequences, and placing enormous strains on the Schengen zone arrangements for free
mobility in a border-less Europe.10
       Several major political and policy developments have rocked national economies and the
global economic outlook since 2016. Leading examples include the June 2016 Brexit
referendum, Donald Trump's surprise election victory in November 2016, and the strength of
populist political movements in several European countries. These developments have injected
new sources of political and economic uncertainties into the global economy.
       There are many other recent examples of economic uncertainty emanating from political
developments. In South Korea, political scandal led to the impeachment of President Park Geun-
hye in December 2016 and her removal from office in March 2017. In Brazil, a long and severe
recession, an extraordinary wave of corruption investigations, the criminal convictions of many
leading political figures, and the impeachment and removal of President Dilma Rouseff in 2016
combined to upend the political landscape. Brazil's next president, Michel Temer, promised to
restore growth by reversing several major policies of his predecessor. 11 In Argentina, new fears
that the Peronist party would regain political power in upcoming elections triggered a spectacular
15 percent depreciation of the Argentine Peso on 12 August 2019 and a 38 percent plunge in the
stock market the same day.12
       In Turkey, after squashing an attempted coup d'état in July 2016, the government set
about arresting and firing more than a hundred thousand teachers, military officers, judges,

mayors, civil servants, and others. 13 Ten weeks after the failed coup, Moody's Investor Service
downgraded Turkey's sovereign credit rating ­ citing external funding risks, slowing growth and
"further concerns regarding the predictability and effectiveness of government policy and the
rule of law."14 The coup attempt and its aftermath have also strained international relations
between Turkey and several of its allies. 15 Intense pressures on the foreign exchange value of the
Turkish Lira have prompted dramatic policy moves by the Turkish Central Bank since 2018 and
the dismissal of the Bank's Governor in July 2019. 16


     II.      The New Prominence of Trade Policy Uncertainty

           Trade policy has become both more uncertain and more protectionist under the Trump
presidency. Particulars include the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
Agreement in January 2017, President Trump's early threats to jettison the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), doubts about U.S. congressional ratification of a NAFTA-
replacement treaty, and a large number of tariff hikes, tariff threats and tariff reversals. The
average U.S. tariff rate rose from less than 2% in December 2017 to 4% in May 2019. It is slated
to reach an estimated 5-8% by the end of 2019. 17 Threats of additional tariff hikes would, if fully
implemented, bring the average U.S. tariff rate to an estimated 9-11% by the end of 2019. 18 The
trade-weighted average U.S. tariff on Chinese imports rose from 3.1% in 2017 to 12.4% in 2018

18 These figures are also estimates reported in "Costly Tariff Spat Masks Deeper Trade Problems"

and "The Daily Shot: How High Will the Average U.S. Tariff Rate Get?" They do not incorporate
President Trump's announcement on 23 August 2019 of additional tarif f hikes on Chinese imports.


                                                                                                    5
and 18.3% in May 2019. Current U.S. plans will take the average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese
imports to an estimated 21.4% in December 2019 (Brown and Zhang, 2019).
       U.S. tariff hikes and President Trump's rhetorical attacks on trading partners invite
retaliation. Indeed, tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the United States and China have been
underway since April 2018. Canada, India, Mexico, Turkey and the European Union have also
imposed new tariffs on American imports in reaction to U.S. tariff hikes. In short, the shift to
greater protectionism in U.S. trade policy has prompted other countries to respond in kind.
       Trump Administration officials often asserts that its aggressive trade policy stance will
yield new trade deals that are more favorable to the United States. Developments to date offer
scant support for this assertion. The U.S. and South Korea renegotiated and signed a revised
Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in September 2018, but the new agreement involves "only
limited changes to the original pact" (Schott and Jung 2018). On 30 November 2018, Canadian
Prime Minister Trudeau, Mexican President Nieto and President Trump signed the U.S.-Mexico-
Canada Agreement to replace NAFTA. As of August 2019, however, its ratification by the U.S.
Congress looks unlikely.19 The tone of recent statements from the U.S. and Chinese sides suggest
dim prospects in the next few months for a significant resolution of outstanding trade policy
conflicts and a reversal of recent tariff hikes. Nor is there any sign that the United States will
soon resolve its trade policy conflicts with India, Turkey or the European Union.
       Trade policy under the Trump administration also has a capricious, back-and-forth
character that amplifies uncertainty and undermines a rules-based trading order. Less than three
months after withdrawing from the TPP, President Trump said he would consider rejoining for a
substantially better deal, only to throw cold water on the idea a few days later. 20 Robert
Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative justified steel tariffs on the laughable grounds that
Canada, for example, presents a national security threat. 21 But President Trump tweeted that



19 As of 17 August 2019, PredictIt assesses a 30% probability that " both houses of the U.S. Congress
shall ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, by passing a bill to implement such
agreement" by the end of 2019. See, also, "Trump's North America Trade Deal at Risk of Stalling in
Congress," Washington Post, 29 March 2019; and "Hopes Dim for Passage of Trump Trade Deal,"
The Hill, 5 July 2019.

Mail, 26 July 2018.


                                                                                                     6
tariffs on Canadian steel were really a response to Canadian tariffs on U.S. dairy products. 22 In
August 2018, the President tweeted that he "just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and
Aluminum with respect to Turkey" for reasons unclear.23
       Under President Trump, tariffs are threatened, announced, delayed, reversed, announced
again, imposed, and removed ­ often in quick succession. Some countries get tariff exemptions,
some don't. Exemptions vary in duration, and they come and go in a head-spinning manner. The
recent treatment of steel imports exemplifies this aspect of U.S. trade policy under President
Trump. See Brown and Kolb (2019) for a detailed account.
       Another example involves the latest round of announcements about new tariffs on
Chinese imports, which Brown (2019) summarizes this way: "On Aug. 1, President
Trump abruptly announced on Twitter that he would impose on Sept. 1 a 10% levy on roughly
$300 billion in Chinese goods, an apparent response to what he described as China's failure to
commit to promised U.S. agricultural purchases." Less than two weeks later, the plan was
revised to "impose 10 percent tariffs on $112 billion of Chinese imports starting on September 1
... followed by a second round of duties on a different set of products, covering $160 billion of
imports, on December 15." China retaliated on 23 August, announcing plans to levy new tariffs
of 5 to 10% on $75 billion of U.S. imports. President Trump responded later the same day,
announcing that he would raise existing and planned tariffs on $550 billon of Chinese imports by
an additional 5 percentage points.24
       Trump Administration trade policy also gives greater discretion over tariffs to
bureaucrats, creating added complexity and uncertainty for individual businesses and compelling
them, as a matter of business necessity, to become enmeshed in the tariff-exemption process. For
example, the Department of Commerce rolled out a slow-working, burdensome process for
requesting company-specific exemptions from steel and aluminum tariffs, as neatly recounted in
the Wall Street Journal:25

Examiner, 12 June 2018.

      [C]ompanies must submit a request attesting that their imports aren't made in the U.S.
      in "a satisfactory quality" or "sufficient and reasonably available amount." Companies
      must state the uses for their steel product, their average annual consumption of the
      product, as well as the number of days required to take delivery, manufacture and ship
      the product. They must also estimate the maximum and minimum composition of 24
      chemical elements in their products including molybdenum, antimony and vanadium.
      There are dozens of other queries, but we'll spare you.

      Oh, and a separate request is required for each width, length, grade shape, and form of
      steel or aluminum product. A single company, Primrose Alloys, has submitted more
      than 1,200 steel product requests, according to Commerce's database. All 14 that have
      been reviewed so far were denied.

      Businesses may also submit statements to support their requests, which naturally turn
      political...

       These various developments have led to a tremendous upsurge in anxiety and uncertainty
about trade policy and its economic fallout. To attach some numbers to this point, Figure 3
displays a newspaper-based index of Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) for the United States. The
TPU index reflects the frequency of articles in U.S. newspapers that discuss economic policy
uncertainty and trade policy matters.
       Two periods stand out. The first runs from August 1992 to March 1995 and reflects
uncertainties around the negotiation, ratification and implementation of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The second commences with Donald Trump's election victory in
November 2016. The TPU index rose above 300 in reaction to the election outcome, the U.S.
withdrawal from the TPP Agreement in January 2017, and U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum
imports in March 2018. It rose even higher later in 2018 and in 2019, as U.S.-China trade policy
conflicts intensified. The TPU index value averages 301 from March 2018 to July 2019 ­ 7.7
times its average from 2013 to 2015 and 5.3 times its average from 1996 to 2015.
       Table 1 presents evidence on the new prominence of trade policy uncertainty in China
and Japan as well as the United States. Like Figure 3, Table 1 relies on frequency counts of own-
country newspaper articles about trade policy uncertainty, but the scaling is different. In Figure
3, the raw TPU counts are scaled by the count of all articles in the same newspapers and
normalized to 100 from 1985 to 2009. In contrast, Table 1 reports the percentage of EPU articles
that discuss trade policy matters. All three countries show a dramatic rise in this percentage since
November 2016, even more so since March 2018. Consider, for example, a comparison of the
2000-2015 period to the period from March to December in 2018: The trade policy share of EPU


                                                                                                     8
articles rose from 2 to 15% in the United States, from 7 to 27% in Japan, and from 20 to 48% in
China. These comparisons support two conclusions: first, the rise in trade policy uncertainty
under the Trump presidency has reverberated globally; second, the level of anxiety about trade
policy is higher for major U.S. trading partners.
       Trade policy concerns have also become a major source of stock market gyrations since
2018. For example, the S&P 500 index fell more than 2.5 percent on 22 March 2018, reacting to
news about new U.S. tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports. Four days later, the
index rose more than 2.7 percent on news the U.S. and China had begun trade negotiations.
Nevertheless, tariffs and tariff threats between the two countries have ratcheted upwards in the
ensuing fifteen months.
       In Baker, Bloom, Davis and Sammon (2019), my coauthors and I examine the role of
trade policy developments and fifteen other news categories in large daily stock market moves.
We first identified every daily move of more than 2.5 percent, up or down, in the U.S. stock
market. By this criterion, there were 1,114 large daily moves from January 1900 to July 2019.
For each large move, we read next-day news articles in the Wall Street Journal to classify
perceptions of what moves the market.
       Table 2 summarizes our evidence regarding the role of trade policy as a trigger for large
daily moves in the U.S. stock market. The Journal attributed 7 of 1,103 large moves from 1900
to February 2018 mainly to news about trade policy, as compared to 4 of 11 large moves from
March 2018 to July 2019. 26 By this metric, the prominent role of trade policy in recent U.S. stock
market swings is historically unprecedented. In a complementary analysis, Huang et al. (2018)
examine firm-level equity returns from March 21 to March 23. They find larger negative returns
for U.S.-listed firms with greater exposure to trade with China over this period and larger
negative returns for Chinese-listed firms with greater sales to the United States.
       In Baker, Bloom, Davis and Kost (2019), my coauthors and I take a different approach to
the analysis of newspaper content. We first use automated methods to identify articles about
stock market volatility in 11 leading U.S. newspapers and to construct an Equity Market
Volatility (EMV) tracker. Our newspaper-based EMV tracker performs well in the sense that it
moves closely with actual stock market volatility. Parsing the text in the EMV articles, we then


26The four dates and the corresponding value-weighted returns on the S&P 500 are 22 March 2018,
-2.52%; 26 March 2018, 2.72%; 4 December 2018, -3.24%; and 4 January 2019, 3.43%


                                                                                                   9
quantify journalist perceptions of what drives volatility in equity returns and classify the drivers
into about thirty categories, many of which pertain to particular types of policy. This approach
lets us assess the importance of each category to the average level of stock market volatility and
its movements over time.
            As seen in Figure 4, trade policy gets attention in 26% of articles about equity market
volatility in leading U.S. newspapers from March to December 2018. In glaring contrast, trade
policy matters receive attention in a mere 2.7% of articles about equity market volatility from
1985-2015.27 In other words, trade policy went from a virtual non-factor in U.S. equity market
volatility in recent decades to one of its leading sources in 2018.


     III.      The Interplay between Policy Uncertainty and Economic Performance

            Politics and policy decision-making are often messy and fraught with uncertainty about
political outcomes, policy decisions, near-term consequences, and long-term implications.
Sections I and II offer a variety of examples, many of them recent, drawn from countries around
the world. They include the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis in August 2011, the U.S. fiscal cliff and
government shutdown episodes in 2012 and 2013, the Syrian catastrophe, multiple Eurozone
crises since 2010, Russian military incursions in Ukraine, the European immigration crisis, the
ongoing Brexit saga, a coup attempt and crackdown in Turkey, the removal of South Korea's
president, corruption scandals and presidential removal in Brazil, a sharp escalation of U.S.-
China trade policy conflicts in 2018 and 2019, and more. These examples illustrate the role of
governments and political processes as sources of economic uncertainty. That uncertainty weighs



27 To construct Figure 4, we first compute the ratio, (count of EMV articles that contain Trade Policy
terms)/(count of all EMV articles), in each month from January 1985 to December 2018. The "count
of all EMV articles" in the denominator is the number of article s in 11 leading U.S. newspapers that
contain at least one term in each of the following three sets: (E)conomy: {economic, economy,
financial}; Stock (M)arket: {"stock market", equity, equities, "Standard and Poors", "Standard &
Poors", "Standard and Poor", "Standard and Poor's", "Standard & Poor's"}; and (V)olatility:
{uncertain, uncertainty, volatility, volatile, risk, risky}. The numerator is the count of the subset of
EMV articles that also contains one or more terms in Trade Policy: {trade policy, tariff, import duty,
import barrier, import restriction, trade quota, dumping, export tax, export duty, trade treaty, trade
agreement, trade act, wto, world trade organization, Doha round, Uruguay round, gatt, export
restriction investment restriction, Nafta, North American Free Trade Agreement, Trans-Pacific
Partnership, TransPacific Partnership, Federal Maritime Commission, International Trade
Commission, Jones Act, trade adjustment assistance}.


                                                                                                      10
negatively on economic performance. At least in a proximate sense, causality run from political
processes and policy uncertainty to aggregate economic performance in these examples.
       Economic developments also give rise to uncertainty, directly and through their impact
on policy making. As a leading example, the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007-09 confronted
policymakers with extraordinary and complex challenges, especially in the immediate wake of
the financial panic in September 2008. There was great uncertainty about how policymakers
should and would respond, and what would be the economic consequences. In this episode, the
financial crisis and its economic fallout drove a sharp rise in policy uncertainty. In turn, high
policy uncertainty contributed to the severity of the crisis and the weakness of the ensuing
recovery.
       There is also evidence that major financial crises lead to higher levels of policy
uncertainty for many years. Funke, Schularick and Trebesch (2016) draw on data for many
countries over 140 years to document a pattern of rising political polarization in the years
following systemic financial crises, contributing to higher levels of policy uncertainty. Mian,
Sufi and Trebbi (2014) also find evidence that financial crises breed political polarization, which
sometimes results in political gridlock and policy uncertainty.
       A key point: The potential for negative shocks to drive policy uncertainty depends on the
underlying environment, which is partly shaped by past policy decisions. 28 Consider again the
GFC. It was precipitated by a collapse in U.S. housing prices and mortgage-backed security
values (Mian and Sufi, 2015). The shock was large, and many banks were highly exposed to it.
The shock led to a systemic financial crisis, because banks were poorly capitalized and heavily
dependent on flight-prone forms of debt to fund their investments. If policymakers had required
banks to rely more heavily on run-proof funding, the crisis would have been less severe ­ and
perhaps avoided altogether. In this and other respects, the pre-crisis regulatory regime set the
stage for a major financial crisis (Admati and Hellwig, 2013 and Duffie, 2019) and the ensuing
policy uncertainty.




28The effects of policy uncertainty also depend on the environment. For example, Basu and Bundick
(2017) and Nakata (2017) examine uncertainty shocks in New Keynesian models. Both papers
conclude that higher uncertainty has a larger negative effect on output when the monetary
authority's policy rate is closer to the zero bound. Caggiano et al. (2017) find empirical support for
this prediction.


                                                                                                    11
        As another example, there is less need for discretionary fiscal stimulus in response to
negative shocks when robust automatic fiscal stabilizers are in place. Automatic fiscal stabilizers
lessen the political conflicts, decision delays, implementation lags and policy uncertainty that
comes with efforts to deploy discretionary fiscal tools. Especially when monetary policy is
hampered by an effective lower bound on policy rates, inadequate or poorly designed automatic
fiscal stabilizers almost ensure that political leaders will turn to discretionary fiscal policy as a
response to the next large economic downturn.
        High policy uncertainty in the past decade has stimulated empirical research on its
economic consequences. Durnev (2012), Julio and Yook (2012, 2016), Giavazzi and McMahon
(2012) and Kelly, Pastor and Veronesi (2016), among others, investigate the effects of election-
related uncertainty on corporate investment, international capital flows, precautionary savings,
and stock price volatility. By and large, this literature finds that election-related uncertainty
reduces investment, discourages inward FDI, raises precautionary savings and increases stock
price volatility. Aaberge, Liu and Zhu (2017) find that political uncertainty associated with the
1989 Tiananmen Square Movement led to sharp savings increases by Chinese households.
Wiemann and Lumsdaine (2019) find that increases in uncertainty about U.S. healthcare policy
lowers the consumption spending of married households, more so for those with worse health.
        Handley and Limao (2015) develop evidence that lower uncertainty about trade policy
stimulates investment in export capacity. Caldara et al. (2019) find evidence that higher trade
policy uncertainty since 2017 has dampened U.S. business investment. 29 Gulen and Ion (2016)
find negative effects of policy uncertainty on corporate investment using the U.S. EPU measure
in Figure 1. Similarly, Baker et al. (2016) find larger negative effects of EPU on investment rates
and employment growth, and larger positive effects on stock price volatility, for firms with
greater exposure to policy risks. Hassan et al. (2019) use transcripts of earnings conference calls
to construct time-varying measures of firm-level policy uncertainty. They also find that higher
uncertainty discourages investment and employment. Using the EPU index for India, Anand and




29Although they cannot cleanly disentangle uncertainty effects from (negative) anticipation effects,
Altig et al. (2019) report survey evidence that trade policy developments in 2018 caused a small
drop in U.S. business investment. Similarly, Bloom et al. (2019) find survey evidence that Brexit-
related developments have caused a sizable drop in U.K. business investment over the past three
years.


                                                                                                        12
Tulin (2014) find negative effects of policy uncertainty on firm-level investment flows, with
stronger effects on new projects.
       A larger literature considers the effects of economic uncertainty in general, rather than
policy uncertainty in particular. Important early analyses of how income uncertainty affects
consumption behavior include Zeldes (1989), Kimball (1990) and Carrol (1997). Eberly (1994)
finds that high uncertainty leads households to defer costly-to-reverse purchases of durable
goods. Bloom (2009) finds that high uncertainty leads firms to cut or delay investment
expenditures. These two studies and many others stress that heightened uncertainty provides an
incentive to delay or forego investments that are costly to reverse. Uncertainty can also depress
investment by raising risk premiums, as stressed by Pastor and Veronesi (2013), Christiano et al.
(2014), Gilchrist et al. (2014), and Arellano et al. (2016). Insofar as high uncertainty depresses
investment and discourages the reallocation of capital and labor, it also slows the growth of
productivity and output. See Bloom (2014) for a fuller discussion of how uncertainty affects
economic activity.
       Another branch of the literature investigates the dynamic relationship of policy
uncertainty, or economic uncertainty more broadly, to macroeconomic performance. Examples
include Stock and Watson (2012), Colombo (2013), International Monetary Fund (2013), Jurado
et al. (2015), Ludvigson et al. (2015), Baker et al. (2016), Baker, Bloom and Terry (2016), Leduc
and Liu (2016), Arbatli et al. (2019) and Ghirelli et al. (2019). These studies typically find that
higher (policy) uncertainty foreshadows a deterioration in macroeconomic performance. Romer
(1990) marshals evidence that the 1929 stock market crash triggered a sharp rise in income
uncertainty that led households to forego purchases of consumer durables, accentuating the
collapse of aggregate demand at the onset of the U.S. Great Depression. Evidence in
Constantinescu et al. (2017) suggests that high policy uncertainty depresses international trade in
goods and services.
       In summary, a variety of studies find evidence that high (policy) uncertainty undermines
economic performance by leading firms to delay or forego investments and hiring, by slowing
productivity-enhancing factor reallocation, and by depressing consumption expenditures. This
evidence points to a positive payoff in the form of stronger macroeconomic performance if
policymakers can deliver greater predictability in the policy environment. A smaller literature
finds that greater uncertainty causes households and firms to become less responsive on the



                                                                                                      13
margin to cuts in interest rates and taxes, in line with predictions of real options theory. See
Bertola et al. (2005), Bloom et al. (2007), Bloom (2009), Aastveit et al. (2013) and Vavra
(2014). These studies suggest that a stronger policy framework also increases the potency of
countercyclical stabilization policies.


   IV.      Concluding Remarks

         U.S. and global policy uncertainty have been highly elevated in recent years. According
to Figure 1 and evidence in Baker et al. (2014), the past dozen years have seen the highest levels
of U.S. economic policy uncertainty in the past 60 years. According to Figure 2, Global EPU in
2017 and 2018 is running at even higher levels than during the Global Financial Crisis. The huge
rise in trade policy uncertainty since early 2018 is an extraordinary departure from recent history,
as is the prominent role of trade policy in recent stock market volatility.
         There is now a sizable body of empirical research that supports the proposition that high
policy uncertainty harms macroeconomic performance. The evidence in this literature implies
that greater predictability in the policy environment yields better macroeconomic performance. A
smaller literature suggests that standard monetary and fiscal policy tools are also more effective
in environments with greater policy predictability.

   Note: This table is a tabulation of results in Baker, Bloom, Davis and Sammon (2019), who consider all daily
   jumps in the U.S. stock market greater than 2.5%, up or down, since 1900. They classify the reason for each
   daily stock market jump into 16 categories based on human readings of next-day accounts in the Wall Street
   Journal. The table reports the total number of jumps in the indicated time periods and the number attributed
   primarily to news about trade policy, according to the human readings. The four dates from March 2018 to July
   2019 attributed to trade policy, and the corresponding value-weighted returns on the S&P 500, are 22 March
   2018, -2.52%; 26 March 2018, 2.72%; 4 December 2018, -3.24%; and 4 January 2019, 3.43%.
