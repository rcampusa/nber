     This   paper compares employment and hours adjustment in Japanese and

U.S. manufacturing.       In contrast to some previous work, we find that

adjustment of total labor input to demand changes is significantly greater

in the United States than in Japan; adjustment of employment is

significantly greater in the United States, while that of average hours is

about the sane in the two countries.       Although workers in Japan enjoy

greater employment stability than do U.S. workers, we find considerable

variability in the adjustment patterns across groups within each country.

In the United States, most of the adjustment is bone by production workers.

In Japan, female workers, in particular, bear a disproportionate share of

adjustment.

I.   Introduction

     Severe macroeconomic recessions, trade pressures and industrial

restructuring have created tensions between American management, which wants

to reduce work force levels and increase productivity, and Anerican labor,

which wants greater job security.    Many in the United States have pointed to

Japan, with its success in trade, its high labor productivity, and its

relatively strong job security, as a model to follow in reforming U.S. labor

relations.

     White Japanese workers generally are perceived as having greater job

security than U.S.   workers, job security can be achieved in different ways.
Firms may simply keep excess workers on the payroll during a downturn, even

though doing so reduces their short term profits, if they believe that there

are long run advantages to such a strategy.     Such advantages might include

the retention of highly skilled workers or better labor relations.

Alternatively, a firm may provide employment security for its work force

without sacrificing short term profits if workers as a group are willing to

accept flexible hours and/or flexible compensation.     Finally, a company may

offer employment security for a core group of employees without giving up

labor cost flexibility by using subcontractors or temporary workers as a

buffer.   In this case, greater stability of employment for some translates

into less stability for others.     All three approaches have been seen as an

integral part of Japanese industrial relations.    The relative importance of

each of these strategies has clear implications for how the costs of

adjustment are distributed in society.


                                          I
     This paper focuses on the dynamics of employment and hours adjustment

in 11.5. and Japanese manufacturing industries.    Our empirical work addresses

twD sets of issues.    We look first at the overall elasticities of

employment, average hours and total hours with respect to changes in demand

in the two countries       A key question in this part of the analysis is

whether, in Japan. total labor input adjusts less than in the United States

or whether greater flexibility in hours compensates for lower employment

elasticities.

     The   second set of questions that we address concerns differences in
adjustment patterns across groups of workers within countries.     To the
extent that labor input is adjusted to changes in demand, are some groups
within each country disproportionately affected? If so, are these groups
the same in the   United   States as in Japan? And is the degree to which the
employment of particular groups responds to changes in demand similar in the
two countries?
     A number of Japanese and Aaerican researchers have studied employment
and hours adjustment in the two countries using both aggregate and industry
dataJ      While, to our knowledge, all have found slower adjustment of
overall employment levels in Japan than in the United States, there is
conflicting evidence concerning the adjustment of total hours.      The

prevailing wisdom seems to have been that, in Japan, hours worked are
sufficiently responsive to changes in output that hours adjustment largely
compensates for the lack of employment adjustment. Shinozuka and Ishthara

     1
                                        hours adjustment in the United
          Studies comparing employment and
States and Japan include Shinozuka and Ishihara (1916), Shimada, Seike, and
Hosokawa (1982), Shimada et. al. (1982-82), Sterling (1984), United States
Department of Labor (1985), tachibanaki (1981) and Hashimoto and Raisian
(1988).

                                             2
(1976), for example, find that, while the adjustment of employment is slower

in Japan. the adjustment of total labor input in the two countries is about

the same.   Shimada, et. al. (1g82-83) also suggest that employment

adjustment in Japan is slower than in the United States, but that the

adjustment of total hours in the two countries is roughly comparable.         The

basis for this claim is unclear.   Tachibanaki (1987), comparing standard

deviations of employment and hours measures for Japan, the United States,

and European countries, concludes that while Japan has the lowest adjustment

of employment, it has the greatest adjustment of average hours.     In

constrast, Hashimoto and Raisian (1988), who relate changes in labor input

to changes in output using annual data for manufacturing, find slower

adjustment of total hours in Japan.   Using a more flexible functional form

and somewhat different data to estimate labor elasticities than has been

adopted in previous work, we present evidence that both employment and total

hours adjustment is significantly greater in U.S.   manufacturing   than in

Japanese manufacturing and that adjustment of average production worker

hours is about the same in the two countries.

     In analyzing the distribution of the burden of adjustment across groups

of workers within each country, we make three comparisons.    For both the

United States and Japan, we compare adjustment patterns by broad

occupational category (production versus nonproduction workers) and by sex.

In addition, for Japan only, we look at differences in adjustment by

establishment size.2




     2
       Unfortunately, available data do not permit parallel by-
establishment-size comparisons for the United States.

                                         3
        We would expect greater adjustment of employment among workers whose
duties    are tied more directly to the level of production or who possess    less
firm-specific human capital.      The greater responsiveness of production than

of nonproduction employment in the United States is a well established fact

that has been explained on the basis of these economic factors.        Our results

indicate that production employment elasticities also exceed nonproduction

employment elasticities in Japan, but that the difference between the two

groups is much smaller than that in the United States.

        Because turnover rates are typically higher for women than for men, we

would    expect greater employment elasticities for women in both countries.
In addition, female employment may adjust more than male employment if women
as a group have weaker job rights and are more vulnerable to layoff or
contract termination than men.        In studies of the adjustment of employment
levels by sex, Shinozuka (1980) and Nakamura (1983, 1984) find greater
adjustment    of female than of male employment in Japan.    Our estimates

support    these results.    Interestingly, we also find evidence of higher

employment elasticities for women than for men in the United States,

although the differences between the two groups are much less pronounced

than those in Japan.

        Finally, it is widely believed that small Japanese enterprises function

as a buffer for larger firms.      By subcontracting work during expansions and

terminating    contracts during recessions, large firms may shift cyclical risk
onto    smaller companies.   Others argue, however, that the linkages between

large and small Japanese firms are more complex than this simple

characterization    would suggest.3    Shinozuka (1980), using aggregate data by

          See, for example, Aoki (1984).
                                             4
establishment size, does find greater adjustment of small than of large

establishment employment, but Sterling (1984) finds no correlation between

the proportion of Industry employment in small establishments and the

magnitude of industry employment adjustment.            Our results reveal only a weak

relationship between employment adjustment and establishment size.

       The remainder of the paper is organized into four sections.             Sections

II and III discuss the model and the data underlying our analysis.               Our

empirical results are presented in Section IV.            Section V summarizes the

conclusions that can be drawn from our analysis concerning the overall

dynamics      of employment and hours adjustment and the relative job security of
various groups in each country,


II.    The    Estimatin Framework
       The    objective   of the empirical work described in this paper is to

characterize the process whereby U.S. and Japanese employers adjust

employment and hours in response to short-run changes in the level of

production.       Civen our comparative focus       it is important that our

estimating      equations be sufficiently   flexible to capture any differences in

the   pattern of adjustment that might exist between the two countries.
       Much   previous work on employment   adjustment, including almost all

previous studies using Japanese data, has used the Koyck specification!'

Although the Koyck specification is appealingly parsimonious and the Koycic

parameters are amenable to precise structural interpretation, this approach

requires very strong       assumptions that are unlikely to be satisfied in

      4The one exception among studies using Japanese data that we know of is

                                                5
practice.     In particular, it assumes that adjustment costs are quadratic, so

that adjustment to a given shock declines geometrically over time, and that

the current level of labor demand is expected to persist indefinitely into

the future.     We have chosen to estimate employment elasticities using a

distributed lag model that is flexible enough to capture employment dynamics

and demand environments that are different from those presupposed by the

Koyck model.

       Our basic estimating equation is of the following form:

                                13
       (1)   alnE   — a     +    E    flalnP.1       i
                                                         + 8   t
                                                                   +
                                i—o              -


where E represents employment, P represents production, t is a time trend, s

is the error term (assumed to follow a first-order autoregressive process).

and a, the fl's and the Os are parameters to be estimated.5            The fls in this

equation capture the response of employment to changes in output.            For

example, the sum      of   $ througt $4 (i.e., the coefficients on the lead, the

current and the first three lagged production tens) captures the cumulative

effect on employment over three months of a one-time decline in production.

Our   specification    allows production to affect employment with a lag of up to

one year.     We assume that other factors affecting employment, such as

productivity trends and changes in relative factor prices over the

estimating period, are adequately captured by the constant term and the time




       We could have estimated an equation containing levels, rather than
differences, of the employment and production terms. We did begin by
fitting levels equations, but the estimated errors in these equations were
such as to suggest that the underlying process gen.rating them was very
close to a random walk. We therefore adopted the differenced specification
shown in equation (I).

trend.6       Equations with hours per worker or total hours in place of

employment on the left-hand side can be interpreted similarly.

           In addition, rather than estimating the $j's freely, we constrain them

to   lie along a third-order polynomial in i.           That is. we assume that the

      can be written in terms of four underlying parameters:

       (2) Pi—o         1i     +02i2 +e3i3

where the s's are the parameters we actually estimate.             We impose no end-

point constraints on the

       It should be recognized that the parameters we estimate may be

influenced not only by the institutional constraints that are operative in a

particular setting but also by the production structure (the industry

composition of output, the engineering technologies in use, and so on) and

by expectations concerning future demand.            In comparing U.S. and Japanese

adjustment patterns, we implicitly assume that the structure of production

and the structure of the demand for output are reasonably similar between

the two countries.         This is an issue that we return to below when we discuss

our empirical results.8


     6lncluciing a constant plus a time trend in a difference equation is
equivalent to including a time trend plus its square in a levels equation.
If, for example, productivity growth over a given time period were to reduce
the labor input required to produce any given output, that would reduce the
constant term in our estimating equation; a slowing in the rate of
productivity growth would raise the coefficient on our time trend.
            The   point estimates of the   cumulative   effects of changes in output
derived from the Almon lag models are almost            identical to those derived from
the corresponding unconstrained models.

       8    For more detailed discussions of the assumptions underlying
alternative specifications and of the interpretation of the finite lag model
we have chosen to estimate, see Sims (1974), Nickell (1986) and Abraham and
Houseaan (1989).

          Note that information on the net accession rate derived from labor

turnover statistics can also be used to estimate the employment version of

equation (I)        Given a change in the level of production, employers alter

the level of employment through some combination of changes in accessions

and changes in separations.         For example, if output declines, an employer

may   curtail    hiring (reduce the accession rate) and also lay off workers

(increase the separation rate).        The net change in employment will reflect

both actions.       Using the approximation that the change in ln(employment)

equals the net accession rate, equation (1) can be rewritten as:


        (3)   ACCRATEt - SEPRATEt    — a             fljalnP+t       + 9   t
                                             + L                 i             +   Pt
whore ACCRATE represents the gross accession rate, SEPRATE                 represents   the

gross separation rate, and the other tens are as previously defined.                     If

there are problems with the available employment data, as turns out to be

the   case for   Japan, this equation may      actually   perform better than the

corresponding     equation based on employment data.

        In the analysis that follows we make use of monthly data on employment.
hours, and production for the U.S. manufacturing sector and on employment,
gross    accessions, gross separations, hours and production for the Japanese

manufacturing sector.      The analyses reported in the paper are for the

manufacturing sector as a whole.           We also carried out similar analyses for

each of fifteen disaggregated industries within the manufacturing sector;

the results of these disaggregated analyses are reported in an appendix




                                                 8
available from the authors.9       Because we were only able to obtain seasonally

adjusted production series for Japan, we used seasonally adjusted series

throughoutJ0        Except as otherwise noted, all of our analyses cover the

1970:1 through 1985:12 time period.

       The employment and hours data for the United States come from the

employer     payroll survey sent to a stratified random sample of    establishments

each   month.    The data from this survey permit us to construct not only an
overall employment series, but also separate employment series for
production versus nonproduction workers and for male versus female workers.
The survey also yields information on average paid weekly hours for
production workers.       The published data from this survey are not broken down
by establishment size.

       The    labor input data for Japan   are derived from a similar employer

survey,      the Monthly Labour Survey, sent to a random sample of establishments
with S or more employees.       This survey covers all workers who are employed
on an employment contract of at least one month's duration or who have
worked at least 18 days during each of the previous two months.11         It yields

        The fifteen disaggregated industries are: food; textiles; apparel;
lumber; pulp and paper; chemicals; rubber; stone, clay and glass; iron and
steel; nonferrous metals; fabricated metals; nouelectrical machinery;
electrical machinery; transportation equipment; and precision machinery.
     AJbere no seasonally adjusted series was published, we performed the
seasonal adjustment ourselves using th X-ll procedure in SAS.
       11
        In the Japanese Labour Force Survey, a monthly household survey,
'temporary employees" are defined as "employees employed for a period of not
less than a month but not longer than a year" and "day labourers" are
defined as "employees employed daily or for a period of less than a month."
Thus, the employer-provided data we use include temporary employees, but may
not include day laborers. In 1984, day laborers accounted for about two
percent of employment in Japanese manufacturing.        See Japan Ministry of
Labour (1984).

                                              9
information on employment, gross accessions and gross separations for      the

covered work force as a whole.    For establishments with 30 or more

employees, the same information is also collected separately for production

and nonproduction workers and for male and female workers,     Similarly

disaggregated data on average monthly hours are also available for these

establishments.     For establishments with 5-29 employees, data are not

collected separately for production and nonproduction workers.     Except when

we look explicitly at patterns of adjustment by size of establishment, the

results we report for Japan are based on data for establishments with 30 or

more enipioyeesJ2

     While the U.S. and the Japanese surveys are otherwise quite similar in

concept, there is an important difference in the quality of the employment

data derived from them.     In the United States, month to month movements in

all of the employment series we have used are generated using the "link

relative" method, which exploits information on the percentage change in

employment in establishments that report their employment in both months,

and the series are rebenchmarked to population totals annually.    The

Japanese employment data just described are simply published each month as

they become available and never revised subsequently.     because there are

significant month to month changes in the sample of reporting

establishments, the Japanese employment serie, are far noisier than the

corresponding U.S. series.13     Each month, however, in addition to reporting


     12
         Models fit using data for establishment, with 5 or more employees.
rather than 30 or more employees, in cases in which this was possible,
yielded findings that were very similar to those we report.

     13 Eiji Shiraishi of the Japan Ministry of Labor brought this problem
to our attention. The Ministry of Labor does publish an index of employment
in establishments with 30 or more employees that it considers suitable for
                                          10
their end-of-month employment, establishments responding to the Japnese

Monthly Labour Survey are asked to report their accessions and separations.

We use this information to calculate the gross monthly accession rate and

the gross monthly separation rate at the responding firms.              The Japanese

employment    models are then     estimated using equation (3) rather than equation

(I) above, with the net accession rate rather than the change in

ln(employinent) as the dependent variable.           This approach avoids the problems

associated with using        employment data based on different samples in
different months.14
       Another difference between the U.S.         and Japanese surveys is that the

U.S. survey    asks for    information on fiJ4     hours,   while the Japanese Survey

asks   for   information on actual hours.     We discuss the implications of this

difference in definition when we report our results.

       Finally,   the   estimation carried out for this paper required monthly

data on production.        For the United States, we use the monthly industrial

production index constructed by the Federal Reserve Board.              Where   available,
information    on physical output serves as the basis for this index.

Information on energy usage is generally the preferred proxy for the level

of production activity where actual output data are unavailable.                In some

cases, however, manhours are used to gauge the level of production activity.

For manufacturing as a whole, movements in manhours proxy for movements in

about 19 percent of total output.        This feature of the underlying data


use in time series analysis, but no similar indices are constructed for
employment by occupational category, sex or establishment size.
       14
        The use of the net accession rate, rather than the change in
ln(employtent),     to fit
                        our Japanese employment equations had very little
effect on the estimated coefficients, but the standard errors in the models
using the net accession rate were much smaller.

                                              11
should be kept in mind as we discuss the results in the next section of the

paper.   We do not, however, believe it poses a serious problem for our

estimates.     For a number of disaggregated manufacturing industries the

weight given to manhours in the construction of the production index is

negligible.     In the equations that we fit for disaggregated manufacturing

industries, the findings concerning cross-country differences in adjustment

are not sensitive to the degree to which manhours were used in constructing

the   Federal Reserve Board production index.
      The corresponding Japanese series, the Industrial Production Index, is
constructed by MITI based on reports from random samples of firms in a
variety of market segments concerning their production of several thousand
commodities.


IV. Esoirical Results
      The first part of our empirical work contrasts the overall pattern of
employment and hours adjustment in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing.       The

second part focuses on differences in employment and hours adjustment across
groups within each country, and addresses the question of whether a
disproportionate share of the burden of adjustment is borne by certain
groups in society.
Production Structure and Deaand in U.S.    and   Jaoan.se Manufacturing
      Our central objective in this study is to learn about the effects of
the U.S. and Japanese industrial relations systems on employment and hours
adjustment.    This effort is complicated by the fact that, as noted above,
different production structures and different expectations concerning future
demand across the two countries might also lead to differences in the

                                          12
pattern of employment and hours adjustment.     Thus, an important question

that we must consider before proceeding further is whether U.S. and Japanese

employers have been operating in a sufficiently similar environment that

observed differences in the responsiveness of employment and hours to

changes in demand can be interpreted as telling us something about the

operation of the two countries' labor market institutions rather than about

differences in the structure of production or differences in expectations

concerning future demand.

     Our major concern with respect to the structure of production was

whether differences in the adjustment of aggregate manufacturing labor input

to changes in aggregate manufacturing output between the United States and

Japan might reflect differences in the composition of the manufacturing base

in the two countries.     Although in this paper we report only estimated

employment and hours elasticities for manufacturing as a whole, as noted

earlier, we have also estimated similar equations for fifteen disaggregated

manufacturing industries.    The fact that these estimates display patterns

very similar to those for manufacturing as a whole suggests that differences

in the structure of production between the United States and Japan do not

explain our findings for manufacturing as a whole.

     We were also concerned that differences in the demand conditions

prevailing in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing might influence our results.

In particular, we feared that stronger long term demand prospects might have

lead Japanese employers to adjust labor input less in response to short ten

perturbations in sales.     Table 1 presents measures of growth and cyclicality

in the two countries' manufacturing output during the full 1970-85 period




                                          13
and during the two subperiods 1970-77 and 197885.15        From 1970 to 1977,

trend growth in manufacturing production was quite similar in Japan and the

United States and the variability of production was actually somewhat

greater in Japan.    However, during the 1978-85 period, manufacturing output

grew much more rapidly in Japan than in the United States, and the

variability of manufacturing production around its trend was substantially

smaller in Japan.    These differences are also apparent, though in muted

toni, in the data for the full 1970-85 period.       Thus, looking at data for

the 1970-77 period, when demand conditions in the two countries were

relatively comparable, is one way of checking any conclusions concerning the

effects of differences in the two countries' industrial relations systems

drawn from analyses for periods that include the late 1970's and early

1980's, when demand conditions were less comparable.       The fact that our

results are very similar for all three time periods we examine gives us

confidence that the qualitative U.S./Japanese differences we observe reflect

differences in the two countries' industrial relations systems, not

differences in prevailing demand conditions.

Employment   and Hours Adlustmertt   An   Overview
     table   2 and table 3 provide   an overview of labor adjustment in U.S.     and

Japanese   manufacturing.   In ligJt of the possible sensitivity of our results

to the time period selected, we present separate estimates for the full

1970-85 period, reported in Table 2, and for the subperiods 1970-77 and



     15
        At the end of 1977, both countries were experiencing strong growth
following the 1974-75 recession, so that our cutoff represents a similar
point in the business cycle for the two countries.  Given that our
estimating strategy requires a substantial number of observations, it also
seemed sensible to break the data at the midpoint of the full period so that
neither subperiod was too short.

                                             14
1978-85. reported in Table 3.    Estimates of one, three, six, and twelve

month elasticities are presented for total employment, production

employment, average production worker hours, and total production worker

hours.

     The pattern of both total employment and production employment

adjustment is strikingly different in the two countries.    In the estimates

for all three time periods, U.S. manufacturing employment responds quickly

and substantially to changes in production, whereas in Japan there is little

adjustment until six to twelve months after the change.    Moreover, the

magnitude of both total employment adjustment and production employment

adjustment is significantly greater in the United States than in Japan over

all time horizons)-6

     The adjustment of average production worker hours is, in contrast,

quite similar in the two countries.    In both the United States and Japan,

there is a large and immediate response of average hours to changes in

production, and none of the estimated average hours elasticities are

significantly different across the two countries.    As noted above, however,

the hours data for the United States aeasure paid hours, while the hours

data for Japan measure actual hours worked.    One might expect the adjustment

of actual hours to changes in production to be greater than that of paid

hours.    For example, employers may be able to schedule vacation time during

slack periods, in which case actual hours worked would adjust. but paid



     16
        Statements concerning the significance of U.S. -Japanese differences
are based on Wald tests, with the test statistic computed as the difference
between the estimated elasticities for the two countries, divided by the
square root of the sum of the variances of these elasticities.   Implicitly,
we are assuming that the error terms in the U.S. and Japanese equations are
uncorrelated. We use the same test for cross-time-period comparisons.

                                         15
hours would not.   Although we do not know the empirical importance of the

difference in definition, we can conclude that average hours in Japanese

manufacturing adjust no more, and possibly less, than in American

manufacturing.

     Total production worker hours elasticities are without exception

significantly larger in the United States than in Japan.   Again, these

differences are, if anything, understated.

     As already noted, demand conditions in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing

were most similar during the 1970-77 subperiod.   During the 1978-85

subperiod, Japanese manufacturing output grew more rapidly and was less

cyclically volatile than in the earlier subperiod, while U.S. manufacturing

output grew less rapidly and was no less cyclically volatile.    The point

estimates of the relevant Table 3 coefficients imply that, during the later

subperiod, U.S. employment and hours generally adjusted somewhat more to

changes in production than during the first part of the 1970's, while

Japanese employment and hours generally adjusted less.11    Thus, the

magnitude of the divergence between the U.S. and the Japanese adjustment

pattern is somewhat sensitive to the period considered.    Importantly,

however, our qualitative findings are not.

     The characterization that Japanese industry relies relatively more on

adjustment of average hours while U.S. industry relies relatively more on

employment adjustment is certainly accurate.   For example, from Table 2,    the


     17 For the United States, only the twelve month production employment
elasticity difference is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.   For
Japan, both of the three and six month employment elasticity differences are
significant.  Our results for Japan are consistent with those reported by
Muramatsu (1983).  On the basis of Koyck models fit for various subperiods.
he concludes that employment adjustment was greatest following the first oil
shock than during either earlier or later subperiods.

                                        16
adjustment of production employment levels accounts for about two-thirds of

the total production labor input adjustment over a one month time horizon in

the United States; in Japan, the adjustment of production employment levels

accounts for only about 10 percent of the total production labor input

adjustment over the same time horizon.

     Our estimates do not indicate, however, as some researchers have

concluded, that average hours adjustment in Japan compensates for the lack

of employment adjustment.    In both the short and medium run, the adjustment

of total production labor input in Japanese manufacturing is substantially

less than that in American manufacturing.

Who Adlusts:   Within Country Differences in Eznlovment Stability
     The results of the preceding section may mask significant variation in

employment and hours adjustment, and corresponding differences in the

stability of employment, across groups within each country.     In the final

part of the analysis, we compare labor adjustment by broad occupational

category and by sex for both the United States and Japan.     In addition, for

Japan we look at differences in employment adjustment by establishment size.

In this section we present only estimates using data for the entire 1970-85

period.   However, we have also estimated equations using data for the 1970-

77 subperiod and the 1978-85 subperiod.     None of our qualitative conclusions

are sensitive to the time period selected.     Qualitatively similar results

were obtAined in our analyses for disaggregated industries as well.

     Production   versus Nonnroduction Worker Adjust.ent
     For technological   reasons, production workers are likely to be a more

variable input in the production process than nonproduction workers.

Furthermore, the average production worker is likely to possess less firm-


                                          17
specific human capital than the average nonproduction worker.      For both of

these reasons, production employment may adjust more to changes     in output

than nonproduction employment.

      Table 4 compares estimates of one, three, six and twelve month

elasticities of production and nonproduction employment within both U.S. and

Japanese manufacturing.   It also presents estimates of average hours

elasticities for Japanese production and nonproduction workers.      As

expected, U.S. production employment elasticities are uniformly

significantly larger than those for nonproduction employment.18

      Quite different patterns are evident in Japan.     The one month

elasticity estimates for production and nonproduction employment are

insignificantly different both from zero and from each other.      The labor

input of production workers is somewhat more responsive than that of

nonproduction workers in the very   short   run, but this largely reflects the

adjustment of average hours rather than of employment.      The production

employment elasticity does increase steadily over longer time horizons, but

the nonproduction employment elasticity remains insignificantly different

from zero.   By three months out, the production employment elasticity is

significantly largor than the nonproduction employment elasticity.

      Still, the differentials in employment adjustment between production

and nonproduction workers are much smaller in Japan than those in the United



      18 To determine the statistical significance of these differences, we
used seemingly unrelated regression techniques to estimate unconstrained and
constrained versions of the production and nonproduction worker equations.
In the constrained versions, we required that the one, three, six or twelve
month elasticities, as appropriate, be the same for the two groups.   This
approach permitted us to construct chi-squared statiscistics for hypothesis
testing. The same approach was used to test the statistical significance of
the   other within-country differences reported below.
                                            18
States.     Interestingly   the elasticity point estimates for production

workers in Japan are insignificantly different from those of nonproduction

workers in theunited States.      Stated somewhat differently, production

workers in Japan enjoy a degree of employment stability that is similar to

that enjoyed by nonproduction workers in the United States.

     Male versus Female Adjustment

     Given the fact that turnover rates are higher for women than for men,

we would expect to observe greater adjustment of female than of male

employaent in response to changes in demand.     In addition, weaker job rights

for women might translate into greater volatility in female employment.

     In the United States, last-in-first-out layoff rules are common even in

nonunion settings.     Because women's job tenure is, on average, shorter than

men's, women may be more vulnerable to being laid off in the event of a

reduction in forcej9

     In Japan. the so-called lifetime employment system applies primarily to

regular employees in large and medium sized establishments.20     In 1984, only

80 percent of women employed in manufacturing held regular positions, while

20 percent were employed as "temporary workers" or "day laborerc 21         In

contrast, 97 percent of men employed in manufacturing held regular

positions, with only 3 percent employed as temporary workers or day

laborers.    Women are also underrepresented in large establishments and


     19

Hall (1982).

        For discussions of work force reductions in Japanese industry. see
United States Department of Labor (1985) and Shimada (1986).
     21
        As noted earlier, the ter. "temporary worker" applies to those
employed for one month to one year and the term "day laborer" applies to
those employed on a daily basis or for a period of less than one month.

                                          19
overrepresented in small establishments.        In 1984, only 20.6   percent   of

female employees in manufacturing worked in establishments with 500 or more

employees; 34.0 percent were employed in establishments with fewer than 30

employees.   The corresponding figures for men were 40.5 percent and 23.6

percent22    The fact that Japanese women are less likely than Japanese men

to be employed in regular positions with large employers may mean that they

are more vulnerable to contract termination.

     Table 5 reports one, three, six and twelve month employment elasticity

estimates for men and for women in U.S. and Japanese manufacturing.            Average

hours elasticities by sex for Japan are also reported.        In the United States

the female employment elasticities are uniformly greater than the male

employment elasticities, significantly so for the one, three and six month

time horizons.

     In the Japanese manufacturing sector, female employment adjustment is

much larger than male employment adjustment, especially beginning with the

three month elasticity.   All male/female differences in the Japanese

employment elasticities are statistically significant.        From three months

onwards, however, the adjustment of male average hours is somewhat larger

than that of female average hours; the six and twelve month differences are

statistically significant.   Therefore, it appears that the lower adjustment

of male employment is partly compensated for by greater adjustment of

average male hours.   The fact that average female hours respond less to


     22
        The data we use to estimate employment and hours elasticities
exclude day laborers and employees of establishments with fewer than 30
employees. Among manufacturing employees who are either regular or
temporary employees, only 83 percent of women but 98 percent of men are
regular employees   Among manufacturing employees in establishments with 30
or more employees, only 31 percent of wonken but 53 percent of men are
employed in establishments of 500 or more employees.

                                           20
changes in demand nay in part reflect the fact that, until 1986, tight legal

restrictions limited overtime work by women.23

      Because production and nonproduction worker employment elasticities are

so different in the United States, estimated male/female differentials are

likely to be sensitive to the representation of men and women by occupation.

Unfortunately, the establishment data source we are using does not provide

data on male and female employment separately by occupation.     Information

from other sources, however, suggests that differences in the distribution

of men and women between production and nonproduction jobs are unlikely to

explain our finding of higher employment elasticities for women than for

men.2      The same problem in disentangling the effects of occupation and sex

on labor adjustment exists for Japan. though the fact that production and

nonproduction employment elasticities are more similar makes it less

worrisome 25

      Although in Japan female employment adjusts more than male employment,

the employment elasticities reported in Table 5 nonetheless imply that


      23 Specifically, women were prohibited from working more than 2 hours
of overtime in any day, 6 hours in any week or 150 hours in any year. We
thank Eiko Shinozuka and Machiko Osawa for bringing this to our attention.

      24 Tabulations of the May 1979 Current Population Survey indicate that
a slightly higher proportion of male than of female employees in
manufacturing were employed in production jobs (69.8 percent versus 62.6
percent) where production jobs were defined to include craft, operative.
laborer and service positions. On the basis of broad occupation alone,
then, one would expect male employment elasticities to be higher than female
employment elasticities.

      25 During 1979, about 76 percent of women in manufacturing were
production workers, compared to 63 percent of men.  This difference alone
would have lead one to expect only a .003 difference between the one month
female and male employment elasticities; over twelve months, the predicted
difference would be only .029. The actual differences reported in Table S
are much larger than the differences one would expect based simply on
differences in production versus nonproductton status.
                                          21
employment elasticities        for Japanese women are significantly less than

employment elasticities for either American men or American women.             This

suggests that Japanese women enjoy greater employment stability than either

American men or American women as a group.              An important caveat to this

conclusion, however, is the fact that day laborers, who are

disproportionately female, are excluded from our employment data.              Day

laborers    account for only a small fraction of employment in manufacturing
(2.1 percent of total employment, 4.5        percent      of female employment and 0.8
percent of male employment) but may well provide an important margin for
adjustment.
     Adjustment by Establishment Size
     In    this    final comparison we look at adjustment of employment levels by
establishment size for Japan. Many have noted that the lifetime employment
system is    primarily    a phenomenon of large and medium sized companies.
Employment    in    smaller   companies may be   less   stable due to differences in
personnel    practices from larger companies.           In addition, larger companies

may subcontract to smaller companies, essentially using them to cushion

demand shocks.        In this case, greater fluctuations in production also would

contribute    to less employment security in smaller companies.
     to directly examine the relation between establishment size and
employment adjustment, we estimated separate employment elasticities for
establisbmencs with 500 or more employees, 100-499 employees. 30-99
employees, and 5-29 employees.          The production variables on the right-hand
side measure percentage changes in production for the entire industry, not
for the individual size class, consequently, differences in employment
adjustment by establishment size may result from differences in the

                                                 22
variablility of production by establishment size as veil as differences in

personnel practices.

        The results in Table 6 do reveal some differences in employment

adjustment by establishment size.        The distinction appears primarily between

establishments in the largest size class          -   -   those with 500 or more employees
--    versus all other size classes.     Employment adjustment is generally

greater in the three smaller establishment size classes than in the largest,

although many of the differences between the top size class and the others

are not statistically significnat and the 12 month employment elasticity for

establishments with 5-29 employees is actually less than that for

establishments 500 or more employees.        A comparison of the three smaller

size classes shows that employment elasticities generally decline with

establishment size.     It is interesting to note that the relatively slower

adjustment in the largest establishment size category coincides with the

fact that women are particularly underrepresented in establishments with 500

or more employees.



V. Conclusion

       Japanese workers appear to enjoy, on average, considerably greater jab

security than American workers.        Consistent with previous work, we find that

employment    levels in Japanese manufacturing adjust much less to changes in
production than do U.S. employment levels.                Contrary to some previous work,
however, we find that the adjustment of average hours is about the same in
the   two countries.   Consequently, the adjustment of total labor input in the

Japanese manufacturing sector is also significantly less than that in U.S.

manufacturing.    Thus, Japanese hours are not sufficiently flexible to offset


                                             23
any short run costs of providing employment security borne by Japanese

employers.

     Weitzman (1984) and Freeman and Weitzman (1987) have suggested that the

bonus system renders compensation considerably more flexible in Japan than

in the    United   States.   The relative responsiveness of total labor costs to

changes in production in the United States and Japan is something that we

plan to examine in future work.       At this point, it would be premature to

conclude that the strong job security characterizing Japanese labor markets

imposes costs on employers even in the short run.          In   addition, Japanese

internal labor markets are often characterized as more flexible than

American internal labor markets, in the sense that Japanese employers have

more freedom to reassign workers within the firm.26             Such flexibility is

likely to enhance productivity and may be viewed as a substitute for

managerial flexibility in hiring and firing.

     Although the stability of employment is, on average, greater in Japan

than in the United States, the variation in employment and hours adjustment

across groups of workers within each country is considerable.             In the United

States, the burden of work force adjustment falls primarily on production

workers.     In Japan, differences between production and nonproduction

employment adjustment are relatively small.          Both production and

nonproduction workers enjoy strong employment security compared to

production workers in the United States.          This may be a result of the

changes in industrial relations in Japan after World War II that equalized




     26
           For a recent discussion, see Koike (1984).

                                             24
social relations between blue and white collar workers.      Such equalization

has never occurred in the United states.2

      In Japan. the burden of adjustment to demand shocks is widely believed

to be borne disproportionately by workers in small establishments and by

casual workers, who are predominantly women.     We find only limited support

for the contention that employment adjustment is greater in smaller

establishments.     The differences between the adjustment patterns of mate and

female employees appear to be more important.     Female employment adjusts

much more than male employment, particularly over horizons of three months

or more.     This finding is consistent with the fact that women comprise the

bulk of temporary workers in manufacturing and, secondarily, are

concentrated in the smaller establishments.

     In sum, in both the United States and Japan, the degree of employment

security varies widely across groups, resulting In some overlap between the

two countries.     In the United States, the employment of nonproduction

workers is,    in practice, roughly as stable as that of overall employment In

Japan.

     Yet, in Japan. among the groups we examined, there is no group whose

employment adjusts as much to changes in demand as that of production

workers in the United States.     Although, in Japan. female workers, and, to

some extent, workers in small establishments, do bear a disproportionate

share of the burden of emloyiuent adjustment, employment of these    groups is

still less responsive to changes in demand than that of U.S.    production
workers.




     27 We
              owe this observation to Konosuke Odaka.
                                          25
     A caveat to this last conclusion is that we could not independently

exaioine adjustment patterns for temporary employees and day laborers, who

are predominantly women.        The pattern of adjustment for temporary employees

is nicely to be considerably different from that for regular workers, and

the fact that a disproportionate number of women are temporary workers may

well underlie the male/female differentials we report for Japan.                 Moreover,

our data exclude day laborers         though it should be remembered that they

comprise under five percent of the women employed in the manufacturing

sector.   Nevertheless, one can conclude that Japanese women not employed as

day laborers   -   -   the great majority of female Japanese employees   -   -    enjoy.   on

average, much greater stability of employment than does the average American

worker.
