             Capital Mobility in the World
           Economy: Theory and Measurement


                            ABSTRACT




    This paper is a critical assessment of some recent empirical

evidence on the   extent   of international capital mobility. Its major

conclusion is that while much of this evidence is difficult to

interpret without ambiguity, it is consistent with a world economy

in which the degree of capital mobility is high and increasing.

Two main approaches to the measurement of capita]. mobility are

discussed. The first, traditional, approach is based on comparing

expected yields on assets located in different countries. The

second,   and more novel, approach is based on comparing national

saving rates and domestic investment rates.

      Th is paper is      a       critical       assessment of some recen t empir i    cal

evidence or the extent of inter national capi tal mobilit y. Free capi tal

mobility is in general a necess ary condition for the ef +                  i ci ent   interna—

tional allocat ion of the world' s saving.                   The efficient all oca tion of

risks in the w orld economy requ ires internati onal asset trade and the

portfolio dive rsification it al lows. Further, the extent to whi ch capi—

tal is mobile is important in a ssessing the e fficacy of financi al

policies in op en economies, the incidence of certain taxes, and the

impact on capi tal accumulation of changes in government and pri vate

saving. The di scussion emphasi zes that concl usi ons about effici ency

cannot be drawn from an y set 0 f empiri cal resul ts unless some b enchmar k

model of an "eff icie n       t        wor 1 d   economy is specif ied in advance.

Similarly, posit i   ye   as well as normat ive conclu sions are extremel y

sensitive to the emp in cal assumption s embedded in the benchmark model.

      The remain der of thi s paper is organized as follows:

      Section II de scr ibes recent wor k on the relation between measured

rates of return on ass ets denomi nated in diff erent currencies. It is

argued that in mo dels of any generali ty, the observed internati onal

linkages between these             r   ates may be 1 oose ev en if there are no serious

imperfections in world             c   api tal markets. The di scussion suggests that the

tests most likely to be                i nf   ormative about the extent of capital mobility

involve assets de nomi nat ed in the same currenc y but issued in di f                       f er en t



political or regu 1 atory jun isdictions. Availab le evidence is con si stent

with strong cross —border               li    nkages between OECD —country capital m arkets.

      Section III descri bes the Feldstein—Hori oka approach and r esul ts,

and then presents a life-cycle model in which countries' saving and

investment rates are correlated even though capital is perfectly mobile.

A simulated regression using data generated by the model yields es—
timates quite similar to those found by Feldstein arid            Horioka   and

ot her S.    However, the policy implications   of the estimates      are very

differen t     from those that are usually drawn • For example,       + I scal


policies that encoura ge saving have no effe ct on domestic capita 1 stocks

in spite of the stron g statistical correlat ion between lon 9—run savi rig

and inves tment rates.

          The empirical { indings of Feldstei n and Horioka are for the most

part based on cross—s ectional c omparisons of countries saving and

I nvestment     rates over periods of five years or more. Sections IV through

Vi of this paper explore the savi ng—in vest merit      relation    in a short—run,

time— series context.

          Section IV develops a si mple open—economy model suitable for

anal yz ing    comovements between innovations in saving and innovations in

invest merit. Both Feldstein (1983) and Murphy (1984) have used aggrega—

tive I S—LPI    models for this purpose    but the modelling strategy here is

differ ent in that the possibility of a saving—investment correlation is

derive d explicitly from the maximi zing behavior of households and firms

rather than imposed a priori.

          The model of section IV highli qhts the fact that data from na—

tiorial      income accounts do not yield an ac curate represent ation o + na-

tional saving in a world where share s in the ownership of domest ic firms

can be held by foreigners. Section V show s        ho    this probi em can i ncrease

measur ed correlations between saving and       i n vest m en t


            Section Vi presents estimates of th e tire-series      correlion

seven OECD countries. although these esti mates need to be interpreted

with c autior, they provide empirical fact s with which macroeconomic

theories must be consistent. The estimated correlation coefficients turn
                                           —4—


out to be highest for economies which are either very large (the United

States) or have had extensve c apital controls over much of the sample

period (Japan). The y are smalle r for medium—sized countries, and may be

insignificantly dif ferent from zero for the smallest economies. In all

cases but those of the U.S. and Japan, the estimated saving—investment

correlations over t he entire sa mple period considered differ sig—

nificantly from the value of 1 that would obtain under complete capital

immobility. Further     for six of the seven countries, the measured cor—

relation drops in t he period af ter 1972. An interpretation of the data

consistent with the se findings is suggested. This interpretation, which

postulates substant ial and incr easing capital mobility among OECD

countries, receives   i ndi re ct   support from evidence on the United Kingdom

under the pre—1914 gold st and ard.

      The papers m am     con clusions are summarized in section VII.




               II.    Inte rest, Exch ange Rates, and Inflation

      The international integrati on of natio nal financial markets im—

plies important linkage s between the ret urns off ered by assets issued in

different countries. Th ese links can be weak ened by transaction costs,

taxes, capital controls      sovereig n ri sk, and other market imperfections.

Even in the absence of imperfecti ons, th e na ture of the 1 inkage depends

on investors preferen ces and the stochastic structure of the world

economy. The most stra i   ghtf or ward   approach t o evaluating the mobility of

capital is the direct    c omp ar i   son of rates of return on ph ysical capital

in various countries. Al thoug h such comparisons have been attempted (for

example, by Harberqer (1978))           the problems of measuremen t, of diverse

ta treatment, and of converting measured returns into           a common


numeraire, are severe. Much recent research has therefore limited itself
                                                                    t

to comparing returns within a                              rather       narrowly delimited group of rela—

tivEly homomoeneous financial assets.

         It is convenient to mot ivate some of the recent empirical tests on

international rate of return linkages b                                     developing a simple two—good

averse investors. The model makes the point that many of the empi                                        ri cal
tests have unambiguous implic ati ons ab out capital mobil ity on ly un der

some rather stringent assumpt ions. It                                                       the c ompar i sons

mOst likely to be informative about the extent of international capital

mobility involve assets denomi nated in the same currency but issued in

different countries.

          There are two countries in the world, a "home" country and a

'foreign' country, each with its own, country—specific currency. On any

date t, the domestic—money p rice of a unit of domestic currency to be

deliver ed with cert ainty on date t+l is just 11(1 +                                          where Rt is the

domesti c nominal in terest r ate. The foreign nominal interest rate                                           is

similar ly defined, and the spot exchange rate, X, gives the price of a

unit of foreign cur rency d elivered at time t in terms of a unit of home

cur r enc      y also deliv ered at time t. Note that the nominal interest rates

thet ha ye just beer defined are risk—free nominal rates. Each country is

special i:ed in the product i on of its characteristic output. The

do ire s t i   c—mon ey price of home output at time t is denoted P, while

there are no cash—in—advan ce constraints, he may use a domestic currency

Because the marginal rate of substitution between current consumption of

equals the relative price of those goods,

             The second equality i n (1) may be rewritten in a way that ii—

lustrates the link between nominal interest rates and the exchange rate.

Expression (3) revea is that, absent imper fections, the nominal interest

differential between the home and foreign currencies is        determined by
two factors. First1 there is the expected       depreciation   of the domestic

currency against the foreign currency, Et                  Seconds there is the

covariance term, whi ch may be interpreted as a risk premium.

      The intuition behind the covariance term in (3) is as fo 11 ow; The

quantity ut+i/Pt+i measures the marginal consumption value o f the
domestic currency at time t+1, the utility obtained then by sp ending

another unit of home money to consume the domestic good. (By          2), this

is the same as the u tility that would be obtained by spending the money

to raise consumption of the foreign good. ] The greater is the covariance

between the future ex change rate            and the marginal consum ption value

of domestic currency, the more effective is the foreign bond relative to

the domestic bond as a hedge against cons umption risk. This i s because

the stochastic payoff on foreign assets, in terms of domestic c urrency

tends to be surprisin gly high when the consumption value of the currency

is surprisingly high.       rise in this covariance therefore leads to a

fall i n the nominal i nterest rate on foreign bonds relative to that on

domest ic bond;.

      when the ris p remium in (3) is zero, interest rates are linked by

the uncovered interest parity condition


(4> (R —
           R)/(1   +   R)    (Et(Xt +i) —


which relates the interest d iff erential exclusively to expected

depreciation. Under the assumpt ion that expectation; are rational,

approximations to condition (4> have been tested extensively on recent

data. These tests are unani mous in rejecting the condition as a charac—

terization of asset—market equi 1 ibrium      [see Cumby and Dbstfeld

 1981,1584),            Hansen and Hodrick (1980,1983), Hodrick and Srivastava

(i5S4,19B)            , and the references therein]. But it should be clear that
                                                                                          6
the assumptions required to proceed from (3) to (4) are not innocuous.
Most authors ha ye therefore regarded rejections of (4) as indicating the
presence of a t ime—varying                consumption risk premium rather than ir—

rationality or              market imperfections. Because expectations (and, by

implication, r isk              premia) are not directly observable, this is just one

of several pos sible              interpretations. Only after making some strong prior

assumptions            on   expectations and the nature of the risk premium can one

extract conclu sions about the functioning of international asset markets

from    test; of (4). 7
            it   is    noteworthy that the concept of uncovered interest parity may

not always            be well defined.      By using (2), one can manipulate (3) to

obtain

            Tests of unco vered          interest parity typically use interest rates on

Euroc urrenc y deposi ts, which, unlike U.S. Treasury bills, are not widely

believed to be free of default risk. This raises two further problems of

interpretation. The first of these arises from the assumption underlying

(3) that interest rates are risk free—rates. The second problem, which
                                                               —9—


is more serious, involves the question of whether inferences concerning

international capital mobility can in fact be made from the tests.

            The pres ence of default risk indicates t hat the reasoning leading

to (3) or (5) is not valid when ap plied to Eur ocurrency rates. The use

of Eurocurrenc y rates is typically justified, however, by the argument

that Eurocurre ncy deposits have id entical risk characteristics (at least

when issued by the same bank). And indeed, a p articular formalization of

this idea does yield (3) and (5). Suppose that the Eurobank honors its

deposits with probability E t+1 on date t+1 but defaults with probability

1 —                payl ng depositors                   no co mpensation in that case. Let       be a

random variabl e that assumes t he value 1 with probability                                  and the

val ue 0 with probability                         1 —
                                                         c1    Then the sto chastic payoff on

cur r enc y Eurodeposits is Q t+1 (1 + Rt) with an expected value of

                                                              while that on

If
      Qt+1
                  is    distributed I ndependentl y of all other relevant variables,

then conditions (3) and (5) follow exactly as bef ore. Of c ourse, a

failure of the f oregoi ng independence assumpti on makes it even more

difficult than o therwi se to interpret rejectio ns of condi tion (4).

             The second problem of interpretatiDn is th at tests of interest

 in for cation           abou t the ex tent of capital mobility among countries. These

 tests typically assess the efficiency of arbitr age among deposits issued

 in a s inqle 1 ocal               i ty    (for example, London). (.inIe ss tests involve assets

 issued ir dif f              er ent      countries, they can tell us little ab out the ease

 with w hich re i dent s of those countries can engage in mt ertemporal

 trades           This po nt would be irrelevant if nominal yields on assets

3 ur   isdictions were equal. hut casual observation reveals discrepancies,

4 or   reasons that may involve heterogeneity in terms of default risk3

soy ereiqn risk, and tax treatment, as well as existing capital controls

and other financial regulations [see Aliber (1973) and Dooley and Isard

(1980)

          indeed, any attempt to measure capital mobility using rates of

return must b e based, not on a comparison of Eurocurrenc y rates, but on

a comparison of nominal yi elds on 'onshore" and "offshor e" assets

denominated i n the same cu rrency——for example, large dol lar certi ficates

of deposit is sued by New V ork banks and those issued by London ba n     k s.



These rates g enerally do d iffer, as noted above, but fo r many cur renc        i es


they have ten ded to move t ogether in recent years [see Fieleke (1 982)

chart 11.

          Johnsto n (1979) finds that after correction for differential

financial req ulations, Eurodollar and Eurodeutschemar k rates are always

quite close t o the interest rates paid on comparable liabilities of

onshore banks (at least after 1973 for dollar rates a nd after mid—1973

for Dli rates).    In a very careful study accounting for bid—ask spreads

and the cost a f deposit insurance as w eli as differen tial reserve re—

quirements, Kr eicher (1982) finds that over the 1975- 198C' period, the

difference bet ween Eurodollar and U.S. certificate—of —deposit rates

afforded banks little or no opportunit y for arbitrage       Hartman (1984)

presents evide nce of significant two—way feedback between Eurodollar

deposit rates and interest rates on commercial paper issued in the U.S

          When ca pital controls are known to have been important, there are

still links b etween onshore and offshore interest rates, but also some

important di screpancies. Siavazzi and Pagano (1984) show that for France

and Italy, these discrepancies have been largest around the time of
                                      -11--



exchange—rate realignments within the European Monetary System (EMS). In

contrast, these authors find a close connection between onshore and

offshore rates for Germany and the Netherlands, two EMS countries with

essentially open capital markets. Rogoff (1985) also presents evidence

that capital controls have helped the French and Italian authorities

maintain EMS—linked exchange rates. Ito (1983) documents the existence

of apparent arbitrage opportunities between Japanese Gensaki repurchase

agreements and Eurocurrency deposits during the 1970s, when Japanese

capital controls were stringent. However, he shows that these oppor-

tunities became very infrequent once Japanese capital markets were
                                         10
effectively opened in December 1980.

      On the whole, therefore, data on onshore—offshore interest dif-

ferentials imply a substantial degree of capital mobility among OECD

countries. In the face of this strong evidence of efficient interna-

tional portfolio allocation at each point in time, it is difficult to

understand assertions that the allocation of portfolios over time

somehow consistent with substantial arbitrage opportunities.

      No explicit mention has been made of the international linkage

among expected real rates of interest, defined as nominal rates cor-

rected for expected local price—level inflation. The reason is that the

theory outlined above makes no strong predictions about real interest

rates so defined. This point is illustrated through the assumption that

the interest parity condition (4) holds. Define the domestic inflation

rate as        =           —   1   and the foreign inflation rate as 11

          —   1.   If   denotes the terms of trade XtF/Pt and if          and


Ft/P are distributed independently, then (4) can be written


 (6) (Rt R/(1+R = [Et(tt+i)/7t)Et[(1+t+i/1+U*i)) -1.
                                                     I'
 Note that iin addition, the terms of trade are expected to remain

 constant over timp, (6) assumes the form


 (7) (R — R:)I(l+R:) =                               *
                                         EtC(Iti           1+11*   )]



which explains relative nominal interest rates by expected relative

inflation rates. A very crude approximation to (7) is


              —                =
                                     *         *
        Rt        Et(llt+i          Rt —


the usual statement of the international equality of expected real

interest rat es. But even when (4) holds, the equality (7) leading to

this approxi mati on follows only if one mak es some exceedingly strong

assumptions, inc luding the assumpti on that the relative price of na—

tional outpu ts f ollows a martingale pr oces s. This last assumption is

sometimes ca 11       ed     ex ante purchasing power parity, and while there is

some support for it in the data, it can b e statistically rejected in

many cases          see Cumby and Ubstfeld (1984)].

         The eq ual    i   ty of expect ed real rates has been tested, for both

onshore and offshore nomi nal rates, in a series of papers by Hodrick

 1979)        Howard (1979            Cumby and Mi shkin (1985), Cumby and Obstfeld

(1984), and Mishkin                (l984a, 19 84b)   In li ght of the rather strong rejec—

tions    of    uncovered p arity and ex a nte p urchasing power parity, is it is

not surp rising that most of these tests reject the hypothesis that

expected real rates are equal acro ss cur rencies. Nonetheless1 the

bi 1 atera 1      correlatio ns computed by Cumby and Mishkin (1985) show that ex

ante rea I rates tend to move together, even when defined using onshore

interest rates. Thei r finding r einforces the impression of significant

capital mobility among OECD countries.
                        III. Saving, Investment, and Capital Mobil ity

          While international comparisons of interest rates yield indirect

evidence          on the mobility o 4 capital among countries1 the connection

between a c ountry's income and its expenditure yields a direct measure

of the exte nt of its inter temporal trade with the rest o4 the world.

When a coun try i s completely closed to                         capi t al   may ements, its income

necessarily equa is its spending on consumpti on and investment goods. In

contrast, c ountr ies that are integrated into the w arId capital market

may    finance         disc repancies between income and spend ing through inter na—

tional borr owing             or lending.

          In      a   pair   of stimulating papers, Feldstein and Horiok a (1980) and

Feld stein            1983) have attempted to use measured discrepanci es between

national in comes and ependitur es to assess the degree of i nternational

financial integrati on. To motivate their approach, let V denote national

income, C private c onsumption, I domestic investment, and 6 government

consumption. In an economy closed to international cap ital movements1

total national savi ng S =                     V               necessarily equals domestic invest—

ment I. The current account of the balance of payments                                given by

is n ecesarily              zero in this case. For an              economy open to external asset

t   r ad e,   S   and I need not coincide and th eref                  ore can vary independently in

equi librium. For example, when national saving exceeds domestic

    nyc stment,the           economy is running a curr ent—account                surplus and ac—

      Over t he period 1960—1974, for example, the least—squares estimate

Regressions using net, rather than gross, savi nç and investment yield

estimates of         even closer to 1. Because              s repeatedly estimated to

be significantly different from zero but not 5igni ficantl y different

that most of any increment to national saving ends up augmonting the

the investment rate given in (19) to rise, these variables can be corre—

lated in a cross—section of countries, in spite of the perfect mobility

of capital.1 Saving rates are increasing functions of population growth

rates for the standard life—cycle reasons [as set forth in tiodigliani

(1970), for example): the more quickly the economy grows, the lower the
weight in the aggregate saving ratio of dissaving by the old. Invest—

behind the saving—i nvestm ent correlation in this model.

In thi s equati or the esti mated slope coefficient is significantly dif—

ferent from                and insigni ficantly different from 1. The equation is

therefore quite close to the type of result found in the Feldstein—

Horioka literature,              al   though the         is only about half as large as those

typically reported there.

           The preceding                                                        the Fel dstein—

Horioka findin gs are consistent with perf ect capital mobili ty. They also

regressions wi thout knowledge of the economic model underly mg                                         the

increase in th e saving rate caused by an increase in the ec onomy 's

growth rate wi 11 be associated with a ri se in the domestic                                     investment
rate. This fac t lies behind the large and significant slop e coefficient

in the regress ions. But it does not follow that j ri se I                                   n    saving will

be accompanied by an increase in investment. For eamp le,                                    a    rise in the

saving rate in duced by tax policies that do not affect fir s will leave

the investment rate unchanged any increment to saving                                 wi 1   I    I   ndeed flow

taken by therns elves, are an insufficient basis for pol icy for mul at ion.

           While th e foregoing counter—example is driven en ti                         r    ly by economic

equation (6). But while the t—statistic for the new regressor is 1.45,                                 a

high correlation between saving and                 investment rates remains. Summers
(1965) finds a highly significant co efficient on                        population growth when
that variable and the rate of income growth ar e added as regressors. An

investment—saving correlation of 0.61 remains, but the Summers result

contradicts the hypothesis that domestic inves tment depends only on

domestic saving in the long run. It i s an open question whether more

             Another question that has       not been answered i s why OECD current

accounts have been so small rel ative to saving over most of the post—

1960 period [see Feldstein and Horioka ( 1980)                        and F i el eke (1962)].
Recall that the current account measures                    the net +1 ow of       capital between

a country and the rest of the worId.                Both the resul ts          of this section

IV. Time—Ser in Covariation between Saving and Invest.ent: An Example

       Section III explored the i nterpretati on of cross—sectional                     cor -


relations between long—run average saving and i nvestmen t rates. The

Feldstein—Horioka reasoning impi ies also that the time— series correla—

tion between changes in saving r ates and chan ges in mv estment rates

should be zero as well if capitaI mobility is perfect. This section

discusses this proposition at a theoretical 1 evel show ing that its

validity will depend on the nat ure of the sho cks imping ing on the

economy. The discussion serves as a backgroun d for the estimation of

time—series saving—i nvestment correlations in section V 1, below.

      4 simple intertemporal model of a small open econ omy illustrates

one channel leading to a posi tive time—series correlati on between in—
                                         n



novations in saving and    innovations       in   investment. That channel is the

response of both saving and investment to temporary shifts in the

productivity of domestic capital and 1 a bor. Say ma         and   investment may

move together in the short run even if domestic firms are entirely

foreign owned. The essential reason for this co movement is again the

fact that labor is not mobile across na tional b oundaries. An increase in

domestic factor productivity therefore entails an increase in the domes—

tic wage; and if this increase is suffi ciently transient, saving will

rise as suppliers of labor spread it cv er all + uture periods.

      The model is deliberately kept as simple as possible; in par—

ticular, a nonstochastic environment is assumed • While a stochastic

setup would of course be necessary to develop r igorously the model s

empirical implications, my goal here is merely to illustrate an aspect

of the saving—investment link in open ec onomi es             The possibly dif-

ferent identities of the agents who make saving decisions and those who

make investment decisions is highlighted below b y the presence of a

stock market and value—maximizing firms. However             the competitive equi—

librium naturally I eads to the same allocation of resources that a

central planner wou ld choose.

      A small open economy faces a perfect world capital market, In—

dividuals consume a single good which may also be transformed into a

unit of capital or lent abroad at the interest rate p. The world capital

market is perfect i n the sense that individuals may lend or borrow any

amount they wish at the rate r,    subject        to a lifetime budget constraint

to be discussed bel ow. All loans are again denominated in units of the

single consumption good.

      The represen t ative immortal consumer has a fixed labor endowment

(normalized at uni t y) which he sells domestically at the wage rate w at
tine t. H            holds his nonhuean wealth at time t in the form of claims on
foreianers (possibly neative) and shares ht (0                               ht s   1) in   the profits

of the single domestic                   firm.     Shares pay dividerds (and bonds pay inter-

est) after a period. Let dt denote the dividends the domestic firm pays

out in period t and                      the firms e—dividend (or end—of—period) market

alue. Necessary conditions for the optimal individual consumption plan

under perfect foresiaht may be derived by maximizing the consumers

An implication                of the necessary conditions is that in a perfect—

foresight equi librium, shares in the domestic firm offer a rate of

return equal t o the wor Id interest rate:

The si mplifying assumption                        = l/(l+p)   yi   elds the further implication

that i ndividuals choose a perfectly flat consumption path.

The firm is       labelled          "dome'stict not because it is owned entirel y or even

both national saving and domestic investee nt to causes in that pen od.

permanent.

This leads to k1 = vLm/p+&)1lU. After v rises to v' in period 1,

however, the capital stock rust remain fixed at k1 even though the the

           Figures 2 and 3 t ogether make the point that investment and saving

innovations can be posi tively correlated when both are c aused by tern—

porary shifts in the domest         i C   production function. Shift 5     in   produc—

tivity alter saving as          well   as investment incentives by conferring a

windfall gain or loss 0 n domes tic shareholders and chan ging the path of

real wages. When shock s to the prod uction function are sufficently

transient, saving and          i nve stment   Wi 11 move together in the short run.

           The purpose of t his section h as been to provide a single illustra—

tive example, but it i s ci ear that factors other than productivity

shocks can induce a po siti ye conrei ation between savin g and investment

innovations. Suppose, for example, that production req uires as an input

an imported good that is d istinct from t he output of t he domestic firm.

If imports and capital ar e complements i n production, a temporary fall

in the relative price of imports will sp ur investment and also encourage

saving as households spre ad the temporar y increase in their real incomes

over all future pen ods. Temporary chang es in the won d interest rate p

(the intertemporal terms of trade) also cause simultaneous movements in

saving and investment.21



                  V.     A Proble. with National Income Account Data

           Nati onal    income account (NIA) data provide notoriously poor

proxies for th e economic concepts of saving and investment. For example,

purchase-s o consumer durables, which really represent investment, are

treated in the accounts as current consumption. Since national product

figures represent the nominal val ue of goods and                                          ser vi   ces produced by a

countrys factors, as measured by real ned finan cial 11 ows, exchange—

for example, Freedman (1979)3.

          The previous sec tions theo retical model suggests an additional

data problem which is related to those associated with                                               mx ch ange—rate     and

price—level variation. This prob 1mm is most acute for                                              ec ono ohms   in which

a substantial share of domestic industry is forei gn owned, or in which

much of domestic wealt h is held as shares in fore ign firms.                                                   In the

former case, that in whi ch forei gners own domesti c shares, the correla—

higher than that between the tru e value of saving and investaent.

        when h       1,   so that all shares are domestical ly ow ned,the NIA

that corporate sa ving just equals the increase in th e firm s ex—dividend

the larger the share o4 domestic firms owned by foreigners, that is, the

more open is t he economy to foreign portfolio investment. lndeed, in an

integrated wor ld economy with full international portfolio diversifica—

tion, we would ex pect domestic residents to own a negligible share of

the domestic f irm when human—capital risk is approximately uncorrelated

with the fir m s profitability. But if h   0, national income data for

the economy o+ section IV would nonetheless show NIA net saving and

investment as being perfectly correlated precisely when investment is

totally un correlated with the economically relevant measure of saving.

      The prevalence of earnings retention as a means of financing

corporate investment lends empirical significance to this problem.
                                                                     2   But

the magnitude of the errors involved is unknown. Gross capital flows

between countries are very large even though net flows, as measured by

current account imbalances, have been small (see section Ill). So while

the problem may be of minor importance for the U.S., where the ratio of

foreign—owned capital to total capital is low, it may be of greater

importance in other economies. It should also be remembered that in

reality, NIA saving differs from true saving not only because of capital

gains on foreign—owned shares but because of unobserved capital gains on

foreign shares owned by domestic residents. The effect of this addi-

tional discrepancy on the correlation between NIA saving and investment

is theoretically ambiguous.



   VI. Saving and Investment in the Short Run:    Time—Series Evidence

      This section presents estimated correlatio ns between quarterly

changes in saving and investment rates, for seve n UECD countries, over

the period since the restoration o4 currency convertibility in late

1958. Confidence intervals for tnese estimates a re also calculated. Ihe
enpiricJ r&sults are consistent wit h a significant and increasing

decree   o{ capital mobility         over the sample period.

         There   are   at    least four reaso ns why short—run time—series correla—

tion coefficients between changes i n saving and investment rates are of

interest. First, and mo st important ¶         they provide a set of empirical
recularites with whmch theoreti cal open—economy models must be consis—

tent. These empir ical r egularities a iso suggest hypotheses that may

inspire more powe rful t ests in the f uture. Second, estimation of the

coefficients and their asymptotic di stributions permits an assessment of

the significance of the ir difference from the value of 1 that would

scce guidance on the ap propr i ateness of pooling time—series observations

on different cour tries, as in Feldst em          (1983). In fact, the data give a

strong mdi cation           that such pooling is not appropriate. Fourth, even

though (as was sh own in section IV) short—run saving and investment

changes need not be unco rrelated und er perfect capital mobility,

measures of thei r          correl ation are likely to be unaffected by some of the

the forces that        may limi t prot racted current—account imbalances over

longer periods. This is still insufficient to allow rigorous inference

concerning a     countr y' 5     opennes s to capital movements. But once the

saving and in vest me nt rate dat a have been purged of movements caused by

known common     factor s,      such as effective labor—force growth, the iden—

tifying assum pt ions needed to permit such inference become more

plausible. Of     cours e, addition ml tests may ultimately lead to the rejec—
tion of some     or all      of these i dentfying assumptions.

      The results, for the entire sample available since the return to

convertibility, are presented in table 1.

      A pronounced pattern emerges from these estimates. For the smal-

lest countries, Australia and Austria, the contemporaneous correlation

between t(SI6NF) and t(lIGNF) is low. In the case of Austria, r51 is

statistically insignificant. For Canada, Germany, and the United

Kingdom, the correlation coefficients are statistically significant but

lower than the cross—sectional coefficients reported in the Feldstein—

Horioka papers. Dn]y in the cases of Japan and the United States, with

r51 values of 0.846 and 0.908 respectively, are the correlations of the

same order of magnitude as the coefficients estimated by Feldstein and

Horiok'a. Also, it is only in the cases of Japan and the U.S. that the

estimated coefficients do not differ significantly from I, the theoreti-

cal value under complete capital immobility. However, the U.S. is the

largest country in the world economy, while Japan has had extensive

capital—account controls until very recently.

      The results of table 1 therefore suggest that the measured saving—

investment correlation is an increasing function of country size. Except

where capital controls were an important factor, the correlation is low

for small countries, moderate for medium—sized countries, and high for

the largest country. Harberger (1980) and Murphy (1984) have argued that

the link between saving and investment will increase with country size

        These considerations suggest that the                     stochastic propert ies of the

 saving-investment process may have changed over time. To                       inves ti gate

this possibility the samples were split at 1972:IV and the cor rd ati on

coeHiclents were estimated separately over the sub—samples.                           The pr oce—

except that of 4ustralia, r51 drops——sometimes dramatically——be t                       ween    the

earlier and later periods. This evidence is consistent with the

widespread belief that the decree of international capital mobility

increased after 1972:IV. Note that for the second sub—sample
                                                                                    r51 reman-s
more than two standard deviations below I for all countries other than

Japan and the U.S. But once again, the high estimated correlations for

these two countries can be ascribed to capital controls in the Japanese

case and country Size in the U.S. case. Because the estimated correla-

tions are higher before 1973: I and because smaller sample size results

in less precise estimates, r51 lies within two standart errors of 1 more

frequently in the first sub—sample than over the complete sanple.

       One further test can be conducted to help evaluate the argument

that high values of r01 for the United States are a consequence of its

size rather than capital i mmouil i ty. The Uni ted F ingdom occupied a

similarly dominant position in the world economy during the pre—Worid

War I gold-standard era, particularly from 1870 onward, and its ex-

perience then is often cited as the                                    o

as those assumed in the static Heckscher—Ohlin trade model), in which

 the international allocation of a given stock of productie factors can

8. The argument made above to justify ignoring default risk on Eurocur—

rency deposits is inapplicable here because the deposits being compared

are not issued by a single bank. Even when there is no currency                         r i s k

12. Feldstein and Horioka (1980) also present instrumental—variable

estimates based on an explicit model of aggregate saving. They
                                                               regard
those results as supporting the conclusions reached earlier in their

involves some potential specification errors. A number of studies

pursued the a pproach outlined in the text. Penati and Dooley (1984)
                                                                     and
Fieleke (1982                  obtain results consistent with those reported by

Feldstein and Horioka. Capric and Howard (1984) find that the

the development literature att empt to measure the impact of capital

inflow on saving and investment by regressing those variables on the

current account. Leff and Sato (1954) discuss some econometric bi ases

that may arise.



13. Fel dstein and Horioka (1950) recognize the potential importance of

common factors affecting both saving and investment, but assert (p. 319)

that th eir strong results place 'the burden of identifying such common

causal factors' on proponents of the hypothesis that capital is interna

ti onal I y    mobile. The demonstration in this section that equally strong

 results can emerge in a world with perfect capital mobility hopefully

 redi str ibutes the burden more equitably. The empirical relevance of the

 forces driving this sections simulation example is discussed below.

 Summers (1955) points out that least—squares estimates of                               do not

 measure the effect of aggreqate saving on investment when fiscal policy

 systematically counteracts shifts in private spending. The theoretical

 model. I concentrate here (and in the theoretical model of section IV)

 on net saving and investment, rather than on the gross concepts em—

 phasized by Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Feldstein (1983), because

net concepts are the economically meaningful ones. s
                                                     remarked above,
those authors found even higher correlations between saving and invest—

,.ent ratios constructed from net measures. They ascri bed the higher

correlation to a common



lb. 6rowth rates g were taken to be average annual real 6DF growth rates

over 1970—1979, as reported in the United Nations Statistical

book, 1981, table 30. (The GDP growth rate for New Zealand was calcu-

lated from data reported in the International Monetary Funds

tional Financial Statistics.) Labors sharp, 1—e, was calculated as the

ratio of employee compensation to national income in 1970. These data

were taken from OECD, National ccounts of OECD Countries, vol. II,

1974. No attempt was made to correct for the labor income of the self—

employed, so the estimate of 1—u used is an underestimate of labors

17. One alternative explanation involves the economys intertemporal

budget constraint, which states that      current accounts must sum over time
to the change in the economy s n et    external assets. 1+ there is a ten-
dency for the economys external assets to approach some steady—state

level, as a result of residents       consumption preferences [as in Obstfeld
(1981)] or of the pattern of sho cks disturbing the economy, saving and

investment will necessarily tend toward equality over long periods.

Features of the tax system simul taneously affecting saving and invest—

ment    rates could also be   part of an explanation.




18. For example, German ys current account balance in 1982 was DPi 6.6

billion     but it ran a b ilateral current—account surplus of   DPi   14.7

billion against France alone in that year. In all of the three years

1979—19 61, Ger&any ran historically large current—accoun t deficits, yet

it was a net lender to France and other countries. [See Deutsche Eundes—

bank (1 963).] This typ e of current—account behavior is inconsi stent with

the ide a that overall current—account imbalances are lieited by con—

siderat ions of soverei gn—risk exposure. I am indebted to Larry kotlikof+

for thi s observation.



19. Stockean and Svensson (1984) analyc e a stochastic two—country

monetary model in which the investment decision in one of the countries

is explicitly modelled. They also find that saving and investment may be

positively correlated, but the mechani sas operating     in   their model stern

from terms—of—trade effects and are di fferent from the one emphasized

here.
