                                          ABSTRACT

While a large literature is interested in the relationship between family and labor supply
outcomes, little is known about the expectations of these objects at earlier stages. We examine
these expectations, taking advantage of unique data from the Berea Panel Study. In addition to
characterizing expectations, starting during college, the data details outcomes for ten years after
graduation. On average, both male and female college students are well-informed about the future
gender gap in labor supply. Gender differences in beliefs about this future gap are primarily
explained by gender differences in beliefs about how future family outcomes are related to future
labor supply. Methodological contributions come from an approach for addressing measurement
error in survey questions and the recognition that expectations data, along with longitudinal data,
can potentially help address endogeneity issues arising in the estimation of the causal effect of
family on labor supply.

1       Introduction
A large literature has recognized the importance of understanding the determinants of
labor supply, especially for females, with issues related to the family receiving particular
attention (see e.g., Browning, 1992, and Blundell and MaCurdy, 1999, for surveys of early
literature and Blau and Kahn, 2007, for a more recent investigation). The vast majority
of this literature has focused on actual family and labor supply outcomes, while little is
known about the expectations of these objects at earlier stages.1 In this paper, we provide
a study of these expectations by taking advantage of unique data from the Berea Panel
Study, a longitudinal survey that followed students at Berea College closely, starting at
the time their matriculation in 2000. Of particular relevance for this paper, in addition
to detailing labor supply and family outcomes for ten years after college graduation, the
BPS characterized expectations about these outcomes yearly, starting early in college.
    Consistent with the burgeoning literature on the use of expectations data, our inter-
est in characterizing beliefs is driven primarily by the reality that it is beliefs that are
relevant for decision-making (Manski, 2004).2 This implies that a necessary step towards
understanding a particular decision of interest is to obtain a thorough understanding of
the relevant expectations data. This paper strives to provide this type of understanding
by: 1) describing responses to survey questions eliciting the beliefs of college students
about labor supply, 2) examining how these responses are related to beliefs about family
outcomes, both marriage and children, 3) providing evidence about the extent to which
these responses truthfully and accurately reflect actual beliefs about labor supply, and 4)
comparing beliefs to actual post-college outcomes. While it is beyond the scope of this
paper to perform a comprehensive analysis of how these beliefs affect various in-college
and post-college decisions, an analysis of post-college labor supply decisions shows that a
woman's work decision is influenced by both the current presence of young children and
beliefs about the future arrival of children.3
    In Section 3.1, we begin by describing responses to survey questions eliciting beliefs
during college about labor supply over the lifecycle. We next note that these beliefs
will be affected by both beliefs about the timing of future family changes and beliefs
about future labor supply conditional on family outcomes. With respect to the former
    1
     A notable exception is Wiswall and Zafar (2016) who elicit college students' expectations about
various future events, including family and labor supply outcomes. Different from the focus of our
paper, they focus on whether students believe that human capital investment decisions, such as choice
of major, will have an effect on future marital and child outcomes.
   2
     In support of this argument, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2012) finds that a simple theoretical
implication related to college dropout - that the dropout decision should depend on both a student's cu-
mulative GPA and beliefs about future GPA - is satisfied when beliefs are directly elicited through survey
questions, but is not satisfied when beliefs are constructed under a version of Rational Expectations.
   3
     College major represents a prominent example of a decision that may depend on one's beliefs about
future labor supply. There is a growing literature that has recognized the general usefulness of expecta-
tions data for understanding this decision (see, e.g., Zafar, 2013, Wiswall and Zafar, 2014, Stinebrickner
and Stinebrickner, 2014a, Arcidiacono, Hotz and Kang, 2012, and Altonji, Arcidiacono, and Maurel,
2016).



                                                    2
object, we find that women expect to have children somewhat earlier than men. With
respect to the latter object, we find that there exist no gender differences in beliefs about
labor supply under scenarios in which individuals are not married or are married without
children, but that large gender differences in beliefs about labor supply are present under
scenarios that involve the presence of young children. In Section 3.2, we provide a
method to formally assess the relative importance of these objects in determining beliefs
about unconditional future labor supply. We find that a representative female student
would believe that she is 8.52 percentage points less likely than a representative male
student to be working at the age of 28, with 23.5% of this gender difference being due
to gender differences in beliefs about the timing of children and the remaining 76.5% of
this gender difference being due to gender differences in beliefs about how labor supply
will be influenced by scenarios that involve the presence of young children.
    With the interest in expectations data increasing substantially in recent years, the
issue of whether survey questions are able to correctly elicit the actual beliefs of individ-
uals has taken on more importance. Unfortunately, for reasons discussed in Section 3.3,
in practice it is typically difficult to provide direct evidence about the amount and type
of measurement error that exists in survey responses.4 We investigate the importance
of two primary reasons that expectations data may not succeed in characterizing actual
beliefs. The first reason is that some students, or groups of students, may systemati-
cally misreport their beliefs because they have difficulty understanding or interpreting
the types of survey questions that are needed to elicit expectations. We describe the
circumstances under which evidence useful for our goal of making gender comparisons is
obtained from a finding of strong similarities between males' (females') reported beliefs
about spousal labor supply and females' (males') reported beliefs about own labor supply.
The second reason is that, even if students tend to understand survey questions, a lack
of attention/focus when answering surveys may lead to the introduction of random noise
in responses. Our approach for examining the relevance of this concern is motivated by
the method proposed and implemented in Gong, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (forth-
coming). It takes advantage of the fact that the BPS data allow us to characterize the
unconditional probability of working at a particular future time using two different sets
of expectations questions. Intuitively, differences in the unconditional probabilities com-
puted using these two sets of expectations questions are informative about the amount
of measurement error present in the underlying survey questions.
    In Section 4, we examine whether beliefs elicited during school about future labor
supply and family outcomes tend to be accurate by comparing these beliefs to actual
post-college labor supply and family outcomes. We are particularly interested in whether
   4
    Under the assumption that the measurement error present in expectations data is classical, its
magnitude can be estimated if researchers have repeated measurements (e.g., Drerup, Enke and von
Gaudecker, 2014) or if researchers are willing to embed these measurement errors in fully specified struc-
tural models (e.g., Lochner, 2003). For a discussion and analysis of early concerns about expectations
data in a development context, see Delavande, Gine, and Mckenzie (2011).



                                                    3
gender differences in outcomes are consistent with the gender differences in beliefs iden-
tified in Section 3. Motivated by a finding from Section 3 that non-trivial measurement
error is present in responses to survey questions, in Section 4.1 we begin by comparing
the average reported probability of having a particular outcome in the future, which even
in the presence of classical measurement error tends to be a consistent estimator of the
average true perceived probability of having the outcome in the future, to the fraction of
individuals that are observed in the post-college data with that outcome. We find that,
on average, men and women have quite accurate beliefs about labor supply outcomes.
Both males and females tend to be quite optimistic about the timing of children (and
marriage), but, even in this case, gender differences in beliefs about the timing of children
are in line with gender differences in the actual timing of children.
     As noted in Wiswall and Zafar (2016), researchers do not typically have access to both
belief data during school and information about outcomes realized a substantial number
of years later. Without this kind of data, the type of group-level comparison described
above is the obvious, feasible way to assess the accuracy of expectations data (Manski,
2004). However, given our data, it is also possible to examine whether an individual's
perceived probability of a particular outcome is a predictor of his/her actual outcome.
In Section 4.2 we provide evidence that perceived probabilities of outcomes are indeed
predictors of actual outcomes, with the individual-level relationship between perceived
and actual being particularly strong for the family variables.
     Complementing our analysis describing the relationship between perceptions about
future labor supply outcomes and perceptions about future family outcomes, the post-
college portion of the BPS also allows for a more traditional analysis - an examination of
the relationship between actual labor supply and actual family outcomes. We find that,
consistent with what was expected by students when they were in college, females tend to
work much less when they have a young child (while males do not). However, the question
of whether (and to what extent) this relationship can be interpreted as being causal in
nature is complicated by a potential, well-recognized endogeneity problem: women who
have young children at age 28 may differ from those who do not in ways that are related
to their labor supply decisions.
     One conceptually appealing and commonly adopted approach to address the endo-
geneity problem is instrumental variables estimation (Angrist and Evans, 1998, Cruces
and Galiani, 2007, Cristia, 2008, and Lundborg, Plug, and Rasmussen, 2017). However,
given the nature of these IV's, they will not typically be available to researchers using
standard longitudinal data sources. In Section 5, we propose and implement a fixed ef-
fects estimator that takes advantage of the longitudinal nature of the BPS data, along
with expectations data in the BPS. By comparing the change in labor supply across,
for example, two years to the change in the family variable of interest across two years,
the fixed effects estimator "differences out" endogeneity due to permanent differences
in respondents' propensity to work (e.g., due to differences in preferences for leisure or


                                             4
time with children). However, an endogeneity problem would remain if there exists a
correlation between the change in family variables across years and the change in the
unobserved determinants of labor supply across years.
    Annual post-college beliefs about future child outcomes allow us to address the most
salient reason that this type of correlation might exist - that differences in labor supply
in the current period might arise because of differences in beliefs about future child
outcomes, which are likely to be correlated with actual changes in children. As such, this
paper makes an additional methodological contribution by suggesting a seemingly new
use of expectations data - to help address certain types of endogeneity concerns. We find
that women do adjust current labor supply to beliefs about future children, while men
do not. Consistent with previous research using other methods, we find strong evidence
that the actual birth of children has a large negative effect on the labor supply of college
educated women, but not men.5


2       Berea Panel Study
The Berea Panel Study (BPS) is a longitudinal survey that was initiated by Todd and
Ralph Stinebrickner to provide detailed information about the college and early post-
college periods. Of particular importance here, the BPS was, to the best of our knowl-
edge, the first longitudinal, general interest survey motivated by an explicit objective of
exploring the potential promise of expectations data. Influenced by the early method-
ological work of, for example, Juster (1966), Dominitz (1998), and Dominitz and Manski
(1996, 1997), the first BPS pilot took place in 1998.
    Full cohorts of students who entered Berea College in the fall of 2000 and the fall of
2001 were surveyed approximately twelve times each year in college. In terms of the in-
school data, we primarily take advantage of expectations data that were collected at the
halfway point of college - the beginning of the third year.6 The details of these questions,
which appear in Appendix A, will be discussed as they are encountered throughout
the paper, but, briefly, the spirit of these questions is to allow individuals to express
uncertainty about a labor market or family outcome (marriage or children) that may
occur in the future.
    5
     The negative effect of young children on labor supply for highly educated/skilled females has been
consistently documented in a large literature (see, for example, Silles, 2016 and Aaronson, et al., 2017).
In contrast, using PSID data, Lundberg and Rose (2002) find that males may adjust their hours upwards
in response to the birth of a child.
   6
     We choose to use expectations about future labor supply from the beginning of the third year because
this is the first point in college when these expectations were collected for both of the BPS cohorts.
Taking advantage of the fact that the 2001 cohort also answered these questions in their sophomore
year, we find in Appendix B (Table 10 to Table 17) that, on average, perceptions are similar in the
second and third years. Examining perceptions in the third year is also useful for making in-school and
post-college samples comparable. Our post-college data collection efforts focused primarily on students
who graduated from college, and the large majority of dropout occurs before the start of the third year
(Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2014b).



                                                    5
    Graduates from the BPS were surveyed annually for approximately ten years after
graduation. We take advantage of detailed information that was collected about labor
market and family outcomes (marriage and children). The BPS post-college surveys also
continued to recognize the usefulness of expectations data. Here we take advantage of
beliefs about future family changes.
    Berea College, which is located in central Kentucky, is unique in certain ways that
have been explored in previous work using the BPS. For example, Berea has a focus on
providing educational opportunities for students from low income backgrounds. As part
of this mission Berea provides a full tuition subsidy to all students (Stinebrickner and
Stinebrickner, 2003a), which is made possible, in part, by all students participating in a
work-study program (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2003b). As always, it is necessary
to be appropriately cautious about the exact extent to which the results from our case
study would generalize to other demographic groups or to other specific institutions.
However, important for the notion that the basic lessons from our work are pertinent for
thinking about what takes place elsewhere, Berea operates under a standard liberal arts
curriculum, and the students at Berea are similar in terms of college entrance exams to
students at the surrounding flagship state universities (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner,
2008).7 In addition, in earlier work we found that schooling and post-schooling outcomes
at Berea look generally similar to decisions made elsewhere. For example, dropout rates
are similar to those at the University of Kentucky (for students from similar income
backgrounds), patterns of major choice and major-switching at Berea are similar in spirit
to those found in the NLSY by Arcidiacono (2004), and average wages in the early part
of the lifecycle are similar to those seen for students of similar age in the NLSY-97
(Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2008, 2012, 2014a, 2014b).


3       Beliefs about Labor Supply and Family Outcomes
This section characterizes beliefs about future labor supply. In Section 3.1, we begin by
characterizing male and female beliefs about labor supply over the lifecycle unconditional
on family outcomes. We note that these "unconditional beliefs" will be affected by both
beliefs about the timing of future family changes and beliefs about future labor supply
conditional on family outcomes. As such, in the latter portion of Section 3.1 we describe
male and female beliefs about these objects, and in Section 3.2 we provide a method
    7
     The average score on the combined American College Test (ACT) is 23.2 for the full BPS sample.
This average is somewhat higher than the average ACT score, 22.0, of students in the NELS-88 who
attended four-year colleges nationally (National Center for Education Statistics, 98-105). ACT scores
of Berea students are also very similar to students who attend the closest two flagship universities in
the region. The 25th percentile of ACT scores in the BPS sample is 21 at Berea, and was also 21 at
The University of Kentucky and The University of Tennessee at the time. The 75th percentile of ACT
scores in the BPS sample is 25 at Berea College, and was 26 at The University of Kentucky and The
University of Tennessee at the time. Not surprisingly, these comparisons become slightly more favorable
for students at Berea if we condition on students in the NELS-88 or students at the regional universities
who come from similar family income backgrounds.

to formally assess the relative importance of these objects in determining beliefs about
unconditional future labor supply. Section 3.3 explores issues related to measurement
error in elicited beliefs.


3.1    Descriptive Statistics
Our analysis focuses on beliefs collected at the halfway point of college, the beginning
of the junior year. Taking advantage of Survey Question A (Appendix A), Table 1
reports beliefs about labor supply at three different future ages. We note in advance
that, while the BPS expectations questions elicit perceptions about the percent chance
that a particular outcome will occur, for reasons of expositional ease we often refer to
the elicited information as a perceived probability. This slight abuse of language implies
that our perceived "probabilities" take on values of 0 to 100 (rather than 0 to 1).
    Panel A indicates that, for the full sample of 418 students, beliefs exhibit a substantial
lifecycle pattern. Perhaps most notably, the first row of Panel A shows that, on average,
the perceived probability of working full-time increases from 62.0% at the age of 23 to
72.1% at the age of 28 to 79.6% at the age of 38, with this lifecycle increase being
consistent with workers facing more job insecurity and having a stronger incentive to
experiment by changing jobs early in careers (Topel and Ward, 1992 and Gervais, et
al., 2016). The middle row of Panel A shows that the lifecycle increases in the average
perceived probability of working full-time are accompanied by lifecycle decreases in the
average perceived probability of working part-time. Combining the full-time and part-
time results, the last row of Panel A shows that the average perceived probability of not
working at all decreases somewhat over the lifecycle, from 7.6% to 5.7%.
    We are particularly interested in whether, and how, beliefs differ by gender. The first
column of Panel B and Panel C shows that beliefs about labor supply at the age of 23 are
strikingly similar for males and females. The average perceived probability of working
full-time is 62.3% for males and 61.8% for females, and the average perceived probability
of not working at all is 7.7% for males and 7.5% for females. However, column 2 shows
that students anticipate that substantial gender differences in labor supply will emerge by
the age of 28. The average perceived probability of working full-time increases by 19.3%
(to 81.6%) for males between the ages of 23 and 28 but by only 4.8% (to 66.6%) for
females, and the average perceived probability of not working at all decreases by 4.05%
(to 3.7%) for males between the ages of 23 and 28 but increases by 1.31% (to 8.8%)
for females. Comparing column 2 to column 3 reveals that students do not anticipate
that further gender differences in labor supply will emerge between the ages of 28 and
38; gender differences in the average perceived probability of working full-time and the
average perceived probability of not working at all are actually slightly smaller for the
age of 38 than for the age of 28.
    Thus, Table 1 shows that there do not exist gender differences in perceptions about

labor supply at the age of 23, and gender differences in perceptions about how labor
supply will change over time are isolated to the period between the age of 23 and the age
of 28. This suggests that family factors, which may be expected to change between these
ages, may play a central role in determining the gender differences in perceptions about
labor supply at the age of 28. From the standpoint of understanding this role, the first
important question is whether females do indeed tend to believe that important family
changes will take place at or before age 28. If so, gender differences in perceptions about
labor supply at age 28 could arise from two alternative family-related explanations: 1)
males tend to believe that family changes will tend to occur later for them or 2) there
exist gender differences in perceptions about the relationship between family changes and
labor supply.
    To examine the first question of whether females tend to believe that important family
changes will take place at or before age 28, we take advantage of Question B, which elicits
the probability that an individual's first child will be born at various ages, and Question
C, which elicits the probability that an individual will be married at various ages. The
third column of the Marriage panel of Table 2 indicates that women in our sample tend
to believe that marriage will take place relatively early; on average, female respondents
believe there is only a 16.5% chance of either never being married or being married after
age 30 (7.7% never married, 8.8% after age 30). Similarly, the third column of the First


                                            8
Child panel of Table 2 indicates that women in our sample tend to believe that they will
have children at a relatively early age; on average, female respondents believe there is
only a 23.1% chance of either never having children or having a first child born after age
30 (11.0% never children, 12.1% first child after age 30).

    Turning to the first alternative explanation above for how gender differences in per-
ceptions about labor supply at age 28 could arise, Table 2 provides evidence that males
do indeed tend to believe that family changes will occur somewhat later for them. On
average, male respondents believe that there is a 23.9% chance of either never being
married or being married after age 30 (11.2% never married, 12.7% after age 30), and a
test of the null hypothesis that the average perception of this probability for males is less
than or equal to that for females is rejected at all traditional levels (t-statistic= 3.19).
Similarly, on average, male respondents believe that there is a 34.0% chance of either
never having children or having a first child born after age 30 (14.0% never children,
20.1% first child after age 30), and a test of the null hypothesis that the average percep-
tion of this probability for males is less than or equal to that for females is also rejected
at all traditional levels (t-statistic= 4.22).
    While these gender differences in perceptions about the timing of marriage and chil-
dren are quantitatively and statistically significant, a back-of-the-envelope calculation
suggests that they are probably not, by themselves, large enough to account for the gen-
der differences in beliefs about labor supply at age 28 that were seen in Panels B and

C of Table 1 (middle column).8 To examine the relevance of the second alternative ex-
planation above for how gender differences in perceptions about labor supply could arise
at age 28 - that there exist gender differences in perceptions about the relationship be-
tween family changes and labor supply - we take advantage of Survey Question D, which
elicited perceptions about the probabilities of working full-time, working part-time, and
not working at age 28 under the scenarios in which an individual is not married, mar-
ried without a child, married with a youngest child between zero and two years old, and
married with a youngest child between three and five years old.

   Turning our attention first to the role of marriage, the first column of Table 3 shows
that perceptions about labor supply at the age of 28 are very similar for men and women
under the unmarried scenario. For example, for women, the sample average perceived
probability of working full-time, 87.4%, is actually slightly higher than the corresponding
   8
    For example, as reported in Table 2, the average perceived probability of having a first child before
age 28 is about 10 percentage points smaller for males than for females. If males and females have
the same perceptions about the how family changes will influence labor supply, then, even in the most
extreme scenario where having a first child before age 28 leads to a 100 percentage points decrease in the
probability of working full-time, this ten percentage point difference in beliefs about having a first child
before age 28 would only produce a 10 percentage point difference in perceptions about the probability
of working full-time at age 28. As shown in Table 1, this is less than the observed perceived difference
of 15 percentage points.


                                                    10
sample average perceived probability for men, 82.2%. Further, comparing the results in
the first column to the Married-No-Kids results in the second column, we see that both
males and females believe that, when no kids are present, marriage will have virtually
no relationship with the probability of working full-time or not working at all (or work-
ing part-time). Thus, our results strongly indicate that individuals do not believe that
marriage per se will contribute to gender differences in labor supply.
    However, perceptions about labor supply change dramatically when respondents are
asked to consider the presence of a child. For example, looking across the first row of Table
3, the third column shows that, for the full sample, the average perceived probability of
full-time work decreases from 83.7% to 60.0% when an individual has a child between
the ages of zero and two at age 28 and the fourth column shows that, for the full sample,
the average perceived probability of full-time work decreases from 83.7% to 67.3% when
an individual has a child between the ages of three and five at age 28. Of particular note,
this change arises almost entirely because of the perceived relationship between children
and labor supply for women. The second, third, and fourth columns of Panel B show
that males believe children will have virtually no relationship with their labor supply. In
contrast, the second, third, and fourth columns of Panel C reveal that females believe
that there is a strong negative relationship between the presence of a young child and
labor supply. Specifically, a comparison of the second and third columns show that the
average perceived probability of full-time work for females decreases from 84.0% to 47.7%
when a female has a child between the ages of zero and two at age 28, and a comparison
of the second and fourth columns show that the average perceived probability of full-time
work for females decreases from 84.0% to 58.0% when an individual has a child between
the ages of three and five at age 28.
    Our survey questions also elicited perceptions about the probability of a future spouse
working full-time, working part-time, and not working at age 28 under the scenarios in
which he/she is married without a child, married with a child between zero and two
years old, and married with a child between three and five years old. Comparing the
Spousal - Married columns in Panel C to the Own -Married columns in Panel B reveals
that females' beliefs about spousal labor supply are strikingly similar to males' beliefs
about their own labor supply, which, as described earlier, indicate that males anticipate
being highly likely to work under any family situation. For example, on average, females
believe that their spouses have an 80.5% chance of working full-time when they have
a child less than or equal to two years old, while, on average, males believe that they
have an 81.3% chance of working full-time under this scenario. Similarly, comparing the
Spousal - Married columns in Panel B to the Own - Married columns in Panel C shows
that there are strong similarities between males' beliefs about spousal labor supply and
females' beliefs about own labor supply, which, as described earlier, indicate that females
anticipate being much less likely to work when they have young children. For example,
on average, males believe that their spouses have a 46.8% chance of working full-time


                                             11
when they have a child two years old or younger, while, on average, females believe that
they have a 47.7% chance of working full-time under this scenario. In addition to being
of substantive relevance to a large literature interested in the joint nature of labor supply
(see, e.g., Lundberg, 1988, Chiappori 1992, Chiappori and Donni, 2011, and Erosa et
al., 2017), these findings of a strong agreement between the beliefs of males and females
has important implications for considering the ability of expectations data to accurately
measure beliefs. We discuss this issue more closely in Section 3.3.1.


3.2     An Alternative Approach for Characterizing the Beliefs
        about Future Labor Supply
The middle column of Table 1 shows beliefs about labor supply at age 28 elicited directly
using survey Question A.2 in Appendix A. In Section 3.2.1, we develop an "alternative"
method to compute these beliefs, taking advantage of BPS information characterizing
beliefs about labor supply under various family scenarios and BPS information allowing
the characterization of beliefs about the probability of these scenarios occurring. We
have two primary motivations for developing this method. As discussed in Section 3.2.2,
the first primary motivation is that it allows us to quantify the individual contributions
of the two alternative family-related explanations for gender differences in beliefs about
labor supply that were raised in Section 3.1: 1) relative to males, females tend to believe
that family changes will occur earlier and 2) relative to males, females tend to believe
that they are less likely to work when family changes occur. As discussed in Section 3.3.2,
a second motivation is that differences between beliefs constructed under this alternative
method and the directly elicited beliefs in Table 1 are informative about the magnitude
of measurement error that might be present in the expectations data.

3.2.1   An Alternative Method for Computing Beliefs about Labor Supply

We let Pij denote student i's perception at the halfway mark of college about the proba-
bility of having work status j at age 28, where j = F , P , and N correspond to "Full-time
Work", "Part-time Work," and "Not Working," respectively. Our alternative method for
computing Pij notes that Pij can be written as a function of beliefs about future fam-
ily outcomes and beliefs about future work status j conditional on these outcomes, and
takes advantage of BPS data of relevance for characterizing these beliefs. Given strong
evidence in Section 3.1 that the labor supply perceptions of individuals are not influenced
by marriage per se, we focus on children as the family outcome of interest. Recognizing
that the influence of children on labor supply may depend on the age of the children, we
characterize a person's children situation using the age of the person's youngest child.
Denoting the age of the youngest child of person i at age 28 as ai , where ai = 0 if i does
not have a child, and letting Ai represent the random variable describing i's subjective
beliefs at the beginning of the junior year about ai , Pij is given by:

                                             12
                          Pij =    (Pij |Ai = ai )dFAi (ai ), j  {F, P, N },                        (1)

where FAi (ai ) and Pij |Ai = ai , respectively, denote the cdf of Ai and student i's perception
at the beginning of the junior year about the probability of work status j given that the
realization of Ai is ai , respectively.
    Given FAi (ai ) and Pij |Ai = ai it is straightforward to approximate the integral using,
for example, standard simulation methods.9 What is necessary is to describe how we
characterize FAi (ai ) and Pij |Ai = ai given the unique expectations data available in the
BPS.
    Beginning with the characterization of Pij |Ai = ai , as discussed in Section 3.1, survey
Question D (Appendix A) provides the relevant BPS information. The question elicits
the perceived conditional probability of having work status j at age 28 given a particular
family scenario. The set of scenarios includes being not married, married without a child,
married with a child between the ages of 0 and 2, and married with a child between the
ages of 3 and 5, and we denote the conditional probabilities associated with these scenarios
as Pij,N M , Pij,N K , Pij,02 , Pij,35 , respectively.
    What is needed is to characterize Pij |Ai = ai for all possible realizations ai . We start
by characterizing this conditional probability for realizations of Ai at the extremes. In
practice, a person could have zero kids (Ai = 0) if either he/she is unmarried or is married
but has no children.10 Given our earlier finding that perceptions about labor supply are
virtually identical for these two scenarios, we approximate Pij |Ai = 0 by the average of
Pij,N M and Pij,N K . We denote this average Pij,N . Considering the other extreme, because
it has been widely recognized that the effect of children on labor supply tends to decrease
substantially when children attend school, we assume that children equal to or older than
6 years old do not affect labor supply. That is, (Pij |Ai  6) = (Pij |Ai = 0) = Pij,N .11
    For characterizing the conditional probability Pij |Ai = ai for values of ai that cor-
respond to having a young child, the relevant observed information is: Pij,02 and Pij,35 .
The former represents the expected value of Pij |Ai = ai over the child ages in the set
(0, 3). The latter represents the expected value of Pij |Ai = ai over the child ages in the
set [3, 6). Then, under the simplifying assumption that Pij |Ai = ai is constant over (0, 3)
and is constant over [3, 6), the perceived unconditional probability of work status j , Pij ,
is given by:
   9
     E.g., this integral can be approximated by computing the average value of Pij |Ai = ai for large
number of random realizations ai drawn from the distribution of Ai .
  10
     We find that only 6.2 percent of respondents in our sample have children outside of marriage at age
28.
  11
     For example, consistent with this assumption, Blau and Winkler (2018) document that, in year 2015,
the labor participation rate of women with children under age 6 is roughly 10 percentage points lower
than that of women with children between the ages of 6 and 17.

[3, 6)).
     In terms of characterizing FAi (ai ), if we were to assume that each student expects to
have at most one child, the distribution of Ai would come directly from a student's beliefs
about the age of having the first child reported in Section 3.1. Relaxing this assumption
requires that we take into consideration each person's beliefs about the age of having a
second child or subsequent children. While it was not feasible for the BPS to collect this
additional information directly, our approach can take advantage of survey question E,
which elicited beliefs about the total number of children a person will have in his/her
lifetime. Table 4 summarizes responses to this survey question. Both male and female
students believe that, on average, they have more than a 60% chance of having more than
one child in their lifetime. Comparing the second column to the third column shows that,
relative to men, women believe they are more likely to have two or more children and
less likely to have only one child or no child at all.

   Formally, let gi,q denote student i's age when the q th child is born, and Gi,q denote
the random variable describing student i's beliefs about gi,q at the beginning of the junior
year. As discussed earlier, Gi,1 can be directly elicited from survey Question B. To take
advantage of survey Question E to estimate Gi,q , for q  2, we begin by assuming that
                                                 5
student i believes that, net of the 10 months ( 6   year) necessary for pregnancy, the age
gap between having two consecutive children follows an exponential distribution with
mean µi,q . Formally, we have:


                                              14
                                              5
                                    Gi,q+1 - Gi,q -
                                                 Exp(µi,q+1 ).                             (3)
                                              6
     We assume that students believe they will have no more than four children, and that
children will not be born after age 40.12 The value of µi,q can be computed from student
i's beliefs about the number of children he/she will have and information on Gi,1 . Our
approach is detailed in Appendix C. In terms of the intuition underlying the approach,
if student i believes, for example, that he/she will have the first child relatively early but
that he/she is not likely to have more than one child, the value of µi,2 would have to
be high so that the second child is unlikely to arrive before the age of 40. Similarly, if
student i believes that he/she will have the first child relatively late but still expects to
have more than one child with high probability, the value of µi,2 would have to be small.
The same intuition can be applied to the computation of µi,3 and µi,4 .
     We compute Pij using Equation (2). With the distributions of Gi,1 and Gi,q+1 - Gi,q ,
q = 1, 2, 3, computed using the method described above, we employ a simulation-based
method to approximate the terms involving Ai in Equation (2). Specifically, for each
student, we simulate his/her fertility history a large number of times and use these
simulated histories to approximate the perceived probability of having the youngest child
in given age ranges at age 28.

3.2.2       Decomposing the Gender Difference in Beliefs about Labor Supply

Table 1 showed that, relative to males, females believe they are less likely to be working
full-time at age 28 and more likely to not be working at all at age 28. The descriptive
statistics in Section 3.1 indicated that two child-related explanations are likely relevant
for understanding this gender difference: 1) females believe they are more likely to have a
young child at age 28 and 2) females believe they are less likely to work when they have a
young child. Here we perform a decomposition, which takes advantage of the method we
developed in Section 3.2.1 to quantify the relative importance of these two explanations.
    For ease of illustration and for reasons related to measurement error discussed later
in Section 3.3.2, we focus on a representative male student (i = M ) and a representative
female student (i = F ). The beliefs of a representative student about a particular object
of interest are found by averaging the beliefs of all students of the same gender about
that object.
    We first use Equation (2) to compute beliefs of the two representative students i =
M, F about unconditional labor supply, Pij , for j = F, P, N . This computation requires
beliefs about conditional labor supply, Pij,N , Pij,02 , and Pij,35 , and beliefs about the age
of the youngest child at age 28, Ai . Beliefs about conditional labor supply for the
representative students are given by the averages in Panel B and Panel C of Table 3.
Beliefs about the age of the youngest child at age 28 can be computed using the method
  12
       Using 35 or 45 instead yields very similar results.


                                                      15
described in the latter part of Section 3.2.1, which utilizes information in Table 2 and
Table 4. We find that the representative male student believes that, at age 28, he has
37.46% chance of having a youngest child between the ages of 0 and 2 (AM  (0, 3)),
a 10.56% chance of having a youngest child between the ages of 3 and 5 (AM  [3, 6)),
and a 51.98% chance of either not having a child (AM = 0) or having a youngest child of
age 6 or older (AM  (6, )). Similarly, we find that the representative female student
believes that, at age 28, she has a 45.25% chance of having a youngest child between the
ages of 0 and 2 (AF  (0, 3)), a 15.27% chance of having a youngest child between the
ages of 3 and 5 (AF  [3, 6)), and a 39.48% chance of either not having a child (AF = 0)
or having a youngest child of age 6 or older (AF  (6, )).
    The results of our computation using Equation (2) show that the (subjective) prob-
abilities of working full-time, working part-time, and not working at age 28 for the
representative male student are 82.02%, 14.44%, and 3.54%, respectively, while these
probabilities for the representative female student are 64.96%, 22.28%, and 12.76%, re-
spectively. Overall, these numbers are quite similar to the average directly elicited (sub-
jective) probabilities of working full-time, working part-time, and not working for males
and females seen in the second column of Panel B and Panel C of Table 1. Then, the
numbers show that the computation method is capable of producing the large gender
difference in beliefs about unconditional labor supply at age 28 that is observed in the
directly elicited expectations data.
    The numbers in the previous paragraph indicate that the representative female stu-
dent believes she is 17.1% less likely (than a representative male student) to be working
full-time at the age of 28. When we recompute the probability of working full-time for
the representative female after replacing her beliefs about the age of the youngest child
at age 28, AF , by the beliefs of the male student, AM , the gender difference is reduced
to 12.6%. Thus, gender differences in beliefs about the timing of children can explain
roughly 26% of the gender difference in beliefs about the probability of working at age
28. The remaining 74% is explained by gender differences in beliefs about working for
the different possible child scenarios. We find similar results when we decompose gender
differences in the probability of not working at all; gender differences in beliefs about
the timing of family outcomes can explain roughly 24% of the gender difference of 9.2%
in beliefs about the probability of not working at all at age 28, with the remaining 76%
explained by gender differences in beliefs about working for the different possible child
scenarios.


3.3    Measurement Issues
With the interest in expectations data increasing substantially in recent years, the issue
of whether survey questions are able to correctly elicit the actual beliefs of individuals
has taken on more importance. Unfortunately, in practice, it is difficult to provide


                                            16
direct evidence about the amount and type of measurement error that exists in survey
responses. It may be possible to examine whether beliefs are "accurate" by comparing
the beliefs of a group of respondents to, for example, the future outcomes of this group
or of a group assumed to come from the same population. However, a fundamental
difficulty arises when trying to ascertain the amount and type of measurement error
from this comparison because differences between beliefs and outcomes could arise not
only if expectations data do not succeed in characterizing actual beliefs, but also if actual
beliefs tend to be incorrect/biased.13 The latter possibility can certainly not be dismissed
because it represents a primary motivation for directly eliciting expectations.
     To consider how measurement issues may affect the type of data we use here, it is
worth describing the underlying reasons that expectations data may not fully succeed
in characterizing actual beliefs. One prominent reason is that some students may have
difficulty understanding or interpreting the types of survey questions that are needed to
elicit expectations. This can be viewed as a situation where respondents, in effect, report
beliefs about some object other than what is of interest to the survey designer. In the
context of the survey questions we use here, this would imply that, for a particular labor
supply outcome, the average reported perceived probability would be a biased estimator
of the average actual perceived probability. In Section 3.3.1, we describe how our survey
questions eliciting beliefs about future spousal labor supply (under particular family
scenarios) provide some evidence about the relevance of this concern.
     A second prominent reason is that, even if students tend to understand survey ques-
tions, a lack of attention/focus when answering surveys may lead to the introduction of
random noise in responses. In this case, standard results related to classical measurement
error would apply; while the average reported perceived probability would be an unbiased
estimator of the average true perceived probability, attenuation bias would be relevant
when individual-level reports are included as independent variables in a regression frame-
work. In Section 3.3.2 we detail how we are able to address this type of measurement
error issue directly, by taking advantage of the fact that the BPS contains two different
sets of survey questions that can be used to compute the same object of interest - the
unconditional probability of working at a particular future age.

3.3.1    Difficulty Understanding/Interpreting Survey Questions

In this section, we discuss the first reason for the presence of measurement error - that
respondents may have difficulty understanding/interpreting survey questions. Our inter-
est in making male-female comparisons suggests that perhaps the most salient concern
of this type in our context is that males and females might understand/interpret survey
questions differently. This could be a problem if, for example, one's ability to understand
survey questions is related to his/her academic ability/achievement because females in
  13
     Differences could also arise because realizations of aggregate shocks are important for determining
outcomes (but tend to be "integrated out" when forming beliefs).


                                                  17
our sample have better high school and college grades (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner,
2012). Survey questions about spousal labor supply provide a unique opportunity to pro-
vide some evidence about this issue. Roughly speaking, under the assumption that men
expect to marry women that are similar to the women in our sample and the assumption
that the true perceptions of males about spousal labor supply tend to line up with the
true perceptions of females about own labor supply, evidence that males and females
interpret questions similarly comes from our earlier finding of strong similarities between
males' reported beliefs about spousal labor supply and females' reported beliefs about
own labor supply. Similarly, under the assumption that women expect to marry men
that are similar to the men in our sample and the assumption that the true perceptions
of females about spousal labor supply tend to line up with the true perceptions of males
about own labor supply, further evidence that males and females interpret questions sim-
ilarly comes from our earlier finding of strong similarities between females' beliefs about
spousal labor supply and males' beliefs about own labor supply. Given this evidence,
in the remainder of the paper we join virtually all other research in the expectations
literature by assuming that individuals are able to understand survey questions. That
is, we assume that the sample average reported perceived probability associated with a
particular labor supply outcome is a consistent estimator of the sample average actual
perceived probability.

3.3.2   Classical Measurement Error

In this section, we consider the second potential reason for the presence of measurement
error - that responses to survey questions may contain classical measurement error. Table
1 showed that there is substantial cross-sectional variation (measured by the standard
deviations in the parenthesis) in the reported probabilities of working at age 28. To
provide some quantitative evidence about the contribution of measurement error and
true heterogeneity to this variation, we take advantage of the fact that the BPS makes it
possible to obtain student i's perceived probability of having work status j at age 28, Pij ,
in two distinct ways. We refer to the perceived probability elicited directly using survey
Question A.2 in Appendix A as P   ~ j . We refer to the perceived probability computed using
                                   i
the alternative method detailed in Section 3.2.1 as P      ^ j . The intuition underlying our
                                                            i
method for estimating the magnitude of measurement error is that the two probabilities
will be identical if the responses to the survey questions used to compute these values
are not affected by measurement error. However, when the two values are different,
measurement error is present and its importance can be quantified if one specifies the
manner in which measurement error influences responses to the survey questions.
    Formally, we write the directly elicited probability as:

                               ~ j = P j +  j , j  {F, P, N },
                               P                                                         (4)
                                 i    i    i




                                             18
where ij is the classical measurement error attached to the true value Pij . We allow ij
to be correlated across j . Since the sum of the probabilities P~ j over j and the sum of P j
                                                                 i                          i
over j are each equal to one, the sum of ij over j is equal to zero.
    We are interested in characterizing the variance in the true value, Pij , across students
because this variance represents a measure of how much heterogeneity exists in actual
beliefs. Taking the variance of both sides of Equation (4) we see that dispersion in the
                ~ j , across students originates from both variation in the true value across
reported value, P i
students and randomness caused by measurement error, ij :

                           ~ j ) = var(P j ) + var( j ), j  {F, P, N }.
                       var(P                                                             (5)
                             i          i          i

A simple rearrangement of Equation (5) reveals that the object of interest, var(Pij ), can
be obtained by subtracting the variance of the measurement error term, var(ij ), from the
directly-observable variance of the reported probabilities, var(P~ j ). Thus, the remainder
                                                                  i
                                                       j
of this section focuses on estimating the variance of i .
    Section 3.2.1 discusses how the computed probability P   ^ j can be obtained from re-
                                                              i
sponses to questions eliciting beliefs about labor supply at age 28 conditional on having
various family outcomes (Question D), as well as questions eliciting beliefs about family
outcomes (Questions B, C and E). Similar to the assumption made in Equation (4), we
assume that measurement error influences the responses to the former types of questions
in a classical manner, that is,

                         ~ j,k = P j,k +  j,k ,
                         P                              k  {N, 02, 35},                  (6)
                           i      i      i

where P ~ j,k is the reported value of P j,k , the actual perceived conditional probability
         i                              i
of working given family outcome k  {N, 02, 35}, and ij,k , k  {N, 02, 35}, are the
corresponding classical measurement errors.
     Taking into account that the reports of the actual perceived conditional probabilities
  j,k
Pi may be noisy and are given by P      ~ j,k , the probability P
                                                                ^ j can be computed using
                                          i                       i
Equation (2):


                       ^j =
                       P                    A,k ~ j,k

                                            A,k j,k                  A,k j,k
                           =                i  Pi +                  i  i
                               k{N,02,35}               k{N,02,35}

                           = Pij +                A,k j,k
                                                  i  i , j  {F, P, N }.                  (7)

                                                                             A,k
Here, we assume that no error is introduced during the computation of i          . When
using a similar approach, Gong, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (forthcoming) show that
relaxing this assumption and specific other assumptions that were needed in Section 3.2.1


                                                  19
to arrive at Equation (2) will lead to a smaller estimate for the magnitude of measurement
error.
    The intuition underlying identification is that the difference between P   ~ j and P
                                                                                       ^ j is
                                                                                i        i
informative about the amount of measurement error. Taking this difference,

                        ~j - P
                        P    ^j =  j -                   A,k j,k
                                                         i  i , j  {F, P, N }.                         (8)

                                           k{N,02,35}

   Using equation (8) to estimate var(ij ) requires assumptions about the joint distri-
bution of ij , ij,N , ij,02 and ij,35 . The prior assumption that ij and ij,k , k  {N, 02, 35},
represent classical measurement error implies that they have mean zero and are indepen-
dent of other factors. In addition, we assume that the four measurement error terms are
independent and identically distributed.
   Under these assumptions, as shown in Appendix D,

                                                            ^j )

a straightforward manner from the data.14 Hence, var(ij ) (std(ij )), and, therefore,
var(Pij ), can be estimated.
    Table 5 reports estimates for the standard deviation of the reported probability,
std(P ~ j ), the standard deviation of measurement error, std( j ), and the standard de-
       i                                                         i
viation of the actual perceived probability, std(Pi ). We allow the distribution of ij to
                                                     j

vary by gender. Comparing the second column to the third column reveals that responses
to survey questions indeed contain a non-negligible amount of measurement error; the
magnitude of measurement error is comparable to the magnitude of heterogeneity for
females and is roughly 50% of the magnitude of heterogeneity for males. Comparing
Panel A to Panel B, we find that, while the magnitude of heterogeneity in reported be-
liefs about labor supply for females is substantially larger than that for males, female
students' responses to survey questions contain more measurement error as well.15 As
a result, the third column shows that the magnitude of heterogeneity in actual beliefs
about labor supply is somewhat similar between males and females.

                                                     ^ j ) involves finding the difference between P~ j and

and then taking the sample average of (i ) .
  15
     Conceptually, when reporting the probability of having work status j, students need to take their
beliefs about all factors that influence labor supply into consideration. Misperceptions about labor
supply arise because of misperceptions about these factors. Then, the observed gender difference in
measurement error would be consistent with a traditional view that women have more factors that
influence whether they work, while men tend to think they will most likely work "no matter what."

4     Actual Labor Supply and Family Outcomes at Age
      28 and Comparison with Beliefs
Because individual decisions are based on beliefs at the time of decision-making, whether
beliefs tend to be accurate is of importance for a variety of policy reasons. Using annual
post-college surveys, the BPS collected outcomes related to labor supply and family for
roughly ten years after graduation, past the age of 30. In examining the accuracy of
beliefs elicited during school, we are particularly interested in whether gender differences
in outcomes are consistent with the gender differences in beliefs uncovered in Section 3.
Evidence in Section 3.3.2 indicates that non-trivial classical measurement error may be
present in responses to our survey questions. This serves as a partial motivation for our
comparison, in Section 4.1, of the average reported probability of having a particular
outcome, which even in the presence of classical measurement error tends to be a consis-
tent estimator of the average true perceived probability of the outcome, to the fraction
of individuals that have that outcome. In Section 4.2, we note the additional benefits of
examining whether individual-level perceptions are strong predictors of individual-level
outcomes, and take advantage of the fact that the BPS is relatively rare in allowing this
type of examination.


4.1    Average Beliefs and Outcomes
Our in-school survey elicited beliefs about labor supply, marriage, and children at the age
of 28 (among other ages). Our annual post-college survey allows us to characterize actual
labor supply, marriage, and children outcomes at this same age. In terms of characterizing
labor supply outcomes, students report whether they are currently working (Question G


                                            21
in Appendix A) and the number of hours they work (Question H). We assume that a
student is working full-time if he/she is currently working 35 or more hours per week,
and is working part-time if he/she is working less than 35 hours per week. Marital status
comes directly from Question I. The age of a respondent's youngest child comes from
questions asking whether a respondent currently has at least one child, and if so, the
age at which the youngest child was born (Question J). While in earlier sections we
distinguish between children who are between 0 and 2 years of age and children who
are between 3 and 5 years of age, in this section, for reasons related to sample size, we
combine these categories.
    As seen in Table 1, 418 (153 male, 265 female) students answered the labor supply,
marriage, and children expectations questions that we utilize from the halfway point of
college. The first column of Table 6 shows the average perceived probabilities associated
with a variety of outcomes for this sample. This information is generated using the
same survey questions as in Section 3, with, in some cases, the information in Table
6 being repeated from earlier tables to ease comparisons. 460 respondents (158 male,
302 female) answered the labor supply, marriage and children questions characterizing
their outcomes at age 28.16 The second column of Table 6 shows the actual fraction of
this sample that has each particular outcome. To explore the potential concern that the
samples in Column 1 and 2 might not be entirely comparable due to selection issues,
Columns 3 and 4 repeat Columns 1 and 2 for the 317 individuals that appear in both
of the samples. A comparison of the first column with the third column shows that the
sample average perceived probabilities are almost identical in the two samples, and for
none of the outcomes is it possible to reject at a 5% level the null hypothesis that the
average perceived probabilities are the same for the two columns. Similarly, a comparison
of the second column with the fourth column shows that the sample fractions are almost
identical in the two samples, and for none of the outcomes is it possible to reject at a 5%
level the null hypothesis that the fractions are the same in the populations associated
for the two columns. Given these results, in the remainder of this section we exploit the
benefits of using as many observations as possible by performing comparisons based on
the samples present in Columns 1 and 2.
    In Table 6, comparing the last entry in the first column of Panel B to the last entry in
the first column of Panel C shows that, as seen earlier in Table 1, the average perceived
probability of working full-time at age 28 is 66.6% for women and 81.6% for men. Of
primary interest in this section is whether there actually exists a substantial gender
difference in the full-time outcome. Comparing the last entry in the second column
of Panel B to the last entry in the second column of Panel C shows the fraction of
respondents working full-time at age 28 is 72.0% for women and 81.0% for men. Thus,
on average, both men and women have quite accurate beliefs about full-time work, and,
  16
    The post-college sample is larger, in part, because participation on the BPS baseline survey was a
necessary condition for participation in subsequent in-school surveys, but was not a necessary condition
for participation in post-college surveys.


                                                  22
as a result, the gender difference in the fractions of men and women working full-time
at age 28, 9.0% = 81.0% - 72.0%, is similar in spirit to the gender difference in the
perceived full-time probabilities of working full-time at age 28, 15% = 81.6% - 66.6%. A
generally similar result is obtained when we examine the outcome of working at all at age
28 (full-time or part-time). There exists a gender difference of 5.5% (female 84.4%, male
89.9%) in the fractions of men and women working at age 28, while there exists a gender
difference of 5.2% (female 91.2%, male 96.4%) in the average perceived probabilities of
working at age 28.
    Turning to the family variables, we find that beliefs about marriage and children are
not as accurate as beliefs about labor supply. For example, consistent with some evidence
in Wiswall and Zafar (2016), the first row of Table 6 shows that the combined male-
female sample is considerably optimistic about the probability of being married at age
28 (average perceived probability 72.7%, actual fraction married 52.4%) and the second
row shows that the combined male-female sample is optimistic about the probability of
having a child five years old or younger at age 28 (average perceived probability 55.7%,
actual fraction with child five years old or younger 29.4%).17
    However, Panels B and C reveal that there exist important gender differences in the
actual timing of children, which are in line with gender differences in perceptions about
the timing of children. Specifically, women are 9.0% more likely than men to have a
young child at age 28 (32.5% female, 23.4% male), and, on average, believe they are
13.1% more likely than men to have a young child at age 28 (60.5% female, 47.4% male).
The gender difference in the fractions of men and women that are married at age 28
(52.7% female, 51.9% male) and the gender difference in the perceived probabilities of
being married at age 28 (female 75.9%, male 67.1%) are both smaller than their children
counterparts.
    Given our finding that women believe that a young child is associated with substan-
tially lower labor supply, an open question is why the overoptimism about the timing
of children seen in Table 6 does not lead women to substantially understate the actual
probability of working full-time or working at all. One possibility is that the probability
of working conditional on having a young child is smaller than women anticipated. We
find some evidence that this is the case. Specifically, the last row of Table 7 shows that
the average perceived probability of working conditional on having a young child is 74.5%
for females, while the fraction of women working with young children is 65.4%. However,
looking across the other family scenarios in Panel C of Table 7 reveals that the optimism
about the probability of working is not isolated to the young-child scenario, but, rather,
is seen for all family scenarios. The results for full-time work reported in the Full-time
  17
    In the study of NYU students by Wiswall and Zafar (2016), a complication would arise when
comparing perceptions about family outcomes to actual family outcomes because the age at which
perceptions are elicited is not the same as the age 25, for which family outcomes are observed. However,
they are able to establish that respondents are too optimistic about marriage because they find that
the fraction of their sample that is married (or has children) at age 25 is extremely low, and, therefore,
lower than the average perceived probability of being married at a younger age.

columns of Panel C of Table 7 are generally similar with regard to optimism.

4.2     Individual Beliefs and Outcomes
The previous subsection compared the sample average perceived probability of a partic-
ular outcome occurring in the future to the fraction of respondents in the sample that
have that outcome occur in the future. While Manski (2004) suggests the value of this
type of full-sample comparison for characterizing the accuracy of beliefs, the relatively
rare ability of the BPS to examine whether an individual's expectations are predictive
of his/her own future outcomes is of additional usefulness. Some recent research has
noted that such a examination is valuable because it provides evidence about whether

     are reported in the first and fourth columns. Standard errors are in the parenthesis.
expectations questions can indeed be successful in eliciting useful individual-level infor-
mation about beliefs. However, given that the value of expectations data now seems
to be widely accepted and given that our paper is able to explicitly attempt to address
measurement issues that might be present in these data (Section 3.3.2), here we focus
on the benefit that, under the assumption that beliefs can be correctly characterized,
the examination of the predictive ability of individual-level expectations allows a differ-
ent, stronger test of Rational Expectations than is possible by the comparison between
sample-level perceptions and sample-level outcomes.
    Specifically, consider a regression in which the dependent variable is an indicator
variable that takes the value one if a particular outcome is observed to occur for person
i at some time t and the independent variable is i's perceived probability (during school)
of the outcome occurring at the future time t.18 If there is no aggregate shock that
affects the actual outcome, the existence of Rational Expectations would imply that the
constant in this regression would have a value of zero and the coefficient on the perceived
probability would have a value of one. From an intuitive standpoint, this is the case
because it corresponds, roughly speaking, to a situation where, for any subgroup of the
sample that has the same perceived probability, the fraction in the subgroup for which the
outcome occurs is equal to the perceived probability. For a variety of reasons, including
the concern that labor supply and family outcomes might be affected by aggregate shocks
to some extent, we do not wish to take this exercise too literally, but, instead note that
the closer the slope coefficient is to one (and the closer the constant is to zero), the more
correct the students' beliefs tend to be in a Rational Expectations sense.
    The first panel of Table 8 shows results obtained by regressing an indicator for whether
a respondent is married at the age of 28 on the respondent's perceived probability (during
school) of being married at the age of 28. Similarly, the second panel of Table 8 shows
the results from regressing an indicator for whether a respondent has a young child at age
28 (5 years old or less) on the respondent's perceived probability of having a young child
at age 28.19 The results in the second row of these two panels indicate that perceptions
are strong predictors of actual family outcomes. A one percentage point increase in the
perceived probability of being married and having a young child at age 28, respectively,
is associated with a 0.66 and 0.56 percentage point increase in the actual probability
of being married and having a young child at age 28, respectively. These estimates are
significant at a 1% level, and, as seen in the third row of the first two panels (Table
8) lead to correlations of 0.36 and 0.38. Further, as shown in the first row of Table 8,
we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the constant term in either of the regressions
  18
     The error term in this regression represents outcome-influencing factors that were not observed
by student i when perceived probabilities were elicited. By construction, they are uncorrelated with
perceived probabilities.
  19
     The perceived probability of being married at age 28 is constructed using a student's reported
probability of getting married at each age under the assumption that divorce does not happen before
age 28 and that the probability of getting married at age 28 is the same as that at age 29. The perceived
probability of having a young child is computed using the method detailed in Section 3.2.1.


                                                   26
is 0, even at a 10% significance level. Thus, although Section 4.1 shows that students
are, on average, incorrect in their beliefs about marriage and children, we find that their
misperceptions are likely to take a relatively simple form; the actual probability of being
married at age 28 is only about two-thirds of what each student believes and the actual
probability of having a young child at age 28 is only a little more than one-half what
each student believes.

   Note: t-statistics are in parentheses. Probability is the perceived (during school)
 percent chance (0 to 100) of the outcome in a particular column occurring at age 28.

    Turning to results related to labor supply in the last two panels of Table 8, the
association between actual outcomes and perceived probabilities is less strong. Looking
at the first column of each of these panels, a one percentage point increase in the perceived
probability of working at all and working full-time, respectively, is associated with a
0.24 and 0.16 percentage point increase in the actual probability of working at all and
working full-time at age 28, respectively. These estimates are significant at a 5% level
and a 10% level, respectively, and, as seen in the last row of Table 8, lead to correlations
of 0.11 and 0.09. These relationships might be influenced by the attenuation bias caused
by the presence of classical measurement error discussed in Section 3.3.2. Fortunately,
attenuation bias can be addressed in the regression framework if the variance of the
measurement error is known. Using a straightforward method described in Appendix
E, the second columns of the last two panels of Table 8 indicate that, after correcting
for measurement error, a one percentage point increase in the perceived probability of
working at all and working full-time, respectively, is associated with a 0.43 and 0.23
percentage point increase in the actual probability of working at all and working full-time
at age 28, respectively. The correlations increase to .15 and .11, respectively. Thus, our
results suggest that, while, on average, perceptions about labor supply are reasonably
accurate (shown in Section 4.1), the relationship between individual perceptions and
actual outcomes is weaker than what is seen for the family outcomes.

5     Estimating the Effect of Young Children on Labor
      Supply
A large traditional literature has been interested in quantifying the causal effect of young
children on the labor supply of women, and to a lesser extent, on men (see e.g., Naka-
mura and Nakamura, 1992 for a survey of early literature and Angrist and Evans, 1998,
Cruces and Galiani, 2007, Cristia, 2008, and Lundborg, Plug, and Rasmussen, 2017 for
more recent investigations). Of relevance for thinking about this issue for women, our
results in previous sections indicated that, consistent with what was expected by students
when they were in college, females tend to work much less when they have a young child
(while males do not). However, the interpretation of this relationship is complicated by
a potential, well-recognized endogeneity problem: women who have young children at
age 28 may differ from those who do not in ways that are related to their labor supply
decisions. In theory, this endogeneity issue can be addressed by a simple cross-sectional
regression if all these differences can be controlled for by observable characteristics. Un-
fortunately, it may be difficult to find observable characteristics that are able to credibly
control for differences in, for example, unobserved preferences for leisure or for spending
time with young children, which would tend to be correlated with both fertility status
and labor supply. In this case, estimators of the effect of children on labor supply from
cross-sectional regressions will tend to be biased.
    One conceptually appealing and commonly adopted approach to address the endo-
geneity problem is instrumental variables estimation. Previous studies have proposed
several plausible IVs. For example, Angrist and Evans (1998) construct an IV based
on whether the first two children in a family are of the same sex, exploiting the widely
observed phenomenon of parental preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition. Using
administrative data from Denmark, Lundborg, Plug, and Rasmussen (2017) exploits the
fertility variation among childless women induced by in vitro fertilization to estimate the
effect of having children on females' careers.
    However, given the nature of these IV's, they will not typically be available to re-
searchers using standard longitudinal data sources. Here we propose and implement a
fixed effects estimator that takes advantage of the longitudinal nature of the BPS data,
along with the unique expectations data in the BPS. By comparing the change in labor
supply across two years to the change in the family variable of interest across two years,
the fixed effects estimator "differences out" endogeneity present because of permanent
differences in respondents' propensity to work (e.g., due to differences in preferences for
leisure or time with children). Then, any remaining endogeneity must be due to the
presence of a correlation between the change in family variables across years and the
change in the unobserved determinants of labor supply across years. The seemingly most
salient reason for the presence of such a correlation is that women may adjust their cur-
rent period labor supply in response to beliefs about having children in the future. Then,

                                             28
addressing this type of endogeneity is possible if one can control for current period beliefs
about having children in the future. The BPS is unique in providing this information,
which was elicited each year on the annual post-college survey.
   Formally, our main specification is given by:

           yit = m mit + k kit + m Emit + k Ekit + a Ageit + zi  + ui +         it ,     (10)

where the outcome yit is a dummy variable characterizing a person's labor supply at
time t. We provide results for both the case where the outcome of interest is whether a
person is working at all and the case where the outcome of interest is whether a person
is working full-time.
    Our primary interest is in understanding the effect that a person's family situation at
time t has on outcomes at time t. This family situation is characterized by kit and mit ,
which are indicator variables for whether a person has a young child at t and whether
a person is married at t, respectively. it is an idiosyncratic shock that is uncorrelated
with any other factors.
    The remaining variables in Equation (10) recognize potential reasons that the corre-
lation between the outcome (yit ) and either of the family variables (kit or mit ) would not
necessarily represent a purely causal relationship. The potential existence of permanent
factors that might be related to the family variables and also influence labor supply (e.g.,
preferences for leisure) is recognized by zi and ui , which represent observed and unob-
served time-invariant factors, respectively. The influence of these time-invariant factors
are differenced out by the fixed effects estimators. Then, of remaining concern from
an identification standpoint are time-varying factors that might be related to the family
variables and also influence labor supply. Age, Ageit , is a standard factor of this type that
we include. For reasons discussed before Equation (10), perhaps of even greater concep-
tual importance for the endogeneity concern are beliefs about family changes that might
take place in the near future. The annual post-college BPS survey provides a unique
opportunity to account for these beliefs. Specifically, we include in our regression beliefs
about the probability of having the next child within the next year and the probability
of getting married in the next year, which we denote Ekit and Emit , respectively.
    The Fixed Effects estimator of Equation (10) is implemented using annual survey
data collected from Year 2007 to Year 2013. The first panel of Table 9 reports the
estimation results for females. Consistent with the expectations of females in college, we
find that neither of the two marital-related variables are significantly related to female
labor supply. The estimates of m show that current marital status does not have a
statistically significant effect on whether a female works at all (t-statistic= 1.37) or
whether she works full-time (t-statistic= 0.33). Similarly, the estimates of m show that
beliefs about the probability of getting married in the next year do not have a significant
effect on either whether a female works at all (t-statistic= 0.57) or whether she works
full-time (t-statistic= 0.89).

                           Note: t-statistics are in parentheses.

    However, a much different story emerges for children. Starting with the contempora-
neous effects of children, the estimates of k indicate that the presence of a young child
decreases the probability of a woman working at all (either full-time or part-time) by 18.9
percentage points and decreases the probability of working full-time by 26.2 percentage
points, with these estimates being significant at all traditional levels (t-statistics of 7.46
and 8.50, respectively).
    Turning our attention to beliefs, the estimate of k in the Working column indicates
that a one percentage point increase in the probability of having a child in the next year
increases the probability of working at all by 0.09 percentage point, with the t-statistic
having a value of 2.05. Thus, there is evidence that women "expecting" children may
wish to be in the workforce in the current period to compensate for the future decrease in
labor supply that often accompanies children. Looking at the estimate of k in the Full-
time column, we find that beliefs about future child outcomes do not have a statistically
significant effect on the probability of working full-time. Thus, the adjustment to work
more operates through the addition of part-time jobs. An additional regression using
part-time work as the dependent variable provides evidence that this is case.20
    The second panel of Table 9 reports the estimation results for males. Consistent with
the expectations of males while in college, we find that neither of the two marital-related
variables and neither of the two children-related variables are significantly related to male
labor supply.


6      Conclusion
From a conceptual standpoint, human capital investment decisions in college, such as
study effort, dropout decisions, and major choices, are influenced by college students' be-
  20
    In this specification, a one percentage point increase in the probability of having a child in the next
year increases the probability of working part-time in the current period by 0.07 percentage points. This
coefficient is significant at a 10% level.

liefs about future labor market attachment. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis
of these beliefs, with a focus on gender differences, taking advantage of expectations data
from the Berea Panel Study.
    Our results suggest that, on average, both men and women are quite well-informed
about their future labor supply. This implies that the difference between the average
perceived probabilities of working for men and women is similar to the difference between
the fractions of men and women observed to be working in the post-college data. We
employ a decomposition to investigate why women believe they are less likely to be
working at age 28 than males. While the fact that women (correctly) believe that they
will have children earlier than men plays some role, the large majority of the gender
difference arises because women (correctly) believe that they will be less likely to be
working when they have young children.
    The paper makes two primary methodological contributions to the expectations lit-
erature. First, it includes a new exploration of the importance of measurement error
in answers to expectations questions. Perhaps of particular note, building on work in
Gong, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (forthcoming), the paper presents an approach for
addressing the possibility that classical measurement error is present in responses. The
approach takes advantage of the fact that the BPS contains two different sets of survey
questions that can be used to compute the same object of interest - the unconditional
probability of working at a particular future age.
    Second, the paper makes a methodological contribution by identifying a novel use for
expectations data. The most obvious use of expectations data is to capture beliefs that
theory suggests are relevant for decision-making. The design of the BPS, with its first
pilot in 1998, also recognized a second use of expectations data - allowing individuals
to express uncertainty about outcomes that would occur in the future.21 This paper
proposes a third use for expectations data - that the direct elicitation of beliefs can help
address endogeneity concerns, when these concerns are present because differences in
independent variables are caused by differences in beliefs. We utilize this approach to
quantify the substantial effect that children have on the labor supply of women.

    The BPS data of this type has been used in papers such as Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2014a)
to study college major and Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2012, 2014b) to study dropout. For other
early research recognizing this use see, e.g., Blass, Lach, and Manski (2010), van der Klaauw and Wolpin
(2008), and van der Klaauw (2012). More recent work has recognized that this type of measurement,
when used in an experimental setting, can allow one to examine how beliefs about outcomes change in
response to changes in beliefs about factors that influence decisions (Zafar and Wiswall, 2014, Delavande
and Zafar, forthcoming).

    Given that the next portion of Question D asks the respondent to report her beliefs about future
labor supply under the scenario where she has a child between ages of 3 and 5, we interpret this portion
of the Question as eliciting the respondent's beliefs about future labor supply under the scenario where
she has a child between the ages of 0 and 2.

C     Construction of FAi (ai)
In this section we discuss how we construct the distribution of Ai which describes student
i's beliefs about the age of the youngest child at age 28, ai . We first note that this
distribution can be obtained through a simulation-based approach if information about
student i's beliefs about the evolution of her future fertility situation is available. We
need to simulate student i's entire fertility history for a large number of times and record
the age of the youngest child at age 28 associated with each simulation. The distribution
of these recorded ages converges in distribution to the distribution of Ai as the number
of simulation increases.
    We model student i's beliefs about future fertility outcomes as follows. Let gi,q denote
student i's age of having the q th child, and Gi,q denote the random variable describing
student i's beliefs about gi,q . We assume that students believe they will have no more
than four children, and that children will not be born after age 40. For ease of notation,
we let Gi,1 = Gi,2 = Gi,3 = Gi,4 = 40 if student i has no children in her lifetime.
    As discussed earlier, Question D in Appendix A provides direct information on Gi,1 .
Specifically, the distribution of Gi,1 can be exactly determined from student i's responses
to Question D under the assumption that the density function of Gi,1 is 1) flat between
age 22 and 23, between 24 and 25, between 26 and 27, and between 28 and 29 and 2)
decreases linearly to zero between age 30 and 39. To take advantage of Question E to
estimate Gi,q , for q  2, we begin by assuming that student i believes that, net of the 10
months ( 5 6
             year) necessary for pregnancy, the age gap between having two consecutive
children follows an exponential distribution with mean µi,q . Formally, we have:

                                          5
                             Gi,q+1 - Gi,q - Exp(µi,q+1 ).                    (3 revisited)
                                          6
    The value of µi,q+1 can be computed from student i's beliefs about the number of
children he/she will have and information on Gi,1 . Note that, if µi,q+1 , q = 1, 2, 3 (and


                                               45
the distribution of Gi,1 ) are known, we can compute the probability that student i has
Q children given that Q  1 in her lifetime using a simulation-based approach similar to
the one described above. We denote this model-implied probability P    ~ K (µi,2 , µi,3 , µi,4 ),
                                                                        i,Q
Q = 1, 2, 3, 4 and denote the directly elicited probability of having Q children given
that Q  1 in her lifetime P   ^ K . For each student, we numerically search for the set of
                                       i,Q
parameters {µi,2 , µi,3 , µi,4 } that minimizes a weighted sum of the discrepancies between
observed and model implied probabilities. We weight each category by its associating
probability. Formally, we have:

             {µi,2 , µi,3 , µi,4 } = argmin                    ^ K (P
                                                               P     ~ K (µi,2 , µi,3 , µi,4 ) - P
                                                                                                 ^ K )2 .           (11)
                                                                 i,Q  i,Q                          i,Q
                                              Q{1,2,3,4}

   Once parameters {µi,2 , µi,3 , µi,4 } are estimated, we can approximate the distribution
of Ai by simulation using the method described in the first paragraph of this appendix.


D      Magnitude of the Measurement Error
In this section, we show that Equation (8), along with additional assumptions, implies
Equation (9). Recall that equation (8) states:

                ~j - P
                P    ^j =  j -                        A,k j,k
                                                      i  i , j  {F, P, N }.                            (8 revisited)
                  i    i  i
                                        k{N,02,35}

Taking the variance of both sides, we have:


           ^ j ) = var( j -
      ~j - P
  var(P                                           A,k j,k

        i    i         i

                                                                                                               |=




                    = var(ij ) +                          A,k 2
                                                      E ((i  ) )var(ij,k )         (E (ij ) = 0 and E (ij,k ) = 0)

                                         k{N,02,35}


Therefore,

E     Correcting the Attenuation Bias
Let vector zi denote the independent variables that are accurately measured and xi
denote the independent variable that is measured with classical measurement error i .
                                                                               2
We allow the variance of i to depend on observable gi and denote this variance M E (gi ).
Let x
    ~i = xi + i denote the measured value of xi . Then, the dependent variable yi is
given by:



                               yi = zi  + xi +
                                            ~i + ( - i ).
                                   = zi  +  x                                            (12)

   By construction, x ~ and - i are correlated. Hence, the OLS estimator is biased.
To correct for this bias, we notice that:


                         zi             0                                zi          0
E (yi - (zi  +  x
                ~i ))          +     2
                                                      = E ( - i )             +   2
                                                                                                = 0.
                         x
                         ~i          M E (gi )                           x
                                                                         ~i       M E (gi )
                                                                                         (13)

   Equation system (13) has the same number of equations and parameters which are
equal to the number of observables. Hence, it can be estimated using the Method of
                                 
Moments, i.e., the estimator of        is the solution to the sample analog of the moment
                                 
conditions defined by Equation 13. It is easy to show that this estimator has an easy-to-
                                                                                  zi
implement matrix-form expression. Letting  denote               and qi denote         , we

                                                                                  ~i
have:

                                                             -1

where and Y and Q are the matrices of yi and qi , respectively.
   In the context of this paper, x
                                 ~i is the reported perceived probability of having certain
outcome (e.g., being married, having a child, working at all and working full-time at age
                                              2

detailed in Section 3.3.2. This information allows us to compute    ^ using Equation (14).
