        This paper is an extensive revision

                                                                      of
since 1720, which has been constructed from the NBER/CPE pilot sample

was attained c.1790. Second, time series on average adult stature of
national populations in North America and Europe are used as indexes of
nutritional status (not diet alone but diet net of prior claims). These

series are shown to be highly

status may have accounted for as much as four—tenths of the secular decline

                                   1. The Issues

      Between c.1700 and 1980 there was a decline of about 35
                                                                points   in the

 standardized American death rate (see Table 1).* Between the same years,

 the British rate declined by about 21 points. About 70 percent of the

American decline and about 50 percent of the British decline took place

before 1911.

     The causes of this remarkable decline remain a puzzle. Until the mid

1950s it was widely attributed to improvements in medical technology.

During the past three decades Thomas NicKeown vigorously disputed that view

in a series of highly influential papers and books. Mckeown agreed that

there had been a considerable expansion of hospital services and important

advances in medical knowledge during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries

but he argued that such advances had little effect on the decline in death

rates until the twentieth century. An epidemiologist, McKeown gained

prominence for biomedical research, including his studies of the

relationship between birth weight and perinatal mortality rates in

Birmingham after World War II (Gibson and McKeowri 1950, 1951; McKeown and

Gibson 1951), before turning his attention to long—term changes in medical

practices and demographic rates.

1.1 The Nutritional Contribution: The English Experience

    Mckecwn's explanation for the decline in mortality rates after 1700 is

most fully set forth in his book on The Modern Rise of Population (1976a)

and he subsequently restated and cogently summarized his argument in 1978

and 1983. In the place of medical technology, McKeown substituted

improvement in nutrition as the principal factor affecting the decline in

mortality. He does not make his case for nutrition directly but largely

 through a residual argument in which he rejects    the other principal

 explanations. The alternatives to nutrition are advances in medical

 technology; reductions in the virulence of
                                              pathogens; human acquisition of
 immunity through natural selection, genetic drift, or acquired immunities;

 personal hygiene; and public sanitation.

      McKeown's analysis turns on a careful consideration of the British

 pattern of decline in death rates due to specific infectious diseases

 between c.1850 and 1971. During this period the standardized death rate

 attributable to infectious diseases declined from 13.0 per thousand to 0.7

 per thousand. About 514 percent of the decline was associated with airborne

 diseases, 28 percent with water— and food—borne diseases, and 18 percent

with diseases spread by other means (McKeowrj 1976a, pp. 514—63). This simple

classification permits MoKeown to assess the probable impact of public

health measures and personal sanitation.
                                             Cleaning up the public water

supply and improving sewage systems, he argues, would have had little effect

on the airborne diseases. Moreover, as long as water supplies were

polluted, individuals could not protect themselves against such water—borne

diseases as typhoid and cholera by washing regularly. Under such

circumstances "the washing of hands is about as effective as the wringing of

hands" (Mckeown 1978, p. 5140).   In his view public health measures did not
become effective until the very end of the nineteenth century. The sharp

declines in food— and water—borne diseases (which he dates in England and

Wales with the start of the eighth decade) were not only due to better water

and sewage systems but to improvements in food
                                                 hygiene, especially
pasteurization. He attributes the rapid decline of infant mortality between

1900 and 1931 mainly to the development of a ttsafe milk supply" (McKeown

1976a, p. 122; McKeowrj 1978, p. 5140). MeKeown argues that improvements in

                                                         from airborne
personal or public hygiene would not have reduced deaths
                                                              increased
diseases unless they reduced crowding, and crowding generally

during the nineteenth century.

     McKeown's skepticism about the efficacy of early medical measures is
                                             of decline in the death rates of
based on his study of the temporal pattern

the most lethal diseases of the nineteenth century. Tuberculosis, the
                                         during much of the nineteenth century,
leading killer in England and America
                               1848—54 tuberculosis caused nearly one out of

identified and an effective chemotherapy

until 1947. Nevertheless, the death rate of respiratory tuberculosis

declined tO   just   43 percent of its i848—5 level by 1900 and to just 10

 percent of that level before the introduction of streptomycin in 19W7.

 similarly, the major decline in the death rates from bronchitis and
                                        scarlet fever, and typhoid all preceded
 pneumonia, whooping cough, measles,
                                 chemotherapies. McKeown also doubts the
 the development of effective

 efficacy of the lying—in hospitals

                                                                    to changes

  might have declined due to changes in the pathogens. However, the
                                             5


  of the total decline attributable
                                       to these three diseases is small. On a

  more general plane he notes that infectious
                                                   diseases that are now relatively
  benign in developed nations are    still   quite virulent in less developed
 countries and   argues   that it is quite unlikely that pathogens would have

 lost their virulence only in
                                 developed countries. McXeown also minimizes
 the impact of natural selection, arguing that in the case of tuberculosis

 too much of the population had
                                   been exposed to the bacillus for too long a

 period before the decline, and the decline itself was too rapid, to be

 consistent with natural selection.

      Mckeown's arguments in favor of a
                                             nutritional explanation fall into two
 categories. First, he cites evidence that per capita food supplies in

 England increased sporadically during the late eighteenth and early

 nineteenth centuries and then regularly in the late nineteenth and in the

 twentieth centuries. Second, he
                                     emphasizes findings of medical researchers
currently working in the developing countries who have concluded that there

is a synergistic relationship
                                  between malnutrition and infection, and that

malnutrition significantly increases the likelihood that a victim will

succumb to an infection. In this
                                     connection he cites a report of the World
Health Organization which concluded that malnutrition was an associated

cause in 57 to 67 percent of the deaths
                                             of children under age 5 in Latin
America (1976a, p. 136).

1.2 The Nutritional Contribution: The American Experience

     McKeown's argument has been extended to the American experience by

Meeker (1972) and by Higgs (1973, 1979). According to Meeker, the period

from 1880 to 1910 witnessed both
                                    a substantial rise in per capita income and
a decline in mortality rates. In
                                     cross—sectional regressions for 1890 to
1900, city mortality rates are    significantly   related to housing density

                                                        related to income. In
variables and state mortality rates are significantly
                                     decline in rural mbrtality rates for the
his 1973 paper Higgs estimated the

period from 1870 to World War I. Despite the absence of direct observations
                                     to infer a series by making use of three
on rural mortality, Higgs was able
                                                the urban crude death rate,
other series (the aggregate crude death rate,
                                           urban) and an identity that related
and the share of the population that was

the rural crude death rate to these series.     This procedure produced a rural

                                                          the same rate as the
crude mortality series which declined at approximately

urban mortality series, the total decline over 50 years amounting to between

30 and 40 percent. Higgs argues that whatever role public sanitation and
                                                        they were of minor
medical care might have played in the urban context,

consequence in rural areas which were undersupplied with physicians, and

which continued to draw water mainly from wells, springs, and cisterns,

 continued to rely art privies, and continued to consume unpasteurized milk.

 Like McKecwn, Higgs concluded that "the great bulk of the decline in rural

 mortality before 1920 is probably attributable to rising levels of living

 among the rural population" (1973, p. 189).

 1.3 objections to the Nutritional Argument

      Virtually all those who are attempting to explain the secular decline

 in mortality rates in Europe and America agree that improvements in
                                                      believe that Mckeown and
 nutrition made a contribution. But some scholars
                                                         1983). The doubts
 others have greatly exaggerated the case (Livi—Bacci

 arise partly because of major gaps in the evidence. Razzell, for example,

 doubts McKeown's claim that the food supply in England grew more rapidly

 than the population before 18U0. He argues that at least for the eighteenth

 century the evidence is "much more consistent with a reversed hypcthesis

  that the standard of the diet was a function of population change?? (Razzell
                                       7


1973, p. 8). Even more basic is the absence of adequate evidence on
mortality rates. Before 1837 in Great Britain and before 1900 in the United

States information on death rates is so sparse that historical demographers

are at odds net only on the levels of mortality but even on the direction of

change (Lindert 1983; Easterlin 1977; Vinovskis 1972).

     In   the American case, for example, fragments of evidence led Thompson
and Whelpton   (1933) to believe that mortality rates declined fairly steadily

from the middle of the eighteenth century to 1900. On the other hand,

Yasuba's (1962) examination of available urban death registrations and some

scattered registrations from rural communities led him to conclude that

mortality rates increased between 1800 and 1860. More recently, a study of

Deerfield, which has vital records that extend back to the early eighteenth

century, revealed that mortality was low and stable within this rural town

of western Massachusetts until the turn of the nineteenth century. Between

1795—99 and 18110—J414, however, mortality rates nearly doubled (Meiridl and

Swedlund 1977, p. 398).

     It is not merely the evidential gaps in the argument of McKeown and

others that aroused the concern of critics. Certain facts seemed to

contradict the case for nutrition. The absence of a significant gap between

the mortality rates of the peerage and the laboring classes in England

before 1725 was particularly vexing. "If the food supply was the critical

variable," Razzell argued (1973, pp. 6—7), mortality reductions should have

been "concentrated almost exclusively amongst the poorer" classes and the

mortality rates of the aristocracy should have been "unaffected." Yet as

Table 2 shows, between the fourth quarter of the sixteenth century and the

beginning of the second quarter of the eighteenth century, the mortality

rates of the aristocracy were about as high as those of the general

population.      Both the high mortality rates of the nobility before 1725 and

the rapid fall in these rates thereafter, although there was no apparent

change in the diet of the peerage, predisposed Razzell "to look at the food

supply hypothesis very critically."1

        Efforts to relate both short- and long—term variations in the mortality

rates   to   variations in bread or wheat prices have also undermined the

nutritional explanation. Appleby's (1975) regressions, which related London

deaths from specific diseases to bread prices over the period from 1550 to

1750, led him to conclude that there was no correlation between the supply

of food and deaths due to plague, smallpox, or tuberculosis and only slight

correlations between bread prices and deaths due to typhus and "ague and

fever." More sophisticated analysis by Lee (1981) revealed statistically

significant but weak relationships between short—term variations in death

rates and in wheat prices. According to Schofield (1983, p. 282) short—run

variations in English mortality were "overwhelmingly determined" by factors

other than the food supply and the long—run trend in mortality was

unaffected by the trend in food prices.

        Lindert's (1983) examination of the work of Lee, Wrigley, and Schofield

confirmed their conclusions on the absence of a notable relationship between

food prices and mortality rates. Nevertheless, he was discontented with

results that implied that living standards "left little or no mark on

mortality." The puzzle, he acknowledged, extended to his own work with

Williamson, since they have not yet been able to "find a firm casual link

behind the obvious correlation between income and life expectancy after

1820." He suggested that the resolution to "the mystery of independent

mortality" trends might require more complex attacks on the issue. That

would   be the case if the "life—extending" effect of income "was hidden
                                          10



behind the shift toward earlier death in the growing unhealthy cities." He

also   suggested that diets may "have improved in ways unmeasured by income"
(pp. 147—kB).
       Other investigators have found evidence which suggests that McKeown
underestimated   the impact of public   health measures on the decline in
mortality    during the nineteenth century: Estimates of the cause of mortality

rates in the three largest urban areas of France during the nineteenth

century by Preston and van de Walle (1978) led them to the conclusion that

water and sewage improvements played a major role in the urban mortality

decline. Not only were the declines concentrated in the waterborne diseases

but the rate of decline was much more rapid in the two cities that

introduced vigorous sewage and pure water programs than in the one that did

not. On the other hand, deaths due to tuberculosis did not decline in Paris

over   a 33 year period, although deaths due to other airborne diseases showed
small declines. Even these declines could have been due to the clean up of
the    water supply. Preston and van    de Walle stress that diarrheal and other
waterborne    diseases have important nutritional consequences because they

!Ireduce appetite, reduce the absorption of essential nutrients, increase

metabolic demands and often lead to dietary restrictions" (p. 218). Thus,

cleaning up the water systems not only reduced deaths caused by waterborne

diseases but also contributed to the reduction in deaths due to airborne

diseases because the reduction in waterborne diseases improved the

nutritional status of the population, especially of infants and young

children.

 1.LI The Concepts of "Nutritional Status"

and "Nutritional Adequacy"

       The last point calls attention to a terminological issue that has

confused the debate over the contribution of improvements in nutrition to

the decline in mortality. Although some investigators have equated the term

nutritional status with the amount of food that is consumed, epidemiologists

and   nutritionists   use the term in a different way. To them nutritional

status denotes the balance between the intake of nutrients and the claims

against it. It follows that adequate levels of nutrition are not determined

solely by the level of nutrient intake but vary with the circumstances of an

individual. Whether the diet of a particular individual is nutritionally

adequate depends on such matters as his level of physical activity, the

climate of the region in which he lives, and the extent of his exposure to

various diseases. As Nevin S. Scrimshaw put it, the adequacy of a given

level of Iron consumption depends critically on whether or not an individual

has hookworm.2 Thus, it is possible that the nutritional status of a

population may decline even though that population's consumption of

nutrients is rising if the extent of exposure to infection or the deee of

physical activity is rising more rapidly. It follows that the assessment of

the contribution of nutrition to the decline in mortality not only requires

measures   of food consumption but of the balance between food consumption and
the claims on that consumption. To avoid confusion, in the remainder of
this paper I will use the terms "diet" and "gr'oss   nutrition" to designate

nutrient intake only. All other references to nutrition, such as

"nutritional status," "net nutrition," "nutrition." "malnutrition," and

"undernutrition" will designate the balance between nutrient intake and the

claims on that intake.

                       2. New Sources of Evidence

    The major obstacle to a resolution of   the debate on   the causes of the

decline in mortality is the absence of data rather than the absence of

analytical ingenuity or credible theories. Recognition of this point has

led to numerous attempts to find sources of data that could till the gap.

The most impressive of these undertakings have been the work with parish

records in England and France which have produced important new series on

population and vital events that reach back to the first half of the

sixteenth century. The publication of The Population History of England and

of a summary of the second volume in the series (Wrigley and Schofield 1983)

reveal that we are now coming into possession of a new long—term series that

will greatly illuminate the evolution of demographic processes in England.

Similar promise for French demography resides in the parish data assembled

by INED, a part of which has been insightfully analyzed by Weir (1982), and

in the new project based on the collection of a random sample of genealogies

that has been launched by J. Dupaquler and his colleagues. Despite the

demonstration by Henripin (19514) and his colleagues that genealogies could

be used to reconstruct the population history of French Canada during the

eighteenth century, historical demographers made little use of this type of

evidence during the three decades following the publication of that study.

The situation now appears to be changing. In Germany samples of genealogies

are also being employed as the principal source of evidence in attempts to

reconstruct long—term series on population and vital events in that nation

 (Imhof 1977).

      It has been far more difficult to obtain data on standards of living

and nutrition that could be used in conjunction with the demographic series

 that are now coming on line. Wrigley and Schofield (1981), for example,
                                       13


were forced to rely on a wage series of a small class of workers in a single

region and to treat the price of wheat as a proxy for the consumption of

food (Cf. Thirsk 1983). This difficulty is also being addressed and

promising new sources of data on economic variables are now being exploited.

It has recently been demonstrated that probate records, bailiffs' accounts,

tax lists, and similar archival records can provide data on economic

information suitable for both cross—sectional and time—series analysis.

From these sources scholars have been able to measure such variables as

grain yields, meat supplies, rental prices of housing, changes in

occupational structure, income and wealth (Overton 1979 and 1980; Schuurman

1980; Lindert 1980; Lindert and Williamson 1983a; B. Campbell 1983).

     Although European scholars have led the way in the exploitation of many

of the new data sources, Americans have not been far behind. Much of the

work on this aide of the Atlantic has been pioneered by historians of the

colonial period who have exploited the full array of these difficult but now

highly valued documentary sources to produce evidence on demographic,

economic, and social behavior (Demos 1970; Lockridge 1966; Greven 1970; Carr

and Walsh 1980; Smith 1972; McCusker 1970; Menard 1975; Walsh and Menard

19714; Rutman and Rutman 1979; Fischer and Dobson 1979; Kulikoff 1976;

McMahon 1980; Galenson 1981; Main 1982; Rothenberg 19814; Jones 1980; IL

Galiman 1982; M. Gallman 1980; Levy 19811). Although for the most part these

studies have focused on local communities and particular periods,

collectively they adumbrate regional and national patterns and demonstrate

the feasibility of extending this approach to the national level and to the

entire span of U.S. history.

     In 1977 the NBER launched a new Program in the Development of the

American Economy (DAE) which is investigating long—term changes in the U.S.
                                       1k



economy that have occurred at the microeconomio level. To facilitate this

objective the DAE has organized several studies of the feasibility of

creating representative data sets consisting of intergenerationallY linked

households. Such data sets could open up entirely new possibilities for

examining the interaction of economic and cultural factors and their mutual

influence on such variables as the saving rate, the rate of female entry

into the labor force, fertility and mortality rates, the inequality of the

wealth distribution, migration rates, and rates of economic and social

mobility. These data sets cannot be created from a single set of records

but require the linking of several different types of records. The pilot

studies have been aimed at determining whether the creation of the projected

data sets is economically feasible and whether it is likely that such data

sets will yield the desired information. The results to date have been

encouraging on both counts.

 2.1 The DAE/CPE Genealogical Sample

      One of the projects in the OAE program is called "The Economics of

Mortality in North America. 1650—1910." Jointly sponsored by the Center for

 Population Economics of the University of Chicago, this project turns on the

 collection of a large sample of genealogical records. The demographic

 information in the genealogical sample is being linked, on an individual or

 household basis, to economic information contained in probate records, tax

 lists, manuscript schedules of federal and local censuses, military and

 pension records, and eventually with medical records.   The projected size of

 the ultimate sample is approximately Looo,ooo individuals in 200,000

 families that will be linked intergenerationally for up to ten generations

 (see Table 3).

        During the past five years we have retrieved a sample of approximately

80,000    persons   who were born or entered the United States between 1640 and

1910.     Our objective during this   phase   has been to investigate the various

categories of genealogical records in order to determine which types of

records would yield the most desirable properties and which are most cost

effective. Of the various categories of genealogies that we have examined

the   two most promising are published family histories and family group

sheets.

        There are at least 110,000 published histories of families that contain

information on over 20,000,000 people who have lived in North America. The

largest collection, with 211,000 volumes, is in the Library of Congress, but

the New York Public Library, the Library of American Antiquarian Society,

the Genealogical Society Library in Salt Lake City, and the Newberry Library

have extensive collections. We have surveyed the resources in these and

other collections and have put information from a sample of the family

histories into machine—readable form. At the present time the sample of

published histories consists of about 65,000 individuals drawn from about

275 books.

        Mast of the family histories begin with an immigrant to North America

or some other individual who may be viewed as a patriarchal or matriarchal

figure. The book then records the descendants of this initial individual so

that a descending tree or a pyramid is described within the family history.

Dates of birth, death, and marriages are recorded in the family history,

along with the place of each vital event, although omission of some vital

information is common. The typical family history in the pilot sample

covers six to eight generations and contains about 2,000 individuals.

Families of New England are overrepresented in the histories but a
                                          17


significant    number of books exist for each region of the country. The

paucity of black family histories is the most serious shortcoming of this

source. But the source is sufficiently diverse with respect to religion,

European origins, places of settlement inljorth America and period of

immigration to be useful. for studies of the white population.

      We have experimented with a variety of strategies in sampling from

these books. An initial concern was the distribution of the sample over the

largest feasible number of books in order to insure geographic and other

forts of diversity. More recently we have been experimenting with the

recording of all of the information in a book, which may be the most cost—

effective procedure. This new approach was encouraged by the discovery that

whatever the initial location of the patriarch, subsequent generations were

so mobile that each book generally had wide geographic coverage.3

      Of the 75,000 observations in machine—readable fcrm only two—thirds

have been integrated into the two files currently employed for demographic

analysis. For the analysis of fertility we created an intergenerationally—

linked file of about 10,000 families embracing about 111,000 unduplicated

individuals. The subsample currently being used to investigate mortality

consists of about 19.000 individuals at risk from birth. About 15 percent

of the individuals in these two working subsamples have been linked so far

to economic information obtained from probate records and from the

manuscript schedules of the federal censuses.11

      Family   group sheets are also family histories but each sheet consists
of just    three   generations. It is possible to link successive group sheets
together    in order   to form longer genealogies but we have not yet attempted

to   do so. So far we have used them mainly     for the period between 1830 and

1900 when foreign immigration was heavy.       The group sheets are well suited
                                              18


for   that purpose since patriarchs who arrived during the second half of the

nineteenth century would only have had one or two generations of eligible

descendants. The family group sheets were constructed by Mormons and there

are about 10,000,000 of these records in the files of the Genealogical

Library in Salt Lake City. Although the compilers were Mormons, the

ancestors included in the group sheets usually were not.5 Much of our work

with the group—sheet         sample has been concerned with whether its members are
similar enough    to the members of the published family histories to consider

both samples as constituting a single pool of information. So far the

results of our tests indicate that they do, and for many of our runs we have

been pooling the two samples, although we continue to teat for differences.

The current working         sample of group sheets consists of about 9,500
individuals who     belonged to 1,500 families.

        A priori considerations suggest that genealogies are likely to be a

biased source of information on demographic and other socioeconomic

characterisitics. For example, it seems reasonable to assume that the

probability that a family history will be constructed is proportional to the

fertility of the family and inversely proportional to its mortality. It

follows that genealogies may yield upward biased estimates of fertility

rates and downward biased estimates of mortality rates. Whether the

magnitude of such biases is large or small and whether they are correctable

cannot, however, be determined on a priori grounds and the investigation of

the direction and magnitude of various biases has been at the center of our

work.

        One approach to this problem has been to run a series of regressions of

the form:

        (1) D = g     (X..,B. .),   where
             j    j     U     13
                                      19


         D. - a dichotomous variable for persons in the .jth age group that

               takes the value one in the event of a death,

               the !th behavioral factor affecting the mortality rate of the

               .jth group,

               the !th distortion in the data set which spuriously affects

               the probability of dying in the Jth group.

The regressions described by equation (1) can be used to produce values of

nx corrected for the biases measured bY the Bij. At the present time only

a proportion of the      variables that we intend to consider have been

brought into analysis. Still missing are the main economic variables, which

we are now in the process of linking to the demographic variables.

Nevertheless, the initial runs on age—specific risk of death (for each sex,

on each of the seven age intervales, for each of four birth cohorts) are

rather promising. Birth order is statistically significant and has a

relatively large impact on the probability of dying in most of the age

intervals, with first and last births having a higher probability of dying

than intermediate births in families with at least four live births. Place

of birth has a significant impact on the probability of dying and the high

risk regions change over time.

     The bias variables (BiJ) indicate that practices by the compilers of

genealogies had a small but statistically significant effect on the measured

level of risk. So far these biases do not appear to have had much effect on

the coefficients of the X, generally changing the values only of the

second or third significant digit. Much remains to be done, however, on

investigating alternative ways in which the bias variables may be introduced

into the regressions. But so far the impact of the various biases

identified on a priori grounds appears to be small in well chosen and
                                       20



carefully screened genealogies. Even in the case of wealth, the upward bias

in the genealogies is smaller than had been conjectured. Adams and Kasakoff

have collected a sample of genealogies for northern states which they linked

with the manuscript schedules of the 1850 census. They then computed mean

wealth of the men in their sample who were age 20 or over in 1850, by

occupation. Table lj compares their results with the means reported by

Soltow (1975) for his random sample from the 1850 census schedules. Table 4

shows that although the means in the sample of Adams and Kasakoff are biased
upward as one would expect, the differences in means are not very large.
Moreover,   the large standard deviations indicate that the genealogies cover

virtually the whole range of wealth holders.6 Consequently, by including

wealth as an argument of equation (1), it is possible to adjust for errors

in estimates of mean mortality rates due to the overrépresentation of rich

individuals and underrepresentation of poor ones.

     Potential biases in the mortality rates because of the nature of

different categories of genealogies raise more troublesome issues. One of

the first issues we investigated was whether the family histories were truly

family histories or merely pedigrees. Family histories include all of the

descendants of the patriarch but pedigrees include only the direct ancestors

of the compiler (his father, his grandfather, his great grandfather, and so

on). Quite clearly pedigrees would bias mortality rates downward severely

since the individuals in a pedigree had to live at least long enough to have

procreated. The creation of a pedigree is the first step in the compilation

of a family history since the compiler must trace his lineage to the

patriarch. Only then can he come forward in time to construct a complete

family history. The simplest test of whether a book is a family history or

a pedigree is to observe the fullness of the tree. Some books can be

discarded because it is obvious that the compiler traced only a few lines.

Such inspection will not, however, reveal more subtle omissions. To get at

these we devised other tests, such as whether the number of lines that died

out in a given genealogy was consistent with the predictions generated by

reasonable guesses at appropriate life tables and fertility schedules. The

results of the various tests have indicated that the majority of the family

histories in our sample are indeed what they purport to be. It appears that

once they determined who their patriarchs were, the compilers usually sought

to fill in the entire family tree, although they were not always entirely

successful.

     Other tests of potential bias have involved evaluation of the behavior

of various fertility and mortality statistics in order to determine if they

conform to patterns observed in comparable populations. We have, for

example, compared age—specific fertility schedules and the mean birth

intervals at various parities with those obtained from a variety of family

reconstitutions and found them to be normal for non—contraceptive

populations. We are currently comparing the age structure of the

individuals in the sample who are alive at given dates with the age

structure in censuses performed at the same date but have not yet completed

these tests. We have also computed both period and cohort life tables from

the data in our sample in order to determine whether the internal structures

of these tables are consistent with known characteristics of life tables and

these are (Bourne etal. 198'1).

     One such life table has been constructed for 920 native—born white

males in the pilot sample who were at risk to die during the decade of the
                                      23


iSSOs (see panel A of Table 5). It should be emphasized that during the

pilot phase of data collection the individuals included in the sample have

been chosen in such a way as to be representative of the collections of

genealogies that have been the focus of our concern. Consequently, the

observations in the pilot sample are not necessarily representative of the

riaitonal population to which the final sample will pertain. Although the

individuals at risk during the 1850s come from all of the major regions, the

Northeast is overrepresented and the South and Midwest are underrepresented.

the rural areas are also overrepresented and urban areas are

underrepresented. In principle the deficiencies in the sample could be

remedied by reweighting each of the cells in an appropriate manner.   I have

not engaged in such an exercise for two reasons. First, the current sample

is too small; on average there are only about 13 observations for each of

the 70 cells that need to be reweighted. Second, the life tables which are

available for comparison suffer from sample selection biases which cannot,

at present, be defined with the precision required for reweighting.

     Panel B of Table S presents the average of the 1850 and 1860 life

tables recently estimated by Haines (1979) from the data in the censuses of

mortality for these two years. Because these censuses suffer from

substantial underreporting, Haines fitted model life schedules to data for

persons aged 5—19, ages during which the reporting tends to be most

complete. Nevertheless, it is still likely that the mortality rates in his

tables are to some degree biased downward. The downward bias is likely to

be present even at the ages he focused on because underreporting was greater

in the South than in the North and because underreporting was severe in

urban areas at all ages (cf. Kahn 1978; Condran and Crimmins 1980). Panel C

presents the life table for 1900 constructed by the Bureau of the Census for

Sources and notes: Panel A: See the text and footnote 7 for the sources. The number

of observations on which each nS value was computed ranged between 126 and 212. The

the ten original death registration states. Unlike the Haines tables it is

difficult to know the direction of bias in this table because the biases run

in both directions. The exclusion of the South from the original

registration states tends to bias mortality rates downward. It was not

until 1933 that all 148 states were included in the death registration system

(U.S. Bur. Cen., 1975, p. 1111). On the other hand, the states included in

the original registration area are overrepresented, in comparison with the

nation as a whole, in two high risk groups: the foreign born and residents

of large cities.

     Table S indicates that life expectation at age 10 during the decade of

the 1850s in the genealogical sample is '46.7 years, which is almost

identical with the corresponding figure in the average of the Haines tables

for 1850 and 1860 (116.6 years) and about three years less than that

indicated by the 1900 table ('49.5 years). These results are generally

consistent with what is known about the extent of improvement in mortality

between the 1850s and 1900. There are some differences in the nx values

between the genealogical sample and the average of the Haines tables, but

because of the relatively small sample sizes, these are within the range of

sampling variability. Sampling variability can, however, be reduced by

further aggregation and for this reason the preliminary findings presented

in part 3 of this paper turn on 25—year averages (averages of five

quinquennial intervals). All in all, the life tables derived from the

genealogies conform well to those derived from registration data and other

sources even before adjusting the sample for the underrepresentation of

various sections of the reference population. The prospect for further

Improving the genealogical sample by both fuller sampling of

underrepresented groups and various statistical adjustments is quite good.

2.2   The Height—by—Age Samples
      One of   the variables that we wanted to include in the regressions run

on equation (1) was a measure of nutritional status. Measures of the mean

consumption of various foods are so scarce for modern populations that it is

unlikely that even the most assiduous search of archival documents would

produce reliable annual estimates of the consumption of the principal

nutrients for any significant number of individuals, certainly not for the

whole span of time that we wish to consider. Moreover, since nutritional

status depends not only on the amount of nutrients that are consumed but

also on the claims against that consumption, a measure of food intake alone

would be insufficient.

      Fortunately, there is a class of measures that are relatively abundant,

that reach far back into time, and that are sensitive to variations in

nutritional status. Both laboratory experiments on animal populations and

observational studies of human populations have led physiologists and

nutritionists to conclude that anthropometric measurements are reliable

indexes of the extent of malnutrition among the socioeconomic classes of

particular populations. Measures of height and weight at given ages, the

age   at which growth of stature terminates, attained final height, and the
rate of change in height or weight during the growing ages "reflect
accurately     the state of a nation's public health and the average nutritional

status of its citizens" (Eveleth and Tanner 1976, p. 1). consequently,

these measures are now widely used by the World Health Organization and

other agencies to assess the nutritional status of the population of

underdeveloped    nations.
      The use of anthropometric measures as measures of nutrition rests on a

well—defined pattern of human growth between childhood and maturity. The
                                           27



    average annual increase in height (velocity) is greatest during infancy,

    falls sharply up to age three, and then falls more slowly throughout the

    remaining pre—adolescent years. During adolescence, velocity rises sharply

    to a peak that is approximately one half of the velocity achieved during

*   infancy,   then falls sharply and reaches zero at maturity. En girls the

    adolescent growth spurt begins about two years earlier, and the magnitude of

    the spurt is slightly smaller than in boys.

         This growth pattern reflects the interaction of genetic, environmental,

    and socioeconomic factors during the period of growth. According to Eveleth

    and Tanner (1976, p. 222):

         Such interaction may be complex.. No genotypes which produce

         the same adult height under optimal environmental circumstances

         may produce different heights under circumstances of privation.

         Thus, two children who would be the same height in a well-off

         community may not only both be smaller under poor economic

         conditions, but one may be significantly smaller than the other...

         If a particular environmental stimulus is lacking at a time when it

         is essential for the child (times known as 'sensitive periods'),

         then the child's development may be shunted, as it were, from one

         line to another.

         The relative importance of environmental and genetic factors in

    explaining individual variations in height is still a matter of some debate.

    For most well—fed contemporary populations, however, systematic genetic

    influences appear to have very little impact on mean heights. Thus, the

    mean heights of well—fed West Europeans, North American whites, and North

    American blacks are nearly identical. There are some ethnic groups in which

    mean adult heights of well—fed persons today do differ significantly from
                                      28



the West European or North American averages, presumably due to genetic

factors. However, since such ethnic groups have represented a minuscule

proportion of American and European populations, they are irrelevant to an

explanation of the secular trends in mean adult heights in the U.S. and in

the various European nations since 1750. Nor do they contribute

significantly to differences, at various points of time, between the height

means of the U.S. population and of the principal populations from which the

U.S. population was drawn. In this connection, it should be noted that

today the mean final heights of well—fed males in the main African nations

from which the U.S. black population is derived also fall within the narrow

band characteristic of Western Europe (Eveleth and Tanner 1976; Fogel etal.

1983).

     Biologists, epidemiologists, and nutritionists, have charted the effect

of nutritional deficiencies on the human growth profile. Nutritional

insults in utero are reflected in birth length and birth weight. Short

periods of severe undernutrition or prolonged periods of moderate

undernutrition merely delay the adolescent growth spurt; severe, prolonged

undernutrition may diminish the typical growth—spurt pattern and contribute

to substantial permanent stunting. If undernutrition is both prolonged and

moderate, growth will continue beyond the age at which the growth of well—

fed adolescents ceases. Hence, average length at birth and in early

childhood, the average age at which the growth spurt peaks, the average age

at which growth terminates, the mean height during adolescent ages, and the

mean final height are all important indicators of mean nutritional status

(Frisancho 1978; Tanner 1978; Keilmann et al. 1983). Any one of these

factors can be used to identify secular trends in nutrition. The more of
                                           29


these measures that are available, the more      precise   the determination of the

severity and duration of periods of malnutrition.

      In considering the relationship between nutrition and height, it is

important to keep in mind that height is a net rather than a gross measure

of nutrition. Moreover, although changes in height during the growing years

are sensitive to current levels of nutrition, mean heights reflect the

accumulated past nutritional experience of an individual over all of his

growing years including the fetal period. Thus, it follows that when the

final heights are used to explain differences in adult mortality rates, they

reveal the effect, not of adult levels of nutrition on adult mortality

rates, but of nutritional levels during infancy, childhood, and adolescence

on adult mortality rates. Similarly, when heights at age 8 are related to

mortality at age 8, the exercise reveals the effect of nutritional

experience up to that age.

     The measure of net nutrition represented by mean heights depends on the

intake of nutrients, on the amount of nutrients available for physical

growth after the necessary claims of work and other activities (including

recovery from infections), and on the efficiency with which the body

converts nutrients into outputs. The body's ability to generate a surplus

for growth will vary with such factors as age, the climate, the nature of

the available food, clothing and shelter, the disease environment, the

intensity of work, and the quality of public sanitation. In other words,

the same nutritional input can have varying effects on physical growth,

depending upon environmental conditions. Consequently, mean height

corresponds quite well to the type of measure of nutritional status called

for in Section 1 .#:   it   is a measure of the balance between food consumption

and the claims on that consumption.
                                      30



    Some social scientists have suggested that height (or weight) at given

ages should not be called measures of "nutritional status," but "generalized

indexes of health" or "non—specific indicators of health status" (Cf. Mosley

and Chen 1983). The definition of "nutritional status" that I have set

forth here is not my own, but rather the definition employed by medical

nutritionists, epidemiologists, and physiologists. It is an unfamiliar

concept to most economists (and other social scientists) because we are not

steeped in the medical literature. Moreover, "nutritional status" sounds

too much like "diet" to most of us, although medical nutritionists and

epidemiologists draw a sharp distinction between the two terms. To scme

social scientists the use of the terra "nutritional status" seems to be a

subtle way of supporting the oversimplified view that low levels of

nutritional intake are the only sources of malnutrition, and so use of the

term appears to give covert support to oversimplified theories of the

relationship between diet and mortality.

     Will the use of such alternative terms as "health" or "non-specific

indicators of health status" avoid the problems? These terms have been

advanced as though their meaning was unambiguous; yet as F.K. Taylor (1979)

has pointed out, "health" is difficult to define rigorously. We can try to

give it rigor by using available information on morbidity and mortality

rates. Then "healthy" populations may be defined as populations having

rates in these dimensions that fall within a "normal" range. The difficulty

with this procedure is not only that reliable measures of mortality and,

especially, of morbidity are often lacking; there is the more fundamental

issue that "normal" ranges of morbidity and mortality vary so widely with

time, place, and circumstances that epidemiologists often turn to

anthropometric measures in order to determine what is "normal" in a given

environment (Hytten and Leitoh 1971; Waterlow etal. 1977; Habioht eta]..

1979; Meredith 1970; Naeye 1981; Raxnan 1981; Thomson and Billewicz 1976;

Goldstein 1976). So the mere substitution of one term for another of

"generalized indexes of health status" for 1tnutritional status," will not

remove conceptual ambiguities or prevent oversimplified characteristics of

the empirical relationships we seek to uncover.8

    Quite the contrary, striking out on our own, without adequate attention

to and connection with the extensive medical investigations on which we must

base our own work, is far more likely to be misleading than acceptance of

medical terminology that now seems strange or even questionable.9 Long

experience with the problems of the interrelationship between nutritional

status and infectious diseases has led medical specialists to the conclusion

that anthropometric measures are the best single index of the average

nutritional status of a population and of the relationship between

undernutrition and the outcome of a significant range of infections (Habicht

eta].. 1979). Both clinical studies and laboratory experiments have shown

that body wasting, retardation in the rate of physical development, and

stunting are usually caused by undernutrition during the developmental

years, which both reduces the rate of cell accumulation and the size of

cells (Winick and Brasel 1980). These findings do not, however, imply that

inadequate nutrient intake is the primary source of undernutrition or that

undernutrition can be remedied merely, or even primarily, by increasing

nutritional intake, since the source of the undernutrition may be a disease

which makes it impossible for the body to assimilate those nutrients which

are ingested.

     Moreover, both laboratory experiments on animal populations and field

studies of human populations have identified a set of infections whose
                                       32


outcome is sensitive to the nutritional status of the population at risk.

The most carefully controlled of these field studies has been underway in

the Narangwal district of India for more than a decade (G.E. Taylor 1982;

Kielmann etal. 1982; Kielmann etal. 1983). The Narangwal project has

revealed that perinatal mortality is particularly sensitive to the

nutritional status of mothers. Perinatal mortality rates were reduced by

more than LW percent when the diets of pregnant women were supplemented by

various nutrients, particularly iron and folio acid. Public health

measures, such as the immunization of mothers for neonatal tetanus and

improved delivery procedures, also were effective, contributing about half

as much to the reduction in perinatal mortality rates as did nutritional

supplementation. Infant mortality during the balance of the first year and

mortality   between ages one and three were also reduced by both measures.

Interestingly, public health measures were more effective than nutritional

supplementation in curbing late infant mortality, and the two types of

intervention were about equally effective in curbing mortality at ages 1—3.

Both nutritional supplementation and public health measures had marked

effects on height and weight at given ages and deviations from the 50th

centile of prevailing standards for height and weight were strongly

correlated with death rates. Whatever the nature of the infections to which

they were exposed, children whose diets were supplemented grew more rapidly

up to age three (the final age of the test) than children in the control

group.

     In   other words, improvements in nutritional status, whether the

consequence of nutritional supplementation (which enables the body to resist

infections) or medical intervention (which reduces the virulence of

infections) were associated with reductions in morbidity and mortality
                                        33

 rates.   However, these associations are not identical or even symmetrical.

 Increases in nutritional intake and medical or public health measures often

have different effects on particular diseases (and these effects vary with

different stages in the life cycle) as well as on the pattern of human

growth. For the range of issues that we are exploring it is particularly

important to stress that every infection affects nutritional status; the

survivors of an infection suffer a deprivation of nutrients required for

growth which slows down the rate of cell accumulation and reduces cell mass

(Winick and Brasel 1980). It does not follow, however, that improvements in

nutritional status necessarily reduce morbidity and mortality rates. Not

all infections are nutritionally sensitive and the body's capacity to resist

a nutritionally-sensitive infection may be inconsequential if the pathogen

is sufficiently virulent. In other words, nutritional status is likely to

be "a determining factor" in the outcome of an infection when that infection

is both nutritionally sensitive and of an intermediate degree of virulence

(J. Interdiscip. MIst. 1983, p. 506). Physiologists have also identified

the "mechanisms responsible for the increased number and severity of

infections in the malnourished host" (Feigin 1981, p. 18).

     Furthermore, although mean height is a good measure of nutritional

status, it does not by itself indicate whether fluctuations in net nutrition

are due to fluctuations in the consumption of food, in the claims on the

food intake, or in the efficiency with which food is converted into outputs.

Such decomposition is possible because of the asymmetries to which I have

referred. Although both infection and inadequate nutritional intake retard

the process of growth, they do not do so in precisely the same way. Because

the body draws more heavily on nutritional stores when it is fighting an

infection than when it is not, an infection may cause growth to cease during
                                        34


a   period of infection. However, if a child is normally well fed, and if

there is sufficient time between infectious episodes, there will usually be

full catch—up in growth when an infection ceases. Normal, well—fed children

do not grow at equal daily rates but alternate periods of growth well in

excess of the daily average with periods of little or no growth, as disease

and other claims on nutritional intake wax and wane. In well—fed children

with sufficient time between infectious episodes these lacunae in growth

have no effect on final heights, because of full and rapid catch—up, but in

malnourished children they contribute to permanent stunting (Fogel eta]..

1983).

        The more data which are available on heights at each age, the more

numerous and disaggregated the links between age— and disease—specific death

rates, not only with anthropometric data, but with a variety of other

socioeconomic variables, the more complete the decomposition of the

determinants of the decline in mortality will be, including the determinants

of nutritional status. It is not easy to construct a data base as varied

and abundant as I have indicated, but the objective is not out of reach.

Some initial stabs at decomposition with the data currently in hand are

undertaken for a few specific cases that are considered in Sections 3.2,

4.2, 4.3,    and
        The collection of a modest sample of height—by-age data was launched in

early 1978 as an adjunct of the mortality project in order to produce a

measure that could be employed in equation (1). However, it quickly became

apparent that this body of evidence was filled with so much useful

    information on economic behavior that the scope of the sampling effort was

enlarged and the work on this body of evidence became the foundation for a

new Bureau project called "Secular Trends in Nutrition, Labor Welfare and

Labor Productivity," which is also co—sponsored by the Center for Population
Economics.

     The nutrition project currently involves a set of sixteen samples (see

Table 6) containing information on height by age, weight, and various

sooioeconomic variables. The samples, which cover the period from 1750

through 1937, reveal aspects of physical development in the United States,

Trinidad, Great Britain, Austro—Eiungary, and Sweden. Ten of the samples

were drawn from military records and hence pertain to males of military age

One of the British samples is composed of poor teen—aged boys taken in by

the Marine Society, a charitable organization, from 1750 to 1910; another is

composed of upper class boys admitted to Sandhurst. Three of the samples

contain information on both sexes from infancy to old age. One sample is of

birth weights and lengths in Philadelphia from the 18*Os to the end of the

1870s. The data in these samples are being linked with additional data

obtained from probate records, tax lists, pension records, and manuscript

schedules of censuses. Such linking increases both the range of variables

that can be brought into the analysis and the complexity of the

interrelationship between height, nutritional status, and economic and

social behavior that we can investigate. As of mid 198k, information had

been collected on about 1OO,000 individuals, which is about 70 percent of

the anticipated final number.

     Much of our work on the height data between 1977 and 1982 dealt with

problems of estimating and correcting biases that arose from using military

records to estimate the mean height of the population from which the

recruits were drawn. These biases fall into three categories. First, there

are the self—selection biases that are peculiar to volunteer armies. Then

there are a variety of more general measurement biases, some of which relate
                                           39

to   the accuracy of the age information and others to the accuracy of the

height information. Finally, there is the bias that arises because military

organizations may have height limits. Most frequently these organizational

restrictions produced a Jagged truncation of the left tall of the height

distribution, but right—tail truncation is also encountered. Since we have

published several papers dealing with the techniques developed for coping

with these problems (Trussell and Bloom 1979; Wachter 1981; Wachter and

Trussell 1982; Fogel eta].. 1982; Floud 1983a; Fogel etal. 1983; Floud and

Wachter 1983; Trussell and Wachter 198L4), I will not      attempt   to describe
them    here   but merely state that both simulation techniques and practical

experience have demonstrated the effectiveness of      the procedures.


                 3. Some  Preliminary Findings on the Relationship
                     between Improvements in Nutritional Status
                            and the Decline in Mortality
        At the present time we have three pieces of evidence linking mortality
rates with nutritional status (as measured by height). Before presenting
these findings, I wish to reemphasize that they are provisional. Although
the work on the height data is fairly advanced, we are still in the pilot
phase of the drawing of the genealogical sample. The pilot sample is still
relatively     small, lacking in the geographical diversity we desire,

especially before 1750, and only partly linked to the economic, medical, and

social    information   that we will eventually have. Nevertheless, there are

several    suggestive findings that have   arisen out of these data sets, and

which    appear to be sufficiently robust to warrant their presentation.

3.1 The Secular Trends in the Height and in the
Life Expectation of U.S. White Males, 1700—1930

     Figure 1 compares the time series that we have developed so far in both

the height and the life expectation of U.S. white males. Before considering

this diagram some characteristics of the series and their limitations should

be kept in mind. First, the secular trend in height is controlled for

shifts in the distribution of the region of birth, of occupation, and

several other relevant characteristics while the life—expectation series is

not, but merely gives the mean life expectation at age 10 of all of the

individuals at risk during each period.10 Second, southerners are

underrepresented in both the height and the life—expectation series. The

correction of these deficiencies, which we hope to make in the near future,

will probably have a greater effect on the e10 series than on the height

series, especially before c.1750.11

     It is possible to estimate tentatively the effect of the mortality

correction by making use of Levy's (198k) estimates of the life expectation

of Maryland legislators. The value of e10 estimated from his data for 1700—

17kg and 1750—1799 are shown in the lower portion of the diagram.12 Also

shown is the effect of averaging his observations and those in the

genealogical sample, using weights that correct for the undercount of

southerners in the genealogical sample.13 As can be seen, the impact of the

 correction will be greatest before 1750, partly because the differential in

mortality between the regions closed rapidly during the first half of the

 eighteenth century and partly because the current representation of the

 South in the sample improves considerably after 1750. Thus, I expect a more

 representative sample to show a more rapid rise in e10 between 1700 and

1750. The beginning of the peak may be shifted by one or two decades and

the level of the peak may be lowered slightly.

    These corrections will not change the suggestive and unexpected

similarities in the two series. Both series appear to be rising during most

of the eighteenth century, attaining both substantially greater heights and

life expectations than prevailed in England during the same period (Floud

1985a). Life expectation began to decline during the 17905 and continued to

do so for about half a century. There may have been a slight decline in the

heights of cohorts born between 1785 and 1820, but the sharp decline, which

probably lasted about half a century, began with cohorts born c.1830. A new

rise in heights, the one with which we have long been familiar, probably

began with cohorts born during the last decade of the nineteenth century and

continued for about 60   years.
     We do not, at present, have data on final heights in America for

cohorts born before 1710, but the relatively flat profile between c.1710 and

c.1750 and the tall stature compared with the English in c.1750 suggests

that heights were probably rising rapidly for several decades before our

series begins. This inference is supported by data on food consumption in

Massachusetts discovered by MoMahon (1980). Wills deposited in Middlesex

 county between 1654 and 1830 indicate a sharp rise in the average amount of

 meat annually allotted to widows for their consumption.   Between c.1675 and

 c.1750 the average allotment increased from approximately 80 to

 approximately 168 pounds per annum: about half the increase took place by

 c.1710. The evidence both on stature and on food allotments suggests that

 Americans achieved an average level of meat consumption by the middle of the

 eighteenth century that was not achieved in Europe until well into the

 twentieth century (McMahon 1980; Holmes 1907; Fogel 1986).15

       Figure 1 and Table 7 reveal that Americans not only achieved modern

heights by the middle of the eighteenth century, but that they reached

levels of life expectation that were not attained by the general population

of England or even by the British peerage until the first quarter of the

twentieth century. Correction of the e10 series for the underrepresentation
                                                                               £

of   southerners may push the period estimate of e10 in c.1725 to about 147

years and the estimate for c.1775 to about 514 years, but these wculd still

be remarkably high values for e10. Although a more refined downward

adjustment will eventually need to be made to obtain a reliable national

average, there is at present no obvious reason for believing that the

figures shown were not representative of the Northeast.

      The early attainment of modern stature and relatively long life

expectation is surprising, and for that reason alone calls for further

verification. Yet in light of the evidence that has accumulated in recent

years it Is by no means unreasonable. By the second quarter of the

eighteenth century Americans had achieved diets that were remarkably

nutritious by European standards, and particularly rich in protein. The

American population was low in density, probably below the threshold needed

to sustain major epidemics of such diseases as smallpox. The low density

probably also reduced exposure to the crowd diseases of the nineteenth

century that took a heavy toll of lire in both England and America. This is

not to say that there were no epidemics in America between c.1725 and

c.1800, but with the exception of a few port cities, outbreaks of epidemic

diseases appear to have been much milder than in England.

      The discovery of the cycling in both height and e10, especially of the

amplitude of the movements, is so new and so surprising that many issues

will have to be pursued before doubts about the discovery can be set aside.

Not least of the tasks is the need to enlarge the genealogical sample and to

investigate characteristics that might be inducing spurious cycles or

exaggerating the amplitude of the cycles in the uncontrolled trend. In this

paper, however, it is the hitherto unsuspected pattern in the height series

and its strong correlation with the mortality series that I want to

emphasize.

3.2 Slaves, Poor London Boys, and Adult English Workers

     The second piece of evidence linking mortality and nutritional status

comes from data on slaves, on poor London boys, and on a more typical cross

section of English workers. Under abolitionist pressures the British

colonial office conducted two registrations of slaves in Trinidad within a

twenty month period, the first in 1813 and the second in 1815. Because the

aim of the registrations was to prevent smuggling of slaves, physical

characteristics, including height, were recorded. The second registration

also included information on the dispositon of all the slaves who were

registered in 1813. Friedman (1982) was the first to investigate the

differences between the height of the slaves who died and those who

survived. The difference Is evident in Table 8, which presents the heights

of surviving and non—surviving males under age 26. The extent of the

difference is more apparent in a regression format. Table 9 shows that

Trinidad—born males under age 26 who died between 813 and    1815 were 1.2
inches   shorter than those who survived. The corresponding figure for

females Is 0.9 inches.

     Table B not only shows that non—survivors were shorter than survivors,

but that even the survivors were exceedingly short by modern standards.

Figure 2 indicates how bad their nutritional status was.    In this diagram

3.3 Evidence From Regressions Between Height and Mortality

        Table 9 revealed a strong correlation between height and mortality in

Trinidad. This relationship has been investigated further by John (198M)

who ran a series of logit regressions relating the probability of dying

between 1813 and 1815 to a number of variables including height. Among

adults and children under age 15, the elasticity of the death rate with

respect to height averaged about                              The effect of height on the death

rate appears to have been greater among young children than adults, and on

males than on females. There are reasons for believing that the effect of

height (or length) on mortality rates would be greatest for infants,

especially neonates, although this proposition cannot be tested against the

Trinidad sample because both infants and infant deaths were undercounted by

margins that render them of little use.

        Floud (1983b; 1985b) has assembled data for eight European nations over

the years from 1880 to 1970 which permit an examination of the relationship

between adult male height and mortality.17 Equations (2) and (3) present

the results of regressions which related both the crude death rates and

infant mortality rates to height (numbers in parentheses are t values):

    the heights of Trinidad—born male slaves, at. ages from infancy to maturity,

    are superimposed on a set of curves which describe the current British

    standard for assessing the adequacy of physical development. The curve

    marked tt5Oth centile" gives the average height at each age among generally

    well—nourished persons in Great Britain today. Also shown on the diagram

    are the heights of U.S. male slaves (which come from documents designed to

    prevent smuggling of slaves into the U.S.), the height of poor adolescent

    boys in London during the last half of the eighteenth century, and the

    height of more typical English workers at maturity c.1800.

         Figure 2 shows that during early childhood slaves in both Trinidad and

    the U.S. were exceedingly malnourished. The figures for ages 0.5 and 1 .5

    are probably biased downward because the legs of the children were not fully

    stretched out when they were measured. But at ages 2.5 and 3.5 the children

    were walking and would have been measured in a standing position. Yet they

    were still exceedingly short by modern standards, falling at or below the

    0.1 oentile. Such poor development is indicative of kwashiorkor and other

    diseases caused by severe protein—calorie malnutrition (PCM). Although the

    gap with modern height standards was reduced after age 3, it remained in a

    range suggesting at least mild to moderate FCM through age 8. Between ages

    10 and 17 the growth patterns of U.S. and Trinidad slaves diverged, with the
I

    heights   of U.S. slaves climbing into the normal range, while the heights of

    Trinidad slaves fluctuated in the range of moderate to severe PCM. By the

    mid—twenties, U.S. slaves were well into the normal range and Trinidad-born

    slaves were borderline normal. Thus, it appears that the diet that U.S.

    slaves received when they began working at adult tasks was good enough not

    only to sustaintheir work effort but to permit a substantial degree of

    catoh—up growth as well. In the oase of Trinidad slaves, however, the diet

appears to have been inadequate to permit the same degree of catch—up, given

the character of the physical environment.

     Figure 2 suggests that nutritional deficiencies in utero and in early

childhood, rather than the overwork or underfeeding of adults, were the main

cause of the relatively high death rate of U.S. slaves. This possibility is

supported by available data on the death rates. Figure 3 indicates that it

was excess death rates of slave children under 5 that accounted for the

difference between the overall death rates of U.S. slaves and U.S. whites

during the late antebellum era. Moreover, the fact that U.S. slaves and

whites had similar life expectations after age 20 suggests that it was not

the general virulence of the disease environment but conditions specific to

young children. J. Campbell's (19814) examination of a large cotton

plantation in Georgia revealed a correlation between the infant death rate

and the intensity with which planters worked pregnant women. Steckel

(198'la) has also found evidence that overwork of pregnant women increased

the stillbirth and neonatal death rates. His examination of the monthly

pattern of a sample of such deaths indicated that these rates were highest

among the babies of women whose first trimester coincided with the planting

season and who were in their third trimester when the peak period of

harvesting occurred.

     The small heights at ages 2.5 and 3.5 suggest not only that fetal

malnutrition was prevalent but that chronic undernourishment was widespread

during infancy and early childhood. Breastfeeding of slave babies was

common   throughout the South, but its average duration is uncertain. On some
of the larger plantations most of the infants may have been at least
partially   weaned within 3 or l months.        Plantation records which describe

the diets of weaned infants and young children suggest that it was ample in
                                      52


calories but low in proteIn. Gruels and porridges, usually made with

cornmeal and sometimes containing milk, were a common fare. After age 3

these were supplemented to some extent by vegetable soups more likely to

contain lard than meat, potatoes, molasses, grits, hominy, and cornbread.

These more balanced diets contributed to catch—up growth between ages 3 and

8, although even the eight—year—olds were still quite short by modern

standards (Fogel 1986). Both the available descriptions of the diets of

young children and the small stature of children, especially those under age

3, are consistent with the evidence on protein deficiency culled from the

antebellum medical reports by Kiple and King (1981). They argue that

frequent descriptions of the "glistening fat and corpulent paunches" of

young children, the frequent listing of "dropsy" and "swelling" as a cause

of death, and the concern of southern physicians with "the distention of

slave children's stomachs," suggest that kwashiorkor or prekwashiorkor was

prevalent.

     In Trinidad as in the U.S. the exceedingly small stature of slaves

under 3 suggests intrauterine malnutrition of fetuses. But in th case of

Trinidad consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, which retards fetal

development and induces a number of other abnormalities that are referred to

as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, may have been a complicating factor. On

sugar plantations liberal rations of rum were usually provided to slaves,

especially during harvest time. Thus, although the absence of catch—up

growth before age 3 may indicate that the early childhood diet was very low

in protein, it could also reflect the residual effect of Fetal Alcohol

Syndrome. However, since Trinidad slaves had a weaker adolescent growth

spurt and a lower final height than U.S. slaves, the nutrients available for

adolescent growth were obviously less in Trinidad than in the slave South.
                                      53


Not only was the nutrient intake of Trinidad slaves relatively low, but the

more virulent disease environment of Trinidad undoubtedly exercised

relatively greater claims against that intake. it is doubtful that adult

slaves in Trinidad could have worked harder than U.S. slaves; the nutrient

value of their diet would not permit it (Sheridan 1985). But in

combination, the claims of work and disease and the disfunct ions caused by

alcohol appear to have left Trinidad slaves with a lower net nutrition to

sustain an adolescent growth spurt than U.S. slaves.

     There are no measurements of the stature of the poor London boys during

infancy or early childhood, but their heights between ages 13 and 16 are one

to two inches less than those of Trinidad—born slaves of the same ages. Nor

was this gap made up during the late years of adolescence. Tanner (1982)

has estimated that the height of the poor London boys at maturity was just

62 inches, about three inches below the adult height of Trinidad slaves. It

thus appears likely that some combination of intrauterine malnutrition, poor

weaning diet, and an adolescent diet inadequate to sustain catch-up growth

(under the conditions of their environment) stunted the physical development

of poor English boys between 1750 and 1800. When Tanner assessed this

evidence (1981, p. 158) he said that the causes of such short stature, which

persisted into adulthood without an acute retardation of the teenage growth

spurt,

     have to be sought in early childhood and even the fetal period.

     Severe malnutrition of the pregnant mother followed by chronic

     and severe undernutrition of the infant could cause this result.

     More likely still is a low birthweight and/or a low weight gain

     in infancy caused by injurious substances breathed or eaten by

     the pregnant mother and the newborn child.

The substances to which he referred included opium, laudanuin, and morphia

which he pointed out were the ingredients of popular patent medicines for

children and which are thought to have been widely used by mothers, unaware

of their contents, to keep their children quiet while they worked at home or

in factories. When these "elixirs" and "cordials" were administered from

birth they often led to a permanent stillness (Pinchbeck and Hewett 1969;

Berridge and Edwards 1981).

     Conditions of life were far more deleterious for the poor London boys

than the generality of English workers. These boys, who represented the

poorest of the English lower classes, were drawn largely from that fifth of

english families that were unemployed or at best partially employed. They

lived in the most crowded and virulent slums of London, many were homeless

(Floud and Wachter 1982), and as Tanner has suggested, many of them were

probably victims of toxic substances that were ingested while they were in

utero or early in infancy. Evidence that the nutritional status of most

English workers was superior to that of the poor London boys is also

presented in Figure 2, which shows the mean final height of the pool of men

from which the recruits into the Royal Marines were drawn c.1800. Although

this pool included Londoners, the majority were residents of the southern

and northern counties and of the Midlands. Artisans and craftsmen from both

rural and urban areas were well represented in the ranks of the Royal

Marines and so were common laborers from both rural and urban areas.

Analysis of this broad cross section indicates that the mean height of the

English working class as a whole near the beginning of the nineteenth

century was about 614.5 inches, which is just a shade below the final height

of Trinidad slaves, but about 2.5 inches greater than the final height of

the poor London boys.

3.3 Evidence From Regressions Between Height and Mortality

        Table 9 revealed a strong correlation between height and mortality in

Trinidad. This relationship has been investigated further by John (198M)

who ran a series of logit regressions relating the probability of dying

between 1813 and 1815 to a number of variables including height. Among

adults and children under age 15, the elasticity of the death rate with

respect to height averaged about                              The effect of height on the death

rate appears to have been greater among young children than adults, and on

males than on females. There are reasons for believing that the effect of

height (or length) on mortality rates would be greatest for infants,

especially neonates, although this proposition cannot be tested against the

Trinidad sample because both infants and infant deaths were undercounted by

margins that render them of little use.

        Floud (1983b; 1985b) has assembled data for eight European nations over

the years from 1880 to 1970 which permit an examination of the relationship

between adult male height and mortality.17 Equations (2) and (3) present

the results of regressions which related both the crude death rates and

infant mortality rates to height (numbers in parentheses are t values):

                      that variable

     From these equations it can be seen that a one percent increase in

height was associated with a change in infant mortality rates that was three

times as large as the corresponding change in crude mortality rates. In

both equations height has an independent effect on mortality rates, even

after controlling for per capita income and time. Indeed, the addition of

time to these regressions had virtually no effect on the coefficients of

height, although it reduced the coefficient on per capita income in equation

(2) by more than half, and in equation (1) it made the coefficient of per

capita income statistically insignificant. Equation (2) Implies that the

rise in heights accounted for 39 percent of the decline in the infant

mortality rate and per capita income accounted for another 27 percent,

leaving only about 33 percent attributable to the unknown factors which are

measured by time.18

     There is a question regarding the interpretation that should be placed

on the coefficients of height and per capita income when both are included

in the regression. Steckel's (1983) analysis suggests that when per capita

income is held constant, height becomes a proxy for the degree of inequality

in the income distribution. His regression on adult height implies that a

one percent change in the Gini ratio (holding the level of income constant)

had about four times as large an effect on mean heights as a one percent

change in the level of per capita income (holding the Gini ratio constant).
                                      57


    Equations (2) and (3) suggest that height and income together were only

about half as important in explaining the decline in the crude death rate

between 1880 and 1970 as in explaining the decline in infant death rates in

the eight countries covered by these equations. Even this last statement

tends to exaggerate the effect of improvements in income and nutrition on

the decline in adult mortality rates since infant death rates represent as

much as a quarter of the crude death rate in high mortality regimens such as

those which existed in Europe during the nineteenth century. Of course, the

crude death rate is a poor proxy for life expectation since it is so

sensitive to variations in age structure. Nevertheless, when considered in

conjunction with the Trinidad regressions, equations (2) and (3) add to the

evidence that the mortality rates of infants and very young children are

more sensitive to nutritional status than the mortality rates of adolescents

and adults.19

                                .   Discussion
     In combination, the several pieces of evidence make a fairly strong

case for the view that nutritional status had a significant impact on

mortality rates. Yet even those scholars who are skeptical of nutritional

arguments acknowledge that nutrition is a relevant consideration. The real

issues are the size of the nutritional contribution to the long—term decline

in mortality and the locus of its impact. Much work remains before it will

be possible to provide an adequate resolution of these issues. But I

believe that a provisional estimate of the nutritional contribution is

possible and might be useful.

14.1 A Provisional Estimate of Improvements in Jutritional
Status on the Long—Term Decline in Mortality

     I will first estimate the impact of improvements in nutritional status

on non—infants. Because of the absence of data a more indirect approach is

required for infants. This illustrative calculation will be applied to the

British case.

     Let us begin by supposing that the nutrition of working class English

males c.1800 had been improved to the point that they were able to achieve

modern stature. Then their mean final height would have increased from 514.5

to 69.5 inches, which is an increase of 7.75 percent.2° How much of an

impact would such an improvement in nutritional status have had on

mortality? As previously noted, the Trinidad sample revealed that the

elasticity of the death rate of non—infants with respect to height is about

-1 .14. Hence, a 7.75 percent increase in the final height of males would

have reduced the non—infant death rate by about 11 percent (—1.1; x 7.75 =   -
10.85).
     The Trinidad registrations undercounted mortality so badly that they

cannot be used to estimate reliably the elasticity of infant mortality with

respect to height. We can circumvent this problem by using the schedule

that relates neonatal death rates to birth weight.21 The probability of

dying at given birth weights is very high at weights below 2,501 grams (5.5

pounds). The schedule which relates the probability of dying to birthweight

is stable below 2,501 grams. It varies little from one socioeconomic group

to another within a nation or even across nations. This stability is

evident in Figure 1422

     Mean birth weights vary greatly with the nutritional status of

populations (Eveleth and Tanner 1976; WHO 1980). This point is illustrated

    in Figure 5. The lines on this graph are normal approximations of the

    frequency distributions of birth weights.23 Birth weight is represented on

    the vertical axis, and the horizontal axis represents z scores (deviations

    of birthweight from the mean measured in units of the standard deviation).

    Hence, the cumulative frequency distribution is represented by a straight

    line. The lowest line represents the distribution of U.S. non—whites in

    1960. They had a mean birth weight of 3,128 grams and, as indicated by

    Figure 5, about 13 percent of the neonates weighed less than 2,501 grams at

    birth. The second line is the distribution of birth weights for lower class

    women in Bombay (Jayant 19611). Figure 5 indicates the mean birth weight in

    this population was just 2,525 grams. In this case nearly half (116 percent)

    of the births were below the critical level, although the women in the

    sample were not the lowest of the low.

         The third curve is my estimate of the probable distribution of the

    birth weights of the children of English workers c.1800.24 In deriving this

    distribution I employed established correlations between height and birth

    weight as well as both published and unpublished information on the final

    heights of English workers developed by Floud and Wachter. These sources

    suggest that the distribution of the birth weights in this class c.1800 had

•   a mean of 2,276 grams, which is about 2119 grams (about a half pound) below

    the average in the deliveries of the lower class women in Bombay. It

    follows that about 79 percent of the births among English workers of c.1800

    were at weights below 2,501 grams.25

    distribution of their birth weights. The product of these two columns

    yields an implied neonatal death rate of 26.8 per 1,000 which, of course,

    was also the actual death rate. If, however, this U.S. population had had

    the distribution of the birth weights of the English workers c.1800 which I

    have estimated, their neonatal death rate would have been 173.0 per thousand

    (see Column 3). The implication of Table 10 is that improvements in

    nutrition sufficient to have shifted the mean birth weight from 2,276 grams

    to 3,128 'ams would have reduced the infant death rate by 83 percent

    [1 - (148,9 +   258.3)        0.83].26

         Equation 5 can be used to estimate the overall contribution of

    improvements in nutritional status to the decline in English mortality

         Since the age—standardized death rate actually declined by about 69

    percent, equation (6) implies that improvements in nutritional status

    accounted for about 141         percent   of the total decline in the age—standardized

    English mortality rate since 1800. This figure is neither inconsequential
nor everything. It shows that although improvements in nutrition made a

substantial contribution to the decline in English mortality, other factors

accounted for the majority of the deoline. The main impact of the

nutritional contribution was on the infant death rate. The reduction in

non—infant deaths that may be attributed to nutrition account for just 12
                                                                29
percent of the total decline in English mortality since 1800.        Plausible

upper and lower bounds on the variables in equation (5) indicate that

fl   10 probably bounds the nutritonal contribution at all ages. It should

be emphasized that these figures refer not merely to the diet but also to

the other factors that affected the nutrients available for growth.3°

14.2 A Possible Explanation for the Peerage Paradox

     Although the calculation suggests a more modest role for nutrition than

some have argued, other scholars may find even four—tenths is much too high

a number, since the question about the peerage is still unanswered. If

nutrition was so important, why did the English peerage have virtually the

same mortality as the general population until the beginning of the

eighteenth century? And why did life expectation of peers improve so

rapidly after 1750 when no great change in their diet is apparent?

     First, there is a general point which may not be of great quantitative

significance in the resolution of the peerage paradox, but which bears on

the context in which that issue ought to be considered. Some of the work on

the changing epidemiology of Europe suggests that the potential leverage of

nutritional statuson mortality rates may have increased during the

eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Since nutritional status does not have

an equal influence on the outcome of every disease, the prevalence of




                                                                                 4

different   diseases among different classes, arid within different

geographical areas, will obviously affect the impact of nutritional factors

art fluctuations in mortality rates. Table 11 classifies diseases according

to whether nutritional status is likely to influence their outcome. Taken

in conjunction with studies of the epidemiology of medieval and early mcdern

Europe by Creighton (1891), Hatcher (1977), }1elleiner (1967), McNeill

(1976), Appleby (1980), Kunitz (1983) and others, this classification

suggests that diseases in which nutritional influence is minimal or

equivocal (such as plague, malaria, smallpox, typhus, and influenza) may

have had a greater impact on mortality before 1750 than after it. For

reasons that are still unclear, the prevalence of these diseases declined in

Europe between 1700 and the mid—nineteenth century, and there was an

increase in the prevalence of those infectious diseases in which the

influence of nutrition is large. The possibility that there was a shift in

the distribution of diseases suggests that the impact of nutritional status

on mortality rates may have increased after 1750. However, whether such a

shift actually took place, and its quantitative significance if it did, is

still in dispute.31

     A point more directly relevant to the resolution of the peerage paradox

is that investigators searching for the possible influence of nutrition on

the longevity of peers appear to have dwelt on the wrong issue: the diet of

adults. As we have seen, nutritional status has its greatest impact on the

mortality Or   infants,   not on adults. The fact that dukes and earls had an

abundance of food as adults does not mean they were well nourished in

infancy or in early childhood. Weanling peers of the eighteenth century did

not eat joints of beef, but like weanling peasants, dined on a pap or watery

gruel. During this era privilege and wealth did not insure a diet or a
     -                                    67


nutritional   status for the upper class infants and young children that was

better than that experienced by the common people. Although the housing,

the clothing, and some aspects of the personal care of upper class infants

probably was better than that received by their lower class counterparts1

these advantages do not appear to have affected the infant and early

childhood mortality rates of the peerage during the first half of the

eighteenth century. Examination of the Hollingsworth (1977) mortality

schedules indicates that 60 percent of the Increase in the life expectation

between the cohorts of 1700—21! and of 1900-24 was due to the decline in

deaths under age 10. Indeed, if the peerage had continued to suffer the

     value of 1700—24 in 1900—24, but experienced the improved mortality

rates of the twentieth century at all other ages, then the life expectancy

of the peers (both sexes combined) born during 1900—24 would not have been

65.0 but only 46.4.

     Furthermore, the fact the English nobility was rich enough to afford a

good diet does not imply that they actually enjoyed a good diet.

Considerable evidence suggests that, as G.R. Elton recently put it, the

English nobility of the late medieval and early modern eras was often

afflicted by "bad nutrition" (an abundant but unhealthy diet) while the

lower classes often suffered from an "inadequate diet (hunger)."32 Studies

of per capita rations and annual food expenditures in the estate account

books of noble households indicate that although aristocratic diets were

abundant in calories and   proteins,   they were deficient in vitamins A, C, and

D, due partly to a dietary theory that viewed "greenstuff as a danger to

health" and partly to a class prejudice against milk, cheese, and eggs (Dyer

1983, pp. 196, 207). Consequently, lower class diets, though often

inadequate in quantity, were often "more varied" than those of the upper
                                            68


classes. Peasants "ate all types of         corn,   not just wheat" and "the   peasant

table was    more likely to carry the dairy produce and vegetables that the

nobility despised" (Dyer 1983, p. 209). The hallmark of aristocratic diets

before 1700, aside from their abundance (or superabundance) in calories and

meats, was     the   regular availability of wines and spices.

     The huge quantities of wine and ale consumed in aristocratic

households, not only in England but throughout Europe, raises still another

issue, one which bares both on neonatal and late—age mortality rates. The

standard ration of drink for the inferior members of noble households was a

gallon of ale per day, while the superior members drank both ale and wine,

with wine constituting as much as half of the daily intake of fluids

(Drummond and Wilbraham 1939; Pullar 1970; Wilson 1973; Dyer 1983; Thurgood

19811).     So prominent were these alcoholic beverages in aristocratic diets

that they accounted for one quarter or more of the daily consumption of

calories (Drummond and Wilbraham 1939; Dyer 1983; i-{eckscher 1954). The

lavish consumption of ale and wine was stimulated by the fact that even in

aristocratic households much of the fish and meat were heavily salted.33 A

diet heavy in salt and alcohol probably increased the incidence of liver,

renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular diseases among peers who

survived to middle and late ages, and may have contributed to the high

mortality rates of peers at ages 110 and over. But it was in utero that

 dietary habits of the peerage were most deadly, sinoe ladies of the realm

were apparently consuming an average of between three and nine ounces of

 absolute alcohol per day——more than enough to produce a high incidence of

 Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and      Fetal   Alcohol Effects.311

          Thus, despite their enormous wealth and command over resources, the

 diet cf the English aristocracy during the sixteenth and seventeenth
                                        69

 centuries   was deleterious to health. Their diet was bad partly because of

 nutrients that were excluded but mainly because of toxic substances that

 were included. Alcohol may have been the most lethal of these substances.

 In the quantities in which it was apparently consumed by preant women, it

 not only increased late fetal deaths and the
                                                neonatal mortality rate of the
 peerage, but also increased the risk to surviving infants into the second

 and third years of life (Abel 1982).
                                        By impairing the ability of the body
 to assimilate nutrients for three years or more after birth, Fetal Alcohol

 Syndrome severely exacerbated the deficiencies in the weaning and early

 childhood diets and may have undermined the health of many peers for the

balance of the life cycle.

     The peerage paradox thus appears to have arisen from the mistaken

proposition that because the adult diet of English aristocrats was abundant

in grains and meat, it was a "good" diet.    That proposition overlooked the
role of toxic substances in upper class diets, substances which were harmful

to adult health and were disastrous for fetal development as well as for

development during infancy and early childhood. The proposition also

overlooked the critical nature of the weaning diet, which was as inadequate

for peers as for peasants. These neglected factors are certainly relevant

to an explanation for the exceedingly high infant and childhood mortality

rates of the peerage before 1725. They also help to a000unt for the decline

in these mortality rates after 1725. The relevant point here is not merely

what was added to the aristocratic diet between 1700 and 1900 but also the

gradual elimination from that diet of the toxic substances that were so

lethal to the young and the unborn (Mingay 1963; Pullar 1970; Wilson 1973).

The children of the upper classes were the beneficiaries of the reform in

mariners that were in part a lagged response to Puritanism and other austere
                                       70



religious movements of the seventeenth century, in part a reflection of the

Enlightenment, and in part a reaction to the devastating consequences of the

gin mania of 1720—1750 (Trevelyan 19142; Warner and Rosett 1975). One of the

byproducts of this reform that affected both the nutritional status and

mortality rates of infants was the gradual disappearance of the upper—class

practice of putting out infants with wet nurses (Mingay 1963; Pullar 1970;

Sussman 1975; Sussman 1977; Trumbach 1978; Stone 1977; Flinn 1981).

       The suggested resolution to the peerage paradox points to the need for

further research on past practices that affected nutritional status during

infancy, the weaning ages, and in utero. What was the temporal pattern by

which the new manners diffused through the upper classes of England and how

did this pattern affect the consumption of alcohol, opiates, and other toxic

substances by pregnant mothers, infants, and young children? Was it

fashionable in court during some periods for pregnant women to keep their

weight gain low? To what extent did the weaning diet of peers expose them

to virulent infections from contaminated water or raw milk and when did this

risk diminish? Research into these issues should, of course, be extended to

cover the experience of the lower as well as of the upper classes. Study of

the leads and lags between changes in the cultural standards of the upper

and lower classes may go a long way toward explaining the leads and lags

between the changes in their respective mortality rates.

14.3   The Wrigley—Schofield-Lee Paradox
        In interpreting the regressions between mortality rates and wheat

 prices, it has often been assumed that the price of wheat was so highly

 correlated with all other grain prices that it could serve as a proxy for

 the price of food. It has also been assumed that food shortages would be

 reflected in their price. Although the second assumption is quite

reasonable, it does not follow that a large rise in prices necessarily

implies an equally large decline in the supply of food. That would be the

case only If the demand elasticity Cc) for food was one.      However, if the

demand elasticity for grains was only between 0.25 and     0.1 •   then even the

so—called "exceptionally high" fluctuations in grain prices (20 percent or

more above trend) would imply shortfalls in grain yields that were only

between 2 and 5 percent below the trend (see Table 12).      With a highly

inelastic demand for grains, even the weak relationship between mortality

and wheat prices found by various investigators would be consistent with the

nutritional case. Their regressions would then imply that mortality rose

even when declines in the supply of food were quite small.         Thus, the

critical question raised by the studies of correlations between wheat prices

and mortality is the size of demand elasticities for wheat, for grains, and

for food as a whole, in England during the early modern era.

     The analytical framework recently developed by Amaryta Sen (1981)

facilitates the marshalling of the evidence needed to answer this question.

Sen called attention to the fact that certain recent famines in

 underdeveloped nations occurred despite abundant harvests.        These famines

were caused not by natural disasters but by dramatic redistributions of

 "entitlements" to grain. The mechanism which promoted the redistribution of

 entitlements was a sharp rise in the price of grain relative to wages or

 other types of income received by the.lower classes. In the "great Bengal

 famine" of 19i3, for example, the exchange rate between wages and foodgrains

                             despite an "exceptionally high" supply of grain.      In
 declined by 86   percent,
 this case the rise in grain prices had nothing to do with the bountifulness

 of the harvest, but was driven by forces outside of the agricultural sector.

 The Bengal famine, Sen points out, was a "boom famine" caused by "powerful
                                      73


inflationary pressures" unleashed by a rapid expansion of public

expenditures (pp. 66, 75).

     The relevance of the entitlement approach to the interpretation of the

economic demography of the early modern era does not depend on the source of

the rise in grain prices that triggers the redistribution of entitlements.

It is the similarity in the structural characteristics of traditional

societies of the past and of low—income countries today that makes the

entitlement approach pertinent (Tilly 1983; Hufton 1983; Appleby 1979a; Post

1976; Fljnn 1974). At the root of these structural similarities is the

highly unequal distribution of wealth and the overarching importance of land

as a source of wealth. These twin characteristics lead directly to two

other structural features: First, they cause the price elasticity of the

total demand for grains to be quite low. Second, they drive a large wedge

between the grain demand elasticities of the upper and the lower classes,

with the elasticity of the lowest classes having a value that may be 10 or

20 times as large as the elasticity of the class of great land magnates.

     It is these large class differences in demand elasticities (caused by

social organization) rather than wide year—to—year swings in harvest yields

(caused by variations in weather or other natural phenomena) that were the

source of the periodic subsistence crises that afflicted late medieval and

early modern England. Once the yield—to—seed ratio reached four and

carryover inventories exceeded a month or two of the annual supply (which

probably occurred in England before 1500), large weather—induced reductions

in the normal national supply of foodgrains probably became exceedingly

rare. The evidence at hand suggests that during the 331 years covered by

the analysis of Wrigley, Schofield, and Lee there were probably not more

than seven or eight years (and there may have been as few as three) during

aristocracy and gentry, the yeomanry, artisans and shopkeepers, and common

laborers (including the unemployed). Servants working in the households of

the upper classes are included with these classes, since their masters

provided the grains which they consumed.        In other words, the population

embraced by the landlords (class 1 in Table 13) includes not only the

landlords and their immediate families but all of their retainers, high and

low. Table 13 also presents my estimates of share of the English population

represented by each of the classes, the normal share of each class in the

annual consumption of grain (t). and of 6' , iv., and c. The population
                                                                           follow
shares are based on King's table (Laslett 198k).36 The values of

from the population shares and estimates of the per capita consumption of

rains and calories in each class indicated by recent studies (including

Everitt 1967; Kerridge 1968; Appleby 1979b; Dyer 1983; Shamas 1983; Shainas

198'1; Lindert 1985; Druznmond and Wilbraham 1958; williams 1985). The values

of       shown   in column 2 imply that landlords and yeomen consumed about 50
percent more      grain per capita than the national average (much of it as ale

and spirits), that shopkeepers and craftsmen consumed the national average.
and that common laborers and paupers consumed about 50 percent of the
national average. Allowing for waste and storage losses, these values of
 imply   that the average caloric intake of the poor was at about the mean

 level of Afghanistan or Bangladesh today (World Bank 1984), while the

 landlords   and yeomen were   at the level of U.S. farmers c.1850 (Fogel and

 Engerman 197U). The values of e,               and    are based on available

 evidence    regarding the share of gross farm income originating in grains
 during the      early modern era and cross—sectional studies of less developed

 countries today with income levels and agricultural sectors similar to those
                                           37
 of early modern England (Fogel 1985).
                                            77


     One important implication of Table 13 is that although laborers were

about 4k percent of the population, they only accounted for 22 percent of

the normal consumption of foodgrains and that landlords (who with their

retainers and servants represented only 11 percent of the population)

accotmted for nearly as large a share of consumption. Another implication

of Table 13 is that both the magnitude and the direction of the effect of a

rise in grain prices on elasticities was quite different for different

classes (see columns 6 and 7). In the case of landlords the income—

compensated price elasticity is positive, even though the income—fixed price

elasticity is negative. This change in sign reflects the fact that

landlords were not only consumers of grain but owners of large surpluses.

In their case the rise in prices had two effects: as owners of surpluses the

rise in grain prices increased their income, while as consumers it reduced

their income. For landlords the producer's effect was so much stronger than

the consumer's effect that rising grain prices would have led them to

increase their consumption of grain. In the case of yeomen both effects

were also present, but the income effect was not strong enough to have

increased their grain consumption with rising prices; however, it did cut

the income—compensated elasticity to one—third of the income—fixed

elasticity. In the case of laborers only the consumption effect was

present. Although the income—fixed elasticity is already high, the income-

compensated elasticity is more than twice as high.

     The values set forth in Table 13 make it possible to estimate aggregate

elasticity of the consumption demand for grains Cs0), by making use of the

relationship set forth in equation (8):

     (8)           —       + •22   +
                                       33
                                            +


Substituting   the appropriate values of         and   into equation (8) yields
                                                 78



                       = (0.16)(—0.02) +       (0.51)(0.0'4)   ÷   (0.11)(Oifl)   +


                         (0.22)(1.17)     —   0.320.
Thus, the estimates of class elasticities in Table 13 imply that the

elasticity of the aggregate consumption demand was well below 0.5, even

though common laborers and paupers, who accounted for nearly half the

population had an elasticity in excess of one. However, as equation                         (8)


indicates, it is shares in consumption rather than in population that

determine the value of e. If it were the population share that mattered,

Sc would be nearly twice the indicated size and would fall between demand

elasticities of artisans and laborers, who constituted the majority of the

population. As it is,               falls below the demand elasticity of artisans

because of the heavy weight given to the elasticities of landlords and

yeomen who, although a minority cf the population, accounted for two—thirds

of consumption.

        Although s is the price elasticity of the aggregate foodgrain demand,

it is not the price elasticity of aggregate demand, which is given by

equation (10):

        (10)             =   6€   +   (16)€
where

                   c         the price elasticity of demand for grains used as seed

                             and feed

                   6 — the        share of the total crop normally used as seed and

                             feed

 Available evidence suggests that about 25 percent of grains were reserved

 for seed and feed and that the demand for this intermediate product was

 moderately inelastic (about 0.6) but not as inelastic as is often implicitly

 assumed.8 Substituting these values into equation (9),                   results     in:
                                           79


     (11)          a 0.25 x 0.6   + 0.75   x 0.32 a 0.39

     Equation (11) gives the "normal" value of ——the value of           when

yields are close to the mean (say within plus or minus one standard

deviation). We have not yet considered the case in which the deviation from

normality is large enough to trigger significant declines in exchange

entitlements. Table 1U shows that such declines could be triggered with

surprisingly small shortfalls in output. Even a shortfall in output as

small as 8 percent, triggers significant shifts in the shares of grain

consumed by different classes. In the case of landlords, the rise in their

share more than offsets the decline in output so that their per capita

consumption rises slightly. In the case of laborers, however, the decline

in their share reinforces the decline in output so that their per capita

consumption is down by 23 percent. It is worth noting that although output

declines by 8 percent, aggregate foodgrain consumption only declines by 6

percent because grain reserved for feed and seed declines by twice as much

(13 percent) as foodgrain consumption. As a result the feed and seed share

of the reduced crop declines from 25 to 22 percent. With a supply that is

15 percent below the normal level, the interclass distribution of per capita

consumption Is so greatly exacerbated that the per capita grain consumption

of laborers and paupers falls to less than 60 percent of its normal level.

     The sharp decline in consumption of the laboring class (when Q a 0.85)

is due to the combination of its high elasticity of demand (CU a 1 .17) and

the sharp rise in price (P goes to 1.65).       It should be noted that more than

a fifth of the indicated price rise is due not directly to a decline in

Q   from 1 to 0.85, but to the rise in the value of e. as the price

increases. If         had remained constant, the decline in   would have led to

a 52 percent increase in prices instead of a 65 percent increase. In other

words, one of the effects of the shifting distribution of entitlement is to

reduce both     and       (to 0.23 and 0.30 respectively). It follows that an

initial rise in prices tends to feed on itself, even in the absence of a

speculative demand or irrational hoarding, by increasing the share of grain

entitlements held by classes with a highly inelastic demand.

     The estimates in Table 14, together with the distribution of deviations

in grain prices from their trend, make it possible to assess the extent of

harvest failures in years of ttexceptionallylt high prices.39 Perhaps the

most important feature of the price distribution is that there are only 23

out of 198 observations (0.1162) between 1540 and 1737 in which the price

index deviates positively from the trend by as much as 25 percent. Using

0.37 as an estimate of       (the value implied by Table 1 for a 25 percent

rise in prices), this fact implies that the aggregate quantity of' grains

fell below the trend (or mean level) of quantity by as much as 0.0792 in
                                                              82


only 11.62 percent of the years. With the deviations in quantity ("yields")

normally distributed,                           the preceding points imply equation (12):

        (12)               1.20a = O.0792X

where

                           a       =    the standard deviation (SD) of deviations from the
                               g
                                        "normal" level (or trend) of quantity

                           Xg a         the     "normal" level (trend—level) of quantity, which is

                                        set equal to one.

Solving equation (12) for a results in a value of

        Thus, the standard deviation of the distribution of grain "yields"

(deviations in the quantity of all grains) is far smaller than the standard

deviation of the distribution of deviations in wheat prices, which over the

same 198 years was O.251J12 This is an important finding for the assessment

of investigations that have used the price of wheat as a proxy for the

physical quantity of all grains. The large difference between the two

standard deviations (of grain tlyieldsfl and of deviations in wheat prices)

implies that the elasticity of grain "yields" with respect to wheat prices

was substantially below that of e. This result is immediately apparent

from equation (13):

        Although it is often assumed that, except for the very rich, grains

were virtually the equivalent of the food supply in early modern England,

recent studies have revealed that meat, fish, game, dairy products,

vegetables, fruits, and nuts formed a significant part of the diet of other

classes, even of common laborers and paupers (Shamas 198k; Dyer 1983; Oddy

1983; Shamas 1983; Skipp 1978; Richardson 1976; Kerridge 1968; Everitt 1967;

Fussell 19kg; Drummond and Wilbraham 1958; of. Webster 18145). The

difficulty with the stylized approach to food supply is that it implicitly

assumes that °g (the SD of deviations around the trend in the quantity of

grain) is identical with o. (the SD of deviations around the trend in the

total food supply). As it turns out this assumption is unwarranted. In the

case of the all—agricultural-products price series, only five out of 198

observations (0.0253) between 151W and 1737 deviate positively from the

trend by as much as 25 percent. Hence, instead of equation (12) we have

equation (15):

        (15)              1.950f — O.O792Xf.

which yields a value for                      of 0.0141.        Now Cfw (the elasticity of the

quantity of food with respect to the price of wheat) follows from equation

(16):
                                0. 041            =
                           =

                                        314




where i'f is the coefficient of correlation between deviations in the

quantity of food and deviations in wheat prices.

     Equations (1E and (16) reveal the pitfall in the interpretation of

studies that used wheat prices as a proxy for shortfalls in the supply of

grain and of food. It was assumed that because wheat prices were highly

correlated with other food prices, that large positive deviations of wheat

prices implied not only large declines in the supply of wheat but in the

supply of grains as a whole and in the total supply of food. Equation (14)

shows that even if the correlation between grain "yields" and wheat prices

were perfect, what has been termed an "exceptional" deviation in wheat

prices (20 percent above trend) would only imply about a 5 percent decline

in the total supply of grains and (taking account of the shift away from

feed and seed) only about a it percent decline in the supply of foodgrains.

Consequently, far from representing serious nutritional deprivation, most

"exceptional" deviations in wheat prices fell within the range of "normal"

consumption of grains (although not necessarily of wheat). Even among

common laborers, who would have suffered from the adverse effect of a shift

in entitlements, a positive deviation in wheat prices of 20 percent would

imply a decline in per capita food consumption of about 9 percent——not a

catastrophe, but not trivial either for a class suffering from the chronic

malnutrition that accompanied a diet that probably averaged below 2,000

calories per capita. For the other three classes, the implied decline in

per capita consumption is negligible.

     The estimate of °g and o. developed from equations (12) and (15) makes

it possible to assess the extent to which the English population suffered

from generalized harvest failures during 15141—1871. A decline in grain

"yields" of as much as 10 percent (152Og) was a relatively rare event,
                                           85


occurring less than one year in fifteen. It is unlikely that England

suffered more than one 10 percent shortfall in the overall food supply

(2.1ikOf) after 1540. The estimated value of 6fw (assuming rf — 1) implies

that even in 1556 when the positive deviation in wheat prices was at its

highest post—1540 level (98 percent), the decline in the overall food supply

was about 10.5 percent. All but seven of the other poor harvests imply

grain shortfalls of less than 10 percent, foodgrain shortfalls of less than

8 percent, and overall food shortfalls of less than 7      percent
        The information in column 3 of Table 14 provides a basis for estimating

the effect of post—1540 harvest failures on the mortality rate. That column

shows that with total grain shortfalls of 8 percent, only the two lowest

classes would have had non—negligible reductions in their normal supply of

grain. In the case of the artisan class, much of the 8.8 percent reduction

in the apparent consumption of rains could have been offset by shifting

from inefficient to efficient forms of the extraction of calories (from beer

and ale, for example, to gruels and porridges) and by reducing storage

losses and waste (Walford 1970; Walter 1976; Stern 1964; Mathias 1959;

Fussell 1949; Drummond and Wilbraham 1958; Appleby 1978; McCloskey 1984).

Consequently, the demographic effect of harvest failures would have been

confined largely, if not exclusively, to the class of common laborers and

paupers, many of whom were unrelieved by public or private charity (Lindert

and Williamson 1983b; Lindert 1980). In this case, the gap between apparent

and effective    consumption was   probably quite small because the lower classes

could   not   indulge in inefficient forms of grain processing and consumption

to the same extent as the other classes. Moreover, lacking the wherewithal

to hold inventories of food, they were also spared the large inventory

losses of the period.

      On the other hand, part of the decline in the grain consumption of
                                         increased consumption of other foods,
laborers would have been offset bY an

garden vegetables, milk, and milk products (Drurnmond and Wilbraham
                                    1928). Equations (11) and (16) together
Stern 19614; Fussell 1949; Ashley

imply that about 40 percent of the decline in grain consumption would have
                                              of other foods. consequently, in

the shortfall in the grain supply would have had to have been about 13

                          0.130), an event that would have occurred just one

with respect to nutritional status of —1.4 (although that figure may be too

                                         then a shortfall in grains yields

 on the crude death rate (cdr) of the entire population (which is the

 statistic that has entered into studies which attempt to relate wheat prices

regular   and persistent malnutrition) was large since only one—fifth of

the years identified as famine years using wheat prices would represent

years in which there was actually a substantial increase in the national cUr

due to a shortfall in food. The basic point, however, is not that

regressions have been misspecified and the results misinterpreted. It is

rather that after c.1400 or c.1500, famines in England were rare events,

affecting a minority of the population, and accounting for a miniscule

proportion of accumulated deaths. Over the entire 331 years covered by the

Wrigley—schofield—Lee analysis it is unlikely that famine deaths accounted

for as much as 0.4 percent of the accumulated total deaths (0.16 x 0.024

O0038) Given the exceedingly small proportion of deaths due to famines,

the many factors (including non—famine malnutrition) that affected annual

death rates and the lack of controls for most of the relevant factors, the

highly aggregated level of the time—series analysis, and the use of wheat

prices as a proxy for food shortfalls, it is impressive that Lee was able to

pick up any mortality effect at all, let alone one which appears to be quite
                       146
close   to the mark.

     The Wrigley—Schofield—Lee results seemed paradoxical only because it

was widely assumed that the large swings in wheat prices represented

correspondingly large swings in the aggregate supply of food.4 When it is

recognized that food shortfalls of 7 percent or more were quite rare, it

becomes evident that their results neither contradict nor confirm the

nutritional hypothesis. They do demonstrate that famine mortality was a

minor factor in explaining both cumulated deaths and secular trends in the

death rate during 1541—1871 ,   but this finding does not eliminate chronic
                                                                              148
malnutrition as a significant component of pre—industrial mortality rates.

The "normal" distribution of shares in grain entitlements shown in Table 13
                                      88


and what is known about the course of agricultural production suggests that
until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, English laborers were about as badly

fed as the lower classes in such countries as India. Pakistan, and

Bangladesh shortly after World War II. This conclusion is consistent with

the currently available data on the heights of English laborers between 1760

and 1810. The impact of chronic malnutrition on English mortality rates

during the pre—industrial era remains an open issue.

'L11 Some Implications for the Standard of Living
Controversies in Europe and America

     The long and sustained upward movements in physical growth schedules in

Europe and the United States that began late in the nineteenth century and

continued through most of the twentieth century were a sharp break with the

past. Before the last quarter of the nineteenth century, only the United

States had experienced a long period of relatively rapid upward movement in

growth schedules, with most of it occurring before 1710. Between cohorts

born in 1710 and in 1780 final heights of native—born white American males

increased at a rate of only 0.25 centimeters per decade±9 During the next

century the final heights of Americans oscillated in a narrow band or

declined fairly sharply, losing about three centimeters in just two decades

beginning with cohorts born about 1830. Rapid upward shifts in growth

schedules probably did not resume until the last decade of the nineteenth

century. The new period of increase in final heights which lasted for about

60 years was more rapid than the increase experienced during the late

seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (Sokoloff and Villaflor 1982;

Margo and Steckel 1983; Fogel etal. 1983).

     The principal upward shift in English growth schedules before 1900 came

later and was shorter than that experienced in the United States. The mean

final height of English working—class males born c.1760 was about 624.5
                                      89


inches (which was about 9 centimeters below those of U.S. whites) and

remained more or less at that level for the next half century. The

succession of cohorts born between c.181O and c.18110 appears to have

experienced a fairly rapid upward shift in growth schedules, so that the

c.1840 cohort was about three centimeters taller at maturity than the c.1810

cohort. Thereafter, the upward shift in growth schedules slowed down so

that cohorts born half a century later were only about a centimeter taller

at maturity than their c.18140 counterparts (Sokoloff and Villaflor 1982;

Floud and Wachter 1982; Floud and Wachter 1983; Floud 1983a; Floud 1983b).

     There were also relatively constant growth curves for France between

c.1820 and c.1900, and for Belgium between c.1830 and c.1900. In both

countries heights at age 20 remained below 65.5 inches down through the end

of the nineteenth century (Floud 1983b). In the Netherlands and the

Scandinavian countries the laboring classes appear to have experienced

improved living conditions sometime during the third quarter of the

nineteenth century. In the case of the Netherlands, for example, mean adult

heights between 1865 and 1905 increased at about 1 centimeter per decade,

which is about five times as large as the British rate of increase during

the same period. Even so, the Dutch rate of increase during the late

nineteenth century was only half as great as the rate of increase during the

half century following World War I (Van Wieringen 1978).50

     Although the standard of living of the laboring classes in the United

States was quite high early in the nineteenth century by European standards,

it appears that the difference narrowed considerably over the course of the

nineteenth century, partly because U.S. height declined for about half a

century and partly because the heights of Europeans increased somewhat. At
                                          90


the end of the nineteenth century when the United States entered a new phase

of rapid upward shift in growth curves, living standards for U.S. workers,

as measured by final heights, were quite similar to those prevailing in

northwestern Europe, but they were still significantly better than those of

southern Europe. As late as 1900 the mean height of adult Italian males was

below 65 inches (Terrenato and Ulizzi 1983).

        In recent decades economists and economic historians have tended to

assume that    if   the "real wage" (an index of nominal wages divided by an

index of prices) was rising,      then the standard of living of workers was
rising.     Beginning with the late nineteenth century, but especially after

 1930 when large investments were made in the gathering of wage and price

data, older measures of the standard of living, such as weight, housing

 conditions, and mortality rates began to be abandoned in favor of the newer

 and presumably more comprehensive index. Criticisms have been made of the

 quality of the data from which long—term series of real wages were

 constructed (Von Tunzelniann 1979; Thirsk 1983) and far—reaching questions

 have been raised about what "real wages" actually measured, even when the
 indexes were ideally constructed (A.J. Taylor 1975). Nevertheless, the
 tendency    has been to employ "real wages" not just as a measure (or even as

 the principal measure) of the standard of living but sometimes to convert it

 into a synonym for the standard of living.

        The point is not that "real—wage" measures should be discarded but that

 the interpretation that has been placed on them needs to be reconsidered.

 We may be able to obtain a deeper understanding of the changing standard of

 living of workers, develop a subtler appreciation of the manifold dimensions

 of the phenomenon, if the information embodied in both real—wage indexes and

 measures of per capita income is reviewed in the light of the information
                                              91



contained in anthropometrjc measures, mortality and morbidity rates, and

other measures of living conditions that are now becoming available.

        What, for example, are we to make of a situation in which real wages

were rising rapidly, as apparently occurred in England during the last half
of the nineteenth century (Mitchell and Deane 1962 Matthews etal. 1982)
while   working—class heights remained at relatively low levels, showing

little increase over half a century? How should we characterize conditions

of workers in the United States between 1820 and 1860 if "real wages" were

generally constant or rising, sometimes rising quite rapidly (Williamson

1976; David and     Solar 1977),   but heights and   life   expectation were

decreasing?      During an era in which from 50     to 75 percent of the income of

workers was spent on food, is it plausible that the overall standard of
living of workers was improving if their nutritional status and life
expectations     were declining? These are not questions that can easily

resolved and I will not attempt to do so here. Rather, I want briefly to

sketch some of the new issues about the course of the standard of living

that are     suggested   by the anthropometric and demographic data. When "real

wages," per capita       income, and   other measures all move in   the same   direction

there is little need to probe into their exact meaning. The interesting

issues arise when the measures diverge, and it is on some of these issues

that I wish to focus.

       The   evidence so far developed on height and mortality rates suggests
that improvements in the living conditons of workers during the nineteenth
century   may have been more sporadic and uneven (both in time and among

subgroups    of workers) than is suggested by indexes of real wages or the
movements in per capita income. In England the period of rapid improvement
in the nutritional status of workers sees to have been confined largely to
                                        92


                                                                      there
the three decades following the end of the Napoleonic wars. In France
                                                                beginning of
was little change from the end of the Napoleonic wars until the
                                                                  status of the
the twentieth century.   In the United States, the nutritional

laboring classes, which was initially quite high by European standards,

appears to have deteriorated during
                                      the middle decades of the nineteenth


century.

     Although the substantial declines in both heights and life expectation

shown by Figure 1 are too new and provisional to be accepted without

substantial additional evidence, let us suppose for the moment that further
                                          findings. Will these series then
investigation supports the provisional

contradict prevailing estimates of fairly rapid increases in conventional

                                         Williamson and L.indert (1980) have
measures of per capita income? Since

 provided evidence that the inequality in the income distribution increased
                                    does not have an obvious answer. It is now
 during this period, the question

 necessary to probe more deeply into the magnitude, nature, sources, and

 locus of both gains in income and the increase in inequality. Rising

 inequality provides one way, although not the only way, of resolving the

 apparent anomaly between current estimates of rapidly rising per capita

 income and of declining heights during

 height, per capita income, and the

 final heights an increase of 100 percent in per capita income would just

 offset an increase in the Gini ratio of 0.066. it follows that current
                                              income and the estimated decline in
  estimates of the increase in per capita
                                        suggest that the Gini ratio increased by
  mean heights of 1.5 inches together

  about 0.17, going from perhaps 0.30 in c.1830 (the ourrent figure for
                                       93


Australia) to about 0.117, which is a plausible estimate of the Gini ratio

for the U.S. near the turn of the twentieth century (Sawyer 1976;
                                                                     Lebergott

1976; Williamson and Lindert 1980)1 Thus, the decline in final heights of

native—born U.S. white males may add to the evidence recently developed by

others which indicates that the middle quarters of the nineteenth century

witnessed significant increases in the inequality of the American income

distribution (Williamson and Linden 1980; Pessen 1973).

     It may seem odd to those unfamiliar with this body of evidence that

changes in height should be used as a measure of ohanges in the inequality

of the distributions of income and wealth. However, as Floud and Waohter

(1982) have recently pointed out, there was a time when height was the most

compelling and the most widely used index of inequality. Moreover, because

of the abundance of height data and their wide coverage of geographic

regions and socioeconomic groups it is possible to probe more deeply into

vexing issues regarding variations in the conditions of the population of

particular regions and occupations than has so far been possible with wage

data which are skimpy in their coverage of particular categories. Two

examples suggest the possibilities that now appear to be emerging.

     The first is drawn from the work on British sources. Data recently

collected by Floud on the British upper classes (1984) when combined with

his data on the lower classes make it possible to estimate how much of the

improvement in the average nutritional status in Great Britain over the past

century and a half has been due to a closing of the gap between the upper

and lower classes and how much was due to an upward shift in attainable

average height. By "attainable" I mean not genetically attainable but,

within genetic constraints, attainable under the most favorable prevailing

1830 and then declines. These curves indicate that about 85 percent of the
initial decline in the aggregate series was due to a decline in the mean

heights of farmers and other rural residents. The balance of the decline in

the aggregate series was due to the increased proportions of the population

experiencing the poor nutritional health conditions of the cities as well as

to declining heights among urban residents (cf. Margo and Steckel 1983).

     The deterioraticn in the mean final height of farmers apparent in the

last two cohorts of Figure 6 continued in subsequent decades. Native—born

farmers who were born c.1860 were about 1.5 inches shorter than those who

were born three decades earlier. Over the same period the final heights of

urban laborers declined by about 0.8 inches. Thus, although deteriorating

conditions in the cities and the shift of population from the countryside to

the cities played a role, they explain only about one—fifth of the decline

in the aggregate series shown in Figure 1 for cohorts born between c.1830

and c.1860. About four—fifths of the decline was due to a deterioration of

conditions   affecting growth in the rural areas.
        Current research is aimed at explaining this surprising decline in
rural    heights. One possibility is that an increasing proportion of the

native-born rural males were children of foreign—born parents.     It is likely

that foreign—born mothers were relatively malnourished during their own

developmental    years and that foreign—born parents generally had lower
incomes than native—born parents. Both factors would have made the children
of foreign—born parents shorter than the children of native—born parents.

Support for this hypothesis is found in a subsample of the Union Army

recruits which has been linked to the manuscript schedules of the 1860

census. This subsample reveals that in the rural areas native—born males of

 foreign parents were O.1 inches shorter in final height than native-born
                                        97


males of native—born parents. The effect. of parental ethnicity was even

greater in the cities, with children of foreign—born parents averaging 1.2

inches less in final heights than children of native—born parents. It thus

appears that the low incomes of foreign—born parents and the poor

nutritional status and health of foreign—born mothers had an effect on

children both in the cities and in the countryside, but that effect was

greater in the cities that in the countryside. It is plausible that as much

as half of the urban—rural differential in native-born heights was

associated with parental ethnicity.53

     The decline of heights in the rural areas is particularly puzzling.

The ethnic effect could only have accounted for a small share of the rural

decline, and the available evidence strongly suggests that the per capita

production of food, especially in the Midwest, increased between 1810 and

1860. There is, of course, the possibility that rural food consumption

declined, despite the increase in output. Steven B. Webb has recently

suggested that improved transportation links between farms and the cities

might have had two negative health effects in the rural areas:

     First, while railroads were lowering food prices in the cities

     and improving nutrition there, they may have raised farm gate -

     prices   and lowered nutrition there. Giving farmers the

     opportunity to trade corn for calico may raise their utility, or

     at least the parents' utility, but may also reduce caloric intake.

     Second, increased contact with the urban disease environment may

    have increased the spread of communicable diseases in the rural sector.

    Both of these possibilities certainly ought to be pursued, and they may

turn out to be right. Yet the evidence on the growth of per capita income

in the Midwest between 1830 arid 1860 is so compelling, and midwestern
                                          98


farmers as   a    class seem to have prospered so much during this era, that it

is not easy to accept the hypothesis that their food consunption declined,

let alone that it declined by enough to explain a decrease in height of more

than 1.5 inches (Bidwell and Falconer 1925; Berry 19143; G.R. Taylor 1951;

Easterlin 1975).
     Of course, not all rural residents were farmers, and not all farmers

shred equally in the a'arian prosperity. As much as 140        percent   of the

rural labor force of the North was employed in manufacturing, construction,

and trade (Yang 198k; Moen 1985). This was an age in which many sectors of

manufacturing, including iron production, milling, textiles, and many

handicrafts were located largely in rural areas, partly because access to

water power and raw materials were significant considerations (Temin 1966).

There is a good deal of evidence that the non—agricultural sector of rural

labor force, particularly native—born craftsmen, may have suffered from the

rise in the cost of living to which Webbrefers (Fogel 1986). Moreover, the

competition from foreign-born labor and a rise in unemployment may have led

a fair number of native—born craftsmen to shift into agriculture, either as

laborers or at the low end of the distribution of farm owners and operators.

Yet, even    if   half of these workers suffered income declines large enough to

induce a 1.5 inch decline in the final heights of their children, the

deprivation of this class would explain only about a fifth of the rural

height decline.6

        Perhaps Webb's second point holds the key. Recent studies have

demonstrated      a strong link between immignation rates and urban mortality
rates    both before and after the Civil War (Higgs 1979; Meckel 1985). Public

health studies of the antebellum era demonstrated not only that mortality

rates were much higher in the immigrant wards than in the wards in which the
                                          99



native—born were preponderant, but that epidemics often began first in the

foreign—born wards and then spread outward, not only to other wards in the

cities, but to the rural areas as well.

       The cholera epidemic of 18148—1850 is the most dramatic case in point.

This epidemic was brought to American shores in December of 1848 by two

ships carrying German immigrants, one bound for New York, the other for New

Orleans. Although New York—bound passengers who were sick with cholera when

the ship arrived were kept in quarantine, others were allowed to enter the

city. Within a few days cholera broke out in the immigrant districts of New

York; then it spread to the predominantly native—born, lower—class districts

nearby; and eventually to upper—class districts. In the case of the ship

bound for New Orleans, public health officials were not only able tc tie the

spread of disease to New Orleans with the disembarkation of the immigrants

there, but to follow the movement of cholera up the Mississippi and its

tributaries. As immigrants from the infected ship boarded river steamers,

cholera broke out aboard these ships and then in the cities at which the

steamers called, including Memphis, Nashville, Louisville, Cincinnati,

Wheeling (W. VA), Pittsburgh, and St. Louis (U.S. Surgeon-General's Office

1875). Soon after it reached these cities, cholera broke out in the

surrounding countryside.

      Cholera was the most dramatic disease of the antebellum era because it

struck the nation suddenly, spread quickly, had a high case fatality rate,

and   its   victims often succumbed within 2k hours after they became sick

(Rosenberg 1962; Ency. Brit. 1961, 5, pp. 615—618). But such diseases as

malaria, typhoid, typhus, tuberculosis, smallpox, yellow fever, and

dysentery took far more lives than cholera between 1800 and 1860. So severe

was the increase in epidemic diseases during these decades that one
                                          100


historian of public health characterized it as a "period of great epidemics"

(Smillie 1955). It seems likely, therefore, that increased exposure to

disease was a major factor contributing to the decline in both the height

and life expectation series shown in Figure 1. The wide variations in the

prevalence of particular diseases, by localities and over time, opens up the

possibility of being able to measure the effect of variations in exposure to

diseases on the variation in mortality rates with controls for height and a

variety of socioeconomic variables.57

      If cholera and other diseases that afflicted the United States during

the   nineteenth century were acts of God,      unrelated to the functioning of the

economic     system,   they would pose no special problem for the resolution of

the andard—of-living controversy. However, economic growth, the spread of

disease, and the concomitant increase in morbidity and mortality rates were

intricately intertwined. Not only was internal migration responsible for as

much as 50 percent of the increase in measured per capita income during        the

antebellum     era (Fogel and Engerman 1971; Galiman 1972; Easterlin 1975; Fogel

1986), it was also a principal factor in the spread of cholera, typhoid,

typhus, malaria, dysentery and other major killer diseases of the era (Boyd

 1941 ;   Ackerknecht 1945; Ackerknecht 1952; Smillie 1955) .    Increasing
 population density, another concomitant of economic growth, also increased

 the prevalence of various diseases, raising the level of malaria, enteric

 diseases, and diseases of the respiratory system (Ackerknecht 1945; Smillie

 1955; May 1958; Kunitz 1983; N.Y. State 3d. of Health 1867).

          The increase in mortality between c.1790 and c.1860, therefore, calls

 for a downward adjustment in the measured growth of per capita income.        Such

 an adjustment is necessary even if wage rates in high disease localities

 fully reflected the bribe which workers demanded for the increased risks of
                                             101



living in these areas, since national income accounting procedures treat the

bribe as an increase in national income, when it is merely a cost of

production. Jeffrey Williamson's recent application of the bribery

principle, using differences in wage rates between regions of high and low

mortality to measure the disutility of English industrialization (Williamson

1981a, b, and 1982), represents an important advance in the assessment of

both the short— and long—run costs and benefits of economic growth during

the nineteenth century. The debate set off by his estimates (Pollard 1981;

Floud 19811) involves such issues as whether workers had enough information

to properly assess differences in risks, whether the measures of mortality

used by Williamson were precise enough to gage the differential risks that

workers actually suffered in particular occupations and localities, and

whether the various labor markets were all In equilibrium (or all out of

equilibrium by the same degree). The resolution of these issues will no

doubt add greatly to our knowledge about the costs and benefits of

industrialization to the workers who experienced it.

     There is an alternative approach to the computation of the mortality

correction which, while not as comprehensive as the correction implied by

the bribery principle (Williamson 19811), is easier to measure. Equation

(18) is derived from the theory of human capital.

                           equilibrium price of such a worker if he could be sold

                           as a slave)

Differentiating equation (18) totally yields,

        (19)
                  'n
                       =         + (1_)n   +

                           change in that variable.

        Equations (18) and (19) indicate that increases in mortality rates will

lead    to spurious increases in both "real" wages (wages adjusted only for the
price level) and in "real" per capita income. That is because conventional
measures of "real" wages and per capita income fail to distinguish between
rises    in wages that are due to, say, technological change and those that are

due to a more rapid consumption of human capital, treating both as if they

represented net additions to human welfare.8 Equations (18) and (19)

indicate that increased mortality rates raise wages not only because they

increase o     (the probability that someone in the labor force will die), but
also because they increase V (the cost of producing a new entrant into the

labor force). The higher the mortality rate, the greater the number of live

births (and associated costs) needed to produce a new entrant into the

labor force.59 There is, of course, a corresponding increase in cost due to

extra expenditures on non—survivors at all the other ages between birth and

entry into the labor force.
                            *         *
        The estimates of o and V. which can be derived from the decline in life

expectation shown in Figure 1 and Appendix A, indicate that rising mortality
                                     103


may have accounted for about two—fifths of the average annual Increase in

the conventional measure of "real" per capita income over the 70 years

between 1790 and 1860.60 In principle, this correction is a lower bound on

the correction that one would obtain from the implementation of the bribery

principle, since no account was taken of the psychic cost involved in the

loss of loved ones, and since it was implicitly assumed that workers were

risk neutral with respect to their own fate.

    The preceding estimate is merely meant to illustrate the new

possibilities that are arising for refining our measures and conceptions of

the changes in standards of living during the various stages of the

industrialization process. The data on stature should provide additional

information, beyond that conveyed by the mortality series, because they

pertain to survivors, to individuals who lived to maturity (Floud 198U).

Although the calculation based on equation (18) suggested the magnitude of

the correction needed to net out the effect of rises in mortality rates on

conventional measures of per capita income, it did not provide adjustments

for the consequences of increased morbidity rates experienced by those who

survived exposure to virulent diseases. Such corrections are needed to take

account of medical expenditures and a variety of investments which merely

offset the deterioration in the environment, and of diseases which degraded

the quality of life and reduced the productivity of the labor of survivors.

The data on stature promise to provide such adjustments, although we will

need to learn more than we now know about how to separate out the effect of

morbidity front other influences on stature before we can implement such an

adjustment.

     One issue which I have not yet probed in this discussion but which now

leaps to the fore is the transfer of income and wealth between immigrants
                                     104


and native—born workers. Until now discussions of real economic growth by

economic historians have tended to slight this issue, although it has been

of great concern to many social, political, and labor historians (Commons et

al. 1915, I; Benson 1969; Fiandlin 1979; Ernst 1949; Hoagland 1913; Pessen

1975; Hannon 1984). Whatever the long—run benefits of unrestricted

immigration to native workers, it appears that in the short run it created

severe hardships for them, not only by increasing the competition for jobs

but also by increasing their exposure to disease and by reducing their life

expectations. The extent of the losses to native workers has been shrouded

by the tendency to average over the experience of native and foreign—born

workers. The available evidence suggests that the conditions of immigrants

improved fairly rapidly after they arrived in the U.S., not only because the

disease environment was less virulent in America than in their native lands,

but also because their wages rose fairly rapidly with time in the U.S.

(Lebergott 1984; Chiswick 1978 and 1979; Kearl and Pope 1986). Native

workers, on the other hand, experienced declines in real income during the

periods of most rapid antebellum immigration, even though the average level

of their conventional income and their levels of health and longevity were

higher than those of immigrants. This, then, is a case in which

averaging over subgroups gives quite misleading impressions of the fate of

the different groups. Even if the average real wages of all U.S. workers

rose between 18140 and 1860, as seems likely, such a highly aggregated index

tends to underestimate the substantial gains of foreign—born workers and

obscures the declines in the real income of native-born workers in the non—

                                     5.     Conclusion

         The decline in mortality rates since 1700 is one of the greatest events

    of human history.61 I was inclined to say "one of the greatest achievements

    of humankind," but the fact remains that we still do not know how much of

    that achievement was due to causes beyond human control. The paper

    published by McKeown and Brown in 1955 marked a turning point in the effort

    to provide a warranted explanation of the decline in mortality. Bridging

    the worlds of social scientists and of medical specialists, they brought

    into the discussion most of the range of issues that have been under debate

    for the past three decades. That debate not only defined the issues more

    clearly than previously, but also revealed that the critical differences

    were quantitative rather than qualitative. Nearly all the specialists agree

    on the range of factors that were responsible for the decline in mortality

    but they have had quite different views about the relative importance of

    each of the factors.

         The unresolved issue, therefore, is not really whether a particular

    factor was involved in the decline, but how much each of the various factors

    contributed to the decline. Resolution of the issue is essentially an

    accounting exercise of a particularly complicated nature, which involves not

•   only measuring the direct effect of particular factors but also their

    indirect effects and their interactions with other factors. Our preliminary

    investigations indicate that   the    construction of data sets rich enough to

    permit   such a complex accounting is critical to the successful outcome of
    the exercise. What is needed is a data set that can cope with the changes
    in the cause—of—death structure which, as Preston (1976) indicated, has
    varied significantly over time and place. To identify the locus of

    influences of each of the principal factors that contributed to the decline
                                           io6


we need not only disease—specific but age—specific, and generation—specific

information, because the influence of both jk—increasing and risk—averting

factors appear to vary markedly both over lifetimes and over generations.

        The findings on the extent and the locus of the nutritional

contribution presented in this paper are preliminary in two respects.

First, we anticipate that more complete data will lead to revisions in the

estimates we have presented. Second, nutritional status is only the first

of numerous other factors which contributed to the mortality decline in

America since 1700 that we hope to measure. Our preliminary results

indicate that the contribution of improvements in nutritional status was

neither inconsequential nor overwhelming; although it made a substantial

contribution, the factors which contributed to the majority of the decline

are still unmeasured. Moreover, although our preliminary estimates indicate

that improvements in nutritional status may have accounted for about four-

tenths of the mortality decline, this contribution was confined largely to

the reduction in infant deaths, particularly to late fetal and neonatal

deathsand to deaths during weaning. The concentration of the impact of
improved nutrition in these age categories raises the possibility that
increases    in diarrhea and   other   diseases which diverted ingested nutrients

from rowth both before and       after   birth, rather than   a   decline in food

intake, was    the   main cause of the decline in nutritional status and the rise

in mortality during the middle decades of the nineteenth century.

        Several important issues have been obfuscated by          the confusion between
 diet   (the 'oss intake of nutrients) and nutritional status (the balance

 between nutrient intake and the claims on that intake). The blurring of

 these concepts has diverted attention from the ingestion of harmful

 substances, which are not only devoid cf nutritional value but which prevent
                                           107


    the body from assimilating nutrients at critical ages, especially in utero

    and in early childhood. Alcohol may have been the most devastating of these

    substances because it was long and so widely consumed by pregnant women.

    But the administration of opiates to infants also appears to have been

    widespread for some stretches of time and may have been as widespread among

    the upper classes as it was among the lower ones. Even salt, in the

    quantities in which it was consumed prior to the development of
t
    refrigeration,   was a toxic substance that may have taken a heavy toll at

    late ages. We are Just beginning to become aware of the full range of

    ingested toxic substances and their role in the high mortality rates of the

    early modern and early industrial eras. More attention needs to be paid to

    the role of a variety of contaminants, including lead, arsenic, snakeroot,

    and mold poisoning (Ackerknecht 1952; Scrimshaw 1983; Matrossian 198A4).

         Preoccupation with diet, especially the excessive focus on adult diets,

    has diverted attention from an array of intrauterine occurances that

    undermined nutritional status and raised mortality rates during infancy and

    early childhood. Overwork of pregnant mothers and bacterial infections of

    minor consequence to mothers could have caused serious retardation of fetal

    development, especially when the Insult occurred during the first trimester

    (Moore 1983; Kielmann eta].. 1983; Hurley 1980; Steckel 1985). Intrauterine

    infections not only contributed to the large proportion of low—weight

    births, but increased the incidence of birth anomalies that severely

    affected the respiratory, circulatory, renal, skeletal, immune, and

    neurological systems and thus undermined physical development throughout the

    first year, and often well Into the second year and beyond (Fitzhardinge and

    Steven 1972a, b; Ejerre 1975a, b; McFarlane 1976; Shapiro etal. 1980;

    Christianson etal. 1981; McCormick 1955). Whether caused by a poor diet,
                                      108



by toxic substances, by overwork, or by intrauterine infections, low birth

weight not only increased perinatal death rates but also late infant and

early   childhood death rates. Recent studies suggest that the incidence of

arteriosclerotic diseases at middle and late ages may be promoted by adverse

intrauterine and infant environments (Forsdahl 1977; Marmot, Shipley, and

Rose 19814).

     The preliminary results not only indicate that the factors contributing

to the unanticipated cycles in heights and mortality were concentrated at

particular ages but that the routes of influences might have been quite

round about. These findings point to new issues in the standard-ofliviflg

controversy. It may turn out that the difficulties created by improved

transportation and rapidly 'owing cities carried over into the rural

regions   surrounding the cities, so that urban disamenities imposed costs on
the rural populations that have not yet been measured (cf. Williamson 1981a;
Williamson 1981b; Williamson 1982; pollard 1981). In the American case it
is difficult to believe that per capita food consumption was declining
during the last two—thirds of the nineteenth century since   there is so much

evidence pointing in the opposite direction (Towne and   Rasmussen 1960;

Gallman 1960; Bennett and Pierce 1961). Yet there could have been more
unequal distribution of food products, especially of meat, which adversely

affected the nutritional status of the poor. This appears to have been the

case with blacks whose nutritional intake apparently declined, and whose

mortality increased, between 1860 and 1880 (Meeker 1976; Fogel and Engerman

197'4; Atwater and Woods 1897; Frissell and Bevier 1899; U.S. Dept. Lab.,

1897). A more subtle and possibly more pervasive effect on the living

standards of laborers and their families, both in the cities and the

countryside, may have come from increased exposure to risks (not captured or
                                         log

only partially captured by current measures of real wages) that more than
offset the rises in    consumption.   This possibilit' does   not   invalidate
indexes    of real wages which were designed to cope with a specific set of

issues. Rather it raises new issues which require new measures, measures

that will supplement the information obtained from the older ones.

       The new findings suggest that much more attention needs to be given to

the way that population pressures, urbanization, and other economic factors

affected not just those of working age but the very young. It may well be

that the main damage to the standard of living of workers occurred at

exceedingly young ages, in ways that no one at the time fully appreciated,

and in a manner that does not conform well to current scenarios regarding

the factors and individuals responsible for the hardships of working—class

life   during the nineteenth century. Nutritional and other     health insults

delivered in utero or early life not only appear to have affected adult

health and longevity, but significantly reduced the later productivity of

those who recovered from early insults (cf. Fogel etal. 1983).

       The search for data sources capable of dealing with both the new and

the old issues on the interrelationship between demographic and

socioeconomic variables has gained considerable force in recent years.

Scholars have pushed in many different directions, and nearly all of the

work has   borne fruit. Careful examination of published data on disease-

specific causes of death in U.S. cities have revealed that expenditures on

sewers and waterworks had a relatively small effect on the decline in urban

mortality before the beginning of the twentieth century (Condran and

Crimmins—Gardner 1978). that the main diseases in which rural death rates

were consistently lower than urban death rates in 1890 and 1900 were those

which are nutritionally sensitive, and that the urban—rural differential was
                                         110



greater for infants and young children than for older persons (Condran and

Crimmins 1980).      These findings, although consistent with the nutritional
hypothesis, raise questions about the role of exposure to disease, a

variable that could not be measured in these studies. The weak relationship

between public health expenditures and mortality rates could reflect the

propensity of cities with the most virulent environments to make the

heaviest expenditures. Similarly, urban-rural differences in disease—

specific mortality rates might be more a matter of differences in exposure

rates than in nutritional status. Such issues have led to a search for data

sources that make it possible to measure exposure rates.

     In this connection, there is much to be gleaned from a reexamination of

published data in both state and local sources which can now be more

effectively exploited than previously because of computers. Close

examination of such published sources have revealed subtle aspects of the

mortality structures (Preston 1976) and of influences upon them that were

 not adequately appreciated in the past. Condran and Cheney (1982), for

 example, have found that in Philadelphia during 1870—1930, medical

 intervention was effective, despite the absence of "high—tech" chemotherapy,

 because of the role of medical personnel In spreading knowledge about the

 environmental sources of diseases and in isolating carriers of diseases.

 Among the more suggestive findings of these recent studies of published data

 was the discovery by Higgs (1979) of marked cycles, around a declining

 trend, in the mortality rates of 18 large American cities between 1871 and

 1900 that are strongly associated with variations in the rate of
                62
 immigration.

      Work on the manuscript sources is still at an early stage, but as the

 studies by Wrigley and Schofield (1983), Preston and van de Walle (1978),
                                     111



Haines (1983), and Preston and Haines (1983) have already indicated, these

sources will not only permit us to push the empirical analysis of the causes

of the decline in mortality further back in time but also to shed light on

factors that are not apparent in published data. Linked micro data sets

will make it possible to disentangle factors that are intricately convoluted

in ag-egate data. The ability to measure the separate and joint effects of

nutritional status, disease exposure rates, medical practices, public

sanitation, and intergenerational transmission of behavioral patterns will

not only illuninate the past but will directly contribute to a better

understanding of important issues in current economic and social policies.

     The findings presented in this paper are tentative and subject to

change. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBER or any of the

other cooperating institutions or funding agencies.

     1Richard Hellie has called my attention to "the coincidence of the

lowest life expectation [in Table 2 above] with the Maunder Minimum (the

Little Ice Age)," and notes that "the declining life expectations of the

English peerage parallels the worsening of the enserfinent process in Russia,

with the nadir of life expectations coinciding with the completion of the

enserfment process." He suggests "that low yields and the generally

unhealthier—than—usual climatic conditions" may have "played a role in

driving both processes." From a letter to R.W. Fogel dated July 17, 19814.

     3The principal disadvantage of an emphasis on whole books is that a

single aberrant book will have a large influence on the whole sample.

Although such instances can be handled by reweighting, the aberrations

reduce the efficiency of the sample and diminish its usefulness for some

purposes. This problem will diminish as the sample size increases. The

final sample will contain over a thousand books.

     The mortality file is smaller than the family file partly because a

requirement for entry into that file is that both the birth date and the

death of an individual is known. Non—bloodline spouses, who are at risk

only after their marriages, have not yet been integrated into the mortality

file. Their inclusion will increase the size of the mortality file by about

25 percent.

     A family is defined by the existence of marriage, whether or not the

family produces progeny. Families with multiple marriages have not yet been

integrated into the family file, but they are a relatively small percentage

of the families already in the file. Bloodline individuals who marry will

appear in both their families of birth and the families formed by their

marriages. The number of families suitable for the computations of various

statistics varies because of the completeness of information. For example,

it is possible to compute total births in completed families for about 77

percent of the families. In most of the other 23 percent of the families,

date of publication of the genealogy preceded the end of the childbearing

period of families at risk to have children. however, mother's age at last

birth can be computed only for about 35 percent of the families since

computation of this statistic not only requires that the date of publication

of a genealogy follow the end of the childbearing period, but also requires

information on the date of birth of both the mother and of the last child.

     The small percentage of the individuals in the sample who have been

linked to economic information reflects the recent start on this task. As

of May, 1984 we had searched for economic information on only 20 percent of

the individuals in the sample. In other words, so far we have been able to

obtain economic information on about 75 percent of the individuals for whom

this information was sought.

     5The Mormon Church was not founded until 1830. The religious objective

behind the compilation of family group sheets required the identification of

ancestors who had not been Mormons. There are three parts to the collection

of family group sheets. The Main Section consists of about 14,700,000 sheets

submitted mainly before 1962 and contains information on about 25,000,000

individuals, only a small proportion of whom are Mormons. The New Patrons

Section was started in 1962 when members of the Mormon Church were asked to

submit sheets on the most recent four generations of their families. There

are about 1 ,000,000 sheets in this part of the collection, and a fairly

large proportion of the individuals in these sheets are Mormons. The Old

Patrons Section was launched in 19214 and consists of any   genealogical
records    held by Church members that they desired to place on deposit in the

Genealogical Library. There are about 4,000,000 sheets in this part of the

collection. The DAE/CPE pilot sample of group sheets is drawn from the Main

Section. Cf. Wimmer 19814.

     6About 43    percent of males age 20 and over had zero real wealth. The
largest    endowment in the linked genealogical sample thus far is about
$200,000 which falls into the top 0.01 percent of the national distribution
estimated   by Soltow (1975) for 1850.

meeting.

     81n practice "health" is usually defined as "freedom from clinically

ascertainable disease" (Gt. Brit. Dept. Health Soc. Ser. 1980). Measures of

health include morbidity rates, mortality rates, number of GP consultations,

days absent from school, disability days, days absent from work, parental

assessments, weekly laboratory cultures, and weekly clinical diagnosis.

Responses to key questions (e.g. "Do you have any physical difficulty with

shopping?") are also used (Balinsky 1975; Sackett etal. 1917; Blaxter 1916;

McKeown 1976b; Martorell 1980).

        do not mean to argue that average stature cannot be employed to

assess factors affecting the general level of health in a population, but

only to argue against the notion that the health and stature are synonyms.

The relationship between growth retardation and disease is complex, varying

from one disease to another, and from one context to another. Consequently,

while it may be possible to use data on stature to make valid statements

about the probable level of exposure to certain diseases, a great deal more

will have to be learned than is now known about complex interactions within

a multivariate context. (The same caveat applies to attempts to infer diet

from stature without controlling for exposure to disease and other relevant

variables.) An oversimplified approach which assumes strict proportionality

or some other simple relationship between stunting, or its absence, will

miss or greatly underestimate nearly all respiratory diseases, most chronic

diseases, many infectious fevers, and most non—specific disorders——much of

the range of diseases occurring among well-fed populations. Indeed, in one

study anthropometric measures and the incidence of non—specific health

disorders were positively and significantly correlated (Butler 1974; Condon—

Paoloni etal. 1977; Briscoe 1979; Martorell eta].. 1975; Beisel 1977; Cole

and Perkin 1977; Martorell ig8o; Mata et al. 1977; Frisancho 1978;
                                        117


Baumgartner and Mueller 1984). On the other hand, I believe that there is

enough evidence around to permit us to investigate and establish the

robustness of these complex interrelationships. Given adequate patience,

caution, and a good deal of ancillary information, we may be able to

establish the likely combination of factors which affected growth profiles.

In parts III and IV of this paper attempts are made to identify situations

in which such inferences may be tenable.
     10
          Because the series of e10 is not yet controlled for the variables

that were controlled in producing the height series, considerable caution

needs to be exercised in interpreting leads and lags which are evident in

the two series of Figure 1.

     11See Appendix A for a discussion of the procedures employed in

constructing the two time series displayed in Figure 1.    Table Li gives the

values of each of the entries.

     12Levy's life tables begin with age 25. The e10 values shown for his

data in Figure 1 were extrapolated to age 10, using the model West tables of

Coale and Demeny (1966).

     1evy also has a life table for 1650—1699 which was used to establish

the location and slope of the line segment between 1715 and 1725 which shows

the effect of a possible correction for the undercount of southern

observations, in the genealogical sample employed in Figure 1

            the Williamsburg meetings Paul A. David and Warren C. Sanderson

called our attention to a time series of e10 contained in a dissertation by

Kent Kunze (1979) which overlaps with our series. Kunze covers the period

from 1800 to 1880 in 14 life tables for males (and an additional 111 for

females). His first table is based on a fifteen—year period (1800—1815),

the second on a ten—year period (1815—1825), and the remaining 12 are for
                                      118


quinquennia centered on years ending with zero or five. Kunze's data were

obtained from samples of the family group sheets in the files of the

Genealogical Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter—day Saints.

Only information on individuals who resided outside of Utah were included in

his computations. Foreign—born as well as native—born white individuals

were included.

     Over the years in which they overlap, Kunze's series and the DAE/CFE

series depict quite similar patterns. Both show a fairly steady decline

after c.18O5. His series bottoms out in c.1865 and then rises. The DAE/CPE

series bottoms out c.1857 and then rises. The decline of e10 in his series

from c.1807 to c.1865 is 10 percent, which is the same decline as that shown

in the DAE/CPE series between c.1807 and c.1857. However, between the peak

of the DAE/CPE series (which occurred c.1792, about 15 years before Kunze's

first observation) and its trough, the decline in about 16 percent.

     15An improvement in the diet is not by itself a sufficient basis for

Inferring an increase in final heights, since a substantial secular

deterioration in environmental conditions could have offset the potential

improvement in nutritional status associated with a better diet. Based on

current knowledge of the epidemiology of Massachusetts during 1675—1720,

however, such a deterioration seems unlikely (Duffy 1953; Vinovskis 1972).

     16The elasticity of the mortality rate with respect to height in

Trinidad was estimated from regressions (and the mean values of the

variables in these regressions) reported in a memorandum from Meredith John

to Robert 'vi. Fogel dated November 30, 1983.   I used four of John's logit

regressions relating the probability of surviving to a series of variables

including height. These regressions were for males      age 15 (p. 36),

females   age 15 (p. 39), males S age 15 (p. k2), females age 5 15 (p. 13).
                                              119


The elasticities for these four groups (estimated over the arc between the

average height of each group of Trinidadians and the current British height

standard for the mean age of each group) were:

                                  e           =   —2.00
                                      01<15

                                  Cf<15 =         -1.5!
                                  C           =   —2.50
                                      m1 5
                                                        0
                                      Cf>15
The average of these four elasticities (weighted by the share of each group

in the total population of Trinidad) was -1.57. If English population

weights in 1801—05 are used (Wrigley and            Schofield   1981, p. 529), the

average elasticity is —1.1114 (the sex ratio was assumed to be equal both

above and below age 15, since Wrigley and Schofield do not give the sex

ratio by age). U.S. population weights for 1980 (U.S. Bur. Cen. 1983, p.

33) yield an elasticity of -1.33. Population weights for England and Wales

for 1851 and 1961 (Mitchell 1975, p. 52) yield elasticities of —1.41 and

—1.32.

     17The eight nations included in the Floud (1983b) study and the dates

covered are Belgium (1880—1969), Denmark (1880—1975), France (1880—1960),

Italy (1880—1952), Netherlands (1877—1970), Norway (1880—1960), Sweden

(1880—1961), and Switzerland (188l—1957).

       It follows that height accounts for 39 percent (15.9106 x 0.0610 +

2.51   =   0.39),   income for 27 percent (0.3889 x 1.75 + 2.51 =   0.27),   and time

for 33 percent (0.837 + 2.51        0.33) of the average annual decline in the

infant death rate.

       19The similarity between the results of equations (2) and (3) and

John's (19814) set of logit regressions on the probability of dying in

Trinidad should not obscure the significant differences in the nature of the

two sets of regressions. The Trinidad re'essions related the own height of

an individual to his or her probability of dying between two points in time.

Equation 3, on the other hand, relates the average height of males (mainly

in their early twenties) to a nation's infant death rate. When used in this

way adult heights have only indirect bearing on the nutritional status of

infants. Since the adult heights measure the nutritional status of males

during the preceding two or three decades, and since the mean nutritional

status of a nation exhibits high serial correlation, such a lagged measure

of average nutritional status may be a fairly good predictor of a nation's

current nutritional status especially during a period when the nutritional

status of particular nations has been changing in a fairly steady way.

Adult heights also have a bearing on ourrent infant mortality rates to the
                                          121



extent that they indicate the nutritional circumstances of mothers during

their developmental years. When comparing several nations, lagged measures

may be a good predictor of differences in current nutritional status if the

different nations had different starting levels and different rates of

change in nutritional status.

     20The figure 6J1.5 inches is the estimated mean height of the pool of

adult males from which recruits into the Royal Marines were drawn. Floud

and Wachter have not yet completed their examination of possible sample

selection and other biases in their military samples. Consequently, the use

of 614.5 inches as an estimate of the mean final height of english males

reaching maturity c.1800 must be considered tentative and is subject to

revision. However, no currently plausible revision (the possibilities of

change are pretty well bounded by +   1   .0 inches) would substantially alter

the estimates of the effect of improved nutritional status on the decline in

non-infant mortality rates.

     21Neonatal deaths are those which occur within the first 28 days of

life. Perinatal deaths are late fetal deaths (generally of 20 or 28 weeks

of gestational age) plus early neonatal deaths (generally deaths during the

first seven days after birth). In the U.S. and Great Britain during the

early 1960s the distribution of infant deaths was approximately as follows

(Shapiro etal. 1968):

                                                      cumulative

                  days           percent              percentage

                 29—365            27                    100
                                       1 22




Late fetal deaths in Britain and the U.S. have recently been approximately

equal to neonatal deaths (U.S. Bur. Cen. 1983, p. 77). For countries

experiencing death rates in the range of 100 per thousand and over, neonatal

deaths range between 35 and 70 percent (Mata 1978, Table 2.16; Ashworth

1982; Bouvier and Tak 1976).

     Wrigley and Schofield (1981, p. 97) estimate neonatal deaths in England

during the 17th and 18th centuries at about half of infant deaths. However,

the practice of treating infant deaths during the first week or nine days as

stillbirths, common in England and America before 1900, and still common in

some high mortality societies today, suggests that neonatal death rates may

have been substantially underestimated. Although Wrigley and Schofield

wrestled with this problem, the procedure they developed for correcting the

bias may only have captured a part of the undercount in infant deaths.

Their    procedure rests on the assumption that the count of deaths during the
last 11 months of infancy is virtually complete, and that there is a linear
relationship between cumulated deaths (per thousand births) during the
course of the first year and the cube of the log of days (plus one) elapsed

since birth. (Their procedure     is described briefly in Wrigley and Schofield

1981 •   pp. 98—100, and at greater length in Wrigley 1977; see Knodel and
Kintner    1977 and Hogan 1976, for discussions of the linearity assumption.)

Other reasons for a possible substantial undercount of mortality by Wrigley

and Schofield, especially after the turn of the nineteenth century, are

suggested by Lindert 1983. The small stature of the English workers prior

to 1820 and the high correlation between the infant death rate and stature

at age 3 and at maturity (see Steoke]. 1985; Floud 1985a) also indicate that

infant mortality rates were substantially higher than suggested by Wrigley

and Schofield. However, because of the widespread consunption of alcohol
                                       123


and   other toxic substances by preant women, and the probable undercount of
deaths during the first 7—9   days, 0.6 seems   to   be   a   more appropriate figure.
See n.31i and section 4.2, below.

       22However, in recent years new high technology introduced into

maternity hospitals in the more developed nations has led to some downward

shift in this schedule, especially for births of less than 1,500 grams that

are of early gestational age but not otherwise impaired (Pharoah and

Alberman 1981; Jones etal. 1979; Lancet 1980, p. 181).

      23The distribution of birth weights is not normal, mainly because there

are too many observations in the left tail. The fat left tail may be

treated as the result of adding together a distribution of the weights of

underdeveloped babies (which I will call "pre—term") to a much larger

distribution of fully developed babies (which I will call "full term').

Nevertheless, for the purposes to which they are put in Figure 5, normal

approximations to the distribution of the U.S. nonwhite and Bombay lower

classes yield satisfactory results. The mean and standard deviation in the

normal approximation to the U.S. distribution differs from those of the

actual distribution by less than one percent (Chase 1969). In the Bombay

case the difference in the means is less than one percent (the standard

deviation of the sample was not reported) (Jayant 196U).

      2J4in this case it was necessary to estimate the heaping of pre—term

births on the left tail of the distribution of birth weights. My procedure

was based on the proposition set forth in footnote 23 that the observed

distribution of birth weights may be viewed as the result of. a convolution

of a small distribution of weights of pre—term babies which is heaped on the

left tail of a much larger distribution of weights of full—term babies that

is normally distributed. Under this assumption the underlying normal
                                        12k


distribution   can be recovered by truncating the left tail of the

distribution at (say) 2,001 grams and then using the QBE procedure described

in Wachter (1981) and Wachter and Trussell (1982) to    estimate   the complete

normal distribution of full—term babies. It follows that the difference

between the number of observations below 2,001 grams in the reconstituted

normal distribution and in the original distribution yields an estimate of

the distribution of pre—term babies that have been heaped on the left tail.

     In estimating column 1   of   Table 10, which is graphed in Figure 5, I

assumed that the underlying full-term distribution was N(2,300; q20). To

this distribution I then added the estimated number of pre—term births at

weights below .2,001 grams, using ratios obtained   from GuM et al. (1973)

which   provides information on birth weight by gestational age for a Delhi
sample quite similar to the Bombay sample. Basically, the number of births
under 2,001 grams in the original normal distribution was inflated by the
ratio   of all births to full-term births in the Delhi sample, but the

additional births were distributed over two intervals: under 1,501 and

1,501-2,000. This adjustment for pre-term births produced a convoluted

distribution with a mean of 2,276 grams (down 2Zi grams from the underlying

normal) and a standard deviation of 399 grams (down 21 grams from the

underlying normal)

        Although the mean birth weight of the hypothetical distribution is

quite low, it is consistent with the final height of English workers c.1800—

1810 and the high infant death rates indicated by current estimates (before

adequate allowance is made for the undercount of deaths during the first

nine days after birth). In this connection, I would emphasize the

likelihood that the mean birth weight in rural areas of countries such as

India and Bangladesh is below those prevailing in the hospitals of their
                                         125


large    cities. This inference is consistent with evidence indicating that

incomes and final heights are generally lower (and the infant death rates

are higher) in the rural areas of these countries than in the cities. In

the villages covered by the Narangwal experiment, for example, the mean

birth weight was below 2,500 grams (Kielmann etal. 1983). Moreover, babies

born to women of a given socioeconomic class in hospitals are liable to be

higher   by several hundred grams   than those born to women cf the same class

at home because of the phenomenas discussed in footnote 25.

     See Steckel (1985) for an alternative procedure that produces similar

results.

        25My estimate of the mean birth weight of lower—class children is about

590 grams (about 1.3 pounds) less than mean weights of about 27,000 births

at the Maternit de Port Royal in Paris delivered during the first decade of

the nineteenth century (Tanner 1981, pp. 255—56). I suspect that this

differential was due partly to late third—trimester weight gains associated

with much improved diets received by mothers while at the Maternit. Until

the late nineteenth or early twentieth century lying—in hospitals, often

called pre—maternity homes, functioned more as charities aimed at rescuing

destitute women and their often illegitimate children, than as scientific

institutions. The aim of these hospitals was to provide food, clothing, and

shelter to "poor and desperate" women who were awaiting delivery, rather

than to offer a surgical type of facility (Vogel 1980, pp. 12—13).

Destitute expectant mothers were often kept in these hospitals for several

weeks or longer on a nutritious diet before their deliveries. A study of

birth weights at English pre—maternity homes shortly after the turn of the

twentieth century revealed that the birth weight of children whose mothers
                                      126



worked up to the day of confinement averaged 280 grams less than those of

mothers who were confined to the homes for ten days (Ashby 1915).

       Since i5 percent of the increase in fetal weight normally takes place

during the last eight weeks of preiancy (Thomson, Billewicz, and     Hytten
1968; Birkbeck 1976; Southgate 1978), birth weights at the Maternit may

well   have exceeded the average of babies born to working—class women in
England and France during the first decade of the nineteenth century by the
590 'ams suggested by the birth—weight distribution of Figure 5. The
combination of an enforced sedentary life together with a substantial
increase   in the intake of nutrients for several weeks could have led to a

substantially larger gain In the weight of fetuses than would otherwise have

been the oase. The exceedingly high death rates among deliveries in the

maternity hospitals of the nineteenth century, as much as seven times as

high as home deliveries (McKeown 1976a), is consistent with this

possibility. One would expect an unusually    high   rate of stillbirths and

neonatal deaths among fetuses that suffered first trimester insults, even

though they had high levels of nutrition during the third trimester (Hurley

1980; Moore 1983).

       In the case of food—supplemented preancies (when supplementation

begins late in, or after, the first trimester), mean birth size may not be

as good a predictor or perinatal and neonatal mortality rates (Kielmann et

al. 1983) as in unsupplemented feeding regimens. This discrepancy may be

dueto the diversity of responses to first trimester insults and later
supplementation. Some preanoies will abort early. Some fetuses that have
suffered permanent impairment during the first trimester will continue to
develop (at a retarded rate) and will be at high risk late in the third
trimester and after birth. Still, others will fully recover from the first
                                      127


trimester trauma and, as a result of supplementatior-i, will experience third

trimester weight gains that are eater than they otherwise would have been.

It seems likely, therefore, that a very poor first trimester diet (or other

nutritional insult) combined with supplementation in the third trimester

will increase the coefficient of variation in birthweights (with an

uncertain effect on the mean weight, since supplementation may increase the

proportion of small—for—dates fetuses that are born alive). This appears to

have been the case in the Maternit. Its coefficient of variation is 26

percent higher than that of a sample of 113 populations with low mean birth

weights (under 3,000 g.) reported in the WEO survey (1980).

     Two recent studies, one on births between 1851 and 1905 at the

University Lying—In Hospital in Montreal (Ward and Ward 19811), the other

births between 18118 and 1865 at the Philadelphia Alms House (Goldin and

Margo 19811) promise to increase cur knowledge of nineteenth—century birth

size and of its bearing on perinatal deaths during that century. The Wards

have discovered a decline in mean birth weight of about 1120 grams between

the late 1860s and the beginning of the twentieth century. The Wards are

also collecting birth—weight data for the nineteenth and early twentieth

centuries from a number of other lying-in hospitals in North America and

Europe. Preliminary analysis of the Philadelphia data by Goldin and Margo

not only indicates a decline in birth weights between the mid 1850s and the

mid 1860s, but also reveals that the first—day death rate, even for live

births in the range of 3,000 and 11,000 grams, was about twice as high as in

the U.S. national sample in 1950. Goldin and Margo are also collecting data

that will relate the duration of the stay in the Alms House prior to birth

to birth weights and to perinatal mortality rates.

     261 have not distinguished birth weight and length by sex since it is a

refinement not justified by the rough calculations which follow. At birth

the mean weight of girls is less than that of boys, but the difference is

only about 100 grams (about 3 ounces). The average difference in birth

length between the sexes is about 0.6 centimeters (about a quarter of an

inch) and shows less variation across nations than weight differences. Cf.

Beal 1980; Tanner et al. 1966; Eveleth and Tanner 1976; Hytten and Leitch

1971; and the sources cited in WHO 1980.

     I have used 0.6 rather than the 0.5 figure employed by Wrigley and

Schofield as the share of infant deaths that occurred during the neonatal

period, partly because of the widespread ingestion of toxic substances by

pregnant women (of. the discussion in n.21, n.33, n.311, and in section 4.2

below).

     The percentage reduction in the infant death rate due to a shift in the

birth weight schedule is quite robust to the principal assumptions employed

in Table 10.       If, for example, I had used assumptions which yielded an

infant death rate of 200 per thousand in 1800 (a more conventional figure

than indicated in Table 10), the decline in the infant mortality rate due to

the shift in the birth weight schedule would still be 76 percent [1—(148.9 ÷

200.0)    =   0.76].
     27See Appendix B for the derivation of equation (5)

     28Wrigley and Schofield (1981, p. 529) give the following values for

1801—05:

                                  =   35.89
                              cdr =   27.08
                              cbr = 37.71
                                        129



The appropriate value of        (179.0 per thousand) for the indicated value of

e0 was obtained from their Table Al 11.5 (p. 7111) by interpolating between

their levels 8 and 9. Then 37.71 x 0.179 = 6.112 is the number of infant

deaths per 1,000 persons in the total population. Consequently, infant

deaths were 23.7 percent of all deaths (6.112 + 27.08 =     0.237).
        29The age—standardized death rate in Britain c.1980 was 8.32 per

thousand, using the Wrigley and Schofield (1981, p. 529) age distribution

for 1801-05 and the 1978—80 life table for the United Kingdom to estimate

the m values (G.B. Cent. Stat. 0ff. 1983, p.113). Since the crude death

rate for 1801—05 in Wrigley and Schofield (1981, p. 529) was 27.08, the

decline in the standardized mortality rate is 18.76. Non—infant deaths were

20.66 per thousand in 1801—05 (0.763 x 27.08 =    20.66).    Then 20.66 x 0.1085

=   2.24 is the reduction in non—infant mortality due to improved nutrition.
The last figure is 12 percent of the total decline in mortality (2.211 +

18.76     0.119).

        30Some caveats about the foregoing estimates are in order. After

maturity, height will not adequately measure nutritional status unless the

relationship betweeen nutritional status during the growing ages and after

maturity is not only strong but of a simple form. Consequently, the

computations presented in the text may miss part of the effects of

improvements in nutritional status after maturity on the decline in adult

mortality. The assumption that the elasticity between nx and height is

stable with respect to time, place, and circumstances (which is involved in

the application of the Trinidad elasticity to the British case) requires

confirmation and may have to be modified as additional evidence becomes

available.

      31Roger Schofield has called my attention to evidence which suggests

that diseases listed in the first column of Table 11 might have accounted

for the majority of deaths among the peerage well before 1750.       I do not

mean to suggest that the shift in the distribution of diseases is the main

factor explaining the decline In the death rate of the peerage, but only

that it might have played some role. The principal point of this paragraph

is that improvements in nutritional status could not have played a

significant role in reducing the death rates of either the peerage or of the

lower classes as long as the main killer diseases were those whose outcome

was unaffected by nutritional status. Just when this shift took place, or

even whether it took place, is still an open issue. Some students of

medieval demoaphy believe that the outcome of' epidemics of medieval

plague, or at least some forms of it, may have been influenced by

nutritional status. See, for example, Nellie 1982.

       32From a letter to R.W. Fogel dated July 16, 1984.

       33A   half pound of   hard—salted herring, bacon, or similarly cured meat

per   capita per day (and upper class individuals may have consumed that much
at breakfast alone——cf. n.311) would have exceeded maximum "safe" levels of
sodium consumption for an average individual by more than five fold. Salt
was also used much more heavily than today to cure and flavor butter (about
1.5 ounces of salt per pound of butter) and other dairy products, and in
bread (five pounds of salt per sack of flour) and porridges. Sodium occurs
naturally    in significant quantities in various root vegetables, pulses,

milk, beer, meats, and fish (Encyc. Brit. 1961, 2, p. 888; Ashbrook 1955;

Webster 18Z45, pp. 7147, 773—833, 1135; Davidson etal. 1979; Meneely and

Battarbee 1976; U.S. Senate 1977).

       311According to Dyer (1983, pp. 193—19J4) a gallon of ale was the

standard ration for adult males in "lordly households" during the late

medieval era, but superior members of the household consumed two or three

pints of this amount as wine. At Northumberland the Lord and Lady split a

quart of beer and a quart of wine at breakfast alone (along with two pieces

of salt fish and six baked herrings) and even the children in the nursery

consumed a quart of beer at breakfast. Children of all classes drank ale or

beer, but usually of a weaker type than their parents (Pullar 1970; Wilson

1973).   The per capita ration of ale for nuns at Syon was seven gallons per
week (Pullar 1970, p. 111). According to Thurgood (19814, p. 6) the accounts

of   the First Duke of Buckingham during the mid—fifteenth century indicate
that daily consumption of wine among "upper members of the householdTT was
about a half gallon per capita. If peeresses consumed two—thirds of a
gallon of liquid, half as ale and half as wine, then their daily consumption
of absolute alcohol would have been between 7.2 ounces (allowing 4 percent
of   absolute alcohol in ale and 11 percent in wine) and 9.1 ounces (if the

percentage of absolute alcohol in ale is set at 8 percent).. Even ii'

peeresses drank only weak ale (14   percent absolute alcohol) their daily
consumption   of absolute alcohol would still have averaged about 3.1! ounces.

Recent studies indicate that among women whose daily consumption of absolute

alcohol during pregnancy equaled two or more ounces per day, about one out

of five newborns suffered from symptoms of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (Hanson,

Streissguth, and Smith 1978; Abel 1982). The heavy salt intake of pregnant

women further endangered fetuses by causing edema and by increasing the

likelihood of kidney damage (U.S. Senate 1977).

       35me balance of this section presents a highly condensed version of

the analysis set forth in Fogel (1985). See that paper for the derivation
                                      32



of the equations and the estimates of parameters that are merely reported in

this section.

     36Estimates of the social distribution of the population based on

revisions of King's table (Lindert 1980; Lindert and Williamson 1983b) would

not significantly affect the analysis that follows.

     37The provisional nature of the estimates of these parameters and of

those set forth in equation (11) should be emphasized. Although consistent

with the available evidence thus far developed for the early modern era,

current research into estate and probate records and similar sources should

permit improvements in these estimates. See Fogel (1985) for a discussion

of the effects of plausible variations in these parameters on the estimates

of entitlement shifts, foodgrairi shortfalls, overall food shortfalls, and

famine—induced mortality rates. Cf. the discussion in n. 0.

     38A yield—to-seed ratio of eight implies that 12.5 percent of the crop

was used for seed, and grains used as feed for work animals may have

accounted for a like amount by the beginning, of the eighteenth century.

Hoskins (19614, 1968) and other economic historians have implicitly assumed

that the seed elasticity of demand was close to zero. However, econometric

estimates of agricultural production functions, as well as controlled

experiments by plant breeders, suggest a fairly high elasticity of

substitution between seeds and other inputs. That finding, together with

the theory of demand for inputs, suggests that 0.6 is a reasonable estimate

of    (Fogel 1985).

     39The grain price series used here includes peas and beans which were

also used to make bread during the early modern era. The prices are from

Sowden (1967 and 1985). Missing entries in the peas and beans series were

linearly interpolated. Peas and beans were then added to the Bowden grain

series, using a weight of 0.165 each for peas and beans and 0.67 for

Bowden's grain series.

       UOThe assumption   that   yields were lognormally distributed (there is a

slightly better fit of grain prices to a lognormal than a normal

distribution) would have little effect on the analysis that follows. Under

the lognormal assumption the estimated value of °g would rise by only U

percent (from 0.066 to 0.069). In this paper I have, therefore, employed

the normal assumption in order to simplify the exposition. See Fogel (1985)

for the results obtained when the analysis is based on a lognormal

distribution of yields.

       Ui1 believe that this estimate of °g is probably too high.           Since I

did not take account of a hoarding and speculative demand, my assumption

that         0.37 probably biases the value of °g upward. If, for example,

hoarding demand reduced          to 0.25,      would be just 0.045.

       It is possible to estimate           directly for the first 30 years (188l—

1913) that output and yield—per—acre data are available in Great Britain

(Mitchell and Deane 1962). Yields on wheat, barley, and oats were combined

into an index of grain yields (using equal weights), and then detrended by

regressing the index on time. The SD of the errors divided by the mean of

the index, °g' was 0.051. However, °g is determined not purely by

deviations in the per—acre yields of these grains but by deviations from

trend in the total supply of all grains. When total supply of all grains

(broadly defined) was     taken   into account, the estimate of         for the period
                                                                   °g
1884—1913 dropped to 0.035 (G.B. House Com. 1899 and 1917; G.B. Ministry

Agr. Fish. 1927). These two fIgures (0.051 and 0.035) may be taken as

reasonable estimates of the bounds within which °g probably fell during

1540—1871 (cf. Fogel 1985).
                                         1 314




     If we   now substitute 0.051 for °g in equation (12), that equation

becomes 1.2 x 0.051      0061Xg• Hence, we can estimate       from log 0.939 =

      1   .25, which yields a value of 0.282 for ,.    Similarly,   if we use

0.035 for °g' the estimate of      becomes 0.192. These computations suggest

that failure to take account of the speculative demand may have biased the

estimate of      used in the text upward by between 31 and 93 percent. The

correction of a and c would also reduce the estimates of c           ,   a       ,   and   c
                 g       t                                      gw           f                 fw

by similar proportions. Cf. n.146.

     142The SD of deviations of wheat prices from a 25-year moving average

was computed from the price series of Bowden (1967 and 1985). Lee (Wrigley

and Schofield 1981, p. 3714),   using   a somewhat different series of wheat

prices, found that the SD of the deviations around an 11—year moving average

was 0.25 during 15110—16140 and 0.24 during 16141—1745.

     143rhe SD deviations in the total food supply (af) was estimated from

the "all-agricultural-products" price series developed by Bowden (1967 and

1985). The deviations in food prices were computed from a 25—year moving

average of this series. The weight of food in Bowden's series varies

between 87 and 97 percent. When the Phelps Brown and Hopkins series (1956)

of the price consumables (in which food has a weight of 80 percent) is used,

   is 0.013.

     1This estimate of the decline in the food supply is based on Bowden's

(1967 and 1985) all—agriculture price series. When the price series of

consumables constructed by Phelps Brown and Hopkins (1956) is used, equation

(16) becomes

      (16.1)      fw =   Ol?2rfw
This equation also implies that there were only 8 years with food shortfalls

in excess of 7 percent. In setting up equation (15), I assumed                       for all
                                          135


food was the same as for all grain, which probably biases the estimate of

upwards.

        45The first figure in the parentheses is the proportionate increase in

the national cdr due to a 23 percent decline in food consumption by the

class of common laborers. The second figure is the proportion of years

(1 +    141)   in which such a decline occurred. For reasons explained in notes

141 and 146, the upper bound on famine deaths as a percentage of accumulated

total deaths during 15141—1871 may be as low as 0.1.

        16Lee (Wrigley and Schofield 1981   ,   pp. 370—373) finds a sharp decline
in fertility between three and nine months after a rise in wheat prices,

which he attributes to first and second trimester fetal mortality. Not all

fetuses that suffered nutritional insults would have died. One would also

expect an increase in neonatal death rates because impaired fetuses survived

the entire gestation period, but died shortly after birth. In ether words,

some part of the apparent fertility decline in year zero may be due to a

rise in infant mortality that was unmeasured. If we add half of the zero—

year elasticity of fertility decline to the zero—year elasticity of

mortality rise, Lee's 5—year cumulated elasticity of mortality rates with

respect to a rise in wheat prices becomes 0.163.

        The last figure is not far from the elasticity implied by my

computation, which is about 0.23. A 23 percent decrease in the food

consumption of the class of common laborers requires (from equation 14 and

the discussion on p. 86) a 70 percent increase in wheat prices and will lead

to a 16 percent increase in the national cdr in such a year. Hence, the

elasticity of the national cdr with respect to wheat prices is 0.16 + 0.70 =

0.23.      For various reasons that I have suggested, this last figure is an

upper bound. If, for example, I had made allowance for a speculative demand
                                         136


for wheat, the elasticity of the mortality rate with respect to wheat prices

implied by my computations would have been between 0.163 and 0.094. Cf.

n.kl.

        7This widely used assumption in the analysis of time series on grain

prices was questioned by [andes in 1950, but his caveat has been largely

unheeded.

             similar point was made by Flinn (1971, p. 315) in a different

context. Citing the work of two French demographic historians U. Meuvret

and J. Lebrun), Flinn argued that after the beginning of the eighteenth

century "improved social organization prevented the very poor from actually

dying from starvation during a famine, but it did not rescue them from their

more permanent state of undernourishment which left them vulnerable to both

endemic and epidemic disease. This kind of social action, in other words,

leveled the unevennesses of mortality without reducing it in aggregate."

          19Ga1enson (1981) has shown that the majority of English immigrants to

North America were from the lower classes. If it is assumed that the mean

height of adult male immigrants before 1650 was 614.5 inches (the approximate

mean male adult height of the English laboring population for cohorts born

c. 1750), then the implied rate of increase in adult height between

immigrants born c.1630 and native cohorts born c.1710 was about one

centimeter per decade. There is no information currently available on

the mean height of English cohorts born before c.1750. However, the high

mortality rates in England between c.1625 and c.1790 (Wrigley and Schofield

 1981 ,    pp. 528—529) suggest that there was little change in height schedules
during this period.       (Cf. Palliser 1982 on conditions during 1300—16140.)

          50Swedish and Norwegian adult heights appear to have increased fairly

 rapidly during the first third of the nineteenth century. However, the
                                                       137


secular increase slowed during the middle third of the century and

accelerated during the last third (Xiii 1939; Udjus i964; Sandberg and

Steckel 1980).

     51The estimate of the Gini ratio for the distribution of income c.1900

(0.147) was obtained from Steckel's regression, Gailman's income estimate for

that year (converted in dollars of 1970), and the adult height estimate for

c.1900 derived from the data in Figure 1. Alternative specifications of

Steckel's regression, with dummies for high income countries raised the

estimated Gini ratio for c.1900 to about 0.50. A Gin! ratio can be computed

from the income distribution for 1900 estimated by Lebergott (1976) from

budget surveys. That computation yielded a Gin! ratio of 0.56.

        52The equation used in this computation can be derived as follows:
                                                            —
             (17.1)        H = (1—it)H        + IT(H             D).
Hence

             (17.2)        H       Hu — TO.

Differentiating (17.2) totally yields:

             (17.3)            =
                                   *H

      In       equation (17.3) both D and it   only   enter into the second right—hand

term. Thus, we can measure the share of increase in the mean height of the

English that is due to the growth of the upper class just by computing

      + H.         The values of the variables needed to compute this ratio and the

sources of the estimates are as follows:

                               which British soldiers aged 23—35 were recruited into

                               population. The share is from Laslett 19811. The

                               Sandhurst height data are from the unpublished files of

                               Floud described in Table 6).

       H1 =        68.9"       (Rona etal. 1978, Table 3).

      531t is likely that immigrants too poor to provide their growing

children with adequate nutrition (which may be viewed as an

intergenerational transfer of human capital) also were unable to provide

children with adequate transfers of ordinary capital.

      514The quote is from a letter to R.W. Fogel dated November 30, 19814.

Similar points were called to my attention by S. Peltzman and P.A. David.
  -
      551t is, of course, possible that the increase in midwestern per capita

income was accompanied by a rise in the inequality of the income

distribution sufficient to impoverish a substantial percentage of the

region's population. Even if it is unlikely that the percentage so

impoverished would have been large enough by itself to explain the observed

height decline, it could have been a non—trivial contributing factor.

      6There is also the possibility that part of the decline is a

statistical artifact. It might be argued that children of the farm families

who enlisted during the peacetime years of the 1880s came, on average, from

poorer families than those who enlisted during wartime years. On the other

hand, the mean height of the native—born population as estimated from the

recruits who joined the regular army during the peacetime years of 1850-1855

was 68.1 inches, which is just a tenth of an inch below the corresponding

figure for the Union army (Sokoloff 19814).

      570ur investigation of available data sources indicated that there is

enough quantifiable information on the disease environment of localities in

the recruiting and station records of the U.S. Army, in the surveys of

medical societies and public health officials, and in mortality records to

be able to construct time series on the extent of exposure to particular

diseases by counties (by wards within large cities) or at least by

Congressional districts. We have, therefore, initiated a new project aimed

at collecting and analyzing these data.

     8Meade (1955) and Kuznets (1959) called attention to the fallacies

that may arise in growth accounting when the effect of mortality rates on

the measured growth in per capita income are neglected.

     59This point was made in another context by Butlin (1971).

     60For the period 1790—1860 the best current estimate of the average

annual rate of increases in U.S. tTreal?I per capita income appears to be

about 0.71 percent (Engerman and Galiman 1983; of. David 1967). The

mortality increase between c.1790 and c.1860 involved a shift from the life

table at level 16 to that at level 10 in West Model Female (Coale and Derneny

1966). The values of a computed the L schedules of these tables during the

prime working ages (taken to be ages 20—50) was 1.10 percent for level 10
                                                                                       *
and 0.58 percent for level 16. Hence, the average value of a over the 70

years from c.1790 to c.1860 was 0.91 percent. The value of (1—) was

computed from
                                   0.5 x 1.10 + 0.5 x 0.58                            — 0 123

     The values V for 1790 and 1860 were computed as follows. First, the

number of live births require.d to produce one survivor at age 20 was

computed from 20&oI which turned out to 1.18 births at mortality level 16

and 1.45 birth at level 10. Then, V1860/V1890 was computed from

adjustment reduces the rate of growth in "real" per capita income by about

39   percent     (0.28 + 0.71 =                      0.39).

    61The decline in the mortality rates of low—income countries since 1950

is even more remarkable than the mortality decline in the industrialized

nations between 1700 and 1980. The less developed nations have accomplished

in three decades what took two centuries or more in the industrialized

nations. A significant part of this acceleration is due to the transfer of

medical and economic technology from the industrialized nations to the less

developed nations (cf. Ppeston 1976, 1980, and 1985).

     62The fact that the debate launched in the mid—1950s still continues

should not distract attention from the considerable advances in knowledge

that have occurred because of the debate. Investigators have probed

increasingly into aspects of issues that were obscure at the outset. The

point is well illustrated by the evolution of research on the pathways of

airborne diseases. McKeown (1976a) stressed direct exposure; Preston and

van de Wafle (1978) called attention to the risk—increasing effects of the

lowering of resistance to airborne pathogens brought about by infections

caused by water—born pathogens. Thus, in the course of the debate the

concept of nutritional status has been refined and the factors which affect

it have been elaborated. Similarly, Condran ahd Cheney (1982) have provided

evidence that medical intervention became increasingly effective before the

dramatic chemical breakthroughs that became apparent during and after World

War II. However, the extent of mortality reduction due to these less

dramatic contributions has   yet   to be measured.

                      On the Construction of Figure 1

     Table Li gives the time series on height and on      used in the

construction of Figure 1.

The Height Series

     The entries from 1710-1875 give the mean adult heights of native-born

whites who were ages 25—L19 at the time of measurement. Each observation is

the mean height of a five-year birth cohort centered on the indicated date.

The various cohort averages in the time series were obtained from

regressions on height with dummy variables for each five-year birth

interval. To prevent changes in the socioeconomic composition of recruits

into the army from introducing spurious variations in the trend, a variety

of control variables were introduced, including civilian occupation, state

or region of birth, state or region of residence at time of enlistment, date

of enlistment, number of previous enlistments, rural and city—size

variables, and migration variables. The effects of alternative functional

forms for the time trend and various transformations of the other variables

were also investigated. The time trend proved to be robust to these

alternative specifications. We chose to present the time trend generated by

the dummy variables since this specification put the least constraint on

that trend. The results of the regression analysis will be more fully

reported at a later date. Some of the findings have been reported in

Sokoloff and Villaflcr (1982) and Margo and Steckel (1983).

     There are three gaps In the time series on height (1760—1775, 1800-

1810, and 1880—1900). The data needed to close these gaps have been

retrieved from the muster rolls but work on the processing of these data has

not yet been completed. Consequently, the first two gaps were closed by

linear    interpolation. The third gap was closed by interpolation on the

trend in the height of native—born recruits onto the Ohio militia (SteokeJ.

1982b).

     The observations on the birth cohorts for 1905.5—1931 were obtained

from Fogel eta].. (1983). They pertain to all whites, foreign as well as

native.

The Series of

     The first step in the construction of time series on e10 was the

construction of period life tables for five—year intervals extending from

1710—14 through 1875—79. The value of e10 for each of these life tables was

then computed. The series was smoothed by taking a five—item moving average

of the e101s. In other words, each observation of e10 listed in Table A.1

reflects mortality experience over a 25—year period centered on the mid—year

of a given interval.

     Time series of e and e5 were also constructed. The secular trend in

these series are quite similar to that generated by e10. However, there

appears   to be a significant undercount of infant deaths among cohorts born
before 1850 and a smaller undercount in ages 1-U. There are data in the
genealogies that may permit us to correct the deficiency but the work on
this problem is still in pro'ess. Although the listing of deaths at ages
5—9 appears to be virtually complete, we chose to work with e10 until we
completed our analysis of the problem of undercounting at younger ages.
     The observations from 1901—1970 give e10 for all whites, foreign as
well as native. The life tables from which these statistics    were computed

are based   on the states in the death registration system which expanded front
ten states in 1900 (with 26 percent of the national population) to the

entire nation in 1933 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, p. 44). The

years centered on the designated year (U.S. Nat. Off. Vital Stat. 1963).

The observations for 1960 and 1970 are each based on data for a single year

       It follows that if the birth rate and                       the   age structure of the

population           are       held   constant, which is the assumption of the         computation

presented           in   the text, then equation (5.14) reduces to equation (5), since
**
a—8   =    0.

       The preceding derivation rests on two assumptions which require further

consideration: First, the mortality schedule was treated as if it consisted

of just two ages, without demonstrating that the reduction of the number of

age intervals from z to 2 does not invalidate the results. Second, since

the percentages employed in equation (6) are large, there is the question of

the appropriateness of applying an equation derived from differential

approximations to discrete changes.

       The first question can be addressed by beginning with the definition of

an age standardized rate, which is given by equation (5.5):




                                             •                      •

                    M.     —    the age—specific death rates

Here,   the                 are fixed from one time period to another; in other words,

only the        change so that                            * S.      is due only to temporal differences in
