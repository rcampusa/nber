Why Does Credit Growth Crowd Out Real Economic Growth?

                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the negative relationship between the rate of growth in credit and the rate of growth
in output per worker. Using a panel of 20 countries over 25 years, we establish that there is a
robust correlation: the higher the growth rate of credit, the lower the growth rate of output per
worker. We then proceed to build a model in which this relationship arises from the fact that
investment projects that are more risky have a higher return. As their borrowing grows more
quickly over time, entrepreneurs turn to safer, hence lower return projects, thereby reducing
aggregate productivity growth. We take this theoretical prediction to industry-level data and find
that credit growth disproportionately harms output per worker growth in industries that have
either less tangible assets or are more R&D intensive.

1. Introduction

Finance and growth are intimately connected. Since the seminal work of Levine in the early 1990s, we have
known that for economies to thrive, they require deep and broad financial systems.1 But what is true from
emerging and frontier economies may not be true in the advanced world. That is, finance could very well
be a two-edged sword. When credit is relatively low, or the financial sector’s share of employment modest,
it adds to growth. But there is a threshold beyond which it becomes a drag. There is now considerable
evidence that productivity grows more slowly when a country’s government, corporate or household debt
exceed 100 percent of GDP.2

In this paper, we examine the relationship between credit growth and real growth. And, unlike the level
relationship, where finance is good before turning bad, in this case the result is unambiguous: the faster
the growth in credit, the worse it is for real growth. Using a panel of 20 countries over 25 years, we establish
that there is a robust, economically meaningful, negative correlation between output per worker growth
and growth in real credit. And, that causality likely runs from finance to output.

To understand the mechanism that lies behind this relationship, how the growth in credit reduces growth
in output per worker, we construct a model where entrepreneurs can choose among a set of projects
which differ in their risk and average return. Our model builds on two key assumptions. First, as is standard,
projects that are more risky yield a higher average return. Entrepreneurs are therefore confronted with the
traditional risk-return trade-off. Second, we assume that entrepreneurs must choose a project and commit
to it for more than one period. As a result, entrepreneurs’ choice of project depends not only on their
current ability to borrow, but on their future ability to borrow as well. In this environment, the faster the
growth in credit, the safer and less productive the projects that are undertaken, and the slower the real
economy grows.3 In addition when entrepreneurs are heterogeneous in their borrowing capacities,
aggregate credit growth tends to affect disproportionately those with lower borrowing capacity.

We take this theoretical prediction to sector-level data. Focusing on manufacturing industries, we confirm
that the less tangible an industry’s assets, or the more R&D intensive it is (our proxies for the ability to
borrow) the more credit growth harms productivity growth. That is, the less pledgeable an industries’
inputs or outputs, the more damaging are financial booms.

The remainder of the paper is divided into three main parts, followed by a brief conclusion. In Section 2
we present the country-level results. This provides the motivation of our more detailed analysis. Then, in

sections 3, we describe the model that guides our thinking about the relationship between credit growth
and productivity growth. Section 4 presents the results of our industry-level analysis. Building on the
seminal work of Rajan and Zingales (1998), we study 33 manufacturing industries in 17 advanced
economies and provide unambiguous evidence for large negative effects of credit growth on industries
that either have low asset tangibility or are R&D-intensive. Our estimates imply that a highly R&D-
intensive industry located in a country with a rapidly growing credit will experience growth in value added
per worker that is roughly 2 to 2½ percentage points per year less than an industry that is not very R&D-
intensive located in a country with a slow-growing credit. The final section concludes.



2. Country-level data

We begin our analysis at the country-level. In the left-hand panel of Graph 1 we plot growth in real GDP
on the vertical axis against growth in real credit to the private sector on the horizontal axis. In the right
hand panel, we examine growth in real GDP per person employed versus growth in real credit to the private
sector. Our sample includes 20 advanced economies from 1985 to 2009.4 In every case, data are averaged
over five year non-overlapping periods and measured as deviations from the country mean. The results
show that real GDP and real credit growths are correlated as would be expected, positively. But in the case
of real GDP per worker, the correlation turns negative. As real credit grows faster, labour productivity
growth declines. We note that the line running through the scatter plot has a negative slope with a
coefficient that is significantly less than zero at standard confidence levels.

There are many reasons why this negative correlation could arise. To examine them, we turn to a slightly
more sophisticated statistical analysis. And to anticipate our conclusion, the negative relationship is robust
to the inclusion of a variety of controls. Moreover, to the extent that we can establish causality, it runs
from the financial sector to the real economy.


2.1 The relationship between real growth and financial sector growth: the baseline case

Our analysis uses the following simple regression based on the existing growth literature5

                (1)                        yi ,t 5  i   t   fi ,t 5   X i ,t   i ,t ,

where yi,t+5 is the average growth of output per person employed in country i between year t and t+5, i
and t are country and time fixed effect, fi,t+5 is a measure of growth in the financial sector (credit or
employment) in country i between year t and t+5, Xi,t is a vector of pre-determined control variables, and
it is a residual. Table 1 reports the results of our baseline regression in which the controls are the beginning
of period values for CPI inflation, government consumption to GDP, and the log level of output per person
employed. The data sample is again from 1985 to 2009.

            respectively denoted with ***/**/*. Data sources are described in the appendix.


These results confirm those of Graph 1. When we control for (some of) the established determinants of
output growth – inflation, the size of the government– as well as catch-up effects (in the log level of GDP
per person employed), the negative relationship between growth in the financial and growth in real GDP
per person employed remains. Moreover, in the case of credit, the negative correlation is driven by credit
to firms, as growth in household credit is not significantly correlated with output per worker growth (the
estimated coefficient is negative, but with a t-stat less than minus one).

We can get a sense of the size of the effect by looking at some specific examples. Consider the cases of
Ireland and Spain. Starting with Ireland, from 2005 to 2010, real credit to the private sector more than
doubled, growing 15.1 percent per year. By contrast, over the five years from 1990 to 1995, it grew at a

more modest average annual rate of 7.4 percent. The estimate in Table 1 ( ˆ =-0.084) implies that this 7.7

percentage point difference has resulted in a productivity slow-down over 2005-2010 of 0.65 percentage
points per year compared to the period 1990-1995. This accounts for around 30 per cent of the 2.1
percentage point drop in productivity growth (from 2.5 to 0.4 percent at an annual rate) that occurred
over this period.

Turning to Spain, from 1990 to 1995 financial sector employment fell by 0.4 percent per year, while
Spanish productivity was growing +1.7 percent per year. Fifteen years later, from 2005 to 2010, financial
sector employment grew 2.6 percent a year but productivity grew only 0.7 percent a year. Our estimates



                                                                          4
Cecchetti and Kharroubi                        Financial sector growth and real growth                             September 2018



suggest that his change accounts for roughly half of the decline. That is, if financial sector employment
had continue to decline modestly instead of rising, then productivity growth in Spain over 2005-2010
would have been 1.2 percent per year, roughly half a percentage point higher than it was.

Of course changes in the growth rate of private credit or in the growth rate of financial sector employment
cannot account for all fluctuations in output per worker growth. In particular, there are a variety of
alternative factors that influence both output per worker growth and each of our three financial sector
growth variables. The next section looks at them more closely.

Before continuing, it is important to note the contrast between the results in Table 1, which emphasize the
importance of credit to firms, and those reported in Mian, Sufi and Verner (2017), who focus on credit to
households.6 An important difference is that we are looking at contemporaneous effects, while Mian et al.
examine lagged effects. That is, we find that the faster real credit to nonfinancial firms rises, the slower
productivity grows. As we will discuss, we see this as largely a consequence of reallocation of resources in
which finance is favouring relatively low productivity growth activities. Our supply-side perspective as
complementary with the demand-side story that growing household debt is associated with lower future
aggregate growth resulting an increased likelihood that consumers will face binding liquidity constraints
and be forced to reduce their consumption.


2.2 The relationship between real growth and financial sector growth: robustness

To support our interpretation of the results in Table 1, we turn to a more detailed investigation of
alternative explanations. For example, if credit growth is negatively correlated with the level of financial
development, which seems likely, then our regression could simply be picking up the standard result that
financial deepening and growth are positively related (at least most of the time).7

Another possibility is that the result is a consequence of composition effects. If credit growth comes along
with a shift in the share of credit going to households relative to that going to firms, this could change
the composition of production away from relatively high productivity investment goods to relatively low
productivity consumer goods. Alternatively, if we assume that nonbank intermediaries and financial
markets supply marginal credit, and that bank credit is more information intensive and more productivity
enhancing, then a shift away from lending by banks could account for the reduction in productivity
growth.8

    See also the discussion in Mian and Sufi (2018).
7
 As Cecchetti, Mohanty and Zampolli (2011) note, while low levels of debt are associated with higher real growth rates, as the ratio
of debt to GDP rises, it can eventually become a drag on growth.
8
  Conversely, it could be that bank credit is less productivity enhancing if banks favour old credit relationship over new ones and the
former finance lower productivity projects than the latter.



                                                                   5

Our results could also be due to changes in the distribution of employment across sectors. Here we can
think of two cases. The first is the shift towards finance and real estate. It could be that growth in finance
is really representing large construction and real estate services sectors– where productivity gains are
relatively low. A second possibility is that growth in finance is really just a part of a secular trend in which
employment is shifting away from manufacturing into services.

Yet another possible explanation is that the negative correlation we find is a consequence of financial
crises. High growth in finance tends to presage financial crises. And, financial crises are associated with
low growth.

Finally, we note the possibility of reverse causation. Low productivity growth could give rise to higher
financial sector growth. Rajan (2011) has argued that credit expansion has been pushed by politicians to
fill the gap between flat wage profiles and the expectation of ever-increasing living standards.9 Although
this could give rise to our results, we note that since the financial sector is more likely to grow faster when
the real economy grows more quickly, reverse causality is likely to give rise to a positive, not negative
correlations.10

Each of these possibilities leads us to either include a different control variable in the regression equation
(1); or, in the case of reverse causation, to use instrumental variables (IV). Table 2 summarizes the issues
and the control variables used to address them.

baseline equation (1). And for the last case, we investigate the possibility of reverse causality by

    Increased inequality may also have contributed to spur credit extension in particular to the poorest (see Rajan 2011).

  The view that financial development is a by-product of growth is discussed in Robinson (1952): “Where enterprise leads, finance
follows”. More recently, see Philippon and Reshef (2013) for a cross-country study of the long-run properties of the financial sector
income share.



                                                                    6

instrumenting for credit growth and financial sector employment growth in equation (1) as these two
variables are measured contemporaneously to the dependent variable, while the other explanatory
variables are all pre-determined. In all cases, the left-hand-side variable is the five-year average growth in
GDP per person employed and the right-hand-side variables include those in the baseline results reported
in Table 1.


We use three variables to instrument private real credit and employment growth variables: (1) the
beginning of period level of the nominal long term interest rate, (2) a financial liberalisation index and a
dummy variable which equals one if there is evidence of financial reform during the year prior to the one
under consideration.11 We base our choice of instruments on the view that a change in long term rates
affects productivity growth essentially through credit growth.12 Similarly, we presume that credit growth
is the main channel through which financial liberalisation and financial reforms affect productivity growth.

Instrumenting the growth in financial sector employment share variable proves to be more difficult,
although reverse causality may also be less of a concern. That said, we use four instruments: the financial
liberalisation index, the dummy variable for financial reform, manufacturing share in total employment,
and the bank share in total credit.

For the sake of brevity, we only report our estimate of the coefficient on growth in finance,  in equation
(1). Table 3 summarizes these results. Our reading of Table 3 is that the aggregate results are very robust.
To see this, note that when we use private real credit growth, the coefficient of interest in the OLS
regressions ranges from -0.07 to -0.10.13 And when we use the financial sector employment growth, the
coefficient of interest ranges in the OLS regressions from -0.15 and -0.18. Furthermore, there is no case
where the effect is not statistically significantly different from zero at the 5 percent level.

Before continuing, it is interesting to note that the coefficient of interest in the baseline regression tends
to be lower in absolute value to those obtained with IV estimation. This suggests that, if reverse causality
is playing any role, it is in the opposite direction, i.e. that higher productivity growth leads to higher not
lower credit growth. Hence the baseline OLS regressions tend to provide a lower bound for the effect of
financial sector growth on productivity growth.




11
  The dummy variable set to one if the financial liberalisation index increases. Data on financial liberalisation and financial reforms
are drawn from Abiad et al. (2008).
12
  It is surely possible that long term interest rates affect productivity growth independently of credit and employment. If this is the
case, it would mean that a lower long term rate raises productivity growth by allowing credit-constrained firms with positive NPV
projects to invest more. This would undermine the case for a negative relationship between credit and productivity growths and
reinforce our findings.
13
     The range is even narrower when using private real credit to non-financial firms.

 estimations, the Hansen test cannot reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are all valid.


The conclusion from the country-level data is clear: credit growth or financial sector employment growth
is a drag on output per worker growth. The impression from Graph 1 is supported by a more careful
statistical analysis. But what is behind this robust empirical regularity? What is the mechanism by which
finance, something we know to be fundamental to the operation of the economy, is doing harm? To
address this question, we turn first to theory and then return to empirics.

3. The model

To examine the possible sources of the relationship between financial sector growth and real growth we
construct a model where entrepreneurs combine their own resources with borrowed funds to invest a
project. Critically, we assume that entrepreneurs choose from a set of projects that differ in their return.
And, mirroring the real world, higher-return projects are presumed to be inherently riskier and more
difficult to finance. Specifically, the higher the return to a project, the more difficult it is to pledge its
output to potential financiers. That is, entrepreneurs face a trade-off between return and size: high-return
but difficult to finance projects on the one hand vs. low-return but easy to finance projects on the other.
We introduce growth in finance by assuming that financier’s technology for recovering debt in default
improves over time. This, in turn, increases entrepreneurs’ borrowing capacity. But the more rapidly
entrepreneurs’ borrowing capacity increases over time, the more profitable the lower return projects. The
result is the negative relationship between financial sector growth and real growth that we documented
in the previous section.

The remainder of this section presents the details of our model. We start with the general setup, before
proceeding with the dynamics of the economy and finally showing how growth in the borrowing capacity
affects output and total factor productivity growth.


3.1 The general framework, returns and borrowing constraints

Consider a small open economy with overlapping generations of entrepreneurs who live for three periods.
Entrepreneurs born at time t receive a bequest Et from the generation born at time t-1. Generation t
entrepreneurs combine this bequest with borrowing Bt obtained from financiers in order to invest in a
project. For simplicity and without loss of generality, we normalize the cost of capital to one. At time t+1,
the project produces output that is then used for three purposes: (i) repayment of the loan, Bt, (ii) bequeath
Et+1 to the next generation who is just born and (iii) savings St+1. Entrepreneurs born at time t can then
combine savings St+1 with some new borrowing Bt+1 to invest in the same project at time t+1. Finally at
time t+2, generation t entrepreneurs reap the project’s output and use it to for two different tasks: (i) pay
back liabilities Bt+1, and (ii) consume Ct+2.

The key assumption in our setup is that once entrepreneurs choose a project type, they are committed to
that same type for their entire productive life. This is consistent with the idea that entrepreneurs invest in
technologies, skills and capital for more than a single period at a time.

To continue, denoting  a positive scalar, we write the utility function of an entrepreneur born at date t as

(2)   U t  log Et 1   log Ct 2

Projects entrepreneurs can invest in, are indexed by their first period return which we denote R1.
Entrepreneurs face a risk return trade-off: namely, projects with a higher first period return R1 also face
larger uncertainty during the second period return which we denote R2. For simplicity we assume that the
second period return can, with equal probabilities, be either high R2 = R +(R1) or low R2 = R -(R1), with
’(ˑ)>0. Moreover we assume all available projects have positive average net present value (NPV), so that
R1; R2>1. Finally an entrepreneur can borrow at most an amount bt for each unit of own funds at date t.


3.2 The dynamics of the economy

Turning to the dynamics of this economy, we start by denoting the first and second period profit –per unit
of own funds- from a project undertaken in period t respectively as 𝜋 𝑅                     ,   and 𝜋   𝑅   ,   . We are now able

to write the utility maximization problem for an entrepreneur born at date t as


            ;
(3)
                                          ,
           s.t.
                                      ,

We can solve this problem for the period t+1 bequest and period t+2 consumption. This yields:

                  ∗
                                      ,
(4)                         and
           ∗
                                  ,           ,




The first expression governs the growth rate of the economy for a given project (R1,t) chosen at date t. To
see this, simply divide by Et and note that bequests (and hence the economy) grow at the rate

𝜋 𝑅    ,   ⁄ 1        𝛽 .

Next, we turn to the optimal project choice, which is related to the dynamics of entrepreneur’s borrowing
capacity.

3.3 Optimal project choice

Given that projects are all positive NPV, entrepreneurs always borrow as much as possible. Hence denoting
bt the amount of borrowing at date t per unit of own funds, the profit rates t(R1,t) and t+1(R2,t) for an
entrepreneur investing at date t in a project with first period return R1,t satisfy

With this in hand, we can now write down the project choice problem. Substituting the optimal bequest
E* and consumption C* from (4) into the utility function (2), yields the indirect utility function:

                                          ,                                    ,
                ,

                                      ,           with probability
             s.t.       ,
                                      ,           with probability

Projects with a large return R1 yield large first period profits, which fulfils two purposes as entrepreneurs
can make a large bequest and can also enjoy large savings which will be used for the second period
investment and will hence eventually help raise final consumption. However, projects with a large return
R1, while they contribute to raise second period consumption on average, also make it more volatile, which
reduces agent’s welfare. To find out how entrepreneurs trade-off higher bequest and average
consumption against more volatile consumption, we can write the first-order condition: Denoting

 t  bt 1  bt  , the debt to asset ratio, the optimal project entrepreneurs choose satisfies the following
first order condition:

              ,                                                    ,
(7)
                                              ,            ,



Using (7), we can now derive the following result:

         Entrepreneurs choose projects with lower average return R1,t when their borrowing capacity
         at date t+1 increases relative to their borrowing capacity at date t. That is, when credit
         grows more quickly, entrepreneurs undertake lower average return project, and so
         productivity grows more slowly.

To see this, we just need to differentiate the optimality condition (7) with respect to the return R1 and the
future borrowing capacity t+1. Doing so yields:

                                                               ,                   ,                    ,           ,

                                                                                       11

The term in bracket on the left-hand side in (8) is positive while the term on the right hand side is negative.
Entrepreneurs therefore respond to an increase in future borrowing by choosing projects with a lower
return R1 and a lower variance .

The intuition for this result is straightforward. The larger is bt+1, or equivalently t+1, the more costly are
risky projects for agents’ welfare. The key point to note here is that the marginal utility of second period
consumption increases with the amount of borrowing. Hence when borrowing is high, a negative shock
further raises the marginal utility of consumption. Since entrepreneurs prefer to avoid the case of large
marginal utility of consumption, they tend to invest in safer less productive projects when borrowing is
larger. Note that the opposite is the case for current borrowing: an increase in current borrowing bt raises
the marginal utility of bequest and entrepreneurs respond by choosing more productive/more risky
projects.


3.4 Credit growth and output growth

Denoting R1,t the first period return for projects started on date t, growth, given by the dynamics of the
initial endowment Et, is therefore a positive function of current borrowing but a negative function of future
borrowing:

                                  ,                                 ⁄                      ⁄
(9)                                           and                             0
Note that entrepreneurs’ project choice R1,t affects directly the total factor productivity growth of the
economy. Similarly, output at date t+1 is the sum of the first period output for entrepreneurs starting their
project at date t and the second period output for entrepreneurs who started their project at date t-1.
Output at date t+1 satisfies:

(10)        𝑦                         𝑅       ,       𝛽𝑅    ,           𝜋 𝑅   ,       𝐸

And, we can write the growth rate of output between t and t+1 as

                              ,           ,
 11                                                             𝑅   ,             𝛿
                          ,                       ,

We can now state our main result:

         A higher growth rate of credit reduces the growth of total factor productivity as well as the
         growth rate of aggregate output.

Interestingly, as was the case for the dynamics of initial endowment Et, changes in the level of credit have
positive effects on output growth in our model. To see this, consider an increase in bt. This has two effects.
On the one hand, there is a direct positive effect as entrepreneurs can raise more resources for investment.
On the other hand, an increase in current borrowing has a positive effect on the returns R1,t and R2,t-1 while




                                                                                      12
Cecchetti and Kharroubi                         Financial sector growth and real growth                           September 2018



it has a negative effect on the return R1,t-1. These two forces hence go in the same direction: an increase
in date-t borrowing raises the growth rate of output between date t and date t+1.


3.5 Heterogeneous entrepreneurs

Up to now, we have assumed that entrepreneurs are all the same. In practise however, they differ,
especially in their borrowing capacity. Consider then the case in which entrepreneurs are indexed
according to their borrowing capacity bi,t at time t, a higher index i corresponding to a larger borrowing
capacity bi,t.

Then assuming (ˑ) is linear with ’(ˑ)=, denoting i,t = bi,t/(1+bi,t), and defining Ri,1,t at the project chosen
by entrepreneurs with borrowing capacity bi,t at time t, the first order condition (8) simplifies to

                 , ,                                ,
(12)                        𝐹 𝛿 , ;𝛿 ,

 where 𝜕𝛿 , ⁄𝜕𝑏            0 and the function F(ˑ, ˑ) is positive and decreasing in both arguments. Hence, as was

the case with homogenous entrepreneurs, as future borrowing capacity bt+1 increases, entrepreneurs
choose less productive, less risky projects. However this effect is dampened for entrepreneurs enjoying a
larger borrowing capacity when

                       ,               ,                ,   ;   ,                                 ,
(13)                                                                 𝐹 𝛿 , ;𝛿 ,                              0.
When credit growth disproportionately benefits entrepreneurs with a lower borrowing capacity, i.e.
       ,
              0, then condition (10) always holds.14

An increase in the rate of credit expansion therefore tends to generate a disproportionate drop in growth
for entrepreneurs with a lower borrowing capacity relative to those with a larger borrowing capacity.



4. Industry-level data empirical investigation

Two main conclusions emerge from the model of the previous section. First, the model’s predictions match
the empirical results at the aggregate level reported in Section 2: credit growth is negatively correlated
with productivity growth. Second, the model shows that credit growth disproportionately harms
entrepreneurs based on their ability to borrow. Specifically, the more tangible an entrepreneur’s assets, or
the easier it is for them to pledge their output, the less they will be harmed as credit growth increases. To
figure out which sectors are these likely to be, we consider a measure of asset tangibility. And, we use
R&D intensity as a proxy for the ability to pledge output.



                                   ,
14
     Note that the condition               0,   is sufficient but not necessary to obtain the result that entrepreneurs with a lower
borrowing capacity tend to reduce by more the productivity of the projects they pick up for a given expansion in credit. For instance
when an expansion in credit affects all entrepreneurs’ borrowing capacity equally, then our main conclusion still holds.



                                                                    13

4.1 The data

We start with a brief description of data both on credit and on the extent to which an individual industry
owns tangible assets or output. Graph 3 plots the average growth rate from 2000 to 2008 for three credit
indicators in the OECD countries in our sample. Note that Japan and Germany have experienced zero or
even negative real credit growth. Switzerland exhibits very balanced credit growth across firms and
households (around 2 percent). Unsurprisingly, Spain shows a strong boom regardless of how it is
measured. So far, this is as expected. What is surprising is the fact that there are the booms in Denmark
and Sweden – close to or even larger than those in the United Kingdom and the United States.15

period 2000 to 2006.


Turning to industry-specific characteristics, we construct the ratio of tangible to total assets using data
from Braun (2005). Tangible assets include property, plants and equipment, while total assets adds
goodwill, R&D, associated human capital, organizational capital, accounts receivables, cash, and inventory
levels. Braun calculates a given industry’s tangibility level as the median for U.S. companies in the industry
for the period from 1986 to 1995.

We compute R&D intensity analogously as the median ratio across firms belonging to the corresponding
industry in the US of R&D expenditures to total value added. As we just mentioned, R&D intensity gives
us an indication of the likely pledgeability of a firm’s output. The more R&D intensive, the more likely the
products will have a large intellectual property component.

We follow Rajan and Zingales (1998) in measuring industry characteristics using US data. This approach,
which is forced on us by data availability, assumes that differences across industries are driven largely by
differences in technology that are the roughly similar in all countries. Given that our sample is for advanced
OECD economies with substantial cross-border trade, this seems an innocuous assumption.16

Graphs 4 and 5 report the industry-level measures. Starting with asset tangibility in Graph 4, unsurprisingly
industries like petroleum refining, paper and products, and iron and steel have the highest levels of
tangible assets. At the other end of spectrum is computing machinery, communication equipment and
medical instruments.

Turning to R&D intensity in Graph 5, the picture is somewhat different. Here we plot the ratio of average
R&D expenditure to value added for the period 1990–99. Looking at the graph, we can divide industries
into two distinct groups: one with very low and one with very high R&D intensity. In the first group, we
have tobacco, textiles, printing, basic metals and shipbuilding; while the second includes communications
equipment, medical instruments and aircraft industries. In the latter group, R&D expenditures can be as
large as one third of total value added. Note also that the size for these two groups is fairly different: out
of the 33 industries in our sample, 22 display R&D expenditures of less than 10 percent of value added.
By contrast, only three industries devote more than 30 percent of their value added to R&D expenditures.
(We note that the correlation between the measures plotted in Graphs 4 and 5 – between our measures
of asset tangibility and R&D intensity – is less than -0.5.)17




16
  More precisely, the working assumption is that the ranking of industries according to asset tangibility or R&D intensity is country-
invariant.
17
     Table A1 reports information on the external financial dependence and R&D intensity of the industries in the sample.

4.2 The empirical specification and the results

Our sample is a panel of countries and industries over the period from 2000 to 2008. For the countries,
data availability limits us to advanced OECD countries. And for industries, we are restricted to
manufacturing sectors. Following Rajan and Zingales (1998), the following regression allows us to test for
the effects of interest:

(14)         yi ,c  i  c   ( pi x gc )   zi ,c   i ,c ,

where yi,c is the average growth rate of real value added (per person employed) in industry i in country c
over the period 2000 to 2008 ; i and c are industry and country fixed effects; pi×gc, the interaction variable
of interest, is the product of industry i's measure of pledgeability pi and country c's financial sector growth
gc. Finally, we control for initial conditions: zi,c is the log ratio of value added (per person employed) in
industry i in country c in year 2000 to manufacturing value added (per person employed) in country c in
2000.18,19

We estimate equation (14) using a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) procedure, computing
heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. This brings up the possibility of simultaneity bias. As noted
earlier, the variable for the essential industry characteristic – either asset tangibility or R&D intensity – is
based entirely on US data. This reliance on the United States mitigates the possibility of reverse causation,
as it seems quite unlikely that industry growth outside the US affects characteristics of industries in the
US. In addition, as noted earlier, growth in finance is measured at the country level, whereas the dependent
variable is measured at the industry level. Again, this reduces the scope for reverse causality as long as
each individual industry represents a small share of total output in the economy. (For completeness, we
also report IV estimates in section 4.3).

Our main results are in Table 4. Industry-level labour productivity growth is significantly negatively
correlated with the interaction term, measured as the product of industry asset tangibility and either
financial sector growth or industry R&D intensity and financial sector growth. When the financial sector
grows more quickly, industry-level productivity tends to grow disproportionately faster in industries with
either higher asset tangibility or lower R&D intensity. This confirms the mechanism highlighted in the
model that financial sector growth benefits sectors whose assets are more tangible or whose output is
easier to pledge. Furthermore, the results are robust to the measure of financial sector growth.




18
   The choice of this time period has no significant implications for the results. It is, however, useful in dealing with possible reverse
causality issues, as industry characteristics are measured prior to 2000.
19
  This methodology has been used to study, for example, implications of financial sector composition, bank- versus market-based,
on industry growth (Beck and Levine (2002)) and how financial (under)development affects industry volatility (Raddatz (2006)).

     The dependent variable is the average annual growth rate in real value-added per person employed for the period 2000–08 for each industry in each country. Asset tangibility
     is the median for U.S. companies in the industry for the period 1986–1995. R&D intensity is the average for the ratio of R&D expenditures to value added for US industries for
     the period 1990–2000. The interaction variable is the product of variables. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. All estimations include country and industry dummies
     and the log of industry value added per person employed to total manufacturing value added per person employed in 2000. Significance at the 1/5/10% level is indicated by

As for the quantitative implications of these estimates, we compare the difference in productivity growth
between a sector with low asset tangibility (high R&D intensity) located in a country whose financial system
is growing slowly and a sector with high asset tangibility (low R&D intensity) located in a country whose
financial system is growing rapidly, all else equal. The row labelled "Difference-in-difference effect" in
Table 4 reports the results from this experiment.20 We find an effect of between 3½ and 4½ percent when
industries are ranked according to asset tangibility. This means that productivity of an industry with high
asset tangibility located in a country experiencing a financial boom tends to grow 3½-4½ percent a year
more quickly than an industry with low asset tangibility located in a country not experiencing such a boom.
This difference-in-difference effect is the same order of magnitude as the unconditional sample volatility
of labour productivity growth, which is 4 percent.

Turning to industry R&D intensity, we estimate a difference-in-difference effect that is between –2 and
–2½ percent. That is to say, the productivity of a sector with high R&D intensity located in a country with
a rapidly-growing financial sector grows between 2 and 2½ percent a year more slowly than a sector with
low R&D intensity located in a country whose financial system is growing slowly. This confirms the
prediction of the model: financial sector growth benefits disproportionately more to sectors whose output
is easy to pledge.




20
    We compute the difference-in-difference effect as the coefficient on the interaction term times the difference between the
product of the 75th percentile of financial sector growth and the 75th percentile of either asset tangibility or R&D intensity and the
product evaluated at the 25th percentile. That is, the difference-in-difference effect = [pi(75th percentile) x gc(75th percentile)- pi(25th
percentile) x gc(25th percentile)].

4.3 Instrumenting credit growth

The industry level investigation is designed to isolate causality running from aggregate developments in
credit to industry specific growth performance. But it is surely possible that credit growth is a policy
decision that depends on country characteristics. For example, in countries where high tangibility or low
R&D-intensive sectors are larger, there could be demands to expand credit more quickly as such sectors
benefit disproportionately more from such expansion. Similarly, countries where such sectors are expected
to grow more quickly could experience stronger credit growth. To address this potential endogeneity, we
instrument for credit expansion with the nominal short and long term interest rates in 2000, the level for
financial liberalisation in 2000 and a financial reform dummy that takes a value one if the financial
liberalisation index rose between 1999 and 2000.

Financial reforms are likely carried out with an eye toward expanding credit, particularly to constrained
firms. Hence countries where high tangibility or low R&D sectors are either large or expected to grow
quickly are unlikely to launch such reforms, as such sectors would fear a crowding-out effect to the benefit
of formerly credit-constrained sectors. Nominal interest rates are also useful as instruments because short-
and long-term rates are positively correlated with subsequent credit growth in our sample, while the
difference between them (which is a measure of growth opportunities) is not. Hence instrumenting credit
growth with interest rates helps isolate the supply shock to credit growth which arguably does not depend
on sectoral growth.

The results of this IV procedure are reported in Table 5. The point estimates are slightly lower than their
OLS counterparts reported in Table 4 for the interaction with asset tangibility but slightly larger (in
absolute value) for the interaction with R&D intensity. All in all, this suggests that our results are not driven
by reverse causality.21




21
  An interesting qualification is that, while the interaction term with growth in total real credit has the largest effect on industry
productivity growth in the OLS estimates, the interaction term with growth in real credit to firms is now largest.

4.4 Robustness

There is a variety of plausible alternative interpretations for our industry-level results. We examine four in
some detail. First, there is the possibility that the negative impact of financial growth on industry-level
productivity growth arises from the level of financial development itself. If financial sector growth and the
level of financial development are negatively related (larger financial sectors tend to grow more slowly)
and the size of the financial sector is positively related to industry productivity growth, then we would
mistakenly attribute to financial sector growth a negative effect that in reality reflects the positive effect
of the financial development level. Second, our results could be driving by changes in monetary policy.
Financial sector growth is likely to be related to the stance of monetary policy and the cost of capital: the
more accommodative monetary policy and the lower the cost of capital, the faster the financial sector will
grow. Since monetary policy is most accommodative during periods when aggregate growth is low, this
raises the possibility that what we are finding is essentially the effect of countercyclical monetary policy.
Third, there is the potential impact of fiscal policy. If fiscal deficits crowd out credit extension to the private
sector, then again we could be confounding an aggregate cyclical policy with what we believe to be a
cross-sectional effect. Fourth, the extent to which the economy is a net importer of both capital and goods
could influence the availability of resources and have a differential impact on the productivity performance
of more financially constrained sectors.



                                                                                    20

Appendix tables A2 and A3 present a set of results that addresses these four possibilities. There, we report
the coefficient on the interaction term in which a variety of variables are added to our baseline regression,
equation (14). Overall, the results reported in the previous section are confirmed in terms of both statistical
and economic importance. Financial sector growth is detrimental to industries that have more tangible
assets or are more R&D-intensive. Taken together, this leads us to conclude that our results are quite
robust.



5. Conclusion

In this paper, we study the real effects of financial sector growth and come to two important conclusions.
First, the growth of a country's financial system is a drag on productivity growth. That is, higher growth in
the financial sector reduces real growth. Financial booms are not, in general, growth-enhancing. Second,
using sectoral data, we examine the distributional nature of this effect and find that credit booms harm
what we normally think of as the engines for growth – those industries that have either lower asset
tangibility or high R&D-intensity. This evidence, together with recent experience during the financial crisis,
leads us to conclude that there is a pressing need to reassess the relationship of finance and real growth
in modern economic systems.
