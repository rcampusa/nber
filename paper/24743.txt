Sweden's Fiscal Framework and Monetary Policy

                                         ABSTRACT

Basic economic reasoning tells us that monetary and fiscal policies always interact to jointly
determine aggregate demand and the overall level of prices in the economy. This paper interprets
Sweden's explicit monetary and fiscal frameworks in light of this reasoning, bringing recent
Swedish inflation and interest-rate developments to bear on the interpretations. Theory and
evidence raise the question of whether the two policy frameworks are mutually consistent.

1    Introdu              tion


Basi       e onomi    reasoning tells us that monetary and s al poli ies ne essarily intera t in the

short, medium, and long runs. These intera tions jointly determine an e onomy's ma roe-

 onomi          developments. This reasoning is      ompletely general, independent of any parti ular

e onomi          model or view of how the e onomy operates.

         Most    ountries' monetary and s al poli y institutions, in           ontrast, are founded on the

presumption that the two poli ies           an and should    operate independently of ea h other. This

presumption underlies the            reation of   entral banks that are given well-spe ied mandates

to       ontrol ination and stabilize the real e onomy and to operate in isolation from pressures

that might emanate from s al authorities. Fis al poli y, meanwhile, is assigned the task of

stabilizing debtwhat is           alled sustainable s al poli yand often little else. Underlying

this institutional         onstru t are the beliefs that (i) s al poli y has little, if any, impa t on

ination; (ii) monetary poli y has negligible s al            onsequen es; and (iii) the single-minded

s al pursuit of debt stabilization supports, rather than thwarts, the entral bank's mandates.

Sometimes, this institutional arrangement works. At other times, the arrangement leads to

monetary and s al poli ies that are mutually in onsistent.

         The presumption that poli ies       an and should operate independently denies an essential

fa t about modern publi            nan e: governments issue          nominal   bondsbonds denominated

in lo al        urren ybut bondholders       are about the    real   value of those bonds. The real value

 omes from deating nominal debt by the overall level of pri es in the e onomy, something

like the        onsumer pri e index. Be ause modern         entral banks aim to target the rate of hange

of the pri e levelthe ination rateit is impossible to separate monetary and s al poli y

 ompletely. And eorts to do so         an    reate poli y   oni ts.

      Re ent Swedish monetary and s al a tions illustrate the possibility of         oni t. At a time

when monetary poli y has been aggressively expansionary in an eort to raise ination

negative poli y interest rates for three years,          oupled with signi ant asset pur hases that

have produ ed a more than four-fold in rease in the            entral bank's balan e sheet from 2007
          1
to 2017 s al poli y has be ome more            ontra tionary, with net lending moving from       −1.6
per ent of GDP in 2014 to       1.2   per ent in the rst two quarters of 2017. Fis al poli y has

been deationary when monetary poli y has been inationary.

      Sweden is a fas inating ase to study how monetary and s al poli ies intera t to inuen e

the aggregate e onomy.       The      ountry stands out for being expli it about the obje tives

and targets of ma roe onomi           poli ies. Sveriges Riksbank, Sweden's      entral bank, exibly

targets ination at 2 per ent, while the government            urrently pursues a medium-term net-

lending target of 1 per ent of GDP. Expli itness makes Swedish poli y behavior amenable

to assessment, whi h is one goal of this arti le. I raise the possibility that the poli y rule

that Swedish s al authorities follow, parti ularly in re ent years, may be at odds with the

Riksbank's primary goal of targeting ination.


1.1    Targets vs. Rules



Expli it poli y targets are not su ient to ensure ee tive poli y performan e.                 Central

banks with expli it ination targets         ommuni ate mu h more than their target to the publi .

There are innitely many ways that the Riksbank              ould try to a hieve its 2 per ent target.

Ea h wayor poli y ruleae ts private-se tor expe tations dierently. Ea h rule and its

asso iated expe tations has unique impa ts on the publi 's e onomi               de isions. To redu e

the likelihood of mistaken publi        expe tations, the Riksbank       ommuni ates the parti ular

rule that it tries to follow.

      Communi ating the rule is        hallenging.   To a hieve its ination target, the Riksbank

analyzes a vast array of datadomesti and foreign ination and real e onomi              developments

and fore asts,     urrent and prospe tive values of the krona, publi            and nan ial market
                                                                                 2
expe tations of ination, and even politi al events at home and abroad.              By des ribing how

these fa ts and    onje tures inuen e its       hoi e of the path for the repo rate, the Riksbank

is explaining its poli y rule:     how the       entral bank rea ts to various kinds of news that

ae t Swedish ination and real a tivity.          Of    ourse, the Riksbank, and no      entral bank,

   1 Total assets more than tripled between the third quarter of 2008 and the rst quarter of 2009 and
remained elevated until the se ond half of 2010. Assets have nearly doubled over the negative poli y rate
period beginning in 2015.
   2 See Sveriges Riksbank (2018, hapter 1) for examples.

follows a simple algebrai     rule that   an be pre isely and su       in tly   ommuni ated. But it

does respond systemati ally to e onomi         onditions and that systemati       behavior guides the

publi 's formation of expe tations about future monetary poli y a tions.

      The Swedish government's net-lending target, while          ommendable from the viewpoint of

s al sustainability, does nothing to     ommuni ate the s al behavior that tries to a hieve the

target. This is a potentially serious short oming of Sweden's s al framework, a short oming

shared by governments the world over. Governments           an perhaps be forgiven for    onfounding

rules and targets. Even the International Monetary Fund uses the term rule to des ribe

s al targets and restraints, rather than to       hara terize how the s al authority behaves

[S hae hter et al. (2012)℄.

      Be ause this paper fo uses on how intera tions among s al, monetary, and publi               be-
havior   determine the e onomy-wide pri e level, to avoid          onfusion I will delineate between

targets and rules. Targets refer to ination at 2 per ent and net lending at 1 per ent, while

rules des ribe the poli y behavior that a hieves those targets. A rule           hara terizes how the

hoi e of a poli y instrumentthe repo rate, tax rates, expenditure              omponentsdepends

on prevailing e onomi      onditions. I argue that the poli y rules are all-important for deter-

mining the pri e level and, by extension, the performan e of the ma ro e onomy.


1.2    Sket h of Paper



Before getting into details about Sweden, it is ne essary to lay some groundwork for un-

derstanding how and why it is essential to study monetary and s al poli ies together,

rather than separately. To that end, I des ribe the nature of poli y intera tions in any well-

fun tioning equilibrium. Fundamental e onomi          prin iples     arry some    riti al impli ations

that    oni t with beliefs (i)(iii). First, it is the   joint   monetary-s al poli y regime that

determines an e onomy's ination rate.        Se ond, monetary poli y a tions always have s-

 al    onsequen es onsequen es that may be large at timesand how s al poli y rea ts to

those    onsequen es matters for the ultimate impa ts of the monetary poli y a tions. Finally,

the rule that the government pursues implements to pursue debt stabilization matters for

the    entral bank's ability to a hieve its mandates.

      With that e onomi    ba kground in pla e, the paper turns to analyze features of Swedish

ma roe onomi      poli ies and re ent Swedish e onomi        developments. These in lude


  1. negative bond yields over the maturity stru ture, whi h              onstitute   prima fa ie   evi-

        den e of a s al poli y that redu es so ial welfare, but also ree t the low-interest rate

        environment in whi h the Swedish e onomy nds itself;


  2. the fragilityin the sense of potentially indu ing instability in government debtof

       Sweden's net-lending target, for reasons rst arti ulated by Phillips (1954);


    3. eviden e of Swedish s al poli y behavior and the ba king that it provides for monetary

       poli y;


    4. an explanation of how, parti ularly in low-ination periods, monetary poli y a tions

        an generate potentially substantial s al impa ts in subtle ways that are not part of

       typi al e onomi     analyses at   entral banks and ministries of nan e.


    The paper's aim is not to       riti ize Swedish poli ies. Sweden's s al situation is sound:

the government owns equities and its net nan ial position is positive.             But the Swedish

government nonetheless issues krona-denominated debt, so the analysis in this paper applies

to Sweden, as it would to less s ally sound e onomies. The paper tries to shed light on how

monetary and s al poli ies in Sweden jointly determine ma roe onomi                out omes. Along

the way, the paper may point toward alternative s al rules that are               onsistent with the

aims of Sweden's Fis al Poli y Framework and are more              ompatible with the job that the

Riksbank has been tasked to perform.



2   Monetary and Fis              al Poli       y Basi      s


Mu h dis ourse about ma roe onomi           poli ies applies the following logi . The      entral bank

sets its poli y instrumentsa short-term nominal interest rate, the level of bank reserves, the

size and    omposition of its balan e sheetbut does not set taxes and government expendi-

tures. The government       hooses the level and     omposition of various taxes and expenditures

and the quantity and maturity stru ture of the debt it issues, but not the variables the             en-

tral bank    ontrols. Having established who        ontrols what, analyses of poli y impa ts often

pro eed along similar lines to ask: How do             hanges in the   entral bank's (government's)

instruments ae t the e onomy, holding xed s al (monetary) instruments? Although su h

questions seem to make sense on the surfa e, basi            e onomi    reasoning tells us that it is

rarely possible to    hange a monetary (s al) instrument without eventually            hanging s al

(monetary) instruments in parti ular ways.

    Resear h over the past 25 years establishes this reasoning to emphasize that monetary and
                                                                                                 3
s al poli y   jointly determine the e   onomy-wide level of pri es and the rate of ination.        Out

of that literature has emerged the understanding that two distin t          ombinations of monetary

behavior.

and s al poli y behaviorpoli y regimes an determine the pri e level and stabilize the

level of government debt.


2.1    Poli y Regimes



Table 1 summarizes the poli y mixes that determine ination and stabilize debt. To make

the arguments      lear, I make stark and unrealisti        assumptions about poli y behavior. The

arguments go through with more plausible assumptions.

      The rst regime ree ts the        onventional view that monetary poli y a tively adjusts

the poli y interest rate to lean against ination, while s al poli y passively adjusts primary

budget surplusesrevenues less expenditures, not in luding interest payments on government

debtto stabilize the long-run debt-GDP ratio. Taylor's famous rule falls into this regime:

the    entral bank raises the poli y interest rate more than one-for-one with the ination rate
                                                                                                        4
and raises the interest rate more modestly when the output gap in reases [Taylor (1993)℄.

Be ause monetary poli y fo uses on stabilizing ination and the real e onomy, s al poli y

must ensure that government debt remains well behaved. When s al poli y makes taxes

rise with the level of real government debtnominal debt deated by the pri e levelby

more than enough to       over interest payments and some of the prin ipal, the debt-GDP ratio

will be stable in the long run. Many e onomists believe this regime prevails during normal

e onomi     times. All ination-targeting       entral banks believe they operate in this regime.

   4 For reasons rst arti ulated by Obstfeld and Rogo (1983), monetary poli y    annot deliver a unique
ination rate in a pure at   urren y regime. Co hrane (2011) and Sims (2013) re ently emphasized that the
Taylor rule permits explosive ination paths to be equilibria, along with the stable ination out ome that
e onomists usually fo us on.

of in ome, by setting primary surplusesdened as tax revenues less expenditures, ex luding

interest payments on outstanding debtindependently of debt and the pri e level. Monetary

poli y   hooses the interest rate so that it responds only weaklyor not at allto ination,

whi h permits expansions in government debt to raise the pri e level. Higher pri e levels and

lower bond pri es redu e the       real     market value of debtthe quantity of goods and servi es

that a government bond        an pur hasesto make the debt-GDP ratio stable.

   At a general level, there is nothing good or bad about the two poli y regimes. Re ent

resear h on jointly optimal monetary and s al poli ies nds that the best mix of poli ies in

terms of so ial welfare has elements of both the              onventional and the alternative views [Sims

(2013) and Leeper and Zhou (2013)℄. Both regimes deliver the broad ma roe onomi                        poli y

goals of determining ination and stabilizing government debt. But be ause monetary and

s al a tions have dierent impa ts in the two regimes, it is essential for poli ymakers to

know in whi h regime the e onomy resides.

   Be ause U.S. monetary poli y behavior was been widely studied, I will point out several

instan es sin e Ameri a left the gold standard in April 1933 in whi h the Federal Reserve

seems to have followed this alternative behavior: from April 1933 until about 1936; through-

out World War II until the Treasury-Fed A              ord in Mar h 1951; mu h of the 1970s; the 2008
                                        5
nan ial     risis and its aftermath.       And there have been times when s al poli y pays s ant

attention to debt in order to pursue other obje tives: despite extremely high war debt, in

1948 Congress overrode President Truman's veto and                 ut taxes; the E onomi     Re overy Plan

of 1981 in reased primary de its even as the debt-GDP ratio was rising from its post-war

low in the early 1980s; both the E onomi                Growth and Tax Relief Re on iliation A t of

2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Re on iliation A t of 2003                    ut taxes at times of

rising debt; the Ameri an Re overy and Reinvestment A t of 2009 in reased spending and

 ut some taxes despite rising debt; even with re ord pea etime government debt levels, in
                                                                               6
De ember 2017 the U.S. government passed a major                   ut in taxes.

   During and sin e the nan ial             risis of 2007,    entral banks around the world have main-

tained poli y interest rates that are pegged at extraordinarily low levels with the aim of

stimulating real e onomi       a tivity. This behavior pla es monetary poli y into the alterna-

tive view    ategory. At the same time, s al poli iesparti ularly in Europehave been

adjusting to stabilize government debt following brief ex ursions into stimulative stan es

designed to help lift e onomies out of re ession.               By table 1's   ategorizations, the mix of

pegged interest rates and stabilizing s al poli y, if people expe t it would last forever, do

2.2    Fis al Consequen es of Monetary Poli y



To keep this dis ussion fo used, in what follows I                onsider only the        onventional mix of

monetary and s al poli y behavior.              That poli y       ombination underlies the Riksbank's

per eptions of its behavior and the rationale for Sweden's Fis al Poli y Framework.                          The

independent Riksbank pursues its ination target, while the government a ts to ensure debt

is stable. This     onventional view of ma roe onomi              poli ies is the foundation of monetary

and s al institutions in nearly all        ountries.

      My key message is: under this        onventional poli y mix, monetary and s al poli ies              must
intera t in    ertain well-spe ied ways. It is not possible for monetary and s al poli y to

operate independently of ea h other and still deliver good e onomi                     performan e. Under-

standing the nature of these intera tions is essential to formulating ee tive poli y rules.
                                                                            8
      Monetary poli y a tions always have s al              onsequen es.       Let's start with something

routine: the Riksbank lowers the repo rate in order to raise ination. This isn't the end of

the story: a lower repo rate tends to lower all interest rates, in luding those on government

debt, so interest payments on outstanding debt de line.

      Now s al poli y     omes into play. Those lower interest payments redu e s al needs. To

ensure that government debt is stable, taxes must be lower or expenditures must be higher in

the future to oset the redu ed debt servi e. Without these s al adjustments, government

debt would steadily fall, eventually making the government a net lender to the private se tor.

      But there is a tually more to the s al response than simply stabilizing debt.                      Lower

interest payments on government bonds redu e the wealth of holders of those bonds. If those

lower interest re eipts do not trigger an expe tation of eventually lower taxes to                  ompensate

for the redu ed wealth, lower wealth will lead to redu ed demand for goods and servi es

lower aggregate demandand a lower pri e level.

      Be ause the Riksbank initially redu ed the repo rate in the hope of                   raising   aggregate

demand and ination, the negative wealth ee t                   an thwart the Riksbank's eorts.             To

support monetary poli y, s al poli y needs to provide the s al ba king that adjusts future

taxes in the opposite dire tion to pri e-level movements. A higher pri e levelthe Riksbank's

immediate goalrequires a s al rule that lowers future taxes, while a lower pri e level                     alls

for a poli y that raises taxes. Su h a rule eliminates the wealth ee ts of entral bank hanges

in interest rates to deliver the desired ee t of monetary poli y on aggregate demand.

      The s al rule under the       onventional view in table 1 both stabilizes debt and provides

a ademi   literature. Indetermina y means that the ination rate is not pinned down by poli y and is subje t
to potentially volatile u tuations that arise from self-fullling expe tations of ination by the private se tor.
Woodford (2003) explains that determina y is a minimal requirement for optimal poli y.
   8 Tobin (1980) and Walla e (1981) make this point.

the ne essary s al ba king for monetary poli y. A rule that raises future surpluses whenever

real debt in   reases has two omponents to it. First, for a xed pri e level, higher nominal debt

brings forth higher surpluses to ensure government debt is stable. Se ond, for a xed level

of nominal debt, a lower pri e level    reates the expe tation of higher future taxes to provide

the s al ba king for monetary poli y's ination-targeting a tions. The passive poli y rule

in the table happens to deliver both desirable out omes.

     The message is:    to su   essfully raise ination, the Riksbank's    looser monetary poli y
(lower repo rate) ne essarily requires   looser s al poli y   (smaller budget surpluses) at some

point. That s al response is essential for the Riksbank to be able to         ontrol ination and

fulll the pri e-stability poli y mission that the Rigsdag set out for the bank in the Sveriges

Riksbank A t.

     Unfortunately, not all s al rules both stabilize debt and ba k monetary poli y. This is

why it's important for governments to move beyond adopting targets, toward des ribing the

behavior that a hieves the targets. Both out omes rely on s al expe tations. If markets

know that higher real debt eventually leads to higher stabilizing surpluses, then s al poli y

will not run into sustainability problems, as investors are assured the government will fulll

its nan ial    ommitments. This argument gures prominently in the Swedish s al poli y

framework [Swedish Government (2011), pages 5, 7, and 12, for example℄. If bondholders

know that lower taxes are sure to follow lower interest re eipts, then monetary poli y's

adverse wealth ee ts will not arise, and interest-rate poli y will ae t ination as intended.

This point is missing from the Swedish s al framework.

     Appropriate s al ba king for monetary poli y is    riti al for the Riksbank to a hieve pri e

stability. In a    ountry like Sweden, with an expli it s al target, it is essential to ensure

that the s al rules used to implement the target provide appropriate ba king for monetary

poli y. A   orre tly designed rule an hors people's expe tations on the belief that s al poli y

will, in time, rea t appropriately to monetary poli y by eliminating the wealth ee ts that

monetary poli y produ es.

To gain a deeper understanding of the monetary-s al           ombinations in table 1, it is helpful

to   onsider a tual instan es when poli y behavior departed from the        onventional monetary-

s al regime.

3.1    An Important Ameri an Case



Re overy from the Great Depression illustrates that the alternative monetary-s al poli y
                                              9
mix has been an expli it poli y hoi e.            President Franklin D. Roosevelt took o e in Mar h

1933 at the lowest point of the Great Depression. Compared to the third quarter of 1929,

real GNP was 36 per ent lower, industrial produ tion had been                ut in half, unemployment

rose from almost nothing to a quarter of the workfor e, and the pri e level had fallen 27

per ent.    The new president        ommitted to raise the pri e level by a hieving  . . . the kind

of a dollar whi h a generation hen e will have the same pur hasing power and debt-paying

power as the dollar we hope to attain in the near future [Roosevelt (1933b)℄. The rst step

toward permanently raising the pri e level was to abandon the gold standard in favor of

what Roosevelt        alled a managed       urren y [Roosevelt (1933a)℄.

      Abandoning       onvertibility of the dollar to gold in luded abrogating the gold         lause, a

 ontra tual provision that gave        reditors the option to re eive payment in gold, on all future

and past publi        and private   ontra ts. This     hanged the nature of government debt. Under

 onvertibility, even though government bonds paid in dollars, the Treasury was required to

 onvert those dollars into gold on demand. When the Treasury didn't have the gold on hand,

it had to a quire the gold, typi ally through higher taxes.            The new managed         urren y

standard broke the automati           link between new bonds and future surpluses: government

bonds were simply promises to pay dollars, whi h the U.S. government                 ould freely    reate
                             10
without adjusting taxes.

      Roosevelt used three strategies to       onvin e the publi   that higher government debt would

not ne essitate higher future taxes. First, he made poli y depend on the state of the e on-

omy, saying he would run bond-nan ed de its until the e onomy re overed. Se ond, he

emphasized the temporary nature of the poli y by distinguishing between the regular bud-

get, whi h he balan ed, and the emergen y budget, whose de its were driven by spending

designed to provide relief to those the depression had harmed. Finally, Roosevelt raised the

politi al stakes by pit hing e onomi          re overy as a war for the survival of demo ra y [Roo-

sevelt (1936)℄. The strategies appeared to work be ause expe ted ination began to rise by

spring 1933 [Jalil and Rua (2017)℄.

      Monetary poli y behaved passively through the re overy.            After the United States left

gold, the Fed no longer needed to keep interest rates high to staun h the outow of gold

and the New York Fed redu ed its dis ount rate to 1.5 per ent in February 1934, where it

remained until August 1937, when it was lowered to 1 per ent.                From November 1933 to

   9 This draws on Ja obson et al. (2017).
  10 Today all but the 10 per ent of Treasury debt that is indexed to ination is also merely a promise to
pay future dollars.

February 1937, the Fed       ondu ted no open-market pur hases of Treasury se urities.          One

 ontemporary observer wrote that the Federal Reserve served merely as a te hni al instru-

ment for ee ting the Treasury's poli ies [Johnson (1939, p. 211)℄. Clearly, the Fed did not

follow anything resembling a Taylor rule; instead, monetary poli y permitted the expansion

in government debt to stimulate the e onomy, as it does in the alternative poli y mix.

      E onomi    re overy was rapid.    Real GNP returned to its pre-depression level in 1937.

Pri e levels onsumer and wholesale pri e indexes and the GNP deatorrose. The deator

regained its 1920s levels, while the other two fell somewhat short.

      Historians like Friedman and S hwartz (1963) and Romer (1992) attribute re overy to

higher growth in the supply of money. After Ameri a left the gold standard, the Treasury

bought the gold that owed into the        ountry from a politi ally unstable Europe and paid for

that gold by dire tly expanding bank reserves and high-powered money. But that explanation

overlooks the signi ant expansion in government debt that took pla e. The dollar value of

federal debt outstanding doubled in the six years after leaving the gold standard, ree ting

the substantial s al stimulus asso iated with Roosevelt's relief programs.

      Remarkably, this expansion in nominal debt did not raise the debt-GNP ratio. Figure 1

plots the par and market values of gross federal debt as per entages of GNP from 1920 to

1940. The verti al line marks departure from gold in April 1933. After bottoming out in

September 1929 at 15.6 per ent, the debt-GNP ratio rose steadily while the United States

was still on gold, rea hing 44.7 per ent in Mar h 1933. It then remained below 45 per ent

through the end of 1937. E onomi         re overy raised both the pri e level and the real level of

e onomi     a tivity, ensuring that the debt-GNP ratio was stable.

      In this alternative poli y mix, the Federal Reserve behaved passively, permitting the s al

expansion to raise aggregate demand and with it, pri es and output. With this poli y mix,

there need not be any      oni t between s al expansion and s al sustainability be ause, as

the data in gure 1 neatly illustrate, the s al expansion did not in rease debt relative to

the size of the e onomy.

Countries have not always provided appropriate s al ba king.                 In re ent years, Brazil

followed a s al poli y that was unresponsive to debt, while its              entral bank sought to

target ination.     The 1988     onstitution indexed government benets to ination, whi h

pla ed 90 per ent of expenditures out of legislative         ontrol. At the same time, tax in reases

were politi ally infeasible, leading to growing primary de its with no prospe t of reversal.

When ination began to rise, the        entral bank aggressively raised interest rates, just as the

Taylor prin iple instru ts.      Debt servi e rose, driving up aggregate demand and ination.

In De ember 2015, the primary de it was 1.88 per ent of GDP, but the gross de it

primary plus interest paymentswas 10.34 per ent of output. Figure 2 plots Ban o Central

do Brasil's poli y rate, the Seli , along with the              onsumer pri e ination rate from 2013

through 2015.    Despite a doubling of the poli y rate, the ination rate rose by nearly 5

per entage points:    monetary poli y does not appear to be                   ontrolling ination.            In fa t,

ination began to retreat in 2016 only after the             entral bank had stabilized the Seli             at 14.25

per ent for a year.

   It is tempting to infer that Brazil's problems stemmed from dysfun tional s al poli y.

Surely, if s al poli y follows well-spe ied guidelines that ensure responsible s al behav-

ior, monetary poli y will be able to           ontrol ination.        In fa t, the explanation lies in an

in ompatible    ombination of monetary and s al poli ies that were both a tive, in table 1's

nomen lature.

   Switzerland has had responsible s al targets for 15 years and it takes those targets
                                                                                                        12
seriously. By seriously I mean the government a tually a hieves those targets.                              Sin e a

nationwide referendum in 2001, Switzerland has pursued a debt brake, whi h limits spend-

ing to average revenue growth over several years.                If spending diers from this limit, the

dieren e is debited or     redited to an adjustment a           ount that has to be            orre ted in    oming

years. Debt brakes have a built-in error- orre tion me hanism intended to restri t the size

   The top panel of gure 3 suggests that Swiss s al targets have worked to limit debt

growth.   Government debt has steadily fallen over the past 15 years and now is about

35 per ent of GDP. Remarkablyand Switzerland, along with Sweden, may be the sole

ex eptionsdebt either        ontinued to fall or was at during the nan ial                                              risis. This stunning

out ome is a testament to the ee tiveness of s al targets that are rea hed.

       But this prudent s al poli y may have       ome at a   ost in terms of ination targeting.

Switzerland has a 2 per ent ination target that has been missed hroni ally. In Switzerland,

ination has been persistently below target sin e the beginning of 2009. Low ination rates

do not seem to be the result of inadequate eorts by monetary poli y: poli y interest rates

have been negative sin e the beginning of 2015.

       The Swiss   ase illustrates that s al ba king for monetary poli y must be symmetri .

When monetary poli y redu es (raises) interest rates and interest payments on government

debt, s al poli y needs to redu e (raise) taxes. Fis al rules designed primarily to redu e

government debt may interfere with the symmetry of s al ba king.

4    Negative Nominal Bond Yields


Like several other European       ountries, Sweden has been going through the unusual situation

in whi h nominal government bond yields have been negative, even at horizons as long as ve

years. While there are many reasons that nominal yields have turned negativee onomi

weakness in the wake of the global nan ial risis, aging populations, and so forthmonetary

poli y behavior is     ertainly a major fa tor.    Lower monetary poli y interest rates tend to

redu e interest rates a ross the maturity spe trum.

       Persistently negative government bond yields may be       prima fa ie    eviden e that s al

poli y     ould be improved. Essentially, the private se tor is telling the government that it is

willing to   pay for the   right to lend to the government. When yields remain negative, it must

mean that the government is not taking the private se tor up on its generous oer.

       Medium-term government bond yields are negative be ause demand for those safe assets

is very strong. Strong demand bids up bond pri es at the relevant maturities, driving down

yields.    If the government were to respond to the strong demand by in reasing supply of

the desirable assets, yields would rise. Negative yields, therefore, may ree t a shortage of

high-demand assets.

       Although the logi    of why negative bond yields suggest suboptimal s al behavior may
                                                                     14
be obvious, a simple numeri al example may          larify the issues.    Suppose that in 2017, the

market pri e of a government bond that pays SEK 100 in 2018 is SEK 105, implying a                 −5
per ent annual yield. For the sake of this example, imagine that the bond is bought by the

Riksbank by      rediting the government's a     ount at the Riksbank by SEK 105, the amount

by whi h assets and liabilities of both the government and the Riksbank in rease. When the

bond     omes due in 2018, the government pays the Riksbank SEK 100, so its assets with the

 entral bank de line by SEK 100, while its liabilities de line by SEK 105. The mirror of this

transa tion has the Riksbank's assets de line by SEK 105 and its liabilities by SEK 100.

      The following year, the government transfers SEK 5 to the private se tor, paid for by

 rediting banks' deposits at the Riksbank by SEK 5. Government balan es with the Riksbank

fall by SEK 5; liabilities of the Riksbank de line by those 5 krona and rise by the equivalent

amount from the in rease in bank reserves. Banks' deposits with the Riksbank earn the repo

rate, whi h in fall of 2017 was   −0.5 per ent. If we denote the repo rate by r D , then ea h
year the Riksbank's liabilities de line by 1 + r

                                                    < 1 be ause r D < 0. After K years, the
                                                                             D K
Riksbank's liabilities in the form of bank reserves have de lined by −5(1 + r ) . Over time,

this number gets smaller, so that the initial expansion in reserves is self-extinguishing and

the total expansion in bank reserves is     5/(1 + r D ) = 5.025   krona.

      This example illustrates one    hannel by whi h the private se tor    an be made better o

when government bond yields are negative and the government issues additional government

bonds to take advantage of those negative rates. More generally, the government               ould do

pra ti ally   anything    produ tive with the pro eeds from negative bond yieldsinvest in a

sovereign wealth fund, nan e infrastru ture proje ts with positive returns, or drop newly

printed    ash onto Gamla Stan. A government that does not pursue these poli ies is redu ing

its   itizens' welfare.

      Figure 4 plots estimated government bond yields at maturities of one, three, ve, and

10 years, along with the path of the repo rate set by the Riksbank.             Immediately before

and fairly    ontinuously sin e the Riksbank adopted a negative repo rate in February 2015,

bond yields out to ve years also turned negative. In August 2016, even the 10-year yield

briey irted with zero.      Table 2 reports the average yields over the 33 months sin e the

negative interest rate poli y was adopted.       All maturities out to ve years have averaged

negative yields for over two and a half years, plenty of time for the government to adopt

welfare-improving poli ies that      apitalize on bondholders' willingness to   pay   for the privilege

of lending to the government.

      I do not know why governments refuse to issue more bonds when their nominal yields

are negative. But the       urrent s al   limate in many   ountries seems to maintain that any

expansion in government debt is bad, while any         ontra tion in debt is good. This is a

 limate that lo ks up s al poli y and throws away the key.

5   How a Net-Lending Target Works and Why It's Fragile


Swedish s al poli y pursues a net-lending target that is                     urrently one per ent of GDP

over the medium term. To understand that poli y's impli ations for government debt de-

velopments, we need to study how government debt evolves over time. Government debt's

evolution is governed by the government's budget identity, whi h may be written as



                                    Qt Bt = (1 + ρQt )Bt−1 − St




                                                       15
                                Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework




where   Bt    is the nominal value of the government's bond portfolio,          Qt   is the nominal pri e

of the portfolio, and     St    is the nominal primary budget surplus. The primary surplus is the

dieren e between total tax revenues and total government expenditures, ex luding interest

payments on outstanding debt. As written, the budget identity assumes that all government

bonds are in nominal krona. In fa t, Sweden also issues ination-linked bonds and foreign

 urren y bonds, but in 2017 over half of Swedish government debt was krona denominated.

   We spe ialize the spe i ation of government debt by assuming that all debt pays zero

 oupons and that the maturity stru ture de ays at the                 onstant rate    ρ   ea h period.    If

Bt−1 (t + j)    is the quantity of zero- oupon bonds outstanding in period            t − 1,   whi h   ome
                                               j
due in period     t + j , then Bt−1 (t + j) = ρ Bt−1 , where Bt−1 is the portfolio of su h     spe ialized
                            15
bonds in     period t − 1.     Re ent Swedish National Debt O e guidelines aim for            an average

maturity of nominal krona debt of between 4.3 and 5.5 years [Riksgälden Swedish National

Debt O e (2017)℄.

   Dene the gross nominal rate of return on the bond portfolio as


                                                       1 + ρQt
                                            1 + Rt =
                                                         Qt−1

This permits expressing the budget identity in terms of the evolution of the market value of

debt, denoted by      Qt Bt ,   as



                                      Qt Bt = (1 + Rt )Qt−1 Bt−1 − St

   Let   Nt   denote net lending by the government, dened as



                                        Nt ≡ − (Qt Bt − Qt−1 Bt−1 )

Net borrowing is the           hange in the market value of outstanding government debt, so net

lending is the negative of this       hange.

   Then we       an write the budget identity as



                            Nt = − (Qt Bt − Qt−1 Bt−1 ) = St − Rt Qt−1 Bt−1                              (1)



where the term      Rt Qt−1 Bt−1     ree ts interest payments on outstanding debt, whi h is also

 alled debt servi e      osts.

   To relate the budget identity to the government's net-lending rule, we s ale all variables

  15 This spe ialization permits us to extra t the impli ations of the existen e of a maturity stru ture for
government debt in a straightforward and intuitive manner.

      Denote the net-lending target by               n∗ .   When Sweden sets this target at 1 per ent of GDP,

n∗ = .01.      Government poli y aims to a hieve this target by adjusting its s al instruments

taxes, government          onsumption and investment, and transfer paymentswhi h are summa-

rized by the primary surplus,            st .    We shall treat the primary surplus as the government's

s al instrument.


5.1     Always on Target



Initially, let's make the simplifying and extreme assumption that the government hits this

target every period, so that          nt = n∗     all the time. Imposing this on the government's budget

identity in expression (2) implies that


                                                                   Rt
                                                 st = n∗ +              bt−1                                                          (3)
                                                                 1 + Gt

This expression is a rule for setting the surplus that makes net lending always equal to its

target.      To hit the net-lending target every period, the primary surplus must equal that

target value plus the real interest payments on debt                                 arried over from the past.                 In this

expression,      Rt /(1 + Gt )    is the realination-adjustedrate of return on the government's

bond portfolio.

      The extreme assumption produ es extreme poli y behavior: the government must adjust

the real primary surplus one-for-one with real debt servi e. This has two                                      onsequen es. First,

to a hieve the net-lending target every period, the government loses the exibility to pursue

other s al goalsma roe onomi                   stabilization, in ome distribution, and so fortheven in

the short run. For ing net lending to be always on target makes primary surpluses the exa t

fun tion of sele t e onomi            onditions that expression (3) des ribes.

      Se ond, the government must rea t to any e onomi                               disturban e that raises debt servi e

by raising the primary surplus. If the Riksbank redu es the repo rate in order to stimulate

ination, for example, then at least initially real interest rates are likely to fall at all ma-

turities. This redu es the real return on outstanding debt and, hen e, debt servi e                                                 osts.

                                                                                                                                          =
                                             t         Yt ,          Yt ,          (1+gt )(1+πt ) ,          Yt , and              Yt−1

Pt−1 yt−1 = (1 + πt )(1 + gt ), where Gt is the net growth rate of nominal GDP, Yt , and                        Pt   is the general pri e
level, so πt is the net ination rate, and gt is the net growth rate of real GDP.




                                                                17
                                Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework




The government then must redu e primary surplusesthat is, engage in expansionary s al

poli yto maintain the net-lending target.

      Many other e onomi         sho ks will also ae t debt servi e be ause interest rates on govern-

ment debt are highly sensitive to both domesti               and foreign disturban es. Any sho k that

redu es debt servi e, must be met with lower primary surpluses if net lending is to stay on

target.

      Noti e that debt servi e in (3)      an be rewritten as


                                                      Rt Bt−1
                                                    1 + g t Pt

where    1 + gt   is real e onomi    growth. Now passive s al behavior is apparent: a higher pri e

level    alls for a lower surplus. In prin iple, there is no        oni t between a net-lending target

and passive s al ba king for monetary poli y. The s al behavior that (3) des ribes delivers

both the lending target and the s al ba king.


5.2     Gradually on Target



Neither the Swedish government, nor any government, aims to keep net lending on target

all the time. Instead, the target is intended to be hit on average over the             ourse of e onomi

 y les. We        an generalize this analysis by allowing the adjustment to the net-lending target

to be gradual. One s al rule that gradually a hieves the net-lending target is



                                     st − s̄ = −γ(nt − n∗ ),         γ>0                               (4)



where     s̄   is the long-run primary surplus-GDP level. By this rule, whenever net lending is

above target,       nt > n∗ ,   the government makes the primary surplus lower than its long-run

value. A lower surplus redu es net lending (or in reases government borrowing) to redu e net

lending ba k to target over time. The rule in (4) is a stylized des ription of s al behavior.

E onomi         theory often posits stylized behavior in order to fo us attention on a single aspe t

of what poli y doesin this           ase, how surpluses rea t to net lending. A rule like (4)        ould

be far more         ompli ated to try to    apture a tual poli y behavior, but that would merely

make the analysis more           omplex and less transparent.

      For this net-lending rule to stabilize government debt and rea h the net-lending target in

the long run, primary surpluses must respond to net lending with su ient strength. This

implies a restri tion on the        oe ient   γ   in (4). To derive that restri tion, substitute the s al

rule, (4), into the government's budget identity, (2), to obtain an equation that des ribes

     Be ause debt stabilization is by nature about the long run, we                      an   onsider this   ondition

when ination, e onomi               growth, and interest rates are at their             onstant long-run values.

This allows us to link the nominal return on bonds,                    R,   to three things: the rate at whi h

bondholders dis ount the future,            β , the growth rate of the e       onomy,    g , and the    entral bank's

ination target,   π . We obtain the relationships 1 + R = β (1 + G) = β (1 + g)(1 + π ∗ )
                          ∗                                                    −1                 −1

and 1 + r = β     (1 + g), were 1 + g is the gross growth rate of real GDP and 1 + r is the gross
               −1

real interest rate. Substituting these long-run relations in for R/G yields the restri tion that

government must make primary surpluses rea t to net lending with a                            oe ient that satises


                                        (1 + π ∗ ) (r − g)    (1 + π ∗ ) (r − g)
                                   γ>                       =                                                       (6)
                                      (1 + π ∗ )(1 + g) − 1           G

This expression has a straightforward interpretation.                 π ∗ is the    entral bank's ination target,

so in the    ase of Sweden,        1+π ∗ = 1.02, given the Riksbank's 2 per           ent ination target.     r−g is
the dieren e between the real interest rate on government bonds and the growth rate of real

GDP in the long run. E onomies that permanently grow faster than the                               ost of borrowing

have no need for s al rules be ause tax revenues are assured to grow more rapidly than real

debt servi e; those fortunate e onomies                 an simply grow out of de its.

     It is reasonable to assume that over the broad span of time in Sweden, the real interest

rate ex eeds the real growth rate. The denominator in (6) may be rewritten in terms of the

growth rate of nominal GDP as             (1 + π ∗ )(1 + g) − 1 = G, where G is the net growth rate of
nominal GDP, so it is a            number like 0.04 when the pri e level and real output both grow at

2 per ent annually. Higher nominal growth requires a smaller rea tion of surpluses to net

lending for two reasons. First, higher real growth automati ally redu es the debt-GDP ratio.

Se ond, higher ination redu es bond pri es and, therefore, the market value of debt.

   Table 3 reports threshold values for the responsiveness of surpluses to net lending in

order to stabilize debt-GDP when long-run real interest and growth rates take on dierent

 ombinations. Be ause the rule in (4) is written with a                −γ ,   values in the table should be

understood as making surplus deviations move in the opposite dire tion from net-lending

deviations. These      al ulations impose that the Riksbank hits its 2% ination target in the

long run. When   γ   ex eeds these thresholds, in the long run the debt-GDP ratio is                   onstant

and equal to the dis ounted present value of the long-run primary surplus-GDP ratio.

higher ination target redu es the threshold, permitting the debt-GDP ratio to be stabilized

with a weaker response of surpluses to net lending.             It might seem odd that the ination

target would have an impa t on long-run stabilization of the government debt. The reason

                               Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework




for this is that a higher ination target produ es lower bond pri es, whi h redu e the market

value of debt as a share of GDP. A lower market value of debt, on average, makes it easier

to stabilize the ratio.

      The message is that    even in the long run, monetary and s al poli ies must be onsistent
with ea h other.

5.3    Alternative Representation of Fis al Rule



We     an derive an alternative representation of the s al behavior that underlies the net-

lending target. This representation ties more               losely to theoreti al work on how monetary

and s al poli ies intera t. Combine (2) with the net-lending rule (4) to arrive at a rule that

sets the primary surplus in response to net interest payments


                                         γ     Rt           1
                                st =                bt−1 +     (s̄ + γn∗ )                                   (7)
                                       1 + γ 1 + Gt        1+γ

This expression generalizes the extreme poli y behavior that appears in (3) when we assumed

the government exa tly hit the net-lending target,               n∗ ,   every period.     Whereas in (3) the

government in reased the primary surplus one-for-one with interest payments, expression

(7) instru ts the government to gradually raise surpluses by the fra tion                   γ/(1 + γ)   of debt
                                                  18

      Se tion 6 reports some estimates of the surplus rules in equations (4) and (7).


5.4    Net Lending vs. Change in Debt



Given the denition of net lending, a poli y that targets net lending is a very                     lose   ousin
                                                                                                   
to a poli y that targets the         hange   in debt. Net lending is      nt = − bt −        1
                                                                                               b
                                                                                           1+Gt t−1
                                                                                                    , so when

nominal GDP growth,         Gt ,   is zero, this is simply the   hange in the market value of the debt-

GDP ratio. For this reason, it is useful to study the properties of a poli y that targets the

 hange in debt. Let      ∆bt   denote the      hange in debt and        ∆b∗   its target value.

      Now the government sets poli y to raise the primary surplus whenever the                    hange in debt

ex eeds target

                                            st − s̄ = δ (∆bt − ∆b∗ )

so we restri t   δ   to be positive. Combining this rule with the government's budget identity

  18 The oe ient in (7),   γ/(1 + γ),   is less than one to make the adjustment gradual.

happen be ause it requires that real interest rates are negative in the long run.

      The reason targeting the hange in debt                an never stabilize the debt-GDP ratio is obvious.

If the     hange in debt target is positive and it is su               essfully a hieved, then debt is growing

at a     onstant rate as a share of the e onomy; if the target is negative and a hieved, then

debt is de lining as a share of the e onomy. In either                      ase, debt is not a stable fra tion of

GDP.

      The only dieren e between a negative                 hange in debt target and a net-lending target is

that net lending s ales past debt by the growth rate of nominal GDP. Of                                 ourse, in periods

when nominal GDP growth is small, positive net lending is essentially equivalent to a negative

 hange in debt.


5.5     What These Fis al Rules Aim to A                            omplish



Countries adopt s al rules, not be ause the rules                     per se    are virtuous, but be ause the

rules help to a hieve some broader obje tives. Those broader obje tives, a                                 ording to the

Swedish s al poli y framework, are to use s al poli y to raise the welfare of Swedish

 itizens through e onomi          growth, redistribution of in ome, and stabilization of the ma ro

e onomy. As the framework words it, A fundamental pre ondition for being able to attain

the overall obje tive of s al poli y is the long-term sustainability of the publi                               nan es

[Swedish Government (2011, p. 5)℄. One way to operationalize long-term sustainability is

the a hievement of a stable debt-GDP ratio over the long run.

      Many years ago Phillips (1954) applied the theory of                   ontrol to      ategorize three types of

poli y rules: proportional, integral, and derivative. He argued that the main driver of poli y

needs to be a proportional rule. The behavior that equation (4) des ribes makes deviations

debt from targetthe integral               omponentif it is desirable to redu e how long it takes

to return to target. Phillips points out that                 hanges in the deviation of debt from target

are    onstant.
     20 That is, making the oe ient on b                                     1/β < 1.           β,

derivative partshould be used only to dampen any os illations that might otherwise be

present.

     Phillips' point is that a s al response to             hanges   in debtderivativesmay serve as

a supplement to, but not a           entral    omponent of, poli y rules that deliver good e onomi

performan e.        Be ause a net-lending target is very              lose to a    hange-in-debt target, as I

argued in se tion 5.4, Phillips' argument is that su h a target is likely to deliver unstable
                                       21
out omes for government debt.

     Like Switzerland, Sweden stands out among advan ed e onomies by experien ing de lin-

ing or at government debt-GDP ratios in the wake of the global nan ial                             risis.   After

peaking at        lose to 75 per ent during Sweden's banking and debt                  risis in the early 1990s,

 entral government debt has fallen steadily [gure 5℄.                  It was about 35 per ent when the

global nan ial        risis hit in 2008 and is now around 30 per ent. This has o                   urred during

a period in whi h government debt in nearly every other                   ountry expanded rapidly and, in

most       ases, has remained elevated almost a de ade after the             risis began.

     At one level, this remarkable stability in government debt unders ores the su                            ess of

the Swedish s al poli y framework.              At the same time that debt has de lined in re ent

years, many nominal bond yields have been negative, as se tion 4 do uments. As I argued

in that se tion, Swedish governments have de lined the bond market's oer of a free lun h,

whi h presents an opportunity to raise welfare among Swedes. Perhaps this is a sign of an

overly-rigid desire to redu e government debt, regardless of prevailing e onomi                        onditions.

     Government bond developments in gure 5 are ree ted in net-lending data. Figure 6

plots net lending as a per entage of GDP, along with the net-lending target, whi h was 2

per ent of GDP until it was redu ed to 1 per ent in 2007.                    Most notable in this gure is

the sharp in rease in net lending over the past few years. In the pro ess of refusing the free

lun h, the government a tually              hose to   redu e   its borrowing when the bond market was

willing to pay for the privilege to lend.



6    Some Estimates from Swedish Data


Can we nd support in Swedish data for the s al poli y a tions that underlie the net-lending

target? This se tion turns to some estimates of Swedish s al poli y behavior to address

that question.

    21 By Phillips's reasoning, a proportional rule that is more stable than those underlying either the net-
lending or     hange-in-debt targets would simply make surpluses depend on deviations of debt from some
target debt-GDP ratio,    b∗ . Su h a rule would be st − s̄ = γ(bt−1 − b∗ ) with γ > β −1 − 1. This restri tion
on   γ   instru ts the government to raise surpluses with debt by enough to       over the in rease in real interest
payments plus some amount to return debt to target.

6.1    Estimates of Net-Lending Rule



As a rst pass at applying this theoreti al reasoning to Swedish data, I estimate versions

of the s al rule in expression (4), whi h adjusts the primary surplus to target net lending.

Table 5 reports estimates of s al behavior using quarterly data from 1993 through the rst

half of 2017.

      These estimates do not lend support to the hypothesis that Swedish s al poli y adjusts

primary surpluses to target net lending, as s al rule (4) posits.                                                            Negative values of the




                                                                           24
                                   Leeper: Swedish Fis al Framework




thresholds in table 3 give the minimum response of surpluses to net lendingthe                        γ   oe ient

in the rulethat stabilizes government debt.                      To return net lending to target, surpluses

must move in the opposite dire tion of net lending's deviation from target: if net lending is

too high, surpluses must be redu ed. Taken at fa e value, the estimates in the rst three

 olumns of table 5 report that when net lending is high, the government raises surpluses.

This rea tion does not appear to be              onsistent with a net-lending target be ause it makes net

lending in rease to deviate farther from target. This pattern holds in both the ordinary least

squares and the instrumental variables panels. The instrumental variables estimates aim to

address the fa t that the ordinary least squares estimates are                    ontaminated by the naturally

positive relationship between net lending and the primary surplus that the government's

budget identity delivers.

      The fourth       olumns in the two panels seem more promising. That spe i ation alters

s al rule (4) by making surpluses rea t to lags in both net lending and in surpluses, a

spe i ation that smooths the s al response over time. Although the                          oe ient on lagged

net lending is negative, as stabilizing behavior requires, it is not statisti ally dierent from

0. The long-run response of surpluses to net lending takes a                      ount of how     urrent surpluses

depend on past surpluses, a dependen e that raises the response well above the estimate of

0.107 reported as the            oe ient on lagged net lending. But be ause that                 oe ient is not

statisti ally signi ant, it is di ult to             on lude there is strong eviden e that s al poli y
                                                          22
follows the net-lending rule in equation (4).

      The fourth       olumn of the instrumental variables panel reports a somewhat more sig-

ni ant       oe ient on lagged net lending. Unfortunately, the estimate on lagged surpluses

implies that the equation is not stable, with surpluses exploding over time. This e onomi-

 ally nonsensi al estimate makes it hard to take the equation seriously as a des ription of

s al poli y behavior.

      An important short oming of the regressions that table 5 reports is that they do not

indi ate how primary surpluses and net lending intera t dynami ally. Although the simple

theory above makes surpluses respond immediately to higher net lending, in pra ti e there

is no reason to expe t su h instantaneous rea tion.                    To explore the dynami          intera tions,

we estimate a two-variable ve tor autoregression (VAR) with the primary surplus and net
                                                        23
lending, both measured as shares of GDP.                     VAR estimates generalize the regression in the

fourth      olumn of table 5 in two ways.              First, it permits surpluses to respond to             urrent

     22 In the regression   st = ρst−1 + γ(nt−1 − n∗ ) + s̄, the long-run   response of surpluses to past net lending
is   +γ/(1 − ρ),   where in table 5,  ρ is estimated to be 0.979.
     23 The VAR employs the Bayesian methods in Sims and Zha (1998). In their notation, the prior sets
λ1 = 1.0, λ2 = 0.5, λ3 = 1.0, λ4 = 0.1, µ5 = 1.0, µ6 = 1.0.        The VAR in ludes four lags and a     onstant term
in ea h equation and was estimated over the period 1993Q1 to 2017Q2.

over time.

over time. Solid lines are point estimates and dashed lines are 90 per ent probability bands.

The left panel of the gure shows that when net lending rises, primary surpluses also rise,

remaining high for about three years.              There is some eviden e that eventually surpluses

begin to fall, as s al rule (4)       alls for, but even after 10 years the de line in surpluses is not

likely to be dierent from zero. The right panel looks very mu h like the dynami s that the

government budget identity triggers: higher surpluses raise net lending for some period.

   As with the stati      regressions in table 5, the dynami                patterns in gure 7 do not support

the notion that the Swedish government has systemati ally followed a rule that redu es

primary surpluses whenever net lending is above target.

6.2     Response of Surpluses to Debt Servi e

Whenever monetary poli y a tions raise (lower) debt servi e, s al poli y must eventually

respond by raising (lowering) primary surpluses.                          This is the pattern of response that the

alternative representation of s al behavior in equation (7) ree ts. We now turn to Swedish

data to seek eviden e of this behavior.

       Table 6 reports estimates of variants on equation (7), whi h depi ts how surpluses rea t

to debt servi e. As with the estimates in table 5, these results must be interpreted                                     autiously.

The government's budget identity indu es a positive relationship between the primary surplus

and interest payments on the debt. To see this, write the identity in (2) as

                                                                             
                                                                     1 + Rt

                                                                     1 + Gt

                                                                                                                           1
On the right side of this identity are the real prin ipal on the debt-GDP ratio,                                             b ,

                                                                      Rt
and the real interest payments on that ratio,                            b . The identity says that when interest

bt .   But this relationship stems from an a                 ounting fa t, not from any expli it                   poli y behavior,
whi h is the obje t of our interest.

   With this         autionary note in mind, we turn to table 6. Although all the estimated                  oef-

 ients on debt servi e, either        rt bt−1   or   rt−1 bt−2 ,   are positive, none are statisti ally dierent

from zero. This in ludes both the least squares and the instrumental variables estimates and

spe i ations with and without lagged surpluses. Despite the positive                        orrelation that the

budget identity imposes, these regressions do not provide strong eviden e that higher debt

servi e leads to higher surpluses, as passive s al behavior in the                   onventional poli y regime

requires.

   Figure 8 reports dynami             orrelations between primary surpluses and debt servi e from

a VAR that in ludes those variables. With a two-year lag, higher debt servi e is followed by

higher surpluses (rst       olumn of gure). The se ond                 olumn shows that higher surpluses are

followed by lower interest payments, as expe ted if surpluses are used to retire outstanding

debt.

   Whether these estimates re over s al behavior or merely ree t s al dynami s                         reated

by the government's budget identity is an open question. The eviden e is, at best, merely

not a   ount for the fa t that variables in the regressions may be determined simultaneously.

Leeper and Li (2016) point out, for example, that regressions of surpluses on past debt

or, as in table 6, interest payments on debt an be seriously biased, depending on whi h

monetary-s al regime prevailed over the sample. Less                        rude estimates would entail jointly

estimating poli y behavior and private se tor behavior as a means of identifying the s al

Using this expression in the budget identity in (8) yields

      This expression says that the value of debt sold in period                   t equals     the expe ted (Et ) sum

of future dis ounted real primary surpluses beginning in period                        t + 1.    The variables        qt,T   are

real dis ount fa tors, whi h are produ ts of all future one-period real interest rates between

periods      t and T ,    inverted. Suppose the one-period real interest rate between periods                       t and
t+1     is   1 + rt+1 ,   then the one-period dis ount fa tor between those periods is                       1/(1 + rt+1 ).
                                                                                                        1      1
The two-period dis ount fa tor between periods                      t and t + 2, qt,t+2 , is simply   1+rt+1 1+rt+2

so on.

      The real interest rate is an intertemporal pri e. Today's real rate,                        1 + rt+1 ,   is the pri e

of goods today expressed in terms of future goods, so a lower real rate                           orresponds to goods

today being relatively           heap.        In e onomi        models of the sort that many                 entral banks

employ, the real interest rate is the lin hpin for the transmission of monetary poli y: when

the    entral bank redu es nominal interest rates, real rates also tend to fall, indu ing people

to substitute away from demanding goods in the future toward demanding goods today. But

expression (9) reveals another               hannel through whi h real interest rates ae t the e onomy.

The real dis ount fa tors in this debt-valuation equation express goods in the future (primary

surpluses) in terms of goods today to deliver the value of                        urrent debt in units of              urrent

goods (Qt Bt /Pt ). A lower path for real interest rates raises the value of future goods relative

to     urrent goods, whi h in reases the real ba kingthe present value of surplusesand,

  24 Dependen e on the entire future arises be ause the budget identity holds for all dates             t   in the future, so
the value of debt issued at    t, B t ,   rises with surpluses the next period,   st+1 ,   and so on through time.

   The important point is that dis ount fa tors multiplyand therefore                    ompoundinterest

larger      hanges in the monetary poli y interest rate will translate into bigger s al impa ts.

   Valuation equation (9) emerges from intera tions between supply and demand for govern-

ment bonds and, as su h, it is a          ondition that holds in equilibrium. Demand for government

bonds, like demand for other saving devi es, is the mirror image of demand for goods and

servi es: the stronger is the desire to save by a            umulating assets, the weaker is the desire to

 onsume by buying goods and servi es. When the present value of debt's                     ash owsprimary

surplusesis high, debt be omes more attra tive and people substitute out of buying goods

into buying bonds. This redu es aggregate demand. Bond pri es may rise and/or the overall

level of pri es in the e onomy may fall. As the valuation equation makes                     lear, the present

value of debt's     ash ows        an rise be ause people expe t higher primary surplusesthrough

higher taxes or lower expendituresor be ause people expe t higher dis ount fa tors (that

is, lower real interest rates).

   When bond supply is inelasti , expression (9) delivers the demand for nominal bonds in

date   t,   whi h may be written as


                                                   1
                                           Btd =      Pt Et P V (St+1 )                                     (10)
                                                   Qt

This demand is readily understood.              Demand de lines with the pri e,           Qt ,   of bonds, so in

a graph with the pri e of bonds on the verti al axis, the demand for bonds is downward

sloping, like most demand             urves.   Be ause bondholders        are about the      real   value of the

bonds they hold,       Btd /Pt ,   demand for    nominal     bonds is homogeneous of degree one in the

pri e level, just as it is for any nominal asset, su h as money.                  Bond demand also rises

with the real ba king for government debt, the expe ted present value of primary surpluses,

denoted by      Et P V (St+1 ),    be ause higher real ba king raises the expe ted stream of payouts

to bond holders.

   Figure 9 plots supply and demand for government bonds when the aggregate pri e level

is on the verti al axis. Verti al supply means bonds are supplied perfe tly inelasti ally. The

initial equilibrium pri e level is        P1   when the demand s hedule is        B1d .   A lower bond pri e,

lower expe ted path of real interest rates (or higher expe ted path of dis ount fa tors), or

a higher expe ted path of primary surpluses pivots demand to the dashed s hedule                        B2d .   At

this new demand        urve, bondholders wish to hold more bonds at any given aggregate pri e

level, so at pri e level     P1   there is an ex ess demand for bonds. With an inelasti          supply of

bonds, the pri e level must fall to eliminate the ex ess demand for nominal bonds. A lower

pri e level in reases the real market value of debt.

      This reasoning       an be understood in terms of the impa ts on aggregate demand.               An

in rease in demand for bonds is the mirror image of a de rease in demand for goods and

servi es. When government bonds be ome more desirable, people redu e their pur hases of

goods and servi es in order to in rease their bond holdings. That de rease in goods demand

is a de line in aggregate demand, whi h drives down the pri e level, as gure 9 depi ts.


7.2    Applying This Reasoning to Sweden



How is any of this relevant for Sweden? Se tion 4 reviewed that Swedish government bond

yields have now been negative for more than two years. At times, those negative yields have

applied to bonds that do not          ome due for ve years. Table 7 reports a variety of measures

of short-term real interest rates in Sweden over three re ent periods. Sin e January 2008,

nearly all measures have been negative on average. But over the past two and a half years,

the measures have been strongly negative, well over        −1.50 per    ent in some   ases. In    ontrast,

over the seven years before the nan ial         risis, real interest rates were around   positive 1.50
per ent. Evidently, Sweden is entren hed in a low-interest rate environment.

      Low interest rates have been a worldwide phenomenon in re ent years.               But one      lear

reason that Swedish real rates have turned sharply negative is the Riksbank's poli y stan e, a



                                                    32

stan e that in ludes negative poli y interest rates. Be ause negative real interest rates imply

real dis ount fa tors greater than 1, negative rates have important s al           onsequen es. Those

 onsequen es      an be understood through the lens of the debt valuation equation in (9) and

the supply-demand graph in gure 9.

   Monetary poli y a tions are       losely linked to bond pri es: as interest rates de line, bond

pri es and the nominal value of outstanding debt rise. Figure 10 plots the pri e of govern-

ment bonds (left axis) against the repo rate (right axis). The pri e of bonds is                al ulated

as the ratio of the market value of government bonds to the par value and is a measure

of the   Qt   variable that appears in the equations.           There is a   lear negative relationship

between bond pri es and the Riksbank's poli y interest rate, just as theory would predi t.

Fo using on the last few years, bond pri es rose sharply as the repo rate headed toward

negative territory. Sin e the repo rate turned negative, bond pri es have remained elevated.

   Negative real interest rates, as in table 7, beget high real dis ount rates.            Holding the

expe ted path of primary surpluses xed, higher dis ount rates raise the                urrent value of

those surpluses to shift out the demand for government bonds, as gure 9 depi ts. As people

substitute out of buying goods and servi es and into buying bonds, the aggregate pri e level

de lines, either now or in the future.

      Through the debt-valuation relation alone, lower real interest rates exert deationary

pressures on the e onomy. Deationary pressures work                            against          the Riksbank's aim to use

negative poli y interest rates to raise ination. To support the Riksbank's a tions, s al pol-

i y    an eliminate deationary pressures by making government bonds less desirable. Bonds

lose their appeal when their real ba kingfuture primary surplusesde lines. In terms of

gure 9, a lower path for surpluses would oset the ee ts of lower real interest rates to pivot

the   B2d   demand s hedule left toward its initial position,                  B1d .
      Swedish s al poli y during the negative poli y interest rate period has not aimed to

oset the impa ts of low interest rates on the desirability of government debt. Instead, net

lending as a per entage of GDP has moved from                           −1.6   per ent in 2014 to            1.2    per ent over

2016 and the rst two quarters of 2017. To the extent that this shift in net lending raises

the path of surpluses that people expe t, this s al poli y makes government debt still more

attra tive, amplifying the deationary pressures.

      Re ently in Sweden, both monetary and s al poli y have in reased the desirability and

value of government bonds. Poli ies have shifted the demand                                urve down, as in gure 9, to

 reate deationary pressures through the bond market. This may help to explain Sweden's

hroni ally low ination rates.

8    Con   luding Remarks


The paper has pointed to types of analysis that are not            ommonly undertaken by either

monetary or s al authorities, but may shed light on how those poli ies are ae ting the

e onomy. For example, many           entral banks estimate or    alibrate interest-rate rules, whi h

are used in poli y analyses to provide information on how a tual poli y          hoi es    ompare to

some useful ben hmarks. To my knowledge, su h exer ises are not typi ally              ondu ted as an

input to s al de isions. As I argued elsewhere, there is mu h that         an be done to improve

the quality of s al analysis in ministries of nan es [Leeper (2011)℄.

     This paper does   not   deny the value of expli it targets for monetary and s al authorities

to a hieve.   It also does    not   deny the potential value of monetary and s al rules.        The

paper's thesis is that these targets and rules should not be designed in isolation. If monetary

and s al a tions are not mutually       onsistent in ways that this paper has explained, it may

be impossible for the    entral bank and the government to a hieve their obje tives.

     The paper's examination of Swedish ma roe onomi            poli ies raises some   on erns about

whether s al poli y is      ompatible with monetary poli y's pursuit of an ination target. I

am    on erned that in re ent years the desire to hit a 1 per ent net-lending target          oni ts

with the Riksbank's eorts to hit its 2 per ent ination target. Be ause these two targets

and any operational rules for a hieving the targets have been          hosen independently of ea h

other, the potential for     oni t is real.
