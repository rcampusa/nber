Do host counthes aiming to maximize the inflows of technology through
foreign multinationals have any policy alternatives to formal technology
transfer requirements arid performance requirements? To answer this question,
the present paper examines some possible determinants of the technology
imports of U.S. majority-owned foreign affiliates in 33 host countries. The
results show that the affiliates' technology imports increase with the host
countries' domestic investment levels and education levels, but that various
performance requirements are negatively related to technology transfer. This
suggests that policies promoting local investment, competition, and education
may sometimes be alternatives to direct controls and requirements.

Policies to Encourage Inflows of Technology through Foreign Multinationals1

                     Magnus Blomström and Art Kokko



1.    Introduction

The debate on the role of government policies for economic perfonnance has,

in recent years, turned from discussing the choice between free markets and

government intervention to asking what types of intervention are good and bad.

One reason is that almost all governments, irrespective of their political

orientation, have chosen to play an active role in their economy (see e.g.

Bardhan, 1990). However, the definition of successful intervention is still

disputed, although an important lesson from the recent experience of several

Asian economies seems to be that governments should make use of market

forces in their efforts to influence the direction and character of economic

growth: markets and competition need to be retained to discourage wasteful

use of resources and to encourage learning and technical advances.

      The distinction between good and bad intervention has been noted also

in the trade policy debate. For instance, Bhagwati (1988) argues that policies

based on prescriptions rather than proscriptions generally produce better

economic performance. One reason is that the latter types of intervention tend

to stifle initiative and hurt entrepreneurship and growth, whereas the former

leave large areas untouched and also allow people to do what is not formally

prescribed. Another reason is that proscriptions tend to divert resources into

unproductive efforts to evade the rules.

      A similar discussion is now emerging in the literature on foreign direct

investment (FDI) and technology transfer. Some of the main host country

benefits of FDI are considered to stem from the inflows of new technology to

affiliates of multinational firms (MNCs), since these flows create a potential

for technology spillovers to the host country's local firms (Blomström, 1989;

Kokko, forthcoming). What policy measures should host countries adopt to get

the MNCs to transfer more technology, and to increase the potential for

spillovers? The traditional view has been that different types of regulations are

necessary. Many governments have therefore started to frame the environment

within which multinationals operate by introducing various performance

requirements for their behavior. Special attention has been given to policies

regarding technology transfer, and a number of measures intended to

encourage or force multinational firms to increase their technology transfer

have been introduced over the years, including requirements for local content

and local R&D.
                                       3

       A different view on how to influence the multinationals' technology

transfer has recently been suggested by Wang and Blomström (1992). They

develop a model where the MNC affiliate's decision to import technology is

explicitly related to profit maximization, i.e. the affiliate imports technology

until the marginal revenue of further import is equal to the marginal cost.

Technology imports raise revenue (although at a diminishing rate) because the

demand for MNC products is positively related to the technological gap

between the affiliate and competing host country firms. However, there are

also costs involved in each transfer operation (e.g. for training of local

workers), and more modern technologies are increasingly more expensive to

transfer.

       The model's implications for host country policies match those from the

recent debate on government intervention in the trade literature. One result is

that requirements which increase the affiliates' technology transfer costs may

have perverse effects, i.e. reduce technology imports, unless there are strong

sanctions for those who do not abide by the rules. Another conclusion, pointed

out by Wang and Blomström (1992), is that host country governments might

increase the transfer of technology through foreign affiliates by making sure

that they are exposed to local competition and by supporting domestic firms

in their efforts to learn from the foreigners. Increased competitiveness in local

firms means that the technology gap becomes narrower, which reduces the

demand for the affiliates' products and gives them a reason to bring in new
                                       4
technology in order to restore their advantages. Analogously, government

intervention that reduces the affiliates' transfer costs, e.g. education policies

that raise the host countries' learning capabilities and improve local labor

skills, may encourage higher technology imports. In other words, policies

making use of market forces may be preferable to intervention in the form of

conventional technology transfer and perfonnance requirements.

       To the best of our knowledge, there is no host government that has

methodically tried to encourage foreign affiliates to import technology by using

competition and education policies instead of formal requirements, so it is not

possible to compare the effects of the various types of policy intervention.

However, there is a large variation in requirements, competition, education,

and other characteristics across host countries, and it should be possible to

observe systematic cross-country differences in the affiliates' technology

imports if these characteristics influence the marginal costs and benefits of

technology transfer, as hypothesized in the Wang-Blomström model. In this

paper, we will therefore examine how the technology imports of U.S.

majority-owned foreign affiliates in 33 host countries are related to proxies for

the host countries' requirements, levels of local competition, and learning

capabilities. The results are intended to provide some insights about how host

countries can persuade foreign-owned multinationals to bring more technology

to their affiliates.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents data, variables,
                                       5

and statistical hypotheses. Section 3 reports the statistical results and Section

4 summarizes and concludes the paper.



2.    Data, Variables, and Statistical Hypotheses

A. Dependent Variables: Measures of Parent-Affiliate Technology Transfers

The transfer of the parent MNC's proprietary technology can take different

forms, including technical documentation, education and training of the

affiliate's labor force, exchanges of technical personnel, shipments of

machinery and equipment, and continuing communication to solve whatever

problems occur in the production processes. Each transfer is likely to include

several of these modes; yet, only a few of the transfer forms are usually

recorded. Moreover, there are reasons to be cautious even when data are

available. One problem is that all parent companies have not developed precise

methods for pricing the technology that is supplied to affiliates. Another

complication has to do with transfer pricing: mtra-corporate technology

payments are likely instruments for concealing repatriated profits and evading

host country taxes, because market prices for the technologies are usually

lacking (see e.g. Caves, 1982).

      The data on technology transfers used in this study are from the U.S.

Department of Commerce surveys of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, and refer

to the manufacturing operations of majority-owned foreign affiliates (MOFAs)

of U.S. multinationals in 33 host countries in 1982 (U. S. Department of
                                       6

Commerce, 1985).! We will define several alternative proxies for the

affiliates technology imports, based on data for the U.S. MOFAs total

payments for royalties and license fees, and their imports of capital equipment

from the United States. In addition to the possible data problems mentioned

above, two additional sources of errors should be noted. The data on the

affiliates' royalties and license payments include payments to non-affiliated

persons (although intra-MNCs transactions make up 93 per cent of the total

payments), and imports from all U.S. sources are included in the data on

capital equipment. The proxies therefore refer to the affiliates' technology

imports from all sources rather than to transfers between parents and affiliates.

      The total value of the payments for royalties and licenses in 1982 by

U.S. MOFAs in the manufacturing sector amounted to 3,051 million U.S.

dollars. Out of this, 2,856 million dollars were accounted for by affiliates in

developed countries, and only 195 million by affiliates in developing countries.

In the same year, 1,358 million dollars worth of capital equipment was

exported from the U.S. to the affiliates, with 874 million going to developed

country affiliates and 484 million to the developing countries. Table I presents

some measures of the royalty and license payments (LICENSE) and imports

of capital equipment (CAPIMP) by U.S. MOFAs operating in different

industry groups in 1982.
                                       7



                                Insert Table 1




      It can be seen that the differences between industries are very large for

the LICENSE variables: the payments range from 90 dollars per employee (or

a tenth of a per cent of the value of sales) in transport equipment to 2,890

dollars per employee (or over three per cent of sales) in machinery. The

variation in equipment imports is smaller, but still notable.

      The cross-country data that we will use for the regression analysis are

only available for total manufacturing, because numerous industry level

observations have been suppressed at the source for reasons of confidentiality.

However, the large inter-industry differences illustrated by Table 1 suggest that

the industry distribution of affiliates may show through in the figures for total

manufacturing. For example, in Sweden, most U.S. investment is in

machinery, which clearly is the most "licensing-intensive" industry group, and

technology payments can be expected to be high for this reason alone. It is

even possible that the industry effects dominate other explanations for

cross-country differences in technology imports. To come around this problem,

we have therefore constructed some alternatives to the simple LICENSE

measure.

      The first of these, termed LICDIF, attempts to measure the difference
                                        8

between actual license payments and what we might "expect" on the basis of

the industry distribution of U.S. MOFAs in each host country. The measure

is constructed using data on average license payments per employee (weighted

by employment shares, from Table 1) and employment data for U.S. affiliates

(from U.S. Department of Commerce, 1985).2 To get a measure of expected

license payments for each country/industry group, we multiplied the affiliates'

employment in each industry in each country by the average license payment

for that industry. An estimate of the total expected license payment for each

host country, taking into account its industry distribution of affiliates, was then

obtained by summing across industries for each country. To get the variable,

LICDIF, fmally, we subtracted these estimates from the actual license

payments of the host country. Contrary to the ratio of actual license payments

to labor, LICDIF is not automatically high if a large share of the country's

affiliates are in "licensing-intensive" industries, since the expected license

payment in that case is also high. Instead, LICDIF is hypothesized to be high

only when the affiliates import more technology than what is "normal".

Measures for CAPDIF, the difference between actual and expected imports of

capital equipment, were calculated analogously.

       The differences between developed and developing countries, in

particular for payments of royalties and license fees, are also strikingly large,

as noted above. Differences in industry distribution explain part of this, but

there may be other factors that depress the technology flows to developing
                                      9

countries. These include the weaker learning capability of developing

countries, weak infrastructure, fragmented markets, political instability, and

a host of other matters that we have no comprehensive data for. For some of

the tests, we have therefore recalculated the dependent variables with separate

expectations for developed and developing countries - in other words, the

measures for expected license payments from developing countries have been

based on average license payments from developing countries only. The

resulting variables, which are corrected both for the industry distribution and

development level, are termed LICDIF* and CAPDIF*, and allow us to

concentrate more directly on the effects of the host country characteristics we

have data for. All of the measures have been scaled in two ways, i.e. divided

by the affiliates' sales and by their employment, to provide several alternative

proxies for technological effort. The six versions of the dependent variable are

summarized in Appendix Table i.3



B. Explanatory Variables: Requirements, Local C'ompetition, and Learning

Capability.

Levels of economic development, political stability, technology transfer

requirements, local competition, learning capability, and a host of other

characteristics are likely to vary across host countries. We hypothesized in the

introduction that it should be possible to observe systematic cross-country

differences in the MNC affiliates' technology imports if these host country
                                       10

characteristics influence the marginal costs and benefits of technology transfer,

as argued by Wang and Blomström (1992). Since most of these features are

difficult to measure empirically, we have restricted our analysis to proxies for

three variables - technology transfer and performance requirements, local

competition, and local learning capability - but even these suffer from some

obvious weaknesses.4

       First, to measure the host countries' technology transfer and
performance requirements, we have calculated two proxies from U.S.

Department of Commerce (1985), Table 11.1.3. The first of these, labelled

TREQS, focuses directly on technology transfer requirements, and measures

the share of U.S. affiliates in each host country in 1982 that were reported to

operate under requirements to use the most advanced technology available,

perform R&D locally, have access to the U.S. parent's patents, or transfer

skills to local personnel. We hypothesize that these requirements increase the

affiliates' technology transfer costs, and we therefore expect TREQS to have

a negative impact on the affiliates' imports of technology. However, the impact

may not be very significant, for two reasons. Although the requirements

captured by TREQS are likely to increase transfer costs, it is possible that

there are some cases where they are backed up by strong sanctions, so that

only the firms that actually transfer much technology are allowed to stay in

operation. Secondly, the effects of the requirements on both transfer costs and

actual transfers may sometimes be insignificant, because many of the rules are
                                      11

ambiguous: the affiliate decides which technologies are viable, there may not

be any direct connection between R&D and imports of new technology, and

access to the parent's patents does not ensure actual transfer of technology.

      The alternative proxy PREQS reflects the share of affiliates that faced

various quantitative performance requirements in 1982 (including import

restrictions, minimum local content, and minimum local employment

requirements). This may be more suitable for present purposes, because

quantitative rules are less ambiguous and easier to uphold, and because the

performance requirements that increase the extent of local participation also

increase the costs of transferring and using advanced technologies. Hence, we

hypothesize that PREQS will have a negative impact on technology transfer.

      Both TREQS and PREQS cover all non-bank affiliates of U.S. parents

with more than 10 per cent U.S. ownership, rather than only the
majority-owned affiliates included in the measures of technology imports. The

general pattern, with OECD countries and some South-East Asian economies

registering the lowest formal requirements and Latin American and South

Asian nations exhibiting the highest ones, is the one we would expect also for

more comprehensive measures of technology transfer requirements.5

      We have proxied local competition with two alternative measures of

investment intensity in the host economy. The assumption is that investment

reflects either new entrants into industry, or an upgrading of the technological

level of existing firms, both of which increase competition and reduce the
                                      12

technology gap between the affiliate and local firms. The variables are

INV/OUTPUT (the gross fixed capital formation/gross output ratio) and

INV/EMPL (gross fixed capital formation per employee) and both cover the

host countries' entire manufacturing sectors, excluding the U.S. affiliates.

They are based on data from various issues of the United Nations' Industrial

Statistics Yearbook, and for the INV/EMPL variable, capital formation figures

have been converted from local currency to U.S. dollars and corrected for

international differences in capital goods prices using data from Summers and

Heston (1988). Investment by multinationals from other countries than the

United States has not been subtracted, which means that "local competitors"

are defined as all non-U.S. actors in the host country market, including MNC

affiliates from other countries.6 INV/OUTPUT and INV/EMPL are used

interchangeably in the estimations: the variables provide alternative, although

related, measures of competition, as seen by the simple correlation of about

0.5 (see Appendix Table 2). The hypothesis from the theoretical model is that

local competition reduces the technology gap and the demand for the affiliates'

products, and increases the marginal revenue of further technology transfer.

Hence, we expect the affiliates' technology imports to be positively related to

our proxies for local competition.

      To account for the cross-country differences in learning capabilities and

labor skills, we use the variables ED2ND and ED3RD. They measure the

share of the appropriate age-group in secondary and third level education in
                                       13

each host country 1980, and are taken from UNESCO's Statistical Yearbook

1990, Table 3.2. We expect both variables to have a positive influence on

the affiliates' technology imports, because the marginal technology transfer

costs are lower when the level of education is higher. However, it should be

noted already here that the small variance in ED2ND is likely to reduce its

observed significance.



3.    Statistical Results

A. Payments for Royalties and License Fees by MNC Affiliates

The results of OLS estimations of the U.S. MOFAs' license payments are

reported in Table 2. The dependent variables in equations (1) and (2) are based

on the observed license payments (LICENSE), equations (3) and (4) refer to

variables that are adjusted for the industry distribution of affiliates (LICDIF),

and those in equations (5) and (6) have been adjusted also for the host

countries' development levels (LICDIF*).




                              Insert Table 2 here




      Looking first at the estimations with LICENSE, we find that our proxies

for local competition and education are positively related to the affiliates'
                                       14

license payments, whereas the effect of requirements seems to be negative.

The coefficients for the two variants of the local competition proxy,

INV/EMPL and INV/OUTPUT, are both highly significant, but the former

performs better in terms of R2. This holds for the other equations as well, and

the reason is probably that INV/EMPL captures some of the differences

between the countries' capital intensities: high rates of gross investment per

employee are likely to be connected to high capital-labor ratios (simply

because much capital must be replaced in every period), and also to high levels

of technical skills that facilitate the affiliates' technology imports.

       The coefficients for the requirement proxies TREQS and PREQS are

both negative, but TREQS is seldom significantly different from zero, and it

is therefore not shown in the table. This may suggest that the requirements

captured by TREQS may sometimes include rules that force the affiliates to

import technology irrespective of the costs, or that TREQS has little effect on

the affiliates' costs of importing technology, as discussed earlier. Both ED2ND

and ED3RD have the expected positive coefficients, but they are not highly

significant.

       However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the results for

LICENSE, although they seem to confirm some of our hypotheses. As

discussed earlier, the cross-country differences in licensing intensity may be

caused mainly by differences in the industry distribution of affiliates, and not

by our explanatory variables. The observed effects of competition, education,
                                        15

and requirements may therefore be related to decisions about industry

localization rather than to the determinants of the affiliates' technology

imports.

       In equations (3) and (4), an attempt has been made to account for the

cross-country differences in the industry distribution of affiliates. The

explanatory power of the equations improves somewhat, and the coefficient for

ED3RD becomes significant. However, INV/OUTPUT loses its significance.

A possible reason for this is that the license payments from developed and

developing countries differ so much that local competition alone, as proxied

by INV/OUTPUT, cannot explain the pattern. INV/EMPL contains some

information about capital-intensities, and may be more significant for that

reason.

       The major result of the crude adjustment for development levels in the

variable LICDIF* is that INV/OUTPUT becomes more efficient, whereas the

estimated coefficients of PREQS and ED3RD become less significant, although

their signs remain as expected. In equation (5), the coefficient of INV/EMPL

is significant at the one per cent level, whereas those for PREQS and ED3RD

are not significantly different from zero. In equation (6), the coefficient of the

alternative competition proxy INV/OUTPUT is significant at the five per cent

level, but the confidence levels for requirements and education are below 10

per cent. The reason why the proxies for education and requirements are not

significant in these two equations is probably that their effects have already
                                      16

been captured by the adjustment for development levels in the dependent

variable.

      Summing up these results, there is fair support for the hypotheses that

the affiliates' technology payments are positively related to the host countries'

domestic investment levels and education levels, but negatively related to

various performance requirements.



B. Imports of Capital Equipment by MNC Affiliates

Before discussing the determinants of the affiliates' capital imports, it is

necessary to make some comments on the relation between imports of capital

equipment and technology transfer in general. The reason is that there may be

some substitution between different modes of technology transfer. For

instance, we hypothesize that higher teaming capability and labor quality in the

host country are accompanied by larger transfers of technology to affiliates,

but the technology flows may not take the form of capital goods imports. In

countries with high levels of education, it may be possible to find local

suppliers of advanced machinery and equipment - the needed machine

technology can probably be imported in the form of blueprints - and CAPIMP

may remain low although technology transfers in general are large. In the less

developed countries, on the other hand, levels of education are low, but

CAPIMP may be relatively high anyway because all advanced machinery may

have to be imported. Similarly, shortages of skilled labor might lead
                                       17

developing country affiliates to choose technologies that are embodied in

capital goods, rather than "soft' technologies that require skilled labor. This

suggests a more complex case, with several effects pulling in different

directions. The estimations may therefore be seen as tests of which of these

effects are the strongest.

       There are question marks also concerning the effects of requirements.

Most technology transfer requirements usually aim to control the transfer of

disembodied technology, e.g. by demanding special training of the local labor

force, whereas performance requirements are often initiated to reach some

target level of local content or to restrict imports of intermediary goods for

macro-economic reasons. It is not certain that these rules have major effects

on imports of machinery and equipment. In fact, if requirements are strong

(and increase the cost to transfer soft technologies) they might even lead

affiliates to prefer to transfer embodied technology, because it is less likely to

spill over to local competitors.

       Table 3 presents some of the estimations for imports of capital

equipment by U.S. MOFAs. The dependent variable in equations (7) and (8)

is based on the directly observable data for the affiliates' imports of capital

equipment (CAPIMP), but has been adjusted for the industry mix of the

affiliates operating in the host country in equation (9) (CAPDIF), and also for

the host country's development level in equation (10) (CAPDIF*). The results

are weaker than those for the license measures -          most   notably, R2 is
                                      18

significantly lower - but the positive coefficient of local investment remains

significant at the 10 per cent level for all variants of the equation. The

coefficient of PREQS is also positive in all estimations, although never

significant. The signs of the coefficients of TREQS and the education proxies

vary, but none of them is significantly different from zero.




                                Insert Table 3




      Thus, there is some evidence that investment by local competitors may

force the affiliates to higher imports of technology that is embodied in capital

goods. The costs posed by the host countries' performance and technology

transfer requirements do not seem to discourage imports of capital equipment

- if anything, there is a slight positive effect of requirements, that perhaps

reflects the preference to import more embodied technology when the costs for

other transfer modes are high - and differences in the level of education do not

have any detenninate effect. However, the weak fit of the model suggests that

there are other important determinants of capital equipment imports than those

included in the model.

      We also tested the hypotheses for a dependent variable constructed as

the sum of CAPIMP and LICENSE, to examine how the differences in the
                                       19

"aggregate" technology imports of U.S. affiliates can be explained. The

estimated equation (for the 31 countries where data were available), with the

dependent variable Y defined as the ratio (CAPIMP + LICENSE) I LABOR,

and with t-statistics in parentheses, is



(11)           Y = -0.07 + 1.00 INV/EMPL -0.32 PREQS + 0.38 ED3RD
                     (0.18)    (4.72)***          (2.22)**         (1.50)



       It can be seen that the impact of local competition (as measured by

INV/EMPL) appears to be even more significant here than in any of the other

estimations. The negative coefficient of PREQS is also significant, but that of

ED3RD is not, although it has the expected positive sign. Moreover, there are

notable improvements in the overall fit of the equation: R2 increases to 0.55,

and the F-value to 13.47.



4.     Concluding Remarks

The purpose of this paper has been to determine whether host countries aiming

to maximize the inflows of technology through foreign multinationals have

viable policy alternatives to formal technology transfer requirements. On the

basis of a simple theoretical model of technology transfer, proposed by Wang

and Blomström (1992), we hypothesized that policies making use of market

requirements. For instance, policies increasing the level of competition in the

host country may erode the MNC affiliate's technological advantages, and

force it to import new technology from its parent. Similarly, policies

improving local learning capability and labor skills may reduce technology

transfer costs, and encourage imports of technology.

      To test these hypotheses, we examined how cross-country differences

in the technology imports of U.S. affiliates in 33 host countries (calculated

from data on the affiliates' payments for royalties and license fees and their

imports of capital equipment from the U.S. in 1982) were related to proxies

for technology transfer requirements, local competition, and labor skills in the

host countries. The results consistently showed that the technology imports of

MNC affiliates increased with our proxies for the competitive pressure in the

host economy. The technology transfers that were reflected by data on

payments of royalties and license fees were negatively related to performance

requirements, but the requirements did not have any clear effect on imports of

technologies embodied in machinery and equipment. Moreover, the host

countries' levels of education had a positive impact on the affiliates' payments

of royalties and license fees, but no significant effect on the affiliates' imports

of capital equipment.

       One policy conclusion of these fmdings is that host country governments

may choose to support local investment, competition, and education rather than

to rely on controls and direct supervision of FDI to secure inflows of
                                     21

technology to the affiliates of foreign MNCs. One problem, of course, is that

some of these policies - especially those that promote competition - may be

contrary to measures that are commonly used by host countries to attract new

MNCs, e.g. import protection. In practice, it may therefore be necessary to

weigh the benefits from larger inflows of technology to already present MNC

affiliates against the possible costs in terms of foregone new investment from

abroad.

      Notes

1. The surveys cover affiliates in about 50 individual countries, and the data
are presented for aggregate manufacturing and seven broad industry groups.
Gaps in the data have forced us to exclude many countries, and those
remaining are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia,
Denmark, Ecuador, France, West Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India,
Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, South
Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, U.K., and Venezuela. Some estimations cover
fewer countries because of missing observations.

2. It was not possible to calculate unweighted average license payments
because of the many missing country/industry observations.

3. Technology transfers could also be proxied with data on the affiliates' R&D
expenditures, since local R&D often require imports of technology from the
parent company. However, the size and income level of the host economy are
probably the only host characteristics that influence this proxy, as discussed
by Zejan (1990), and we have therefore not included any R&D variables.

4. Some other factors influencing technology transfers have been discussed in
the literature. For instance, Katrak (1991) notes that affiliates are likely to use
more capital-intensive technologies if there are minimum-wage laws that cause
wage rates to exceed some market equilibrium rate, or if over-valued exchange
rates subsidize the use of imported equipment and intennediaries. We have not
included these factors in the analysis for lack of appropriate data.

5. The well-known Decision 24 of the Andean Investment Code, instituted in
1970/71, prohibited payments of royalties and license fees from wholly-owned
affiliates to parents. If the rule had been implemented strictly, the variable
LICENSE would, per definition, have been equal to zero for Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. However, the number of exceptions
has been large, and there did not seem to be any significant differences in the
use of royalties and license fees between these countries and the rest of Latin
America in the early 1980s. See Grosse (1989), pp. 113-131.

6. Our results may therefore reflect the international competition between
MNCs from different countries. See e.g. Graham (1991) and Sölvell (1987).

7. ED2ND and ED3RD refer to 1980, since data for 1982 were not available
for all countries.
