Direct-to-Consumer Advertising and Online Search

NBER Working Paper No. 22582

                                          ABSTRACT

Beginning in 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed television advertisements
to make major statements about a prescription drug, while referring to detailed drug information
on the internet (FDA 1997; 2015). The hope was that consumers would seek additional
information online to fully understand the risks and benefits of taking the medication. To better
understand the effects of the policy, we analyze direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) and
search engine click-through data on a set of drugs over a three-year period.

Regression analysis shows that advertising on a prescription drug serves to increase the frequency
of online search and subsequent clicks for that drug, as well as search for other drugs in the same
class. We find the relationship between DTCA and search is stronger for younger drugs, for those
drugs that treat acute conditions, those drugs that are less likely to be covered by insurance, and
those whose searcher population tends to be older. These findings suggest that DTCA motivates
consumers to search online for drug information, but the magnitude of the effect is heterogeneous
and potentially associated with clicks on websites that are more promotional in nature.

1       Introduction
    Advertising regulations have extended from traditional medias to the internet. Take prescription
drugs for example: in 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a television adver­
tisement to focus on the essential eﬃcacy and side eﬀect information of a prescription drug as long
as the manufacturer provided detailed drug information on the internet and in other publications
(FDA 1997; 2015).1 The key assumptions are that (1) a television-watching consumer will seek more
information on the internet, and (2) this process will result in a balanced understanding of the drug.
    Our paper contributes to the recent literature assessing both assumptions. On the ﬁrst, Kim
(2015) analyzed warning letters issued to pharmaceutical companies regarding problems with their
online search ads and found that most violations were for a lack of adequate risk information on
branded drug websites and in online paid advertisements. After receiving these letters, many of the
advertisements were removed. Choiu and Tucker (2010) looked at how search patterns changed as a
result and found that consumers were more likely to click on websites that featured user-generated
content and online pharmacies.
    Beyond drug advertising, a number of papers have looked at the relationship between television
advertising and online search. Joo et al. (2015) look at how advertisements for ﬁnancial services
companies aﬀected search for both individual brands and more general product categories. They
ﬁnd a positive eﬀect on brand searches, but no eﬀect on category searches.2 Lewis and Reiley (2013)
show similar positive eﬀects focusing on a range of consumer products advertised during the Super
Bowl. Dinner et al. (2014) ﬁnd cross-channel eﬀects on sales: oﬄine (online) advertising aﬀects
online (oﬄine) sales. The interaction of oﬄine and online advertising is studied in Goldfarb and
Tucker (2011) where they show that online ads can be a substitute for oﬄine ads in aﬀecting sales
of alcoholic beverages.3
    An intensive debate also targets the second assumption that consumers receive a balanced
understanding of the risks and beneﬁts of taking a particular drug. One side of the debate argues
that it is misleading to provide drug information to consumers as they cannot directly choose their
prescription. To make things worse, pharmaceutical manufacturers may not have the incentive to
provide “balanced” information: researchers show that television advertisements tend to emphasize
drug beneﬁts over risk information (Kopp and Bang 2000; Day 2006) and although most prescription
drug websites provide both risk and beneﬁt information, the risk information is presented in a less
prominent and accessible way (Huh and Cude 2004).
    1
      The FDA’s guidelines state that the adequate provision for detailed drug information could be met with both
reference to a website on the internet and a means for “many persons with limited access to technologically sophisticated
outlets” to obtain the information. This could be in the form a toll-free number, reference to other available print ads,
or the “availability of suﬃcient numbers of brochures containing package labeling in a variety of publicly accessible
sites (e.g., pharmacies, doctors’ oﬃces, grocery stores, public libraries).”
    2
      If this result holds for drug searches, it would mean that advertisements for the cholesterol drug, Lipitor, lead to
more searches for the brand, but has no signiﬁcant eﬀect for searches on cholesterol or heart disease.
    3
      Other studies that ﬁnd positive eﬀects of online advertising on online search and clicks include Papadimitriou et al.
(2011), Van der Lans et al. (2014), Ghose and Todri (2015), and Chiou and Tucker (2012). Lewis and Nguyen (2015)
use an experiment run on Yahoo!’s search engine to show that display advertising for a particular brand increases
searches for that brand by 30-45% and has positive spillovers to competing brands.


                                                            2
    The other side of the debate stresses the educational value of drug advertising: it informs
consumers of a drug’s existence, which may prompt consumers to research the drug, associate it
with self-observed symptoms and eventually seek treatment. Some evidence lent support to these
arguments (Iizuka and Jin 2005; Avery et al. 2007) while other evidence conﬁrms the concern that
consumer pressure for advertised drugs may compromise doctors’ prescription choices (Kravitz et al.
2005) or lead to adverse drug-related events (David, et al. 2010).4
    Do consumers search for online information upon exposure to direct-to-consumer advertising
(DTCA)? If they do, the information communicated via the internet could play an important role
on both sides of the debate. To the extent that manufacturer websites are biased towards drug
beneﬁts, will DTCA motivate consumers to search for information on other websites? If there is
an educational value in drug advertisements, will DTCA encourage consumers to go beyond the
advertised drug and research competing drugs? In this paper, we employ consumer click-through
data to answer these questions.
    Our analysis focuses on the click behavior of consumers using comScore’s click-through data
from the ﬁve largest search engines. According to Pew internet and the American Life Project
(2008)5 , search engines like Google and Yahoo! are an important gateway to the internet. Use of
the internet in the U.S. increased from 52% of all American adults in 2000 to 84% in 2015 (Perrin
2015).6 When consumers go online, using a search engine is a very popular online activity: 91%
of internet users visited a search engine in 2012 (Purcell 2012). While consumers formerly relied
on their doctor as the primary source of medical information, now they increasingly turn to the
internet. A study by Pew Research found that 72% of internet users searched for health-related
information on the internet in the past 12-months and 77% of users began at a search engine (Fox
2013).7
    Interestingly, while most DTCA for prescription drugs are conveyed via traditional medias such
as television, radio, magazines, newspapers, and billboards, a small but growing portion is devoted to
display (banner) advertisements and sponsored search on the internet. For example, pharmaceutical
manufacturers spent $270 million on online display ads in 2010, 6.4% of overall DTCA spending.8
Overall, total DTCA spending on prescription drugs increased from $662 million in 1996 (the year
before the FDA’s new guidance) to $4.2 billion in 2010, a 542% increase. According to Nielsen, in
2014, pharmaceuticals were the third largest category of ad spending.9
    Our analysis shows that advertising on a prescription drug serves to increase the frequency
of online search for that drug as well as search for other drugs in the same class.10 The number

      There is also a large literature analyzing the eﬀects of DTCA on initial drug take-up and adherence. See, for
example, Avery et al. (2012), Dave and Saﬀer (2012), and Woskinska (2005).

look for advice or information about health or health care in 2001.” (JAMA 2003).

      Some of our results show that class-level DTCA has a larger eﬀect than own-drug DTCA, which is consistent

of clicks following drug queries is positively associated with DTCA and the eﬀect is signiﬁcantly
larger for paid clicks compared to organic clicks. Clicks (both organic and paid) on promotional
websites are more strongly associated with DTCA compared to clicks on informational websites.
The magnitude of the eﬀect of DTCA varies signiﬁcantly by media type with broadcast and internet
advertising having the strongest positive eﬀects.
    We also ﬁnd the relationship between DTCA and search is stronger for younger drugs and for
those drugs that treat acute conditions. This group of drugs may be particularly important from
the FDA’s point of view because consumers may be ﬁrst-time users and lack experience taking a
drug. As expected, drugs that are less likely to be covered by insurance plans also show a stronger
positive relationship between DTCA and search activity, particularly clicks on promotional websites.
    Ippolito and Mathios (1991) show that older and potentially more informationally-disadvantaged
populations are more responsive to advertising.11 If the advertising is associated with more clicks on
promotional websites, it may expose these populations to relatively more biased and less balanced
information. However, if the advertising is associated with clicks on informative websites, they also
may beneﬁt more than other populations if they lack awareness of alternatives. Our results show
more evidence of the ﬁrst hypotheses, primarily for older searchers. Promotional clicks are more
strongly associated with DTCA for older searchers. In contrast, the relationship between DTCA
and promotional clicks is reduced for less wealthy searchers. Neither age nor income level appears
to aﬀect the relationship between DTCA and clicks on informational websites.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a description of
the data, which includes click-through data from comScore, drug information from the FDA, and
advertising data from Kantar Media. Section 3 presents summary statistics on drug-related searches
and advertising. Regression results are presented in section 4 that show how DTCA is associated
with the frequency of search and clicks following drug queries. We also consider spillovers of drug
DTCA to other drugs in the same class and how searcher demographics aﬀect the relationship
between advertising and search. Section 5 concludes.


2    Data
    We combine three diﬀerent data sources to estimate the eﬀects of DTCA on online search.
Search and click-through data are obtained from comScore, monthly advertising data are obtained
from Kantar Media, and drug information is obtained from both the FDA’s Orange Book and the
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
with studies by Donohue and Berndt (2004) and Shapiro (2015) that show that DTCA (unlike detailing to a physician)
has more of an eﬀect on market expansion than on speciﬁc drug choice.

2.1     Search Data
    Search and click-through data are based on a 37-month sample (September 2008-September
2011) from comScore for 373 prescription drugs.12 ComScore’s Search Planner product provides
the frequency of searches and clicks for a given query (drug) on the ﬁve largest internet search
engines (Google, Yahoo!, Bing, AOL, and Ask) for all U.S. internet users.13 Reports are generated
for both “exact” queries (i.e., the metrics reported are for searches on the precise query entered
into the search engine) and “match-all-form” queries (i.e., the metrics reported are for searches
on the precise query and alternative forms of the query such as additional words, plural forms,
and common misspellings).14 Most of our analysis will rely on the match-all-forms reports though
results using the exact reports are provided in the appendix.
    To request the search data from comScore, we needed to provide a list of queries on which to
generate the reports. To create the database of queries, we use the FDA’s Orange Book, which
includes all drugs that have been approved by the FDA.15 We focus on drug names only (as opposed
to medical conditions and drug classes) because drug names are mentioned prominently (and
repeatedly) in advertisements and one study found that over 80% of drug advertisements promoted
speciﬁc products rather than medical conditions.16 Because many of these drugs are unpopular or
have more obscure names, we ﬁrst ran the full list of drug names through comScore to download
the search activity during the ﬁrst and last six months of our sample period. Drugs with no search
activity in either window were dropped, leaving us with a sample of 2,158 drugs. After merging with
the advertising database and restricting to drugs that have positive ads in at least one month during
our time period, we are left with 373 drugs on which we perform our analysis.17 ComScore also
provides demographic information, including age and household income, for the average searcher of
a given query.
   12
      Because 51 drugs are newly approved during our sample period, we only include the period after approval for
those drugs.
   13
      Throughout this paper, we use the term “query” to designate the search term a consumer enters in a search
engine. In our case, queries are drug names. See https://www.comscore.com/Products/Audience-Analytics/
Search-Planner.
   14
      The match-all-forms report for the query “lipitor” would include metrics for “buy lipitor”, “lipetor”, “lipitor side
eﬀects,” etc.
   15
      At the time of download, the Orange Book included 26,590 drugs.
   16
      See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690298/ for more on the evolution of drug advertising
in the U.S. Prior to the FDA’s 1997 guidelines, broadcast ads generally featured either the drug name or the condition
treated, but not both.
   17
      ComScore censors the search and click reports if the sample size is too small to reliably extrapolate to the
population. This is less of an issue for our sample of drugs that are all actively advertised. Approximately 15% of
drug-months show zero searches and clicks, which could be due to censoring.

   Descriptive statistics on the comScore click-through data are shown in Table 1. Drugs in our
sample received an average of about 40,000 searches each month and those searches generated
approximately 28,000 clicks. While most clicks are on “organic” links, about 10% of clicks are on
“paid” or “sponsored” links. Organic links are those displayed based only on the search engine’s
algorithm, while paid links appear based both on their relevance to the search query and a payment
made to the search engine by the link’s owner.
   While many websites often contain both informational and promotional content, we further
classify clicks on websites as being primarily promotional or informational. Promotional clicks are
those on online pharmacies (e.g., drugstore.com), brand websites (e.g., lipitor.com), and producer
websites (e.g., pﬁzer.com). Informational clicks are those on websites ending in dot-gov (e.g.,
fda.gov), those ending in dot-edu (medicine.yale.edu), and other health information websites (e.g.,


                                                          6
webmd.com).18 It is important to note that we are not viewing promotional websites as bad and
informational websites as good, but simply classifying the websites based on their likely primary
content. All other clicks are classiﬁed as “other” and they include clicks on non-health related
websites and generally popular websites, such as yahoo.com. Promotional clicks are much more
likely to be paid compared to informational clicks. The average searcher in our sample is 49 years
old with a household income of over $81,000.

2.2    Advertising Data
    We also gather data on DTCA for each drug in the sample. We have monthly data from January
1994 through September 2011 from Kantar Media. The data include 1,684 unique brand name
drugs, of which 832 had positive DTCA between September 2008 and September 2011, the date
range of the comScore data. Advertising expenditure is broken down by media type and the full
time series of DTCA spending is shown in Figure 1.

    The growth of total DTCA is clearly evident with the largest increases in television and magazine
advertising, and more recently, spending on the internet. In 2011, total DTCA was divided between
television (53.1%), magazines (35.9%), internet (6.1%), newspapers (4.3%), radio (0.5%), and
outdoor ads (0.02%). The growth in television advertising is particularly apparent following the

FDA’s new guidance on DTCA issued in 1997. Kantar only reports internet ad spending on display
ads which appear, for example, across the top of many websites though generally not search engines.
It does not include spending on sponsored/paid search results which is reported to be about the
same size as display ad spending in the pharmaceutical industry.19 Figure A2 in the appendix shows
the 25 drugs with the largest DTCA spending in 2011.
   Descriptive statistics of the advertising data over the time period for which we observe search
data are shown in Table 2. The average drug in our data has close to one million dollars per month
of DTCA, though the average is highly skewed as 66 drugs (18%) had monthly DTCA above the
mean and 307 (82%) were below. Although the median DTCA expenditure across all drugs-months
is zero, the total DTCA for the smoking-cessation drug, Chantix, was over $72 million in December
2009. Television, magazine, and, increasingly, internet-based advertising have the largest average
monthly expenditure among the media channels.

                  and MEPS. Statistics for age of drug based on the drug's age in the first month it
                  appears in our sample. Insurance coverage measures the amount of the total
                  payment paid for by third parties. Rx per year is the average number of prescriptions
                  written for a patient in a given year.




     The average drug in our sample was approved by the FDA around the year 2001 and almost all
drugs in our sample are brand name drugs.20 For each drug, the MEPS reports the amount the
customer pays for each prescription and the amount paid by third parties, such as private insurance
and Medicare. The insurance coverage variable in the table is the ratio between what the customer
pays and the total payment. Drugs in our sample have approximately 76% coverage though some
have zero coverage and others are fully covered by insurance.
     We also use the MEPS to calculate the average prescription rate per year for each drug. Drugs
with an average of ﬁve or more prescriptions per patient per year are classiﬁed as chronic. Others
are classiﬁed as treating acute conditions.21 In our sample, the average drug is prescribed four times
per year to a particular customer and 35% of drugs are classiﬁed as treating chronic conditions.22
Finally, from the FDA’s National Drug Code Directory, we obtain the therapeutic class to which
each drug belongs (e.g., cardiovascular agents, respiratory agents, etc.).23


3        Descriptive Analysis
     In this section we present general descriptive statistics on the advertising and search activity of
drugs in our sample. Descriptive statistics on the 10 most advertised drugs are shown in Table 4.24
    20
       For 7% of drugs in the sample, the drug is listed under its generic name.
    21
       We chose a cut-oﬀ of ﬁve prescriptions because the distribution of prescription rates in the MEPS (among our
sample of drugs) is bi-modal with modes at about one and ﬁve prescriptions per year. Our results are robust to
changing the cut-oﬀ to four and six prescriptions per year.
    22
       For example, Tamiﬂu is an acute drug with 1.04 prescriptions per year and Zonegran (an anti-seizure medicine)
is a chronic drug with 8.11 prescriptions per year.

wide range of drug ages, prescription rates, insurance coverage rates, and searcher demographics
among these drugs. The cholesterol drug, Lipitor, has average DTCA of over $21 million a month
and receives almost 140,000 searches. Averages of the key search and advertising variables for all
drugs are shown in Table 5.

represents about 58% of the total consumer-directed advertising budget for a drug. Over 90% of
clicks are organic, and as shown in Figure 2, this percentage has grown about eight percentage
points from 2008 to 2011.25 As a percentage of total clicks received, over twice as many (33% versus
15%) are clicks on informational websites compared to promotional websites. Figure 2 also shows
that clicks on informational websites have slightly increased between 2008 and 2011, while clicks on
promotional websites have been falling (as a percentage of total clicks).26

      The growth in organic clicks relative to paid clicks is partially due to Google’s ban on unapproved online
pharmacies from advertising via paid links in February 2010. Other search engines followed suit in subsequent months.
All of our regression speciﬁcations include month ﬁxed eﬀects to control for any eﬀects of the ban. For more, see:
Chesnes, Dai, and Jin, “Banning Foreign Pharmacies from Sponsored Search: The Online Consumer Response,” (under
review).
   26
      Informational (promotional) clicks represented 32% (19%) of clicks in 2008 and 34% (13%) of clicks in 2011. Note
that percentages in Table 5 are across all years.

    Figure 3 shows the distribution of destination websites for organic and paid clicks. Among organic
clicks, over half of clicks following drug queries are on general health information websites, followed
by clicks on the the brand website and other sites like major search engines. The distribution of paid
clicks is quite diﬀerent with over half going to brand websites, followed by general health websites
and a signiﬁcant fraction, 16%, to online pharmacies.27 Figure A3 in the appendix shows the
organic/paid split for each entity type ranging from online pharmacies with the highest percentage
of paid clicks (52.2%) to dot-edu websites with the highest percentage of organic clicks (99.8%).
  27
    Note the general health websites with the largest number of paid clicks include webmd.com, righthealth.com,
and healthline.com.

 Notes: DTCA, searches and clicks are month averages per drug from 9/2008‐9/2011. Age of drug, Searcher age, and Searcher income as of the
 first month a drug appears in the sample. Chronic drugs are defined as those with an average of 5 or more prescriptions per patient per year.
 Low coverage drugs are drugs where the percent of the total payment that is paid by third parties is less than 80% (the median coverage).




    Table 6 shows the monthly averages of key variables both by drug characteristics and searcher
demographics. Acute drugs are searched slightly more often (and receive more clicks following those
searches) than drugs that treat chronic conditions. This may be due to the fact that ﬁrst-time users
of these drugs may be unfamiliar with side eﬀects, interactions, etc. and are seeking additional
information. Users of chronic drugs may be seeking an inexpensive source of supply, though the
percent of clicks on paid and promotional websites is the same as acute drugs. DTCA spending is
54% higher for drugs that treat chronic conditions compared to those that treat acute conditions.
    Drugs that are less likely to be covered by third-party payers are searched much more often
than drugs with high coverage, but again the percent of clicks on paid and promotional websites is
similar for both high and low coverage drugs. If consumers are more likely to seek aﬀordable supply
options for drugs with low coverage, we might expect those drugs to receive a higher percentage of
promotional clicks. However, if lower third-party coverage is correlated with lower per-prescription
prices (and lower out-of-pocket expenditure), we would expect the opposite result. We explore this


                                                                       13
further in the regression analysis below.
     The number of searches and subsequent clicks varies somewhat with searcher age and income ­
searchers in their late 40s and those with between $75,000 and $100,000 in income tend to search
more than other groups, but the percent of clicks on paid and promotional links do not vary
systematically. Tables showing these same variables by drug age (A2) and drug class (A3) are
included in the appendix.


4        Regression Results
     Our regression analysis is at the drug-month level. The breakdown of advertising by media is
important both because of diﬀerent FDA regulations over what must be conveyed in advertisements
on each media and DTCA via diﬀerent channels may have diﬀerent eﬀects on consumer search
patterns. Because almost 90% of DTCA is either on television or in magazines, we aggregate
DTCA into “broadcast” and “print” based ads. Television and radio DTCA are aggregated into the
broadcast DTCA variable, while magazine, newspaper, and outdoor-based DTCA are aggregated
into the print DTCA variable. We leave internet DTCA separate both because it is the fastest
growing segment of DTCA and due to its close proximity to the variables we are measuring, search
and clicks.
     Broadcast media, especially since the FDA’s guidance in 1997 lessening the requirements on
what needs to be conveyed during the ad, tends to only highlight the main beneﬁts and potential
side eﬀects of a drug (the “major statement”). Magazine ads usually include two pages: one with
the highlights of the drug in full color and dramatic fonts, and the other with the details in ﬁne print
(the “brief summary”). DTCA in newspapers is likely presenting similar information to magazine
ads. The internet ads captured in the data are display ads and would likely have a similar eﬀect to
broadcast DTCA with only the highlights presented. Therefore broadcast and internet ads, given
their lack of detailed information, may have a stronger positive eﬀect on search compared to print
ads.

4.1      Baseline: Eﬀects of DTCA on Consumer Search and Clicks
     Our baseline regression is shown in equation 1.



                  log(search)dm = α + β · log(DT CAd,m−1 ) + δ · log(DT CAc,m−1 )                                (1)
                                          +µm + µd + �dm .

     Search for drug d in month m is regressed on advertising for the drug and advertising for other
drugs in the same class in the previous month.28 We control for time eﬀects with year-month
    28
     All regressions in this section are in logs. For months where a drug had either no recorded searches or zero
advertising, we code the log of those variables as zero. Removing those observations from our model results in almost
identical results. Our baseline model in levels is shown in the appendix.


                                                         14
ﬁxed eﬀects in all speciﬁcations. Due to the skewed distribution of search popularity for drugs
in our sample, we also include drug ﬁxed eﬀects in all speciﬁcations.29 Our dependent variable is
alternatively the number of searches, clicks, organic clicks, or paid clicks.
    The speciﬁcations in the table below each contain either overall DTCA for a drug or a breakdown
of DTCA by the broadcast, print, and internet channels. We attempt to limit the endogeneity that
may exist between DTCA and search activity by including only DTCA spending in the month prior
to the period we observe the search and click activity.30 We believe this minimizes the endogeneity
of last-month advertising as manufacturers plan their DTCA spending in advance and are unlikely
to determine oﬄine advertising in expectation of its impact on online search. This does not imply
that we assume no eﬀect from concurrent advertising or a complete depreciation of DTCA after
one month (more on depreciation below). Rather, what is captured is the correlation between drug
search and last month’s advertising. To the extent that advertising is serially correlated from month
to month, the regression will partially capture the eﬀect of concurrent advertising as well. We have
done robustness checks by including the previous three, six, and 12 months aggregate advertising
and the results are qualitatively similar to those presented here.31
    Most of the DTCA in our data is oﬄine with only 6% of total DTCA in the form of online
display ads. Online spending on paid-search advertising is not included in the data. Particularly for
speciﬁcations with paid clicks as the dependent variable, we are not accounting for a potentially
important omitted variable, paid search advertising. To the extent that drug companies run
simultaneous ad campaigns across channels, the reported coeﬃcients will partially reﬂect the eﬀect
of the paid search ads. However, the bias should be limited because the correlation between internet
(display) advertising and both broadcast and print ads is only 0.20, while it is 0.53 between broadcast
and print ads.
   29
      See the regression results in appendix table A4, which shows how the coeﬃcients on DTCA change with diﬀerent
drug and time ﬁxed eﬀects.
   30
      Including DTCA from the same month would incorrectly involve search activity during the ﬁrst half of the month
regressed on DTCA spending in the second half of the same month.
   31
      We have also run our regressions using only the contemporaneous advertising variables and obtained similar
results that are generally slightly larger in magnitude. These results are available from the authors upon request.

  month. Broadcast ads are television and radio ads. Print ads are those in magazines, newpapers and on outdoor displays.




    Results of the baseline regression are presented in Table 7. A drug’s own and class DTCA are
strongly associated with more search and clicks. The largest eﬀect for own DTCA is on paid clicks.
A 10% increase in own DTCA is associated with a 0.21%-0.27% increase in searches, all clicks, and
organic clicks; and a 0.85% increase in paid clicks, statistically signiﬁcantly higher than the eﬀect
on organic clicks. Note that while the coeﬃcient (elasticity) is larger for paid clicks compared to
organic clicks, because most clicks are organic, the change in the absolute number of clicks is over
twice as large for organic clicks.           32   We also ﬁnd positive spillovers from one drug to another within
the same class: class DTCA has larger eﬀects than a drug’s own DTCA for all clicks and organic
clicks and a smaller eﬀect for paid clicks.
    Focusing on the breakdown by media category reveals that broadcast and internet advertising
have positive and signiﬁcant eﬀects in all speciﬁcations, with the largest eﬀect for paid clicks. This
is consistent with the notion that these ads provide relatively less detailed information and may
leave a consumer wanting to seek out additional sources. Print ads are positive and signiﬁcant for
searches and paid clicks, though the coeﬃcients are smaller in magnitude compared to broadcast
and internet ads. Class-level DTCA via internet ads is positive and signiﬁcant for both organic and
paid clicks. Class-level print-based DTCA is negative (though insigniﬁcant) for searches and all
clicks, consistent with consumers searching for the drug name appearing in those ads and clicking
relatively less on drugs that may be in the same class. Overall, the spillovers from class-level DTCA
to clicks are largest for online ads.
   32
     From Table, 1, the average drug receives 25,214 organic clicks and 2,541 paid clicks each month. Multiplying
these totals by the elasticities yields a change of 5,295 organic clicks and 2,160 paid clicks for a 10% increase in DTCA.

  Advertising variables lagged one month. Promotional clicks are those on pharmacy, brand and
  producer websites. Informational clicks are those on dot-edu, dot-gov, and other general health
  information websites.



   In Table 8, we dig deeper into the eﬀects of DTCA on clicks by separating promotional and
informational clicks. As explained above, promotional websites include brand and producer websites
as well as online pharmacies, while informational websites include dot-gov and dot-edu websites.
Only a government agency can register for a website that ends in the dot-gov extension, only schools
can use dot-edu, while anyone can register for a dot-com site (see Chesnes (2009)). These three-letter
extensions are called top-level domains. We believe that, particularly for complicated drug and
health related information, a user processing the results of a search query will base their choice
partially on the top-level domain and may prefer more exclusive domains (like dot-gov and dot-edu)
if they are seeking unbiased information. Others may be seeking a place to buy a drug they have
seen on television, so may be more likely to visit the drug company’s website or an online pharmacy
(both likely dot-com websites).33
   We ﬁnd that DTCA is more strongly associated with promotional clicks than informational
clicks, though the latter is still positive and signiﬁcant. A 10% increase in DTCA is associated
with a 0.58% increase in promotional clicks and a 0.25% increase in informational clicks, and these
two eﬀects are statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other. DTCA also has a signiﬁcantly
larger eﬀect on paid promotional and paid informational clicks compared to organic promotional
and organic informational clicks, respectively. As before, we can translate these elasticities into
absolute magnitudes: the coeﬃcients on DTCA translate into an additional 2,487 promotional clicks
and 2,264 informational clicks for each 10% increase in DTCA.34 Class DTCA shows similar eﬀects
as own DTCA for promotional clicks, but generally stronger eﬀects for informational clicks as would
be expected if ads for other drugs induce consumers to search for information about an underlying
  33
       There are dot-com sites, such as webmd.com, that do provide more informational content.
  34
       From Table, 1, the average drug receives 4,288 promotional clicks and 9,056 informational clicks each month.

health condition or for alternative treatments.35
    The appendix includes various robustness checks on our baseline model. Table A5 shows that
using logarithms of both the search and advertising variables provides a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt
to the data (in terms of root MSE) than using levels. Table A6 shows that comScore’s “exact”
reports produce almost identical results to the speciﬁcations based on the “match-all-forms” reports.
Alternative dependent variables are presented in Table A7. While the results for searchers is very
similar to the models based on searches, we also show that own DTCA has a positive, though only
marginally signiﬁcant, eﬀect on the number of searches per searcher, implying a more in-depth
search experience. Regressions using clicks on individual website types as the dependent variable
are shown in Table A8. The largest positive eﬀects are for clicks on the brand, general health,
and giant websites, while there are smaller positive eﬀects for pharmacy and non-health related
websites. Finally, in Table A9, we focus on the rate of depreciation of DTCA.36 Our baseline model
(speciﬁcation 1) is similar to the results based on the aggregate depreciated DTCA in the prior six
months (speciﬁcation 3).37

4.2    Heterogeneous Eﬀects: Drug Attributes
    We next analyze how the eﬀects of DTCA on search may be diﬀerent for various types of drugs.
Our model for these regression speciﬁcations is shown in equation 2.



                  log(search)dm = α + β · log(DT CAd,m−1 ) + δ · log(DT CAc,m−1 )                                   (2)
                                           +γ · Xd · log(DT CAd,m−1 ) + µm + µd + �dm .

    We include own-drug and class-level DTCA as independent variables as well as the interaction
of drug attributes (Xd ) with own-drug DTCA. Results are shown in Table 10.
    35
       Note that while Table 8 presents results for promotional and informational clicks, the omitted category is “other
clicks.” A regression using “other clicks” as the dependent variable results in estimates similar to speciﬁcation 4 for
informational clicks (the coeﬃcients on DTCA and class-DTCA are 0.021 and 0.039 respectively). Full results are
available from the authors upon request.
    36
       Several researchers have attempted to estimate the depreciation rate of DTCA for prescription drugs. Berndt et
al. (1995) ﬁnd that about 15% of DTCA depreciated in a month (using data before the 1997 FDA clariﬁcation). Jin
and Iizuka (2005) ﬁnd that the eﬀect of a drug’s DTCA on the propensity of consumers to visit their doctor regarding
the related drug class, depreciates by only about 4% per month. However, in Jin and Iizuka (2007), they ﬁnd that the
eﬀect of DTCA on the likelihood that a doctor prescribes a drug is small and depreciates almost immediately.
    37
       We use a monthly discount rate of 0.9672 for the "6m Dep" variables in speciﬁcation 3, which is the monthly
depreciation rate of DTCA found in Jin and Iizuka (2005).

  Notes: t-statistics in parentheses, *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Match-all-forms comScore data. Advertising variables lagged one month.
  Drug age is standardized based on the age of the drug as of the first month it appears in the sample. Chronic and low insurance indicators
  constant across all months for each drug. Promotional clicks are those on pharmacy, brand and producer websites. Informational clicks are
  those on dot-edu, dot-gov, and other general health information websites.




     The speciﬁcations correspond to all websites, promotional websites, and informational websites,
separately for all, organic, and paid clicks. Drug attributes included are the drug’s age since FDA
approval, the type of condition the drug treats (chronic/acute), and an indicator for drugs with
low insurance coverage.38 The relationship between DTCA and clicks is reduced the older is the
drug, particularly for promotional clicks. This may be because consumers are already aware of older
drugs and are less inﬂuenced by their advertisements.39 DTCA is generally less eﬀective at driving
clicks for drugs treating chronic conditions, again because consumers may be familiar with drugs
they take frequently.40
     DTCA is eﬀective at driving more clicks for low coverage drugs, particularly paid clicks on
promotional websites. This is consistent with the explanation that consumers are seeking an
aﬀordable supply source. The coeﬃcient of DTCA on (all) informational clicks is positive (though
insigniﬁcant) for drugs with low insurance coverage so a point of purchase may not be the only
motivation for these consumers. Consumers may be clicking on informational websites to obtain
information on drug alternatives/equivalents that may oﬀer better insurance coverage.
     If low insurance coverage and low per-prescription out-of-pocket drug prices were positively
correlated, then consumers may have a reduced incentive to seek aﬀordable sources of supply for
drugs with low coverage. However, in our data the correlation between out-of-pocket per-prescription
drug costs and the proportion of the drug’s total payment made by a third party is -0.23. Appendix
Table A11 conﬁrms this result: we add the interaction of DTCA and out-of-pocket drug costs as an

      See appendix Table A10 for regression results showing how the eﬀect of DTCA on search varies with a drug’s
class. Note these results are based on a smaller sample of drugs for which we observe drug characteristics.
   39
      Note that the drug age variable is standardized so other coeﬃcients measure the eﬀects for an average-aged drug
(approximately seven years after FDA approval).
   40
      Although not shown here, regressions that include individual drug attributes (and without query ﬁxed eﬀects) show
that chronic drugs are generally positively associated with clicks, particularly on promotional websites. Consumers
that purchase a drug often and may be searching for inexpensive sources of supply.

    Finally, we turn to how searcher demographics aﬀect the relationship between DTCA and search.

    DTCA may have a larger eﬀect on older and potentially more informationally-disadvantaged
searchers, populations that may be more responsive to advertising if they have limited information
and are not internet savvy enough to use online search. They may also beneﬁt more from drug
advertisements if they are relatively less aware of a drug’s existence, the condition it treats, and its
alternatives. We ﬁnd that DTCA tends to have a stronger eﬀect on promotional clicks for older
searchers and those with higher incomes. A smaller eﬀect is found on organic informational clicks
for these same populations. Overall, while the eﬀect of DTCA on promotional clicks is larger for
older searchers, lower income searchers do not appear more responsive to DTCA and are, in fact,
less likely to click on promotional websites.


5     Conclusion
Our analysis shows that consumers seek diverse information about prescription drugs online and
their behavior is inﬂuenced by the online and oﬄine advertising to which they are exposed. Overall,
we show that advertising on a prescription drug serves to increase the frequency of online search and
    41
       The data on searcher age and income are reported as the percent “reach” in diﬀerent age groups (e.g, 15% for
ages 18-25 and 10% for incomes between $25,000 and $50,000). We create a continuous variable for each drug based
on midpoints of each range, weighted by the reach, and aggregated. For the 65 and older bin, we take the average U.S.
life expectancy as the maximum (78) so the midpoint in the top range is 72. Data from the census is used to calculate
the average income for the two bins “less than $25,000” and “more than $100,000.”


                                                                        20
subsequent clicks for that drug as well as search for other drugs in the same class. While broadcast
and internet advertising having the strongest positive eﬀects on search, the magnitude of the eﬀect
of DTCA varies signiﬁcantly by media type.
   Following drug searches, the eﬀect of DTCA on clicks varies both by the type of link (organic
versus paid) and the type of destination website (informational versus promotional). The eﬀect of
DTCA is signiﬁcantly larger for paid clicks and promotional websites compared to organic clicks
and informational websites respectively. The relationship between DTCA and clicks is stronger for
younger drugs and for those drugs that treat acute conditions. Because these drugs are more likely
to be prescribed to ﬁrst-time users who may lack information about side eﬀects, interactions, etc.,
the FDA may be reassured that consumers are seeking additional information. It is also encouraging
that for less wealthy searchers, DTCA is associated with fewer clicks on promotional drug websites.
   However, DTCA is also associated with clicks on promotional websites, and the eﬀect is larger
for drugs with low insurance coverage as consumers may be seeking an aﬀordable supply source.
For older searchers, a population that may be more responsive to advertising, clicks on promotional
websites are more strongly associated with DTCA. Finally, while DTCA may be associated with
more clicks on promotional websites, most of those clicks are on brand websites, which the FDA
monitors in order to ensure balanced and unbiased information.
   Overall, because the total number of clicks on organic links is about 10 times larger than clicks on
paid links, the eﬀect of DTCA on the absolute number of clicks is larger for organic links compared
to paid links and roughly evenly split between informational and promotional websites. Without
more information on drug prices and utilization, it is diﬃcult to make conclusions regarding the
welfare eﬀects of DTCA. However, our research shows that at least for some drugs and demographic
groups, DTCA is associated with consumers seeking additional information, which supports the
FDA’s intention when it adopted the 1997 guidelines.
