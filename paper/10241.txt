                                             ABSTRACT

Policies are typically chosen by politicians and bureaucrats. This paper investigates the e fficiency

criteria for allocating policy tasks to elected policymakers (politicians) or non elected bureaucrats.

Politicians are more efficient for tasks that do not involve too much specific technical ability relative

to effort; there is uncertainty about ex post preferences of the public and flexibility is valuable; time

inconsistency is not an issue; small but powerful vested interests do not have large stakes in the

policy outcome; effective decisions over policies require taking into account policy

complementarities and compensating the losers. We then compare this benchmark with the case in

which politicians choose when to delegate and we show that the two generally differ.

1        Introduction

Policies are chosen and implemented by both elected representatives

(politicians) and non elected bureaucrats. The idea that politicians

choose policies and bureaucrats simply implement them is simplistic;

in fact the boundaries between decision and execution are a grey area

and in many cases bureaucrats do much more than executing either de

jure or de facto. In most countries non elected central bankers conduct

monetary policy, with much independence. Regulatory policies are nor-

mally the result of both political and bureaucratic intervention. Fiscal

policy is, instead, by and large chosen by elected representatives (govern-

ments and legislatures); bureaucrats are involved in important aspects

of auditing and implementation, but they do not choose tax rates or

the amount of spending for their department. Foreign policy decisions

are made by politicians, sometimes after consultation with diplomatic

or military personnel.

   What criteria are used to allocate decision power amongst politicians

and bureaucrats? We explore this question both from the point of view

of economic eﬃciency and from the positive point of view of what politi-

cians would choose. First we ask what is the socially optimal allocation

of tasks, that is the allocation that would be chosen by every member

of this society behind a veil of ignorance at a constitutional table, or,

equivalently, by a social planner. Then we discuss the positive question

of whether and how politicians interested in reelection would find it in

their interests to delegate certain tasks (and which ones) to bureaucrats.

   Economists have emphasized one specific argument in favor of dele-



                                    2
gation of policy to a non elected bureaucrat: time inconsistency in mone-

tary policy. Rogoﬀ (1985) pointed out how an independent and inflation

averse central banker not subject to ex post democratic control would

improve social welfare.1 But, as political scientists know well there is

much more to think about. For instance, even fiscal policy is marred with

a host of time inconsistency problems, but societies seem reluctant to

allocate this policy prerogative to independent bureaucrats. Note, how-

ever, that Blinder (1997) argues that some aspects of fiscal policy could

be allocated to an independent agency operating like an independent

Central Bank2 . An interesting question is why this never happens. An

ability to commit to a course of action may even be desirable in foreign

policy, which however is always the prerogative of appointed politicians,

at least in the more relevant phase of choosing the general strategy.3

The raise of the regulatory state has made the bureaucracy a key player

in both the decisions and the execution of a large amount of legislation.

       Our starting point is the premise that the main diﬀerence between
   1
      See Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983) for the ”clas-
sic” statement of the time inconsistency problem. Walsh (1995) and Persson and
Tabellini (1993) discussed ”contractual” arrangements between popular representa-
tives and independent central bankers. For an empirical discussion of the benefits
of independent central bankers see Grilli Masciandaro and Tabellini (1991), Alesina
and Summers (1993) for OECD countries and Cukierman (1992) for a larger sample
of countries.

Australia be set by an independent agency within limits imposed by the legislature.

politicians and bureaucrats lies in their motivations. Politicians are mo-

tivated by the goal of winning elections. Bureaucrats are motivated by

”career concerns”, that is they want to fulfill the goals of their organiza-

tion because this improves their professional prospects in the public or

private sector.4 In addition, by appearing competent, the bureaucrat can

                                                     5
guarantee his autonomy and independence.                 Armed with this premise,

we analyze both a normative and a positive model of task allocation.

In the former a social planner would optimally assign tasks in order to

maximize eﬃciency and by optimally using the diﬀerent incentives of bu-

reaucrats and politicians. In a positive model the politicians themselves

choose when to delegate and the opportunistic motivation of politicians

determines what is delegated. As we show below, the normative and

positive implications for task attribution do not coincide.

       We analyze many diﬀerent types of policies, trying to be reasonably

exhaustive. From a perspective of economic eﬃciency, politicians are

preferable for tasks that have the following features: i) diﬀerences in

performance are due to eﬀort, rather than individual talent or technical

ability; ii)the preferences of the public are unstable and uncertain, so

that flexibility is valuable, a case that may be especially relevant for
   4

ment and this leads them to internalize the goals of the organization, see the classic
treatment in Wilson (1989) especially Chapter 9.

       See Carpenter (2001) for a discussion of this point.



                                          4
changing and complex policy environments; iii) time inconsistency is

unlikely to be a relevant issue; iii) the nature of the polciy is such that

politicians cannot strategically distort policy choices in favor of short

term objectives and against long term welfare; iv) the stakes for orga-

nized interest groups are small, or the legal system is poorly designed

so that corruption is widespread; v) side payments to compensate the

losers are desirable and relevant, or bundling of diﬀerent aspects of policy

management and a comprehensive approach is important. The reverse

applies to the attribution of prerogatives to bureaucrats.

   When politicians (rather than social planners) choose what to del-

egate, the results are quite diﬀerent. Politicians want to retain those

tasks that are likely to generate large rents, large campaign contribu-

tion or bribes. They are instead more inclined to delegate tasks that are

”risky”, in the sense that they may lead to policy failures: blame shifting

to bureaucrats shields the politician from the risk. Politicians also never

delegate redistributive tasks, because those allow politicians to construct

winning coalitions of voters and lead more easily to electoral victory.

   A few examples may clarify some of our points. Monetary policy

involves fairly sophisticated skills, has relatively few distributional con-

sequences (compared to say to fiscal policy) and social preferences on

what is the appropriate goal of monetary policy are quite stable: at least



                                     5
ex-ante most people would agree that monetary policy ought to control

inflation with some room for output stabilization.6 Moreover, politi-

cians can blame (as they often do) the central bank for downturns in the

economy. Hence, delegation to an independent Central Bank seems de-

sirable and politically attractive. Incidentally, these arguments provide

a rationale for independent central bankers even for those who do not

believe that time inconsistency of monetary policy is a major problem,

such as Blinder (1999). On the contrary, foreign policy is an area where

it is very diﬃcult to describe ex ante reasonably precise and fixed policy

goals; in a changing world the preferences of the public may change sub-

stantially. Just think of how preferences for foreign policy changed in

the US before and after September 11, 2001. Hence, from a perspective

of economic eﬃciency, it should remain under political control. Finally,

much of fiscal policy has a redistributive nature and could be a source of

political rents. Our positive analysis predicts that politicians will prefer
  6
      Obviously monetary police has redistributive consequences as well

(think of debtor and creditors) but at least in recent decades the main

goal of monetary policy is inflation control and output stabilization.

Often the redistributive consequences of monetary policy are either un-

expected or a source of time inconsistency (think of devaluation of the

public debt).



                                     6
to maintain control over fiscal policy, as we normally observe in practice.

   Our paper is of course related to the vast political science literature

asking the positive question of why legislative powers are delegated in

practice, what the eﬀect of delegation is, the ”bureaucratic drift” etc.

- see Epstein and O’ Halloran (1999). This literature, mostly focused

on the US, is filled with interesting controversies. Some authors (Lowi

(1969) amongst others) argue that delegation is deleterious, an abdi-

cation of the legislators’ responsibility and a way of favoring special

interests (Stigler (1971)). Other authors (Mc Cubbins, Noll and Wein-

gast (1987, 1989)) instead claim that the legislators can, at least up to

a point, control the bureaucratic agencies by means of procedural rules.

Carpenter (2001) dissents and argues instead that the rise of the regu-

latory state has given a large latitude to many bureaucracies to decide

in addition to implement legislation.

   But then, if the control of politicians over bureaucrats is imperfect,

that is if the agencies can act following their own motivations, why

delegate at all? One answer is ”optimistic” and relates to the need

for division of labor, reduction of eﬀort for the legislators etc.. Others

are more cynical: Epstein and O’ Halloran (1999) argue that the type

of delegation chosen is the one that maximizes the benefits for elected

politicians rather than social welfare; this is precisely what we model



                                    7
in the positive part of our paper. Fiorina (1977) points out the blame

shifting role of delegation: politicians delegate to agencies in order to

blame them when things go badly and claim responsibility when success

occurs. We derive this result formally but we point out a trade oﬀ

between using bureaucrats as scapegoat and rent extraction.

    Our paper is also related to several recent contributions that have

investigated the role of career concerns rather than explicit contracts.

Dewatripont, Jewitt and Tirole (1999a,b) discuss the foundations of

this approach and apply it to study the behavior of government agen-

cies. They focus on some issues related to ours, namely the nature and

”fuzziness” of the agencies mission, but they do not contrast bureau-

cratic and political accountability. Dewatripont and Tirole (1999) study

the role of advocates that provide information and opinion to policy-

makers, and discuss how the career concerns of advocates may improve

policymaking. Maskin and Tirole (2001) investigate the attribution of

responsibilities between accountable and non accountable agents. The

latter have intrinsic motivations, while the former seek to please their

principals because of implicit rewards (career concerns). In our set up,

instead, we neglect the role of intrinsic motivations: both bureaucrats

and politicians need to be kept accountable with implicit incentives; but

the implicit incentive schemes can be of two kinds: those that define a



                                   8
politician (striving for re-election), and those that define a bureaucrat

(career concerns). Schultz (2003) contrasts direct democracy, represen-

tative democracy and bureaucratic delegation. Like Maskin and Tirole

(2001), he views bureaucrats as unaccountable and focuses on the trade-

oﬀ between ideological polarization and accountability: bureaucrats are

less polarized than partisan politicians, but are more inflexible since

they are unacountable and cannot be removed after shocks to the vot-

ers’ policy preferences. Besley and Gathak (2003) also study intrinsi-

cally motivated agents, and focus on how to combine intrinsic motiva-

tion with implicit rewards. Besley and Coate (2003) contrast appointed

and elected regulators of public utilities; both policymakers’ types are

intrinsically motivated, but direct election allows the voters to unbundle

policy issues.

   Another related question is that of privatization of government ac-

tivities. Hart, Shleifer and Vishny ((1997) in particular discuss when it

is preferable to delegate the provision of public goods to private enter-

prises and when to keep it under control of politicians. Issues regarding

incompleteness of the contract between politicians and private providers

have close analogies with some of the questions we address below.

   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the simplest

case of our model and justifies its assumptions. Sections 3 and 4 discuss



                                    9
cases of policies with a ”public good” nature and with no redistribution.

Section 5 reviews the role of bureaucrats in solving time inconsistency

problems and in keeping politicians’ short termism under control. Sec-

tions 6,7 and 8 deal with redistribution and with the role of organized

interest groups. Section 9 discusses the positive aspects of our model.

The last section concludes.

2       The Model

Consider a society that has to decide whether to assign a certain policy

to an elected oﬃcer or to a bureaucrat. With the generic term ”poli-

cymaker” we indicate who chooses policy, so he or she can be either a

politician or a bureaucrat. In the simplest possible case we consider a

single policy, the result of which is determined by the eﬀort put in by the

policymaker and by his ability. Thus, the policy outcome y is defined as

follows:

                                  y =θ+a                               (1)

where a represents the eﬀort of the policymaker and θ ∼ N(θ̄, σ 2θ ) is his

random ability. Ability and eﬀort are additive.7 Citizens care about the

policy outcome according to a well behaved, concave utility function,
    7
        Alternatively they could be multiplicative leading to more compli-

cated algebra but similar results. See Dewatripont, Jewitt and Tirole

(1999b).



                                     10
U(y). For the moment we consider linear preferences, U(y) = y, since

the strict concavity of the utility function does not aﬀect the nature

of the results and simply makes the notation more cumbersome. We

introduce strict concavity later when it matters.

   Eﬀort is costly, and the strictly convex and increasing cost is labelled

C(a). The reward for the policymaker is labelled R(a) and it diﬀers

depending on whether the policymaker is a politician or a bureaucrat.

Both of them maximize their utility defined as:


                              R(a) − C(a)                              (2)


with Ca > 0, Caa > 0 and R(a) to be defined below (subscripts denote

partial derivatives). Note that our model can be restated in terms of

rent extraction instead of eﬀort. That is define a = −r where r > 0

are rents and V (r) (with Vr > 0 Vrr < 0 ) as the utility of rents which

would be of course added to R(.). So every time we say below that the

policymakers ”chooses how much eﬀort to put in” we can reinterpret the

statement as choosing ”how much rent to extract.” The marginal cost

of eﬀort would then play the same role of the marginal benefit of rents

in the first order conditions. We mostly use the eﬀort terminology and

notation which is the one most commonly used in the career concern

literature.

   The timing is as follows. At the ”Constitutional Table” society

                                   11
chooses who has control rights over the policy (in the simplest case there

is only one, there will be multiple policies later). Then the policymaker

chooses eﬀort, a, before knowing his ability, θ. Finally nature chooses

θ, outcomes are observed and the reward is paid. Irrespective of who

has control rights, only the outcome y is observable by the principals,

not its composition between eﬀort and ability. Hence the agent’s reward

can only be based on the policy outcome, y. Note that control over a

policy con only be given either to a bureaucrat or to a politician: we do

not allow for joint control over policies, or for some checks and balances

between the two. We return to this issue below, in section 5.
2.1    The bureaucrat

We posit that bureaucrats are motivated by career concerns. That is,

they are concerned with the perception of their ability θ in the eyes of

those that may then promote them or oﬀer them alternative job oppor-

tunities in the private sector. Therefore the bureaucrat’s reward is (the

suﬃx B stands for Bureaucrat):


           RB (a) = E(E(θ | y)) = E(y − ae ) = E(θ + a − ae )         (3)


where ae is the public’s perception of a.

   Equilibrium behavior of the bureaucrat is obtained as follows. First,

compute the first order condition with respect to eﬀort, a, taking the

expected level of eﬀort ae as given. Then, impose the equilibrium re-

                                   12
quirement, that ae = a. By (3) and (2), we obtain:


                               1 = Ca (aB )                           (4)


where aB indicates the equilibrium eﬀort of the bureaucrat.

   How does this model of bureaucratic behavior diﬀer from that in-

duced by an optimal contract between the voters and the bureaucrat?

Section 1 of the appendix shows that, in this simple environment, it does

not diﬀer at all (except for the neglect of the bureaucrat’s participation

constraint, which throughout the paper we assume is always satisfied).

But as the policy environment gets more complicated, as in the follow-

ing sections, career concern incentives do diﬀer from those of an optimal

contract. Thus, our model of bureaucratic behavior contains some im-

plicit restrictions on the design of bureaucratic institutions. We are not

too apologetic about it, for two reasons. First, as a matter of fact,

bureaucrats are typically not motivated by sharp pecuniary incentives

and complicated contractual arrangements with society. As others have

argued before us, the implicit rewards and the contractual incomplete-

ness oﬀered by career concerns seem a better approximation of observed

arrangements, compared to the purified world of optimal contracts -

see Wilson (1989) and Dewatripont, Jewitt and Tirole (1999a,b). Sec-

ond, if indeed society could write unrestricted optimal contracts with

its policymakers, then the question of whether political or bureaucratic

                                   13
delegation is better for the voters would be utterly unininteresting, since

bureaucratic arrangements would always dominate.

2.2     The politician

The politicians’s goal is to be reelected and he accomplishes this goal if

y is above a threshold W. We do not allow any career concerns for the

politicians, other than to be reelected. Normalizing to 1 the benefits of

oﬃce holding we have (the suﬃx P stands for Politician):


                  RP (a) = Pr(y ≥ W ) = 1 − P (W − a)                  (5)


where P (W − a) = Pr(θ ≤ W − a). We impose rationality of the voters,

so that they expect that the alternative to reelecting the incumbent is

to get another one with average talent, who in equilibrium will put the

same amount of eﬀort as the current one. In fact every period is identical

and the politician’s eﬀort choice is made before he observes his talent.8
  8
      Note that the model could be easily generalized to several periods,

if the politician’s ability today is a signal of his ability tomorrow but

some random element of ability is present every period so that it can

never be fully learnt in advance. A widely studied case in the political

business ccycle literature is that of a MA (1) process for abiity. Persson

and Tabellini (2000) discuss the implications of this political model more

extensively.




                                    14
It follows that:

                                W = θ̄ + ae                             (6)

   With a normal distribution for θ, equilibrium eﬀort by the politician,

aP , is defined implicitly by the first order condition:


                              n(θ̄) = Ca (aP )                          (7)

                   √
where n(θ̄) = 1/σ θ 2π is the density of the normal distribution of θ

evaluated at its mean.

   How does the eﬀort of the politician compare with that of the bureau-

crat? Comparing (4) and (7), we see that the answer is ambiguous and

depends on parameters’ values. Note that aP > aB does not automati-

cally imply that the politician unambiguously dominates the bureaucrat

from the voters’ perspective, however. The reason is that the equilibrium

eﬀort of the bureaucrat here coincides with the first best. Hence, the

bureaucrat can be worse than the politician only if it earns rents (i.e., if

the bureaucrat’s participation constraint does not bind, as discussed in

section 1 of the appendix). In this case, and if political delegation does

not violate the incentive constraint, then whenever aP > aB the voters

are better oﬀ under the politician than under the bureaucrat.
2.3    Discussion

It is important to pause to discuss how these strawmen ”politicians” and

”bureaucrats” relate to real world cases. Probably the most compelling

                                     15
example of a ”bureaucrat” as modelled here is a Central Banker. His

incentives to fulfill his ask are mostly driven by the desire to appear

competent, even though even a Central Banker occasionally may bend

to the electoral needs of a ”politician”. Like our ”bureaucrat”, a Central

Banker sets policy without political interferences and his tasks are set by

a clear mandate to keep inflation low. An American President is instead

the quintessential example of a politician, seeking reelection for himself in

his first term and for his party in his second.9 The paper can be viewed

as asking the following questions: from the point of view of economic

eﬃciency, should institutional arrangements such as those relating to

monetary policy with an independent Central Bank be extended to other

areas of policymaking? And when are such arrangements likely to be

chosen by opportunistic politicians?

      In practice bureaucrats in charge of important agencies may be prepar-

ing a leap into politics, so they may worry about their popularity and

not only their competence per se. On the contrary, politicians may look

ahead to a career in the private sector. While these caveats point to a

large gray area and intermediate cases between our ”politician” and our
  9
      See Alesina and Spear (1988) for a formal discussion of how a party

may create incentive for a second year President to behave as if he were

interested in reelection and avoid a ”last period” problem.



                                     16
”bureaucrat”, it is useful as a first step to clearly identify how career

concerns and electoral incentives lead to diﬀerent result depending on

the nature of the policy in question.

3    Imperfect monitoring

We now move to the case of imperfect monitoring, that is a situation in

which performance is not perfectly observable. Thus, we add noise, ε,

besides talent (θ) and eﬀort (a) :


                              y =θ+ε+a


with ε ∼ N(0, σ 2ε ), uncorrelated with θ and unobservable. Only perfor-

mance y is observed and can be the basis of rewards.

    In this case the reward for bureaucrats can be rewritten as:


           RB (a) = E(E(θ | y)) = θ̄ + βE(θ + ε + a − ae − θ̄)         (8)


where β = σ2θ /(σ 2θ + σ 2ε ) < 1. Given our assumption of normality of the

distributions, we obtain a well known signal extraction result. Now the

perception of talent is ”discounted” by a term β which reflects the signal

to noise ratio. In equilibrium the choice of the bureaucrat is given by:


                               β = Ca (aB )                            (9)


Not surprisingly, the bureaucrat puts in less eﬀort the lower is the signal

to noise ratio.

                                     17
   Note that, with imperfect monitoring, the career concern contract no

longer induces the optimal amount of eﬀort. Given risk neutrality, the

optimal contract (under the assumption that the principal only observes

y) would still induce the same amount of eﬀort as in (4) above - see also

section 1 of the appendix. That is, imperfect monitoring would not add

any distortions. But if the bureaucrat can only be rewarded implicitly

through career concerns, as we assume, then imperfect monitoring entails

a loss of welfare for the voters.

   We now turn to political delegation. The politician’s reward is given

by the same expression as above, except that now the distribution from

which the probability Pr(y ≥ W ) can be computed has a larger variance,

that reflects both the variance of θ and of ε. It is immediate to derive

the first order condition of the politician as follows:


                             n(θ̄, 0) = Ca (aP )

                    p           √
where n(θ̄, 0) = 1/( σ 2θ + σ 2ε 2π) is the density of the random variable

θ + ε, evaluated at the mean of both θ and ε.

   We are now ready to establish the following


 Proposition 1 The comparison between aP and aB is ambiguous. Im-

      perfect monitoring (high σ 2ε ) reduces eﬀort for both types of policy-

      makers. Higher σ 2θ increases aB but decreases aP .


                                     18
      Therefore, less monitoring does not favor one or the other type of

policymakers. This result is related to those obtained by Dewatripont,

Jewitt and Tirole (1999b), who also point out that performance less

closely tied to talent or eﬀort weakens the incentives of agents motivated

by career concerns. But note that the same conclusions also apply to

a politician. Hence, imperfect monitoring reduces the performance of

both policymaker types (relative to an optimal contract), but it does

not provide an argument for preferring a politician to a bureaucrat at

the constitutional stage.

      More uncertainty about the policymaker ability, however, does fa-

vor the bureaucrat over the politician. With imperfect monitoring a

larger variance of θ actually increases eﬀort of the bureaucrat, while

it has the opposite eﬀect on the politician. Intuitively, an increase in

the variance of θ increases the signal-to-noise ratio and implies that ob-

served performance (y) is a better indicator of ability (θ). This makes

the bureaucrat work harder, since by assumption he fully internalizes the

benefit of higher expected ability.10 The politician, instead, only wants
 10
      Here the bureaucrat is risk neutral, which means that his compensa-

tion is a linear function of expected ability (conditional on performance).

A risk averse bureaucrat would put in even more eﬀort with more un-

certainty over θ, if his marginal utility was convex (eg. with iso-elastic

utility function, as in the literature on precautionary savings). This

                                    19
to overcome the re-election threshold (giving the voters more than their

reservation utility is a waste). If ability is more uncertain (if σ 2θ is high),

then re-election prospects are less sensitive to eﬀort, since more of the

policy outcome is due to randomness. Hence his incentives are weakened.

   This result has a practical and sensible implication: bureaucrats are

better than politicians in tasks requiring special abilities or technical

competence, that not everyone is likely to have. The reason is not that

bureaucrats are more gifted than politicians, but rather that they have

stronger incentives to pretend that they are gifted.11 This implication is

strengthened if evaluating the performance of a bureaucrat also requires
would further increase his attractiveness relative to the politician. But

the opposite would be true if the bureacrat’s marginal utility was con-

cave (in this case more uncertainty over θ could weaken the bureaucrat

incentives, if the eﬀect on marginal utility outweighs the eﬀect on the

signal to noise ratio).
  11
     This result would be reinforced if the extent to which bureaucratic

ability is rewarded was also allowed to vary. Tasks where technical abil-

ities matter more are also those for which rewards for ability are higher.

For instance, being a good central banker also entails ability in fore-

casting; if this talent is highly rewarded in the market place, this is an

additional reason to delegate monetary policy to a bureaucrat (since it

gives a stronger incentive to appear a talented bureaucrat).


                                      20
special technical abilities - that is, if the extent of imperfect monitoring

also depends on who does the monitoring. In the case of politicians, the

ultimate judges of performance are the voters at large. The performance

of bureaucrats, instead, is mainly evaluated by their professional peers.

Hence, imperfect monitoring is less of a problem if politicians are given

simple tasks, since bureaucrats can more easily be held accountable by

their peers for more technically demanding tasks. Maskin and Tirole

(2001) and Epstein and O’ Halloran (1999) reach a similar conclusion in

diﬀerent models.

4         Policy tasks in an uncertain world

We now add an element of uncertainty in tasks. In particular, suppose

that at the Constitutional Table voters are not sure of how their pref-

erences will evolve. We return to the case of perfect monitoring and we

assume that there are two possible policies, that is two diﬀerent direc-

tions in which eﬀort can be devoted to: yi = θ + ai , with i = 1, 2.12

         With multiple tasks, which will be our focus from now on, one

needs to specify a general cost function with multiple arguments, C =
    12
         For a general discussion of multi task functions in a principal- agent

relationship see Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991). They analyze situa-

tions in which incentive schemes need to account for the optimal alloca-

tion of eﬀort in diﬀerent tasks.



                                        21
C(a1 , a2 ). Instead of using the general formulation, we simplify to ei-

ther an additive case (C = C(a1 + a2 ), where eﬀort in the various tasks

is perfectly substitutable in the cost function, or to a separable case

(C = C(a1 ) + C(a2 )), where the marginal cost of eﬀort in one task

is totally independent of eﬀort devoted to the other tasks. We choose

the simplest formulation that does not produce knife-hedge or ”trivial”

results. The more general specification of costs generates qualitatively

similar results. We begin in this section by considering additive costs,

so that C = C(a1 + a2 ).

   At the Constitutional Table the (identical) voters are uncertain about

their ex post preferences over alternative policies, so that voters utility

is now given by the following concave function:


                           U(λy1 + (1 − λ)y2 )                        (10)


with λ = 1 with probability q > 1/2, λ = 0 with probability (1 − q).

Thus, society does not know ex ante what it will like ex post; but there

is no disagreement ex post amongst members of society. Disagreements

and redistribution will be analyzed below. The timing is now as follows.

First, at the Constitutional Table the voters choose whether to assign

this policy to a bureaucrat or to a politician, then nature chooses λ,

that is social preferences are determined. Then the policymaker chooses

[ai ] , then nature chooses θ, and finally policy is determined and rewards

                                    22
paid. We assume that λ is observable but not verifiable.13

      Choosing a non-elected bureaucrat means that voters decide at the

Constitutional Table to assign a task to the bureaucrat. Given that at

the Constitutional Table preferences are not yet known, one can only

assign to the bureaucrat an unconditional task defined as follows:


                            y = δy1 + (1 − δ)y2                       (11)


where δ is a parameter specified by the Constitution. A crucial assump-

tion is that the parameter δ cannot be contingent on the realization of

the random variable λ : the mission for the bureaucrat cannot be con-

tingent on the realization of ex post voters’ preferences. This element

of contract incompleteness is plausible: A bureaucrat is somebody who

is not appointed through the political process, and therefore he will not

follow the ebb and flows of changing voters’ preferences. The indepen-

dence of the Central Bank, for instance, means that the central banker

does not have to respond to the voters or even their representatives for

his policy choices, other than for how he fulfills the goals assigned by

the law to the central bank. But these goals can only be formulated in

a simple and general way, like keep inflation under control; the central
 13
      Aghion Alesina and Trebbi (2002) also study of constitutional design

in a case in which social preferences are not fully revealed ex ante. Their

model and their emphasis is however quite diﬀerent.

                                    23
bank objectives cannot be changed with electoral results, or with the

stage of the business cycle.14

      Under these assumptions, the rewards of the bureaucrats are:


  RB (a) = E(E(θ | y)) = E(θ + δa1 + (1 − δ)a2 − δae1 − (1 − δ)ae2 ) (12)


Given additive costs and q > 1/2, it is optimal to set δ = 1.15 The first

order conditions for the bureaucrat imply:


                          aB    −1
                           1 = Ca (1),        aB
                                               2 = 0                     (13)


That is the bureaucrat focuses all his eﬀort on the ”main” activity of his

mandate because that is more helpful in signaling his ability. Thus, the

voters’ utility in equilibrium is given by:


                     U B = qEU (θ + aB
                                     1 ) + (1 − q)EU(θ)                  (14)


The key here is that by choosing a bureaucrat who is non responsive to

the ebb and flows of society’s preferences, citizens are ”stuck” with the
 14
      See Alesina and Gatti (1995) for an explicit discussion of insulation of

the missions assigned to the central bank form changes in the preferences

of the electorate.
  15
     If costs were separable, then the optimal δ would be increasing with

q, at a rate that is decreasing with the curvature of U (.) for obvious

reason having to do with risk aversion. The qualitative nature of our

result would not change.

                                      24
risk that eﬀort is misallocated and the bureaucrat pursues the wrong

goals, those that ex-ante seem more likely to be relevant.

   This is what diﬀerentiates the politician from the bureaucrat. The

politician’s goals always depend on the realization of λ (i.e., on the

preferences of the voters). Thus, knowing λ the politician will devote

eﬀort only to the task preferred ex post by the voters according to a first

order condition similar to (7) above. The following proposition follows.


 Proposition 2 The politician always chooses the right task from the

      voters’ perspective. This advantage of the politician is more im-

      portant the more risk averse are the voters and the more uncertain

      are their ex-post preferences.


   Delegation to bureaucrats is safe when society’s preferences are well

known and stable. But when they change, the ”rigidity” of a bureau-

crat’s behavior makes the latter much less attractive. This helps us to

understand why monetary policy is often delegated to an independent

central bank, while foreign policy is typically under the control of politi-

cians. Few would disagree with the statement that the appropriate goal

for monetary policy is to keep inflation under control with some room

for stabilization policy; and this goal is unlikely to change over time.

But preferences regarding foreign policy are unlikely to be stable and

unchanged, and as a result an appropriate simple bureaucratic goal can-

                                       25
not be stated once and for all. The politician, instead, always finds it

optimal to follow the ebbs and flows of voters’ preferences. In a changing

world, this feature of political accountability may be superior to a fixed

and unchangeable bureaucratic mission. This is consistent with Wilson’s

(1989) view that it would be impossible to delegate foreign policy to a

non political agency because it would be too complicated to specify tasks

in such an area of policymaking so much aﬀected by unexpected contin-

gencies. Hart, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) make a similar argument to

clarify why it would be close to impossible to privatize foreign policy.

   In these situations, a combination of politicians and bureaucrats

could be welfare improving. In fact, a natural remedy to the ”narrow-

mindedness” of bureaucrats pursuing the wrong task is to let the politi-

cian decide the mission of the bureaucrat. Specifically, the constitution

could prescribe that policy be delegated to a bureaucrat, but the bureau-

crat’s mission (the parameter δ in (11) above) be chosen by a politician.

If the politician observes the contingency λ and if he is held accountable

by the voters as described in the previous section, he would always choose

the socially optimal mission for the bureaucrat. This division of tasks

(the politician assigns the bureaucrat some goals and the latter chooses

the instruments with which to pursue them) is observed in a variety of

real world arrangements. An example is the inflation targeting regime



                                   26
in the UK, where the government periodically assigns an inflation target

to the Bank of England and then it does not interfere with the central

bank decisions of how to pursue that target. Of course, the precision and

frequency with which the goals of the bureaucrat are defined can vary

from case to case, and determine the extent to which an independent

bureaucrat is really in charge of policy decisions, (rather than taking or-

ders from the politician). In some cases it may be impossible to delegate

in any meaningful way simply because the contingencies to specify in

the principal agent relationship between politician and bureaucrats are

simply too complex.

5    Time inconsistency

The benefit of flexibility associated with political delegation has a cost,

when society’s preferences are time inconsistent. The rigidity of bu-

reaucratic control, instead, oﬀers protection against time inconsistency.

Delegation to an independent agency to gain credibility is extensively

used in monetary policy (as captured by Rogoﬀ (1985)). Our model

oﬀers a diﬀerent formalization of this point.

    Suppose, again, that there are two tasks, i = 1, 2, say fighting un-

employment (task 1) and fighting inflation (task 2). Citizens care about

both tasks, with simple linear preferences:


                           U (y1 , y2 ) = y1 + y2                     (15)

                                    27
Eﬀective inflation control depends on the policymaker’s eﬀort and ability,

y2 = θ + a2 . But equilibrium unemployment also depends on unexpected

inflation, ae2 . Specifically, suppose that the policy outcome in task 1

(fighting unemployment) is given by:


                          y1 = θ + a1 − (a2 − ae2 )                     (16)


Thus, low unemployment is brought about by ability and eﬀort in choos-

ing the right labor market policies (a1 +θ), but it is also facilitated by an

unexpectedly high level of inflation. Other examples can be thought, but

whatever the precise economic interpretation, in this model the final out-

come depends on the interaction between the policymakers’ decisions and

the private sector expectations, and this creates a time inconsistency.

   Suppose throughout that policy commitments are unavailable, mean-

ing that first private expectations are formed, and then eﬀort in both

tasks, a1 and a2 , are chosen. One can show (see the Appendix for the

derivation) that politicians are much more likely to fall into the traps of

time inconsistency, compared to bureaucrats. The goals of a politician

are unavoidably linked to the ex-post welfare of voters, through reelec-

tion motives. The bureaucrat instead can be given an explicit mission,

possibly diﬀerent from whatever is ex-post optimal for the voters. This

possibility of strategic delegation enables society to overcome credibil-

ity problems. This conclusion is essentially the same as Rogoﬀ (1985).

                                     28
But our framework shows more clearly another benefit of bureaucratic

delegation: it allows separation of tasks. By holding the central bank

accountable only for inflation, and by giving the politician the responsi-

bility to fight unemployment, the time inconsistency no longer distorts

the policymakers’ incentives. In the Appendix we show more precisely

the following:


 Proposition 3 Under time inconsistency, the bureaucrat generally does

        better than the politician, for two reasons: first, the mission of a

        bureaucrat can be narrowly defined to avoid time inconsistent goals;

        second, even if this cannot be achieved because tasks cannot be split

        among separate agencies, the mission of a bureaucrat can be defined

        strategically to influence private sector expectations, irrespective of

        what is ex-post optimal for society.


      A related issue has to do with the time dimension of the flow of costs

and benefits of diﬀerent policy tasks.16 Bureaucrats tend to care more

about the long run consequences of policies, compared to politicians,

for two reasons. First, often bureaucrats are appointed for longer than
 16
      Rogoﬀ (1990), Rogoﬀ and Sibert (1988) and Persson and Tabellini

(1990 and 2000) model myopic electoral cycles in monetary and fiscal

policy with rational voters.




                                       29
electoral cycles, precisely to avoid short termist policies.17 Second, even

when bureaucrats have short terms of oﬃce, the blame for myopic poli-

cies may reach them and hurt them later on. This gives bureaucrats a

strong incentive to focus on the long term goal. A politician instead is

often interested in winning the next elections and is less worried about

repercussions later on in his career. In future elections the main issues

at hand may be diﬀerent and the voters may forget past policy mistakes.

Thus, there is an argument for assigning to bureaucrats policy tasks that

imply short term costs and/or delayed benefits.18

      When the short termism of politicians is an issue, the interaction

between bureaucrats and politicians can yield welfare improvements. To

achieve this, we don’t need to put the bureaucrat in charge of policy

decisions. It is enough that he knows something about what the politi-

cian is doing and acts as a watchdog, conveying his information to the

      Long terms of oﬃce for the Chairman of the Central Bank are con-

sidered a necessary tool to insure independence and a long term horizon

in the conduct of monetary policy.
  18
     Besley and Coate (2003) find evidence that, in US states, elected

regulators tend to keep lower electricity prices compared to appointed

regulators. If, as likely, lower prices come at the expenses of lower in-

vestments, this finding is consistent with the prediction of short-termism

by elected (as opposed to appointed) regulators.


                                    30
voters. The voters’ behavior will then endogenously adjust to induce an

opportunistic politician to pursue long term goals. In our framework,

the voters do not deliberately punish the politician if he acts myopically.

But they do so indirectly, when they exploit the bureaucrat announce-

ment to better understand what the politician is really doing and use

this information to reappoint the incumbent only if he is competent

enough.19

      Watchdogs of this type are especially useful to check the govern-

ment budget. Issues of creative accounting, or unsustainable fiscal policy

”hiding” mounting deficits in the social security account, are common

examples of short termist behavior that could be flagged by watchdogs.

The Stability and Growth Pact, which puts limits on budget deficits of

governments of the European Union and is ”enforced” by the EU Com-

mission, exploits this role of bureaucrats. Even though national gov-

ernments may have violated the deficit ceilings without incurring in the

fines envisaged by the Pact, the bureaucrats’ indications of a violation

has raised the voters’ attention to issues of excessive deficits. European

bureaucrats do not control national deficits, but by raising ”flags” they

nevertheless exert a strong influence on national policies.
 19
      In a previous version of this paper we work out this argument more

formally. The derivation is available from the authors.



                                    31
6    Lobbying and bribing

We now turn to policies which imply conflicts amongst diﬀerent mem-

bers of society, broadly speaking redistributive policies with winners and

losers. In this section we consider the case of lobbies that can influence

the choice of policies with bribes or campaign contributions. Thus here

”redistribution” is intended as favors towards powerful minorities. The

minority will seek to influence policy decisions to obtain favors. Both

the politician and the bureaucrat can be captured by the interest group,

but with diﬀerent mechanisms. This diﬀerence can give raise to a consti-

tutional preference for one or the other type of policymaker, depending

on the circumstances.

    There are two tasks, i = 1, 2, both aﬀected linearly by eﬀort and

ability, with no spillover eﬀects across tasks: yi = θ + ai . The cost of

eﬀort is non-separable: C = C(a1 + a2 ). Task 1 benefits the voters at

large, while task 2 only benefits a small but organized interest group.

Voters influence policy only through elections. The organized interest

group can influence policy either through bribes, b, or through campaign

contributions, f . Thus, the preferences of voters are just y1 , while those

of the interest group can be written as:


                            (1 + γ)y2 − b − f                          (17)


where γ is a parameter capturing the intensity of the group’s preferences

                                    32
for task 2.

   Bribes can be oﬀered to both the politician and the bureaucrat, but

are illegal. Thus, if a policymaker accepts a bribe, with some exogenous

probability q he is caught and pays a fine Z (the interest group is not

fined). Campaign contributions are legal and can only be oﬀered to the

politician. The eﬀect of campaign contributions is to increase the incum-

bent’s chances of winning the elections. We model this by saying that

the voters’ reservation utility is a decreasing function of the campaign

contributions collected by the incumbent:


                          W = θ̄ + ae1 − H(f )                      (18)


where the function H(.) captures the eﬀect of campaign contributions.

It is natural to assume that H(0) = 0, Hf > 0, Hf f < 0. Note that we

are assuming that the lobby group is very small and therefore irrelevant

from a vote counting point of view. Under these assumptions, we can

write the policymaker’s preferences as:


                R(y1 , y2 ) − C(a1 + a2 ) + (1 − φ)b − qZ           (19)


where R(y1 , y2 ) are the policymaker’s rewards (RB (y1 , y2 ) = E(θ/y1 )

for the bureaucrat, RP (y1 , y2 ) = Pr(y1 ≥ W ) for the politician), and

1 > φ > 0 denotes transaction costs that reduce the value of the bribe

for the recipient relative to the amount paid by the interest group. The

                                   33
policymaker’s eﬀort devoted to task 2 is observable by the interest group,

so that bribes and campaign contributions can be contingent upon the

policymaker eﬀort: b = B(a2 ), f = F (a2 ). The timing of events is as fol-

lows. First the Constitution allocates control rights over policies. Then

the organized group commits to bribes and or campaign contributions,

as a function of eﬀort. Next, the policymaker allocates eﬀort between

the two tasks. Nature then chooses a realization of θ. Finally, rewards

are paid.

   This is a common agency game, with two types of principals: the in-

terest group and the representative voter. The interest group has all the

commitment power and can either influence the agent directly (through

bribes), or indirectly (through campaign contributions). The distinc-

tion between the politician and the bureaucrat is that the latter can

only be influenced by the interest group through bribes. We want to

know whether the voters are better oﬀ with the bureaucrat or with the

politician, and what influences this comparison.

6.1    Bribing the bureaucrat

If the constitution gave all control rights to the bureaucrat we would

have a standard common agency game, with a single active lobby. If

bribes are positive, then the equilibrium must be jointly optimal for the




                                    34
organized group and the politician. This immediately implies:


                        aB
                         1 = 0,      aB    −1
                                      2 = Ca (1 + γ)                   (20)


       Moreover, restricting attention to truthful contribution (here brib-

ing) schedules, the equilibrium bribing schedule has the following simple

form:20
                                            1+γ
                            B(a2 ) = B̄ +       a2                     (21)
                                            1−φ

where the constant B̄ is chosen by the organized group so as to leave the

bureaucrat indiﬀerent between accepting or rejecting the bribe. Given

the bureaucrat’s preferences, this implies:


                 B̄ = C(aB        B      B           B
                         2 ) − C(a1 ) + a1 − (1 + γ)a2 + q̄Z           (22)


where aB    −1
       1 = Ca (1) denotes the equilibrium policy if no bribe is accepted.


       Finally, the organized group must also prefer to pay the bribe rather

than be passive. This in turn puts an upper bound on the constant B̄

that the organized interest group is willing to pay. Taking into account

(22), an equilibrium with positive bribes exists only if the following con-

dition is satisfied:

              (1 − 2φ)(1 + γ) B £                      ¤
                             a2 − C(aB        B      B
                                     2 ) − C(a1 ) + a1 ≥ q̄Z           (23)
                   1−φ

If instead this condition is violated, then the equilibrium with the bu-

reaucrat delivers the optimal policy for the voters. Equation (23) makes

       See Grossman and Helpman (2001).

                                      35
it clear that an equilibrium in which the bureaucrat is bribed is more

likely if the stakes for the organized group are high (γ is large), or if the

legal system works poorly (qZ and φ are small).

6.2    Lobbying the politicians

Next, suppose that the politician is in charge of the policy decision. A

condition very similar to (23) above determines the existence of an equi-

librium with bribes (the expression is not identical because the politi-

cian’s reward occurs through reappointment). In particular, it remains

true that bribes would be zero if the legal system is strong, so that trans-

action costs are high or the probability of being caught is high. But now,

besides bribes, the organized interest group can also resort to campaign

contributions.     He will choose to do so if campaign contributions are

suﬃciently eﬀective in swaying the voters.

   Specifically, in an equilibrium with campaign contributions, the allo-

cation of eﬀort must be jointly optimal for the politician and the orga-

nized group. Thus, the equilibrium must solve the following optimization

problem by choice of a1, a2 and f, subject to non-negativity constraints

on the three choice variables, and taking voters’ expectations ae1 as given,

as before.

  Max        Pr(θ ≥ θ̄ + ae1 − a1 − H(f )) + (1 + γ)a2 − C(a1 + a2 ) − f

                                      36
   The properties of the solution to this problem depend on the slope

of the function H(f ), i.e., on how eﬀective campaign contributions are

in swaying the voters. In the Appendix we consider two cases:

   First, if Hf (0) < 1/(1 + γ), then the equilibrium has zero lobbying

(f = 0) and the outcome is optimal for the voters (aP2 = 0). In this case,

campaign contributions cannot be productive enough, and the organized

group will not seek to influence the politician: the group’s stakes are

too low relative to how much he would have to pay into the electoral

campaign of the politician.

   The opposite extreme occurs if Hf (f ∗ ) > 1/(1 + γ), where f ∗ de-

notes equilibrium campaign contributions, to be defined below. In this

case, campaign contributions are very eﬀective at the margin. Eﬀort

is allocated so as to please only the organized group, as in (20) above.

And equilibrium campaign contributions are defined implicitly by the

optimality condition:


                        n(θ̄ − H(f ∗ )) · Hf (f ∗ ) = 1                 (25)


where n(x) is the normal density of θ evaluated at the point x. For this

to be an equilibrium, the organized group must benefit relative to the

option of not lobbying at all, and this also requires: (1 + γ)aP2 ≥ f ∗ .

   We summarize this discussion in the following:


 Proposition 4 Political lobbying can be an equilibrium, even if bribes

                                      37
        to the bureaucrat are not. This is more likely if campaign contri-

        butions are eﬀective in influencing the voters, but the legal system

        is strong and eﬀective in discouraging bribes.


      Thus, politically appointed policymakers are more easily captured by

organized interests compared to bureaucrats, particularly in advanced

democracies with a well functioning legal system. The reason is that,

to influence a politician, the interest group needs to convince the voters

that the politician is doing a good job and deserves to be reelected. The

politician will then automatically respond with policy favors to the in-

terest group, since this will help his chances of reelection. To influence

a bureaucrat, instead, the organized group needs to engage in illegal or

semi-legal activities, and fight against possibly deeply entrenched pro-

fessional goals and standards of a technical bureaucracy. Policies where

the stakes for organized interests are very high, or where redistributive

conflicts concern small but powerful vested interests against the voters

at large, may thus be more safely left in the hands of the bureaucrat.

The regulation of public utilities is a typical example: the long run in-

terests of consumers are easy to identify and the stakes for the utilities’

supplier are very high, so that a politician may be more easily captured

than an independent regulator.21
 21
      This eﬃciency argument in favor of bureaucrats is mitigated if they


                                     38
    Note that this result points to an important diﬀerence between ad-

vanced and less advanced societies. In advanced societies with a well

functioning judicial system, it is relatively easy to enforce the no bribe

equilibrium, but campaign contributions may still be very eﬀective at

buying policies; hence, bureaucratic delegation works well. In develop-

ing countries, instead, stopping bribes might be close to impossible and

politicians are likely to do as good a job as bureaucrats.22

7    Compensation of losers

One critical task for politicians is to form coalitions in favor of certain

policies, compensating losers either with direct transfers or by bundling

several policies into one package. To illustrate this point, we need a

conflict of interest between voters (or groups of voters) and the possibility

of side payments and of bundling policies with complementarities.

    Voters’ utility now depends on the policy outcome and the transfer

(positive or negative) received by the government. We have two voters

(or homogeneous groups of voters of equal size) with concave utility
are easier to bribe than the politician., however. And bureaucrats with

technical expertise may be more easily bribed than politicians through

a "revolving door policy" - i.e. at the end of their public services poli-

cymakers are oﬀered lucrative jobs in the private sector.
  22
     Glaser and Shleifer (2003) reach a similar conclusion, using a diﬀer-

ent analytical framework.


                                     39
defined over private consumption, U(ci ), i = 1, 2 and where:



             c1 = y1 + t,      c2 = y2 − t,       y2 ≥ t ≥ −y1           (26)

Therefore t is a direct lump sum transfer between voters and the gov-

ernment budget is balanced; there are no tax distortions. Each group

benefits from diﬀerent tasks requiring specific and uncorrelated abilities,

θi , i = 1, 2. Let the distribution of θi have the same densities n(.) and cu-

mulative distributions N(.) (not necessarily normal). There are random

negative spillovers between the two tasks, such that:


          y1 = θ1 + a1 − λκa2 ,        y2 = θ2 + a2 − (1 − λ)κa1         (27)


The parameter 0 < κ < 1 denotes the strength of the negative spillover

eﬀects. Who is hurt by the spillovers is ex ante uncertain. Thus, λ is

a random variable that can equal 1 or 0 with equal probabilities. As

in section 4, we assume that λ is observable but it is not verifiable, so

that the bureaucrat’s mission cannot be defined contingent on λ. Thus,

the policymaker maximizes its usual payoﬀs, with diﬀerent rewards for

the two types of policymakers, except that now we assume that the cost

function is additive in the two eﬀorts:



                        R(a1 , a2 ) − C(a1 ) − C(a2 )                    (28)



                                     40
   Timing has the usual structure. First nature sets λ and this deter-

mines which group is hurt by the spillover eﬀect. Then the policymaker

chooses ai and t, nature sets θi and rewards are paid.

   Consider the politician first. He maximizes reelection probabilities,

which means that he has to win the favor of a strict majority of voters.

Here this means winning the votes of both groups (as it will be clear be-

low, nothing of substance hinges on the fact that in this simple example

reelection requires pleasing all voters). Therefore:


          RP (a1 , a2 ) = Pr ob(U(c1 ) 1 W1 ) ∗ Pr ob(U (c2 ) 1 W2 )    (29)


where Wi is the reservation utility of group i.

   Suppose for concreteness that λ = 1. If the two reservation utilities

are equal, then the politician sets transfers t so that:

                           n(x1 )       n(x2 )
                                    =                                   (30)
                         1 − N(x1 )   1 − N(x2 )

where x1 = U −1 (W )−t−a1 +κa2 and x2 = U −1 (W )+t−a2 . That is, the

politician equalizes the ”hazard rates” of losing votes from either group.

In this context, the hazard rate measures the elasticity of the probability

of winning with respect to transfers. Thus, this optimality condition is

similar to the Ramsey rule of optimal taxation: transfers are allocated

between groups so as to equalize this elasticity across groups.        If the

hazard rate is monotonically increasing in x, and given the assumption

                                     41
of the same distribution for θi , i = 1, 2, equation (30) implies c1 = c2 .23

That is, the politician implements full insurance, fully compensating

the losers from the negative externality (remember that compensations

are costless, if they entailed a transaction cost or a tax distortion the

equalization of utilities would no be complete).

       Exploiting (30), the optimality conditions for the allocation of eﬀort

to the two tasks imply:


                                 n(1 − N2 ) = Ca (aP1 )                 (31)

                          n(1 − N1 )(1 − κ) = Ca (aP2 )


Thus, the politician allocates eﬀort ”correctly”, in the sense of devoting

more eﬀort to the task that does not have negative spillovers: aP1 > aP2

if λ = 1. Comparing (31) with (7) in section 2, however, we see that the

politician is induced to put less eﬀort also in the task with no negative

externality (task 1), relative to the simple case of only one task. The

reason is that bundling of two tasks requiring diﬀerent abilities weakens

his incentives. His likelihood of reelection now depends on his success in

both tasks. Even if he puts a lot of eﬀort in task 1, he could still loose

the election because he happens to be unable in task 2. His awareness

of this risk (captured by the term (1 − N2 ) on the left hand side of (31)),
  23
       A uniform distribution of θ satisfies the assumption of a monotoni-

cally increasing hazard rate, for instance.

                                       42
dilutes his incentives.24

       Let’s now turn to the bureaucrat. By assumption, the measure of

performance that he is assigned (and on the basis of which is career-

incentives are determined) cannot be contingent on λ and has to be

stated at the Constitutional Table. The natural measure of performance

in this context is total output, (y1 +y2 ). If given this goal, the bureaucrat

allocates eﬀort eﬃciently, taking the negative externality into account:


                                   1 = Ca (aB
                                            1)                           (32)

                               1 − κ = Ca (aB
                                            2)



Nevertheless, compensating transfers will be set to zero.25

       Comparing the politician and the bureaucrat, we thus have:


Proposition 5 The politician provides side payment to compensate losers

but has weaker incentives than the bureaucrat; the latter, however, does

not compensate losers.
  24
       Persson and Tabellini (2000) and Seabright (1996) elaborate further

on this point comparing centralized vs decentralized arrangements.
  25
     Implicitly, therefore, we are also assuming that social welfare

(U (c1 ) + U(c2 )) cannot be specified as the bureaucrats’ mission because

it is too vague a concept, or cannot be observed by outsiders to infer the

bureaucrats’ talent.



                                     43
   This result relies on the fact that bureaucrats cannot be given state

contingent missions, and if their goal is formulated in terms of aggre-

gate eﬃciency, they will neglect the distributional consequences of their

actions. A politician instead can take advantage of relatively complex

and evolving spillovers between issues and build majorities with com-

plex side payments schemes. Compensating the losers makes it easier

to pass legislation while at the same time providing insurance against

bad luck. Imagine a policy that favors a large majority, say a badly

needed highway, but that creates losers, say the property owners. Under

democratic choice, the losers might be able to block the project. But the

politician can put together a package of compensation for the property

owners, with large benefit for the majority. In a sense this is almost

what describes the job of a politician. Instead, it is hard to imagine how

a bureaucrat might do that. How can one write on paper what a bureau-

crat is allowed to do or not do, to create bundling and compensation? A

bureaucrat can be delegated the task of building the best possible high-

way and he may potentially do a better job than the politician; but he

may not have the ability, interest or authority to provide compensation

to the local owners. Note also that ”writing some checks” to compensate

groups of losers does not require any particular technical competence,

another reason why it may be diﬃcult to generate the correct incentives



                                   44
for career-concerned bureaucrats. This observation leads us directly into

the next section.

8    Splitting the cake

We now consider a purely redistributive policy, ”cake splitting”. Con-

sider three voters, the minimum number required to make the problem

interesting. The policy task delivers a ”cake” that can be divided be-

tween the three voters, therefore:



                         y = θ + a = c1 + c2 + c3                       (33)

The utility function of the voters is concave, U (cJ ), J = 1, 2, 3. We start

with risk neutrality, U(cJ ) = cJ , and comment below on how the results

would change with risk averse voters.

    The key diﬀerence between a politician and a bureaucrat is, once

again, that the former needs a majority to win and the latter simply

wants to signal talent. Consider the bureaucrat first. At the constitu-

tional stage, the bureaucrat can either be given no redistributive tasks,

in which case redistribution is entirely arbitrary - we call this an "unfair"

bureaucrat. Alternatively, behind a veil of ignorance he can be assigned

the task of redistributing equally, that is y/3 for all three voters - we

refer to this case as a "fair" bureaucrat. But irrespective of whether he

is ”fair” or "unfair" (i.e., of how he splits the cake), his talent is still


                                     45
judged by the aggregate measure of performance, y, not by how he re-

distributes. His first order conditions are thus identical to those in (4),

section 2.

   Next, consider the politician. Since he only needs to please a ma-

jority, he gives y/2 to two voters and zero to the third one. Hence, his

reward is:

                        RP (a) = Pr ob(y/2 ≥ W )                       (34)

where W is the reservation utility of individual voters. Implicit in (34) is

the assumption that voters expect that the incumbent, if re-elected, will

maintain the same redistribution observed today - i.e he will split the

cake in half between the voters who re-elect him. With forward looking

and rational voters, W equals the average expected utility they can get if

the opponent is elected. If the hypothetical redistribution implemented

by the opponent is unknown, then W = 1/3(θ + ae ). Going through the

usual steps, of maximizing with respect to eﬀort for given expectations

and then imposing rational expectations, in equilibrium the politician’s

optimality condition implies:
                           µ          ¶
                           2θ − aP
                         n                = Ca (aP )                   (35)
                              3

where n(x) denotes the normal density evaluated at the point x. Com-

paring (35) with (7) in section 2, we see that once the politician is also

in charge of redistribution, he can get away with less equilibrium eﬀort,

                                    46
compared to the case of no redistribution. The reason is that here he

only needs to please two voters out of three. He can thus reduce eﬀort,

and still please two voters with the portion of the cake taken away from

the minority.26 Note the asymmetry: voters expect the incumbent to

preserve the observed redistribution over time, but they are uncertain

about how the opponent would redistribute. This asymmetry creates an

incumbency advantage and dilutes the politician’s incentives: the voters

are more willing to reappoint the incumbent even if he is incompetent,

because they benefit from his redistribution.27 Here we assumed a very

stark asymmetry: no uncertainty at all about how the incumbent will

redistribute, and maximal uncertainty about the opponent. But the na-

ture of the results would be preserved with less stark assumptions, as

long as the voters are more uncertain about the redistributive policies

of the opponent compared to those of the incumbent.
 26
      This result is similar to that obtained in Ferejohn (1986) and Persson

and Tabellini (2000). But since here voters are forward looking, we rule

out the Bertrand competition among voters that instead features in the

backward looking voting equilibrium of Ferejohn (1986).
 27
      Indeed, if the voters’ reservation utility was W = (θ + ae )/2 (i.e

if they were certain to be included in the winning coalition by the op-

ponent), then the eﬀort of the incumbent would coincide with (7) and

there would be no dilution of eﬀort due to redistribution.


                                     47
      Given these results, who is better for the voters behind the consti-

tutional veil of ignorance, the bureaucrat or the politician? If voters

are risk neutral, and given that they ignore the redistribution chosen

by the politician, they only care about aggregate performance, y. This

makes the bureaucrat more attractive for the voters for a larger range

of parameter values, compared to the case of simple non-redistributive

tasks in section 2. With risk averse voters, the comparison between bu-

reaucrat and politician also depends on whether the bureaucrat is "fair"

or "unfair". A "fair" bureaucrat is even more attractive compared to

the politician, not only because he is likely to put more eﬀort, but also

because he is less risky - the politician exposes the voters to the risk of

being in the minority.28 But the result may be reversed if the bureau-

crat is "unfair" and implements a totally arbitrary redistribution. In this

case, political redistribution is less risky, since two voters out of three

are always included in the winning majority. The case of an "unfair"

bureaucrat seems more plausible, since in a complex world it is diﬃcult

to precisely assign redistributive task to a bureaucrat.
 28
      Maskin and Tirole (2001) also point out the ”tyranny of the ma-

jority” or the expropriation of minorities is one reason why politicians

may do worse than non-elected oﬃcials (unaccountable ”judges” in their

context).



                                     48
    We can summarize this discussion in the following:


Proposition 6 The possibility of redistribution reduces the equilibrium

eﬀort of the politician, but not that of the bureaucrat. Risk aversion

makes the bureaucrat more or less desirable ex-ante depending on how

easy it is to impose fair treatment of all voters in his task description.

9    Positive analysis

So far we asked what is the optimal task allocation from the voters’ point

of view. We now turn to the positive question of how tasks are likely to

be allocated in practice. Bureaucratic institutions, although stable over

time, are not typically spelled out in the constitution. They are chosen

in the course of the regular legislative process by the politicians in oﬃce.

Hence, criteria of political expediency dominate this choice. What does

this imply for actual (as opposed to optimal) task allocation? Do elec-

toral considerations push politicians to design eﬃcient institutions (i.e.

institutions that are optimal for the voters)? And if not, are there system-

atic deviations from optimality? A voluminous ”positive” and empirical

literature in political science investigates whether or not and why the

American Congress delegates; it discusses when delegation is in the elec-

toral interests of politicians, and when it also maximizes social welfare.

The answer generally depends on how the voters evaluate the politician

who has appointed a bureaucrat to perform a certain task. The results

                                    49
that follow shed light on several of the point discussed informally in this

literature.

   In the formal analysis, we let the politicians choose what to delegate

and what not. In reality, bureaucracies themselves ”fight” for more and

more autonomy, and sometimes are successful even against the will of

politicians. (Carpenter 2001). But the determination of politicians to

retain control varies across tasks. Our results help us understand why

politicians are more willing to fight for some tasks than for others.
9.1     When do politicians delegate?

We start by asking what are the general criteria that induce politicians

to delegate tasks to independent agencies. To preserve comparability

with the previous results, we retain the same theoretical framework.

Specifically, suppose that there are two tasks, i = 1, 2, requiring task

specific abilities (θi ) and eﬀorts (ai ) :


                                  yi = θi + ai


The two task-specific abilities, (θ1 , θ2 ), are independently distributed

according to a normal distribution with mean θ̄ and variance σ2θ . The

costs of eﬀort are additively separable (C(a1 ) + C(a2 )) and there are no

spillover eﬀects, so that voters’ utility is U (y1 + y2 ). We start with the

simpler case of risk neutral voters: U(y1 + y2 ) = y1 + y2 - this assump-

tion is relaxed below. Remember that we can interpret the eﬀort costs

                                        50
identically as the utility of rents with a simple redefinition of variables.

   The timing of events is as usual: first tasks are allocated at a con-

stitutional stage, then the policymaker in charge chooses eﬀort (without

knowing his own abilities), then performance is observed, rewards are

paid and elections take place. The only diﬀerence is that now, at the

constitutional stage, task allocation is chosen by the politician rather

than by a benevolent planner. The term ”constitutional stage” is not

quite appropriate in this case, but we retain it for the sake of a clear

comparison with the analysis of eﬃcient arrangements. For simplicity,

and without loss of generality, we assume that, at the constitutional

stage, the politician faces a binary choice: either he delegates task 2 to

an independent bureaucrat, or he keeps it for himself; task 1 is instead

restricted to always remain with the politician.

   The voters’ behavior is a crucial determinant of the constitutional

choices. This in turn depends on what the voters know. We assume

throughout that voters observe the constitution and fully understand

its implications (alternative assumptions are discussed below). Thus,

constitutional choice is equivalent to a choice amongst equilibria, except

that the perspective is that of the politician rather than the voters.

   With rational voters, we also need to spell out whether the consti-

tution is expected to remain in place only in the current period, or also



                                    51
in the future. In line with the observation that bureaucratic institutions

can be changed through ordinary legislation, we assume no constitu-

tional commitment: the constitution in place today could be changed

after the elections. Thus, an equilibrium constitution is defined as a

task allocation that meets two requirements: first, it is optimal for the

incumbent politician at the constitutional stage, given the voters’ ex-

pectation of the constitution in place after the elections. Second, the

voters’ expectations are fulfilled.

   Section 3 of the appendix proves that:


Proposition 7 If voters are risk neutral, then in equilibrium the proba-

bility of reelecting the incumbent politician is always 1/2, irrespective of

the constitutional choice. Hence, the politician chooses the constitution

that minimizes his equilibrium costs - or more generally, that maximizes

the equilibrium rents from being in oﬃce.


   Proposition 7 makes clear that electoral concerns do not drive consti-

tutional choice in this framework with risk neutral voters. The reason is

that voters condition re-election on policy performance, but not on con-

stitution design. This in turn follows from the assumption that voters

are rational and understand the implications of alternative constitutions,

while they are imperfectly informed about the policymaker’s ability in

carrying out his policy tasks. Given this assumption, policy (but not

                                      52
constitutional choice) reveals the policymaker’s ability. Given that the

probability of re-election is always 1/2 irrespective of the constitutional

arrangement, the only criteria governing constitutional choice by the

politician concern the costs of eﬀort (or more generally the rents associ-

ated with each task). Specifically, if performing task 2 according to the

voters’ expectations is costly, then the politician prefers to delegate it

away. If instead retaining control of task 2 allows the politician to grab

political rents in equilibrium, then he prefers not to delegate it. Note

that equilibrium eﬀort by the politician in each task is lower (rents are

higher) if he retains two tasks rather than with a single one. The intu-

itive reason is that the politician is less accountable: with two tasks there

is a ”bundling” problem, and voters cannot punish poor performance in

only one of the two tasks. Since ex-ante the politician is uncertain about

his abilities in both tasks, his incentives to please the voters are weaker

than if he has control of only one task.29

       Alternative assumptions would deliver diﬀerent results relative to

Proposition 7. In particular, if voters were un-informed about task allo-

cation, or if institution design also signalled the politician’s ability, then

the result in Proposition 7 need not hold. But the assumption that voters

only hold politicians responsible for the tasks that they have retained,

                                      53
and adapt their expectations to what politicians in the opposition would

deliver (i.e. to what is ”politically feasible”) seems reasonable to us. The

implications of this result are far reaching: if constitutional choice does

not influence the election outcome, then voters’ welfare is not a relevant

determinant of constitutional choice. Politicians will get rid of tasks that

require attention and costly eﬀort, while they will retain tasks that allow

them to grab political rents. The issue of what is in the voters’ interests

simply does not enter the political calculus of costs and benefits.

   What does this argument imply about delegation in general? Is there

a political bias towards too much or too little bureaucratic delegation,

relative to the optimum? The general answer is that politicians will try

to retain ultimate control (so as to appropriate rents), but delegate exe-

cution (so as to get rid of eﬀort and costs). In other words, bureaucrats

stay up at night and do the hard work, while politicians grab the rents.

Thus, the model predicts that we should observe extensive delegation to

bureaucrats directly controlled by politicians, but too little delegation

to really independent bureaucrats.

9.2    Redistribution

Many policies have redistributive implications: would politicians dele-

gate those? Suppose that there are only two tasks and the politician is

constrained to keep one task for himself and to delegate the other one to



                                     54
an independent bureaucrat; but he gets to choose which task to retain

and which one to delegate. Task 1 is a simple task, that gives all voters

the same utility: y1 = θ1 + a1 . Task 2 also gives the policymaker the

ability to choose the allocation of benefits among three groups of voters

indexed by J, as in the cake splitting example of section 8; thus voter

J utility from this task is cJ , and the policymaker is constrained to set
P
  J    cJ = θ2 + a2 .

      Our question is which of these two tasks is kept by the politician,

and which one is delegated. As in the previous subsection, we assume

that voters know the constitution and hold the politician accountable

only for the policy task under his control. It is easy show that:


Proposition 8 The politician always retains control of the redistributive

task


      This result is really a direct implication of the analysis carried out

in section 8. As shown in that section, and under the same assumptions

about the political system, the redistributive task allows the politician

to increase the equilibrium probability of re-election above 1/2, while

putting less eﬀort to please the voters. Hence it is always preferred com-

pared to a non-redistributive task. The intuitive reason is that redis-

tribution gives the incumbent an advantage, because the redistributive

policies of the opponent are unknown, or less well known than those of

                                      55
the incumbent. This seems reasonable in practice. An incumbents has

had an opportunity to credibly build coalitions; an opponent can make

promises while out of oﬃce, but he does not have the same credibility.

       What about tasks that touch the interests of organized groups? Here

too, the politician has a preference to retain them. As shown in section 6,

if the politician is in charge of these tasks, in the equilibria with political

lobbying he receives campaign contributions, which increases his prob-

ability of re-election above 1/2 (see (25)). Hence, the model predicts a

reluctance of politicians to delegate tasks that aﬀect powerful economic

interests, particularly if they are likely to generate campaign contribu-

tions.30 Here there is a stark contrast between what is socially optimal

and what is optimal for an opportunistic politician. If illegal bribes

can be prevented, bureaucratic delegation would be socially optimal,

but would be opposed by politicians interested in extracting campaign

contributions from lobbies.
  30
       In the equilibrium in which the politician receives bribes (rather than

campaign contributions), he is strictly indiﬀerent between delegating to

a bureaucrat or not (since the optimal bribe by the lobby would leave

him indiﬀerent). But with more than one organized group, the politician

can extract rents from the lobbies, and he would strictly prefer to retain

control rather than delegate.




                                       56
9.3     Risk averse voters

Proposition 8 above was derived under the assumption that voters are

risk neutral. We now consider risk averse voters, and ask what this

implies for the politician’s incentives to delegate to an independent bu-

reaucrat. In particular, we ask whether the politician is more keen to

delegate risky or safe tasks (a risky task is one in which performance is

also determined by nature, and not just by the policymaker’s eﬀort and

ability).

      There are two tasks and the politician has to choose which one to

delegate to an independent bureaucrat (i.e., for simplicity we restrict his

choices so that he cannot retain control of both tasks). Task 1 is ”safe”

and gives voters utility y1 = θ +a. Task 2 is ”risky”, in that performance

(and voters’ utility) also depends on a random exogenous component:

y2 = θ + a + ε; as in the case of imperfect monitoring of section 3,

voters only observe y1 and y2 , but do not observe ε. For simplicity, the

required ability, θ, is the same in the two tasks. We only consider the

case in which voters expect that, after the elections, the constitution

will give the safe task to the politician. The opposite case (of a future

constitution that gives the politician control over the risky task) yields

the same conclusions.

   Suppose that, at the constitutional stage, the politician retains the


                                    57
safe task and delegates the risky one. His ability θ is then fully revealed

to the voters when they observe y1 . At the election, the voters thus

anticipate that re-electing the incumbent gives them utility U(θ + ae ).

Voting for the unknown opponent, instead, gives the voters an expected

utility of EU(θ+ae ), where the expectations operator is over the random

variable θ. The equilibrium probability of re-appointment is thus:


                      Pr [U(θ + ae ) ≥ EU(θ + ae )]                   (36)


where now the probability refers to the random variable θ (since the

incumbent still ignores his own ability when setting policy and when

choosing the constitution). If U(.) is strictly concave, the probability in

(36) is clearly above 1/2, the more so the greater is the uncertainty over

θ and the more concave is the utility function.31 In other words, when

voters are risk averse, the incumbent enjoys an electoral advantage. The

reason is that the voters know more about the incumbent than about

the opponent, and this makes them more reluctant to switch. But the

size of the incumbency advantage depends on which tasks are retained

by the politician.

   Specifically, suppose that, at the constitutional stage, the politician

delegates the safe task and retains the risky one. Now, the voters can no
                                          £                      ¤
  31
     This can be seen by noting that Pr U (θ + ae ) ≥ U(θ̄ + ae ) = 1/2,

and that EU(θ + ae ) < U(θ̄ + ae ) by strict concavity of U(.).

                                    58
longer infer the incumbent ability from their observation of y2 . Reap-

pointing the incumbent thus gives the voters an expected utility of

E(U(θ +ae ) | θ +ε), where the expectations operator refers to the expec-

tation over θ, conditional upon observing θ + ε. The expected utility of

voting for the opponent, instead, is unchanged (by the assumption that

there is no constitutional commitment and after the election the politi-

cian retains the safe task for himself). Hence, the equilibrium probability

of reappointment is:


                 Pr [E(U(θ + ae ) | θ + ε) ≥ EU(θ + ae )]               (37)


where now the probability refers to the random variable θ + ε. By strict

concavity of U(.), and since the unconditional mean of ε is 0, we have that

U(θ+ae ) > E(U(θ+ae ) | θ+ε) for all values of θ. Thus, the probability in

(37) is strictly smaller than that in (36) - i.e. the incumbency advantage

is smaller if the politician retains the risky task rather than the safe one.

   We cannot conclude from this comparison that the politician prefers

to retain the safe task for himself, however. The reason is that equilib-

rium eﬀort is generally higher under the safe task: since the politician

faces less uncertainty, he finds it optimal to put more eﬀort into the safe

task than in the risky one. This can be seen by adapting the analysis of

section 3 to the case of risk averse voters.

   We summarize the foregoing discussion in the following:

                                     59
Proposition 9 The constitutional choice between the safe and the risky

task entails a trade-oﬀ between votes and rents (or eﬀort). By keep-

ing the safe task and delegating the risky one, the politician increases

his incumbency advantage but reduces equilibrium rents (equivalently, he

increases equilibrium eﬀort).


   Thus, when voters are risk averse, electoral concerns do influence

constitutional choice, contrary to the case of risk neutral voters. But

this does not push the constitution towards greater eﬃciency for the

voters. It simply makes the politician more willing to delegate risky

tasks. Intuitively, the politician is aware that risk averse voters punish

bad luck more harshly than they reward good luck. He thus prefers

to leave this risk to the bureaucrat. In a sense, the bureaucrat acts as

a ”scapegoat” for the politician, as suggested by Fiorina (1977). This

incentive is tempered by the opposite considerations concerning rents (or

eﬀort), however, since more risky tasks are also associated with greater

rents.

   Sometimes scapegoats for politicians can be welfare improving, since

they take the blame for ”unpopular” but needed policies. In Europe,

national politicians often publicly blame bureaucrats in the European

Commission that tie their hands, but in private they sometimes wel-

come these constraints and may even suggest to the Commission how


                                   60
to formulate its recommendations. A similar role may be served by

other international bureaucracies, such as the IMF, when it prescribes

”unpopular” policies to macroeconomically unstable countries (Vreeland

2003).

   Proposition 9 is also relevant for other institutional choices besides

delegation, and in particular for the design of more or less transparent

procedures for policy formation. Transparency of public policy is an

important dimension of institutions and it a choice variable. Politicians

can make a policy process more or less transparent. In this choice, they

are likely to face a trade-oﬀ similar to that summarized in Proposition

9. More transparency has the benefit of increasing the incumbency ad-

vantage, because the voters are better able to assess the qualities of the

incumbent, while they know less about the opponent. But more trans-

parency is also likely to reduce equilibrium rents, because the punish-

ment for rent extraction is more severe. Depending on which incentives

are likely to prevail, politicians will choose more or less transparent pro-

cedures. An interesting application of this idea is to the budget process.

In many countries the government budget is very non transparent and

this is considered a ”problem” from the point of view of optimality of

institutions. But the degree of budget trasnparency. is entirely endoge-

nous and it is the result of politicians’ strategic choices. In fact the



                                    61
government budget is the primary source of rents broadly defined for

politicians. Otherwise there would be no reason not to simplify the

budget documents and the budget process.32

10      Conclusions

Our analysis rests on two fundamental assumptions. The first one con-

cerns the motivation of diﬀerent types of policymakers. Bureaucrats

want to signal their competence for career concerns, politicians for re-

election purposes. The second assumption is that the tasks for bureau-

cratic agencies have to be specified ex ante and cannot be contingent

on the realization of too many shocks on the environment and/or on

the public’s preferences. If one accepts these two hypotheses, the na-

ture of our results is quite robust to variations on other less important

assumptions.

      From an eﬃciency perspective, these diﬀerences between bureaucrats

and politicians imply that some policy tasks, but not others, ought to be

delegated to independent agencies. Consider first policies with few re-
 32
       See Alesina and Perotti (1999) for a survey of the literature on

budget institution and of transparency. Alesina and Cukierman (1991)

discuss a diﬀerent model in which also the degree of transparency can

be chosen endogenously by politicians who would not always choose the

maximum level of this variable.



                                    62
distributive implications, such as monetary policy or foreign policy. Bu-

reaucrats are likely to be better than politicians if the criteria for good

performance can be easily described ex-ante and are stable over time; if

good performance requires special abilities and performance evaluation

presupposes some technical expertise; if political incentives are distorted

by time inconsistency or short-termism. Monetary policy indeed fulfills

many of these conditions, and the practice of delegating it to an inde-

pendent agency accords with some of these eﬃciency results. Foreign

policy does not, because the criteria for good performance are unstable

and more vague, and the benefit of insulating policy from the political

process are smaller.

   Next, consider policies that have redistributive implications, such as

trade policy, regulation, or fiscal policy. Here, bureaucrats perform well

if the policy consequences touch narrowly defined interest groups, if cri-

teria of good performance can be easily formulated and assessed in terms

of eﬃciency, and if the legal system is strong. Politicians instead are bet-

ter if the policy has far reaching redistributive implications, if criteria

of aggregate eﬃciency do not easily pin down the optimal policy, and if

there are interactions across diﬀerent policy domains (so that a single

measure of performance is aﬀected by several policy instruments and pol-

icy packaging is important). Regulation of public utilities or of specific



                                    63
industries are examples of policies that lend themsleves to bureaucratic

delegation, since they pit special interests against those of consumers

as a whole, do not have large spillover eﬀects, and policy performance

can be evaluated on the basis of eﬃciency or other semi-technical cri-

teria. Trade policy might fall in this cathegory too, although here the

redistributive implications are more pronounced. Welfare state policies,

instead, have such broad redistributive implications that it seems risky

to subtract them from the political process, as suggested by our exam-

ple on cake splitting. But there are specific aspects of fiscal policy that

would certainly meet our eﬃciency criteria for bureaucratic delegation:

for instance, detailed tax policy provisions, or intertemporal fiscal policy

choices where time inconsistency or political myopia is an obvious issue,

as suggested by Blinder (1997).

   Overall, the analysis from the perspective of economic eﬃciency sug-

gests that there is ample scope for bureaucratic delegation to improve

over political delegation, particularly if politicians remain in charge of

defining and correcting the general mission of independent agencies. But

these conclusions are not likely to be reflected in observed institutional

arrangements. There is no reason why opportunistic politicians should

internalize these eﬃciency criteria. Actual institutions are more likely

to be designed so as to deliver maximal rents at the lowest risk for the



                                    64
incumbent politician. This argues for retaining under political control

policy tools that are useful to build winning coalitions or to generate

campaign contributions, such as trade policy or much of fiscal policy. It

also means that politicians might want to get rid of tasks that expose

them to risk, such as monetary policy. But this "risk shielding" is pos-

sible only if bureaucratic delegation is complete, so that the blame for

policy failure lies with the independent agency and not the politician.

This might explain why it is politically so diﬃcult to exploit delegation

to independent agencies in fiscal policy. Full bureaucratic delegation of

fiscal policy is inconceivable, for eﬃciency and positive reasons. But

partial delegation of narrowly defined technical tasks in fiscal policy is

politically unfeasible, no matter how desirable. The reason is that voters

would still hold the politician accountable, as long as he retains some

control (i.e. unless the delegation is complete). And if he is held respon-

sible, then the politician loses any incentive to delegate control.



                               Appendix

   1. Optimal contracts with bureaucrats
   Consider the model of section 2. It is easy to show that the first order

condition (4) also implicitly defines the first best level of eﬀort in a con-

tract between voters (the principals) and the bureaucrat (the agent) in


                                     65
which eﬀort is observable and contractible. Since voters and bureaucrat

are risk neutral, this first best can be achieved with an optimal contract

even if eﬀort and ability are not separately observable. Such optimal

contract would reward the bureaucrat with a simple linear payoﬀ:


                               R(y) = y − b


where the constant b is defined by the agent’s (ex-ante) participation

constraint, namely by the condition that


                            E(R(y)) − C(a) ≥ 0                           (38)


Under the optimal contract, the participation constraint must bind, and

given (1) and (38), this implies: b = θ̄ + a∗ − C(a∗ ) where a∗ denotes

first best eﬀort as defined in (4).

   Thus, in this simple model of section 2, the implicit reward oﬀered by

career concerns induces the same level of eﬀort as the optimal contract,

but there is no guarantee that the participation constraint on the agent

binds or is even satisfied. Throughout, we assume that θ̄ ≥ C(a∗ ). Given

the reward function in (3), this insures that the participation constraint

for the bureaucrat is satisfied. Of course, if the above inequality is strict,

then the bureaucrat enjoys some positive rents under the career concerns

contract, that he would not enjoy under the optimal contract (i.e. the

voters ought to tax the bureaucrat when he is appointed).

                                      66
    2. Time inconsistency
    There are two tasks, i = 1, 2, and:


                           U (y1 , y2 ) = y1 + y2                    (39)


For task two y2 = θ + a2 . But y1 depends also on private sector expec-

tations, ae2 .

                         y1 = θ + a1 − (a2 − ae2 )                   (40)




    Suppose throughout that policy commitments are unavailable, mean-

ing that first private expectations are formed, and then eﬀort in both

tasks, a1 and a2 , are chosen. In order to stress the diﬀerence between

the bureaucrat and the politician, suppose now that costs are additive:

c = C(a1 ) + C(a2 ). The politician allocates eﬀort so as to maximize:


                   Pr(y1 + y2 ≥ W ) − C(a1 ) − C(a2 )                (41)


taking the voters’ reservation utility, W, and the private sector expec-

tations, ae2 , as given. In equilibrium, W = 2θ̄ + ae1 + ae2 . Taking the

first order optimality conditions for the politician and imposing rational

expectations, yields the following result:

                             1
                               n(θ̄) = Ca (aP1 )                     (42)
                             2
                                aP2 = 0


                                    67
Equilibrium eﬀort on task 1 is determined by the same condition as in

section 3, except that the left hand side is divided by 2 because now

task 1 only contributes 50% to improve the politician’s chances for re-

election. But the politician exerts no eﬀort at all on task 2 because

ex-post the benefit for the voters from this policy outcome are exactly

oﬀset by the negative eﬀect on the performance of task 1. Since voters

assign equal weights to both tasks, and eﬀort is costly, the politician

ex-post prefers to do nothing. Of course, this is suboptimal from an

ex-ante perspective: only unexpectedly high a2 hurts the performance of

task 1, and under rational expectations the voters would be better oﬀ

if the politician could commit to exert high eﬀort also in task 2, and

expectations were formed accordingly. Overall voters’ utility under the

politician is thus:

                             U P = 2θ̄ + aP1                         (43)

   Next, consider the bureaucrat, and suppose that his ability is evalu-

ated according to a composite measure of performance, y = δy1 + (1 −

δ)y2 , as in (12) above. Repeating the same steps, and still taking expec-

tations as given, we now obtain:


                                   δ = Ca (aB
                                            1)                       (44)

                           (1 − 2δ) ≤ Ca (aB
                                           2)                        (45)


Like the politician, and for the same reasons, the bureaucrat too exerts

                                   68
less eﬀort in task 2 than in task 1, because under discretion he perceives

a cost from unexpectedly high eﬀort. In fact, for δ ≥ 1/2, (45) implies

aB
 2 = 0. But now, the constitution gives a tool to overcome this incentive


problem: tilting the bureaucratic mission towards task 2, with δ < 1/2,

induces the bureaucrat to reduce aB               B
                                  1 and increase a2 . Since costs are


convex, at least over some range aB                         B
                                  2 increases by more than a1 is reduced.


Moreover, if expectations are formed after the constitutional stage, this is

reflected into expectations, and aB    e
                                  2 = a2 , so that the loss in performance


in task 1 is more than oﬀset by the improved performance in task 2.

Hence, the voters’ expected utility is:


                           U B = 2θ̄ + aB    B
                                        1 + a2                         (46)


Unless eﬀort by the politician in task 1 is very high, the voters are likely

to be better oﬀ under the bureaucrat.

   In fact, voters would be even better oﬀ if tasks 1 and 2 could be split

between two distinct bureaucrats (or between a politician in charge of

task 1 and a bureaucrat in charge of task 2). The bureaucrat in charge

of task 2 could be given a mission defined only on y2 as a basis of perfor-

mance, and someone else could be in charge of task 1. This would get rid

entirely of the time inconsistency, since the bureaucrat in charge of task

2 would now disregard completely the negative impact of unexpectedly

high a2 in the performance of the other task. The proposition in the

                                    69
text follows.


    3. Lobbying
    As stated in the text, the equilibrium with lobbying must solve the

following optimization problem by choice of a1, a2 and f, subject to non-

negativity constraints on the three choice variables, and taking voters’

expectations ae1 as given, as before.

                         n(θ̄ − H(f ))Hf (f ) − 1 + µ3 = 0                 (50)


where µi , i = 1, 2 are the lagrange multipliers on the non-negativity con-

straints for ai , while µ3 is the lagrange multiplier on the non-negativity

constraint for f.

    Consider first the case Hf (0) < 1/(1 + γ). Since Hf f < 0, here

lobbying is ineﬃcient, and the first order conditions can only be satisfied

if f = a2 = 0 and a1 is at an interior optimum defined by (48) with µ1 = 0

in it.

                                      70
   Next, consider the case Hf (f ∗ ) > 1/(1 + γ). This is the opposite

extreme, in which lobbying is very eﬀective. In this case a1 = 0 and

a2 and f ∗ are at an interior optimum defined by (49) and (50) with

µ2 = µ3 = 0 in them.

   In the intermediate case, in which Hf (0) > 1/(1 + γ) but the returns

to campaign contributions fall rapidly, an equilibrium with lobbying does

not always exist. A special knife edge case is given by the case in which

Hf (0) > 1/(1 + γ) and Hf (f ∗ ) = 1/(1 + γ) = n(θ̄ − Hf (f ∗ )). Here a1

and a2 can both be positive, and are defined by

                            1 + γ = Ca (a1 + a2 )

and by the condition that the politician is indiﬀerent between this equi-

librium and the one with no lobbying.


   4. Equilibrium constitutions
   Proof of Proposition 8

   Consider four cases: delegation vs no-delegation today, given that

the voters expect no-delegation after the elections; and delegation vs no-

delegation today, given that voters expect delegation after the elections.

   Suppose that the voters expect that, after the election, the politician

will retain both tasks. Consider each of the two possible constitutional

arrangements for the current period.       Under bureaucratic delegation

(i.e.. the politician is in charge of task 1 while the bureaucrat is in

                                     71
charge of task 2), the probability of reappointment is: P r(y1 ≥ W ) (since

the ability of the incumbent politician in the second task is unknown,

it cannot influence the election outcome). If voters are rational and

fully understand the institutions in place, then their reservation utility

is: W = θ̄ + ae . The equilibrium is then exactly as in section 2 above.

In particular, the probability of reappointment is: P r(θ + aP1 ≥ θ̄ +

ae1 ) = 1/2. If instead the politician keeps the second task for himself, and

given that the voters understand it, the probability of reappointment is:

P r(y1 + y2 ≥ W ) = P r(θ1 + θ2 ≥ W − a1 − a2 ), where the reservation

utility is now given by: W = 2θ̄ + ae1 + ae2 . In equilibrium (i.e., with

aPi = aei , i = 1, 2), the probability of reappointment is thus: P r(θ1 +θ2 ≥

2θ̄) = 1/2.

      Now suppose that the voters expect that, after the election, the

politician will delegate task 2 and only retain task 1. Here, the rele-

vant reservation threshold imposed by rational voters is: W = θ̄ + ae1 ,

since voters know that task 2 will not be controlled by the politician af-

ter the elections. Hence, the equilibrium probability of reappointment is

P r(y1 ≥ W ) = P r(θ1 ≥ θ̄) = 1/2, irrespective of whether the politician

delegates or not before the elections.33

      Note that we have implicitly assumed that voters separately observe

y1 and y2 ; but this does not matter. If this was not the case, and in the

case of no-delegation voters only observed y1 + y2 , then the equilibrium

                                     72
