1. Introduction


       A robust nding of the game theory literature is that with the possibility of future

punishment and rewards there are many possible equilibria. One interpretation is

that these represent alternative social norms or institutions. Indeed, we do observe

a wide array of dierent institutions both across space and time: political systems in

particular range from relatively autocratic (exclusive in our terminology) to quite

democratic (inclusive in the terminology of Acemoglu and Robinson [3]). A natural

question is the positive one: among these dierent institutions are we more likely

to observe some than others? Are ecient institutions likely to be more successful

than inecient ones? A natural setting for this question is an evolutionary one -

and one possible answer is that of Ely [25]
                                                         3 who shows how voluntary migration

leads to eciency. But we do not believe that historically people have moved from

one location to another through a kind of voluntary immigration into the arms

of welcoming neighbors.            Rather people and institutions have more often spread

through invasion and conict. Moreover, institutional change has generally arisen

in the aftermath of the disruption caused by warfare and other conict between

societies. This leads us to address the question of which institutions are likely to be

long-lived in the context of evolution driven by conict between societies.

       When evolution is driven by conict we nd that the long-run favors not in-

stitutions that maximize welfare or per capita output, but rather institutions that

maximize state power.            These institutions have ineciently high taxes and state

power and are not terribly inclusive. While these state power maximizing institu-

tions are hegemonic (within their geographical area of inuence) for long periods

of time, these hegemonies are periodically broken with shorter periods of conict

between competing - and possibly more ecient - states.

       The idea of history being dominated by hegemonic states may seem a strange

one, but with some important exceptions it is borne out by historical facts.
                                                                                                4 Take,

for example, the largely geographically isolated region of China: bounded by jungles



   3
       Ely uses a model similar to the one used here, but similar results using more biologically oriented
models have been around for some time. For example Aoki [1] uses a migration model to study
eciency, while more recently Rogers, Deshpande and Feldman [45] use a migration model to show
how unequal resources can lead to long-run inequality.
   4
       Sources and calculations of historical data on hegemonies and population is in Appendix 1.




                                                     1
in the South, deserts on the West, cold arid wasteland in the North and the Pacic

Ocean in the East. We nd that during the 2,234 years beginning from when we

have decent historical records in 221 BCE the area was ruled by a hegemonic state

roughly 72% of the time, with ve interregna. Less reliable records exist for the area

of Egypt, but in the 1,617 years from 2686 BCE to the end of the new Kingdom in

1069 BCE we see hegemonic rule 87% of the time with two interregna. In Persia

during the 1,201 years from 550 BCE to 651 CE we see hegemony 84% of the time

with two interregna. England has been largely hegemonic within the geographically

conned area of the island of Britain for 947 years from 1066 CE to the present. The

Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean area as a hegemony for 422 years from the

advent of Augustus in 27 BCE to the permanent division into Eastern and Western

Empires in 395 CE and the Eastern Roman Empire lasted an additional 429 years

until the advent of the Caliphate in 814 CE. The Ottoman Empire lasted 304 years

from the conquest of Egypt in 1517 CE to the Greek revolution in 1821 CE.

       There are also, however, two glaring exceptions: except for brief periods neither

the subcontinent of India nor, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the

area of continental Europe were subject to a hegemonic state.

       Our theory predicts hegemony only under conditions where geography does not

matter, and we would argue that in the cases of both continental Europe and India

the inuence of outsiders protected by strong geographical barriers was important.

In the case of Europe following the fall of Rome and up to around 1066 we have the

continued interference of northerners - the Vikings especially were well protected by

their own geography. Following 1066 we have the constant interference of England

- also safe behind a water barrier: during this period we observe that England con-

stantly intervened in continental conicts but always to support the weaker side,

and eventually this policy of balance of power became explicit.
                                                                            5 India also was sub-

ject to repeated invasion from central Asia - protected not by water but by dicult

desert and mountain terrain.
                                    6 Of course China too was subject to outside inuence


   5
       It is not completely correct to view England and Scandinavia as outsiders as at various
time they had continental interests and conversely, but the key point is that they had a core area
relatively safe from invasion. In a dierent direction Homan [32] argues a role also for the Western
Catholic church which in Europe, and only there, has acted as a balancing force much akin to to
the outsiders of our model.
   6
       The exact nature of the asymmetry in the physical geographical barrier is uncertain, but it is
a fact that India has been invaded numerous times successfully from Central Asia, but there have
been no successful conquests of Central Asia from India. Phil Homan in a private communication




                                                   2
- particularly that of the Mongols.          However, the relative size of the Mongolia is

quite small relative to China - less than half a percent of the population - while the

population of Scandinavia was about 5% that of continental Europe, that in central

Asia about 5% that of India, while England was about 8% of continental Europe.

These exceptions are in fact exactly what is predicted by our evolutionary theory:

we show that as outside inuence grows the fraction of time hegemony will reign

decreases.
              7

       With respect to institutions, as we indicated, states with greater power will

have an advantage over less powerful states. To focus thinking we examine a simple

model in which institutions and incentives determine state power. A key question

is why individuals in a society will contribute to state power?                 First, there is a

signicant public goods problem. Worse, given that outside conquest and disruption

is relatively rare, it is hard to believe that military spending levels would stand much

of a cost-benet analysis, so that the good of state power is perhaps not very good

at all. Hence while the public goods problem may be solved by a state run by ocials

who collect taxes, the question remains why these ocials do not collude to consume

tax revenue rather than use it to augment the power of the state. The answer we

propose to this question is that the incentive of state ocials to acquire state power

is not so much in defense of the state from intruders but rather to collect taxes from

which they can consume and to maintain themselves in oce. Roughly speaking we

view state ocials as preferring to consume jewelry rather than swords, but they

need the swords to collect the tax revenue to pay for the jewelry. We model this in

a simple way by assuming that greater state power increases the ability of the state

to collect taxes. Of course a more powerful state enables the collection of greater

revenues for ocials only if the army and other forces of state power respond to the

wishes of those ocials. Whether this is true depends on inclusivity of institutions.



suggests that part of the answer may lie in the fact that the area of Central Asia is well suited
for raising horses and India is not, and that horses play a central military role in conict between
Central Asia and India.
   7
       Note that geographical factors matter in our argument only in so far as they give rise to
outsiders who inuence the evolution of the relationships between the other groups. An existing
literature, including Diamond [20], gives physical geography a direct role, arguing for example that
the terrain of Western Europe is more defensible than that of China, hence less susceptible to
hegemony. Besides this particular claim being challenged on physical grounds (Homan [32]), such
considerations have no bite in the Indian case. Incidentally: while this discussion includes only the
area of Europe, Asia and North Africa, it should be borne in mind that until modern times 90% of
the world population lived in this area.




                                                 3
In an inclusive democracy, for instance, this is not so much the case - ocials may

try to send the army into the streets to collect revenues for their own benet, but

in a meaningful democracy the army will be loyal to institutions not persons and

will not follow such orders.

       Putting the paper in context, the idea that evolution can lead to both coopera-

tion and ineciency is scarcely new, nor is the idea that evolutionary pressure may

be driven by conict. There is a long literature on group selection in evolution: there

may be positive assortative matching as discussed by Bergstrom [6]. Or there can be

noise that leads to a trade-o between incentive constraints and group welfare as in

the work of Price       [42, 43]. Yet another approach is through dierential extinction

as in Boorman and Levitt [10]. Conict, as opposed to migration, as a source of

evolutionary pressure is examined in Bowles [12], who shows how intergroup com-

petition can lead to the evolution of altruism.            Bowles, Choi and Hopfensitz [14]

and Choi and Bowles [16] study in group altruism versus out group hostility in a

model driven by conict. Rowthorn and Seabright                [46] explain a drop in welfare

during the neolithic transition as arising from the greater diculty of defending

agricultural resources. More broadly, there is a great deal of work on the evolution

of preferences as well as of institutions: for example Blume and Easley [9], Dekel,

Ely and Yilankaya [19], Alger and Weibull [5], Levine et al                 [36] or Bottazzi and

Dindo [11]. Some of this work is focused more on biological evolution than social

evolution. As Bisin [7] and Bisin and Topa [8] point out the two are not the same.

       This paper is driven by somewhat dierent goals than earlier work.                  We are

interested in an environment where individual incentives matter; and in an envi-

ronment where the selection between the resulting equilibria are driven by conict

over resources (land).      By combining the idea of the conict resolution function

introduced by Hirshleifer       [31] and subsequently studied in the economic literature

on conict
           8 with the stochastic tools of Kandori, Mailath and Rob [35], Young [49]

and Ellison [24] we are able with relatively weak assumptions to show when state

power maximizing hegemonies do and do not arise.



   8
       See, for example, Garnkel and Skaperdas   [29] or Hausken   [30]. An important focus of this
literature has been in guring out how shares of resources are determined by the conict resolution
function.




                                                  4
2. A Static Example


       We start with a simple static model of how state power is determined by in-

stitutions and incentives within a society. The size of a society, in terms of land

resources controlled, will play a crucial role in in the evolutionary dynamics, but

as we assume constant returns to scale in land, land plays no role in the statics, so

here we conduct the analysis per unit of land. As summarized in the introduction,

the idea for this model is that state power determines strength in conict, but of-

cials determine state power to collect taxes in their own interest. The results of

the section relate state power and welfare to the exclusivity of institutions and their

extractiveness.

       There are two types of players: producers           i=P        and state ocials       i = O.   The

choice variable for producers is the eort level a
                                                  P              ‚àà [0, 1]     and for ocials the level

of state power a
                 O       ‚àà [0, 1].   State ocials move rst and choose the level of state

power; producers move second and choose the eort level.

       Internally state power serves the purpose of collecting taxes. Specically the tax

rate is determined by the level of state power           aO    together with a parameter         œá ‚àà [0, 1]
describing social institutions. The institutions that give rise to                   œá   we view as xed

in the short-run described here although in the dynamic model they will change

over time in response to evolutionary pressures.
                                                            9 The relevant aspect of institutions

summarized by the parameter             œá   describes the extend to which institutions enable

the use of state power to collect taxes.
                                                   10   It represents the exclusivity of those

institutions: relatively inclusive institutions, such as democratic one, use a variety of

checks and balances to limit the application of state power - courts, appeals processes

and so forth. In the extreme when            œá = 0 we imagine that it is essentially impossible
to collect taxes because individuals who fail to pay taxes may engage in endless

appeal to the courts. At the opposite extreme when                   œá = 1 tax collectors can simply
seize resources from producers at gunpoint without any institutional constraint.

Hence we dene        tax power b = œáaO        as the product of the exclusivity parameter                œá

   9
       We do not explicitly model the decisions to adhere to social norms that underly institutions:
we refer the reader to the literature on repeated games such as Fudenberg and Maskin                 [28] or
Fudenberg Levine and Maskin          [27] and especially Kandori      [34]'s work on social norms.     In an
earlier version of this paper Levine and Modica         [37] these decisions were explicitly analyzed -
without however leading to dierent conclusions.
  10
       For computational simplicity in analyzing statics   œá   and   ai   will be treated as continuous, but
in the analysis of evolutionary dynamics they will be treated as discrete.




                                                    5
and target state power. When             œá = 0 there is no tax power;      when   œá = 1 tax power is
the same as state power. The actual tax rate is given by                 œÑ ‚â° min{1, œÑ b}   where   œÑ   is

a technological parameter specifying how eective tax power is in collecting taxes.

We assume       œÑ > 1;   otherwise as we show in the appendix optimal state power is zero

for all   œá.
    Producers are represented by a single representative player.                   Eort translates

into output one for one. Producer's utility is output net of taxes and the quadratic

cost of providing eort, plus a benet from public goods provided through state

power:

                                                                 2
               uP = (1 ‚àí œÑ )aP ‚àí [caP + (1/2)(1 ‚àí c) aP               ] + Œ≥aO   0<c<1

Note that the cost function has been normalized so that the marginal cost of a

unit of eort is 1 and that       Œ≥     measures the extent to which state power is useful in

providing public goods.

    State ocials act collusively as the residual claimants of tax revenue net of the

resources devoted to building state power: their utility is


                                            uO = œÑ aP ‚àí aO .

Notice that we allow negative utility for state ocials - implicitly they have resources

so that the state can operate with a decit.             Our results are not sensitive to this

modeling simplication as in equilibrium ocials never choose to do this.

    An action prole       (aP , aO )   for a society is an   equilibrium   if it is subgame perfect

when the ocials move rst, or equivalently, a Stackelberg equilibrium. Results for

the quadratic case are worked out in Appendix 2 with a complete analysis in Web

Appendix 2. The economy can be summarized by means of the tax-revenue function

Note that the utility of the representative producer and state ocials are measured

in compatible units in the sense that a unit of utility lost by the producer in taxes

G0 (b) + bG00 (b)   is decreasing. For    0‚â§b‚â§b       we have prots    Œ†(b)   twice continuously
                               00
dierentiable, decreasing and Œ† (b)         < 0 with Œ†(b) = 0 for b ‚â• b.       Finally,   Œ†(b)‚àíG(b)
is decreasing. Stepping beyond the linear/quadratic case, when these properties are

satised we will refer to the economy as          proper.
       We are interested in which institutions achieve specic benchmarks. Specically

in proper economies, we can describe institutions            œá   for which the equilibrium max-

imizes state power and for which it maximizes welfare.                 In Appendix 2 we show

that:

Theorem 1.         In a proper economy there is a unique equilibrium level of state power
aO (œá), and it is single peaked in œá; so there is a unique argmax œá‚àó > 0. There is a
unique welfare maximizing level of exclusivity œáÃÇ, and œáÃÇ ‚â§ œá‚àó . There is a Œ≥ ‚â• 1 such
that if Œ≥ ‚â§ Œ≥ then œáÃÇ < œá‚àó .
       This says that state power maximization leads to greater exclusiveness than

welfare maximization.

       We also have a relationship between exclusivity and what Acemoglu and Robin-

son [2] call extractiveness. In Appendix 2 we show that:

Theorem 2.     In a proper economy prots Œ†(œáaO (œá)) are decreasing in œá, while tax
revenues G(œáaO (œá)), tax power œáaO (œá), and the utility of state ocials uO (œá, aO (œá))
are all increasing in œá. 11 For œá ‚â• œáÃÇ producer utility is decreasing in œá and if Œ≥ < 1
so is welfare. If Œ≥ ‚â• 1 the welfare is decreasing for œáÃÇ ‚â§ œá ‚â§ œá‚àó .
       In particular Theorem's 1 and 2 imply that institutions that maximize state

power have greater extractiveness than those that maximize welfare.



3. Dynamics with Two Societies


       We now wish to consider how institutions        œá are determined by evolutionary pres-
sure. To begin, we analyze a greatly simplied evolutionary dynamic. Subsequently

we show that the qualitative properties of this example hold under much broader

conditions.


  11
       We have not specied a relationship between tax power and the tax rate, but expect that as in
the linear quadratic case the tax rate is increasing in tax power.



                                                  7
      In our preliminary analysis we assume that there are two societies, that both

are proper economies, and that equilibrium action proles are always chosen. These

societies share the same technology and dier only in inclusiveness                        œá.    To focus

thoughts, it is useful to think of one value of               œá   maximizing welfare, the other max-

imizing state power. These two societies will compete over land, with their chances

of winning or losing land governed by a conict resolution function that depends

upon relative state power. It is no surprise then that evolutionary forces will favor

the society with greater state power. Our main questions concerns not does more

state power do better?             but rather, how much better does greater state power

enable a society to do? and how often we are likely to see a hegemony?

      Assume then that two societies           j = 1, 2 compete over an integral number L units
of land. Both societies are assumed to implement their unique equilibrium prole,

and consequently generate               aO
                                         j > 0   units of state power per unit of land,          j = 1, 2.
                                      O
Without loss of generality we assume a1                   ‚â§   aO
                                                               2 , that is, society 1 is the weaker
society. At time      t   society   j   controls an integral number       Ljt ‚â• 0   units of land where

L1t + L2t = L.       Recall that we assume constant returns to scale in land.

      Control over land follows a Markov process with state variable                   L1t ,   the amount

of land belonging to the weaker society. The transition probabilities are determined

by a conict resolution function, in which each period there may be conict resulting

in one of the two societies losing a unit of land to the other: that is               |Lj,t+1 ‚àíLjt | ‚â§ 1.
The conict resolution probabilities will depend on the power of the two societies.

      As there are constant returns to scale in land, we dene aggregate state power

as   Ljt aO
          j .   We refer to the loss of a unit of land as a           disruption   and assume that the

probability of disruption depends on the               force ratio :
                                                    A0 + Ljt aO
                                                              j
                                           œÜjt =                     ,
                                                   A0 + L‚àíj,t aO
                                                               ‚àíj

where the constant          A0 > 0       represents the strength of outside forces who are safe

behind geographical barriers, but who are equally disruptive towards both societies.

Letting    0 < p < 1/2      be a xed number, we assume a kind of threshold eect: once

œÜjt   falls below a threshold           œÜ>1   the probability of disruption becomes equal to            p
(which is interpreted as relatively high). Above the threshold, we assume that the

probability of disruption is much smaller; specically, x a number                    >0      measuring




                                                      8
how small is small, then the probability of disruption is given by


                                            œÄ jt = pœÜjt ‚àíœÜ .

If we dene the    resistance rjt = max{0, œÜjt ‚àí œÜ} we may write œÄ jt = prjt .                    This may

be interpreted as resistance to disruption as the probability                  œÄjt   is decreasing in       rjt .
      The conict resolution function is governed by four parameters:                       p, A0 , , œÜ.   The

rst parameter      p   determines how often land is won or lost - we may think of this

as a measure of the period length - if the period is very short, then there is little

chance a unit of land is lost in a single period. For a xed period length                        p   controls

how quickly change takes place - a higher value of                p   eectively speeds up the time

scale. This can be signicant for applications, as              p can be determined by technology
and geography that will generally dier across time and space. For example, it may

be that a lower value of      p   in Western Europe led to an interregnum that was long

in absolute terms relative to China.
                                             12

      Turning to the other parameters, below the threshold                 œÜ   a society is not safe in

the sense that it has an appreciable chance of losing land. Above the threshold, it

is safe in the sense that it has little chance of losing land. The outside forces                         A0
determine how easy it is to get past the threshold - with strong outsiders it is hard

to be safe because of the threat of the outsiders.                  The parameter             by contrast

measures how safe is safe: when           = 0,   for example, safe means safe forever.

      Finally, to simplify the computations, we want to assume that the threshold is

such that a society with even         L‚àí1       units of land is below the threshold. In other

words, once the enemy gets a foothold, they have an appreciable chance of causing

further disruption. We make this assumption only for the purposes of this example.

Specically, we assume that the force ratio with            L‚àí1       units of land for the stronger

society   (A0 + (L ‚àí     1)aO
                            2 )/(A0   +   aO
                                           1)   ‚â§ œÜ.   Dene

                                             (                         )
                                              A0 + LaO
                                                     ‚àíj
                                  œÅj = max 0,           ‚àíœÜ
                                                 A0

to be the resistance to society       j   gaining a unit of land when landless (increasing in

the defender power       A0 +   LaO
                                  ‚àíj ).
      We can summarize then the Markov process: when society                         j   has no land it has



 12
      Noting that Western Europe is de facto a hegemony now so that the interregnum has ended.




                                                    9
a probability of           pœÅj   chance of getting one. When a society has at least one unit

of land, but is not yet a hegemony, it has a chance                p   of getting another unit and a

chance    p    of losing one, while if it is a hegemony, it has only a         pœÅ‚àíj   of losing a unit

of land.

      To understand the dynamics, observe rst that when                  = 0 the hegemonic states
(L1   = L      or   L1 = 0)       are absorbing and the non-hegemonic states (0           < L1 < L)
are transient, so in the long-run there is a hegemony, and if the initial condition is

uniform over        L1 ,   each society has an equal chance of having the long-run hegemony

since the Markov process is symmetric in this case.

      When      >0        the situation is quite dierent: all states are positively recurrent

and there is a unique stationary probability distribution representing the frequency

with which each state occurs. Since this is a simple birth-death chain, the stationary

probabilities can be explicitly computed. In particular the stationary probability of

society    j   having a hegemony is

                                                         1
                                      œÉj =                              .
                                             1 + (L ‚àí 2)œÅ‚àíj + œÅ‚àíj ‚àíœÅj

We can manipulate this expression to characterize the average frequency of time the

system spends in hegemony:


Theorem 3.     If A0 ‚â• LaO2 /(œÜ ‚àí 1) the stationary distribution over states is uniform
regardless of . If A0 < LaO2 /(œÜ ‚àí 1) then as  ‚Üí 0 we have œÉ1 + œÉ2 ‚Üí 1. If a2 > a1
                                                                                 O    O

then in addition œÉ2 ‚Üí 1 and œÉ1 ‚Üí 0. For xed  > 0 time spent in hegemony œÉ1 + œÉ2
declines with outside inuence A0 and as œÅ1 ‚Üí 0 it approaches 2/L.

      Notice that     1/L represents the size of a unit of land relative to the total amount of
land. In this model it represents the amount of land that an invader must successfully

conquer to get a toehold enough to have an appreciable chance of success. As this

grows smaller, the fraction of time there is a hegemony falls to zero.                        In other

words, strong outside forces, and a small toehold needed for success means little

hegemony.

      We can summarize the proposition by saying that with strong outsiders there is

no tendency towards hegemony, while with weak outsiders the tendency is towards a

hegemony of the stronger state. Notice that the circumstances that favor hegemony

are exactly the same that favor the society with greater state power. Hegemony and

high state power go hand in hand. The circumstances under which we might expect

to see institutions with less than maximum state power for appreciable amounts of



                                                      10
time are circumstances where hegemony is uncommon and competing states more

likely.

    From an evolutionary perspective what matter is tness - in this case state

power. From an economic perspective we are not so interested in what level of state

power is favored by evolution, but rather what it implies about institutions.                      For

this we have to return to the static model. Since we are limited to comparing two

sets of institutions, let us suppose that society 2 maximizes state power, that is,

has exclusivity      œá2 = œá‚àó   at the peak of the state power function             aO (œá).    Without

signicant outside inuence, we will generally see a hegemony of these institutions.

This may be more or less exclusivity than the weaker society                   œá1 :     the alternative

society may be excessively exclusive or insuciently exclusive. An interesting case

is where the alternative society has institutions that maximize welfare:                      œá1 = œáÃÇ.
From Theorems 1 and 2 we conclude that absent signicant outside inuence there

will be a hegemony that will be inecient and excessively extractive. By contrast,

when there is signicant outside inuence, hegemony will be much less common,

and ecient institutions will persist more frequently.



4. Generalized Evolutionary Dynamics


    We are now going to generalize the static and dynamic models of the previous

sections to seek a broader theorem about the emergence and nature of hegemony.

We particularly want to avoid arbitrary assumptions about equilibrium versus non-

equilibrium behavior, the number and nature of societies that might compete with

one another, and the functional form of the conict resolution function.

    To generalize the static model we allow for an arbitrary nite list of societies

j = 1, . . . , M .   Each society   j   has a set of players   i = 1, 2, . . . , Nj ,   although as in

the example we understand these to be player roles that may involve representative

individuals or collusive groups (in the example          Nj = 2).        Each player has a nite

set of actions   aij ‚àà Aij   and we denote by     aj ‚àà Aj   the corresponding action proles.

We do not explicitly model utility and incentive constraints, but assume rather

that for each society there is a set of equilibrium proles             Ej ‚äÇ Aj .       These are the

proles for which incentive constraints are satised - although the solution concept

might depend on the context - in the example                Ej   is a singleton containing the

unique Stackelberg equilibrium in which state ocials are the leader. We allow the

possibility that     Ej   is empty. Finally, there is a map from proles to state power:

Œ≥j : Aj ‚Üí <+ .

                                                 11
       Next we consider evolutionary dynamics.                      Each society at a moment of time

t = 1, 2, . . .   plays an action prole             ajt   and controls an integral amount of land             Ljt
       PM
where         j=1 Ljt     = L.       If   Ljt > 0    we refer to a society as active, otherwise it is

inactive.

       In the dynamic example of the previous section we constrained action proles

to lie in     Ej .   We now drop the assumption that incentive constraints are satised

at every moment of time, and instead describe a simple learning process by which

individuals modify their actions and expectations over time.

       We start by considering what a steady state of a learning process should be

like.    Two things should be true:                  rst, players should expect that today will be

the same as yesterday; second, given that expectation, it should be optimal to play

the same way as yesterday. In other words, what happened yesterday should be an

equilibrium, and in addition that equilibrium should be expected to recur today. In

a learning process, the expectation that today should be the same as yesterday will

be based on having observed that in the past this has indeed been true. Suppose

that we are not yet in a steady state but in fact yesterday was an equilibrium so

that    ajt‚àí1 ‚àà Ej        and today is the same as yesterday so that                 ajt = ajt‚àí1 .     A simple

model of learning is to assert that in this case that there is a chance                             1 > œàj > 0
that expectations of tomorrow are that it will be the same as today - that we enter

a steady state.
                      13 To indicate this, we introduce a state variable                     bjt   that can take

on two values,        1   for steady state expectations and                0   otherwise. When       bjt = 1   we

say that society          j   is   stable.   If   ajt ‚àà
                                                      / Ej   then necessarily     bjt = 0.    If   ajt ‚àà Ej   and

bjt = 1       then   aj,t+1 = ajt         and if   Lj,t+1 > 0     then   bj,t+1 = bjt = 1     that is, once an

active society achieves a steady state it stays there as long as it remains active.

       For unstable societies in which                bjt = 0     we assume that there is a transition

function      P (aj,t+1 |ajt ) > 0        that puts positive weight on all proles. In other words,

when people are unsure about the future there is a degree of randomness in their

behavior - charismatic leaders may arise, populist nonsense may be believed and so

forth.
         14


  13
       Assuming that the system is always in equilibrium as we did in the example is not consistent
with this formulation nor is the example consistent with the assumption below requiring duplicate
institutions. It is possible to tweak the general model to allow the example as a special case while
preserving the main theorem. As the special nature of the example is hard to justify and in any
case we already know from direct computation that the theorem holds in it, we will not complicate
the general model.
  14
       This dynamic is essentially a simplied version of the stochastic individual learning procedure




                                                             12
    Finally, we assume that inactive societies are unstable. Notice that an inactive

society becomes relevant only when it gains some land.                           This represents a group

adopting a new set of institutions. We would not expect that people in a newly cre-

ated society would instantly be in equilibrium: the assumption that inactive societies

are unstable is a simple way of modeling the idea that when a society becomes active

for the rst time it is not stable and there is an element of randomness in the way in

which players initially play. As inactive societies represent potential institutions,

we also wish to allow the possibility that when groups experiment with institutions

they experiment with existing institutions but use dierent action proles. That is,

just because an active society uses, say, a constitutional monarchy is no reason a

break-away group of innovators should not also try to use a constitutional monarchy

but taking dierent actions in hope of nding a better equilibrium.

    To make precise the idea that it is possible to experiment with existing institu-

tions, dene two societies         j, j 0   to   use identical institutions     if   Aj = Aj 0 , Ej = Ej 0    and

Œ≥j = Œ≥j 0 .     Formally, we assume that for every society                j   there exists a society j
                                                                                                       0      6= j
with identical institutions.

    Stepping back, the overall state vector at time                   t   is   st = {ajt , Ljt, bjt }Jj=1 ‚àà S ,
where     bjt   is constrained to be             0   when either   Ljt = 0     or    ajt ‚àà
                                                                                         / Ej ,     and evolves

according to a Markov process                M ()      that depends on a parameter             ‚â• 0.   We will

study the process for small            .    To fully specify this process on            S   we must indicate

how land is gained and lost.

    As in the example the movement of land between societies is governed by a

conict resolution function - except that now we have to contend with the possibility

of many societies. As before we continue to assume that at most one unit of land

with   Œìt   and    Œì‚àíj,t   being the corresponding prole of these aggregates and those of

opponents to society         j.   We assume that the probability that society                   j   is disrupted

and loses a unit of land           œÄjt = œÄ(bjt , Œìjt , Œì‚àíj,t )[]    depends on the stability of the

society and on aggregate state power of the society and that of rival societies. Notice
                                                                                             PM

the shocks must necessarily be correlated. The unit of land that is lost is gained by

a society chosen randomly according to the function                       Œª(k|j, Œìt ) > 0      for   k 6= j   and



that Foster and Young [26] introduce and for which they show Nash equilibrium is stochastically
stable.

Œª(j|j, Œìt ) = 0.
      We make several assumptions about the conict resolution function                          œÄ(bj , Œìj , Œì‚àíj )[].
First we assume that for           > 0     we have   œÄ(bj , Œìj , Œì‚àíj )[] > 0.          Second we assume

that it is symmetric in         Œì‚àíj ,   that is the names of the societies do not matter, only

their strength.      Third, we assume that it is monotone: non-increasing in                             Œìj    and

non-decreasing in       Œì‚àíj .   Fourth, we assume that it is convex in                    Œì‚àíj    which means

that concentrated forces are more dangerous than divided ones.

      Fifth, we assume that an unstable society always has an                            appreciable      chance

of losing land meaning that              œÄ(0, Œìj , Œì‚àíj )[] > 0       independent of        .       The idea is

that when expectations of the future are uncertain players have a choice between

experimenting with dierent actions - or with dierent institutions.                                  Under our

assumption that institutions can change on at most a single unit of land in a single

period, experimentation with institutions means that a single unit of land is lost.

Notice that the stability of opposing societies does not matter:                             how disruptive

opponents are depends upon their strength and not upon whether or not they are

stable. Of course if they are not stable, the actions taken by that society are likely

to change in the future, and as a consequence their future ability to be disruptive

may be greater or less than their current ability.

      Our nal and key assumption concerns the case of a stable society facing a single

opponent. That is except for a single            k 6= j   all the components of             Œì‚àíj      are zero. In

this case we assume that the conict resolution function has resistance dened by
                                                                                           
                                         log œÄ(1, Œìj , Œì‚àíj )[]                  A0 + Œì j
                   r(1, Œìj , Œì‚àíj ) ‚â° lim                        =q
                                     ‚Üí0        log                             A0 + Œì k

where for some       œÜ > 1      we have     q(œÜ) = 0      for   œÜ ‚â§ œÜ       and   q(œÜ)   strictly increasing

for   œÜ ‚â• œÜ.   We also assume the regularity condition that if                     r(1, Œìj , Œì‚àíj ) = 0        then

lim‚Üí0 œÄ(1, Œìj , Œì‚àíj )[]=0      . These generalize the assumptions concerning resistance

in the example, allowing for an arbitrary function form, but keeping the threshold

between zero and positive resistance.

      We have now dened a Markov process                 M ()     on the state space          S.   Within the

state space    S   we identify certain classes of states as             hegemonic.       A hegemony           st   at

(j, aj )   means that   ajt = aj ‚àà Ej       , that society      j   is stable    bjt = 1,   and that society

j   has all the land    Ljt = L.    We assume that there is at least one hegemonic class -

that is, that the set     Ej    is nonempty for at least one           j.   For any hegemonic class we




                                                    14
can dene      Œì(st ) = Œìj (aj )     to be the state power of the hegemonic society.
                                                                                                          15

       We can now describe the stationary distribution                       ¬µ()    of the Markov processes

M ()    - this tell us how frequently dierent states will occur.


Theorem 4.     [Main Theorem] For  > 0 there is a unique ¬µ() that places positive
weight on all states. As  ‚Üí 0 there is a unique limit ¬µ. There is a critical value of
A0 > 0. If A0 > A0 then ¬µ places positive weight on all states. If A0 ‚â§ A0 then ¬µ
places weight only on hegemonic classes that have maximal state power within the
class of hegemonic classes.

       We review here some of the important elements of the proof - the remaining

details can be found in Web Appendix 1.                          Examining the role of          A0   we see that

hegemonic classes can be ranked by their state power                              Œì(st )         ‚àó
                                                                                           with Œì the maximal

state power. The resistance to disruption in a hegemonic classes is
                                                                     
                                                        A0 + Œì(st )
                                                q
                                                           A0

which is non-decreasing in            Œì(st ),   and is zero for


                                            Œì(st ) ‚â§ A0 (œÜ ‚àí 1)

and strictly increasing for larger          Œì(st ).       Take   A0 = Œì‚àó /(œÜ ‚àí 1) > 0.         Then if     A0 ‚â• A0
the resistance of all hegemonic classes is zero: this implies that there are no absorbing

hegemonic classes when           = 0.
       Now suppose     A0 < A0 .      Then any hegemonic class for which                     Œì(st ) > A0 (œÜ ‚àí 1)
is absorbing when         = 0       since the probability of disruption is zero.                    If   A0 < A0
but suciently close, then the only such class will be ones with state power                                   Œì‚àó .
Otherwise we use a method of Ellison to show that only hegemonic states with state

power     Œì‚àó   get weight in    ¬µ.
       The method of Ellison requires us to compute the least resistance path from

one absorbing hegemonic steady class                      (j, aj )   to another. It turns out this is easy

to compute.        The key is that the least resistance to losing a unit of land occurs

when there is a single opponent who is as strong as possible. This occurs when the

opponent is a society       k   and prole          ak   such that     Œ≥k (ak )   is maximal over all societies



  15
       There are generally many states making up a hegemonic class: these dier in the action proles
used by inactive societies. Note that the resistance of moving from one state in a hegemonic class to
another is zero since by assumption inactive societies are unstable and have an appreciable chance
of moving to each dierent action prole.




                                                           15
and proles. Such a        (k, ak )   may not be an equilibrium and may not be stable, but

that does not matter, because there is an appreciable probability that it keeps doing

the same thing long enough to overrun                  (j, aj ).   We refer to it as a barbarian horde.

The resistance to the barbarian horde taking over is Ellison's radius                          Rj (aj )   which

is strictly increasing in     Œ≥j .    Moreover, once the barbarian horde has taken over, the

resistance to reaching any other absorbing hegemonic steady class is zero.

      Because the least resistance to reaching every other absorbing hegemonic class

is the same amount         Rj (aj )   we can show that Ellison's co-radius is


                                 CRj (aj ) =             min            Rk (ak )
                                                    (k,ak )‚ààH\(j,aj )

where     H     are the hegemonic absorbing classes. Ellison shows that as                   ‚Üí0    the ratio

of time during which         (j, aj )   has a hegemony to the time at which it does not is

approximately

                                             1/Rj (aj )‚àíCRj (aj ) .

If   (j, aj )   attains state power     Œì‚àó   then   Rj (aj ) > CRj (aj )       and in the limit this ratio

goes to innity: most of the time there is a hegemonic class that maximizes state

power.

Remark 1. (Relation to Literature on Group Evolution)                               The novelty of our ap-
proach lies in our treatment of incentive compatibility.                           Existing literature in the
area mainly focuses on the interplay between individual and group evolutionary se-
lection: individual behavior which increases tness of a group, typically some form
of generosity, may be harmful for individual tness. This is the case both in the
Haystack Model as in Maynard Smith                       [40] or Richerson and Boyd              [44] and in
Bowles' model of conict and evolution (Bowles [13]). The equilibrium dimension
in the group selection literature is generally missing.                      One exception is Boyd and
Richerson [15] who consider a setting with multiple Evolutionary Stable Strategies
and show that group selection can be operative at the level of the equilibrium.

      What does evolutionary theory enable us to conclude about state institutions?

How do the general results compare to that of the example?                               First, the fact that

incentive constraints are not always satised makes little dierence.                           By assump-

tion the learning dynamic is fast relative to the evolutionary dynamic. We think

empirically this is the correct assumption. In situations involving signicant social

disruption - for example in refugee camps - people quickly learn how to behave and

what to expect and social stability - and equilibrium - no matter how unpleasant

and institutionally ineectual - quickly reigns. Note however that during periods of




                                                        16
severe conict leading to the fall of institutions that have been long stable, the fact

that incentive constraints need not hold in the short run means that unstable and

incentive incompatible barbarian hordes will predominant for a brief period.

       Returning to our simple example of institutional dierences indexed by the ex-

clusivity parameter       œá   we see that the results of the simple two-society evolutionary

model are reinforced. Since we now allow for many potential societies, it now natural

to assume that both state power maximizing institutions                œá‚àó and ecient institutions
œáÃÇ are present.     Once again we conclude that absent signicant outside inuence there

will be a hegemony that will be inecient and excessively extractive, and indeed it

will be a hegemony of         œá‚àó .
       Notice that we have assumed away technological dierences. Exogenous tech-

nological dierences can easily be introduced into the model - with the obvious

conclusion that given the same institutions and absent signicant outside inuence

we expect a hegemony of the superior technology. We do not think, however, that

exogenous technological dierences are that interesting:                 more interesting are en-

dogenous technological dierences that arise from dierence in institutions. Unlike

the example, the general model of this section is broad enough to allow for models

in which dierent institutions lead to dierent levels of technology
                                                                                    16 . We do not

examine such models here, but it provides an interesting area for future research.



5. Conclusion


       Readers of grand theories of history such as those of McNeil               [41], Cipolla [17],

Diamond [20] or Acemoglu and Robinson [3] will not nd surprising the idea that

ideas are spread by the conquest of the less advanced by the more advanced - indeed

it seems almost ubiquitous in their anecdotes and discussions. Missing from these

accounts, however, is a model of dynamic competition between conicting societies.

Here we introduce such a model and nd that there is a tendency towards hegemony

when outside forces are weak - but less so when they are strong.
                                                                               17 We also nd that

these hegemonies tend to maximize state power and that this results in ineciently

high exclusiveness which in turn determines ineciently high extractiveness, that is

high taxes, high income for state ocials, low income for producers, and low welfare.



  16
       As the model does not allow for the possibility of continuing growth, it is not broad enough to
study technologies that lead to dierent long-run growth rates.

       A recent empirical paper on the relation between warfare and institutions in the Italian Risorg-
imento is Dincecco, Federico and Vindigni [21].




                                                   17
       An evolutionary model of the type introduced here has dynamics driven by

luck, and the intuition of the results follows from understanding this luck. To re-

volt successfully against a large powerful hegemonic society requires a considerable

amount of luck. The larger and more powerful the hegemonic society is, the more

luck is required, and so the more persistent it is likely to be. When there are strong

outside inuences to support the rebels less luck is required. There is an intuition

here as well for the short-lived empires of Alexander the Great, Ghengis Khan or

Tamurlane.       The best kind of luck to have in order to successfully overwhelm a

powerful neighbor is to have a great deal of military power: a strong military orga-

nization, good technology - and a charismatic and brilliant leader. Even better luck

is to have that leader convince his followers to set aside their incentive constraints.

Such luck will not last long - eventually warriors or their descendants will prefer to

follow their incentives and consume jewelry rather than swords - but the luck

can last long enough to conquer the relevant world. These are the barbarian hordes

in the proof of our main theorem.

       The theory has many implications. In the introduction we gave a broad view of

hegemony and the connection to the strength of outside forces. Here we give some

more speculative thoughts about institutions and history seen through the lens of

hegemonic state power and outside inuence.

       Hong Kong and Singapore.        We note that the libertarian success stories favored

by Milton Friedman in Singapore and Hong Kong were protected from outside inu-

ence - in the case of Hong Kong by the British military, and in the case of Singapore

by a water barrier.          An aspect of the theory worthy of future exploration is that

because there is less scope for competition small geographically protected areas are

likely to have a broader range of social arrangements - both ecient and inecient

- than larger areas.
                        18

       Democracy and military spending.       In the range between welfare maximization

and state power maximization the theory predicts a positive relationship between

exclusiveness and state power. If one takes military spending as a measure of state

power this suggests that more democratic societies would generally spend less on

the military than less democratic societies. This is a robust nding in the empirical

political science literature: see for example Dunne and Perlo-Freeman [22] or Dunne



  18
       The wide range of (admittedly very primitive) social arrangements in New Guinea may be a
case in point.

       Decreasing exclusiveness.       Analyses such as those of Homan and Rosenthal

[33] argue that the transition from absolute to constitutional monarchy in Europe

was determined by the higher tax revenue to be employed for military purposes

which a parliament could generate.            This can occur in our model if technological

change increases the eciency of tax collection            œÑ   in which case it will reduce the

optimal degree of exclusiveness.          For example improved military technology - the

development of rearms, for example - can improve the eciency of tax collection

(raise     œÑ)   resulting in both state power maximizing and welfare maximizing levels of

exclusiveness declining.

       Technology and state power.        We have modeled the eect of exclusiveness on

output as taking place through the tax system. There can also be a direct eect

of exclusiveness lowering productivity as suggested for example in Acemoglu and

Robinson [3].
                    19 As indicated above, it is possible to study models of endogenous

technology driven by institutional dierences in our general evolutionary model. We

do not expect that it will change the general nature of the conclusions from the sim-

ple example, but may have additional interesting implications.                  In particular the

nature of technology may interact with institutions. For example, at the beginning

of the cold war, technology favored assembly line manufacturing which is relatively

amenable to central planning, and so the Soviet Union, a particularly exclusive and

extractive system accumulating military power, was able to compete successfully

with the United States. By contrast as technology changed to favor greater decen-

tralization and inclusiveness, it is likely that the enormous growth of GDP in the

United States relative to the Soviet Union made it impossible for the Soviet Union

to continue to compete.

       Nationalism.     We have characterized institutions by exclusiveness - the extent

to which state power is unchecked in collecting taxes. Another dimension in which

institutions may dier is in the extent to which tax revenue is checked in being

used as external state power. It is simple to modify the model to include another

multiplier which we might think of as nationalism which converts the portion of tax

revenue devoted to state power to actual (external) state power. At the extreme we



  19
       There can also be a direct benet to government ocials of state power, for example, they may
have a taste for warfare as in Homan     [32] - this would not change the qualitative nature of our
results.




                                                  19
can think of this as being zero in the case of Japan where the constitution prohibits

the use of military force externally.
                                              20    Such a multiplier has no implication for

welfare, but obviously state power is maximized when the coecient of nationalism

is one. In other words: nationalism is a necessary characteristic of long-lived societies

- which may help to explain its prevalence.
                                                        21


       An evolutionary model is a model of the very long-run and historically hegemonic

societies have lasted many centuries.              Moreover, the decline and fall of societies

according to the model is driven by infrequent bad luck.                  Applying the model to

current aairs is particularly speculative, more so given that modern institutions

are quite recent with the oldest ones being those of the U.S.
                                                                           22 However, consistent

with the theory the U.S. - which has a very high level of military expenditure - has

had an eective hegemony over the North American continent for 237 years.                         We

notice also that despite modern technology the large oceans appear to still provide

a formidable military obstacle - it seems unlikely that either the United States or

China is likely to bypass these barriers to establish a world hegemony. With ve

major rivals in Eurasia - Europe, Russia, China, India and the Islamic block - we

may hope that the U.S. may play the role in the future of the Eurasian continent

that we believe England did in continental Europe - that of preventing hegemony

and preserving competition.

       In an earlier version of this paper Levine and Modica [37] we considered expansionism which

conditions such societies will have little evolutionary success.

       Notice that just as exclusiveness may have a direct eect on technology, so may nationalism:
for example, the same desire to protect against outsiders and to conquer them may also inhibit the
peaceful arrival of productive immigrants and so lower output. Never-the-less unless this force is
very strong, maximizing state power will involve a substantial amount of nationalism.

Europe.

       Additional information about the Parthian Empire from Wright   [48]. Note that the conven-
tional dates of the Parthian Empire conclude with the Sassanian Empire, but the hegemony of the
Parthian Empire appears to have ended following the war with Rome in 114 AD, so we take that
as the end date.

Additional history
      We count the hegemony of Rome from Augustus in 27 BCE to the permanent

division into the Eastern and Western Empires in 395 CE, a period of 422 years.

The Western Empire did not maintain a hegemony for a signicant period after this.

We date the end of the hegemony of the Eastern Empire to the expansion of the

Caliphate in 814 CE. - 395 a period of 429 years.

      In England we date the beginning of the hegemony from the Norman conquest

in 1066, a period of 947 years.

      We date the hegemony of the Ottoman Empire from the conquest of Egypt in

1517 to the Greek revolution in 1821, a period of 304 years.


Demographic data taken from Maddison [39]
      Ratio of population of Mongolia to China in 1820 CE (the earliest date for which

there is an estimate of the Mongolian population): .2%.

      Ratio of population of Scandinavia to Western Europe excluding Greece and the

British Isles in 1000 CE 5%.

      Ratio of population of United Kingdom to all of Western Europe: In 1000 CE

it is 8% and remains relatively stable until it rises in the early late 1800s, rising to

19% in 1820 CE and remaining relatively stable since then.

      Estimate of ratio of population of Central Asia to India in 1820 CE. The ratio of

the population of Afghanistan to India in 1820 is 1.6%. Data for the rest of Central

Asia is not available until 1950 CE. We computed the ratio of the population of

the rest of Central Asia (the Soviet stans: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikstan,

Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) to Afghanistan in 1950 CE when data is available

as being about double that of Afghanistan. Assuming that ratio is about the same

as in 1820 CE we estimate the overall ratio of the population of Central Asia to

India in 1820 CE as about 5%.



Appendix 2: Analysis of the Static Example


      Recall the requirements for an economy to be proper:              G(b) = 0   at   b=0   and for

b ‚â• b ‚â° (1 ‚àí c)/œÑ         while for   0 ‚â§ b ‚â§ b G(b)   is twice continuously dierentiable with

G00 (b)   <   0. Moreover, G0 (0)      >1        0
                                            and G (b)   + bG00 (b)   is decreasing. For   0‚â§b‚â§b
Œ†(b)                                                        00
       is twice continuously dierentiable, decreasing and Œ† (b)              <0    with   Œ†(b) = 0
for   b ‚â• b.   Finally,   Œ†(b) ‚àí G(b)    is decreasing.

Proposition 1.        The linear quadratic economy is proper.

where œÑÃÑ = min{1, œÑ œáaO }. The derivative of uP is (1 ‚àí œÑ ) ‚àí [c + (1 ‚àí c)aP ]. This is
                  P
negative for all a if œÑÃÑ > 1 ‚àí c, otherwise it hits zero at 1 ‚àí œÑ /(1 ‚àí c). Thus optimal

     Suppose b < b ‚â° (1 ‚àí c)/œÑ .         Recall that       œÑÃÑ = min{1, œÑ b}.    Since       b<b      we have
œÑ b < 1 ‚àí c ‚â§ 1 so œÑ = œÑ b. Hence        in this case

   Suppose b ‚â• b ‚â° (1 ‚àí c)/œÑ . If œÑ b > 1 then œÑ = 1 ‚â• 1 ‚àí c.                           If    œÑb ‚â§ 1     then
œÑ = œÑ b ‚â• 1 ‚àí c. Hence in this case aP = 0.

   Tax revenue is G(b) = œÑ a . If b ‚â• b this is zero. Otherwise

     Prot is   Œ†(b) = G(b) + uP ‚àí Œ≥aO .        If   b‚â•b    this is zero. Otherwise we have

Theorem.    [1 from the text] In a proper economy there is a unique equilibrium level
of state power aO (œá), and it is single peaked in œá; so there is a unique argmax
œá? > 0. There is a unique welfare maximizing level of exclusivity œáÃÇ, and œáÃÇ ‚â§ œá? .
There is a Œ≥ ‚â• 1 such that if Œ≥ ‚â§ Œ≥ then œáÃÇ < œá? .
Proof.                                 uO = G(œáaO )‚àíaO , where G(b) has G00 (b) < 0
         The ocial's utility is given by
on [0, b] and G(b) = 0 for b > b. Hence the maximum with respect to a
                                                                         O is unique

and is either 0 if œáG (0) < 1 or the unique to the rst order condition œáG (œáa ) = 1
otherwise. In the latter case, we have from the implicit function theorem


                                    daO    G0 (b) + bG00 (b)

and   G0 (b) + bG00 (b)   decreasing implies the objective is continuous and single peaked
and so has a unique maximum    aO (œá). Note that since G0 (0) > 1 from the rst order
                        O
condition the solution a (1) > 0 implying a positive level of state power is feasible,
                             ?
and hence that the argmax œá > 0.

    Welfare is W (a ) = Œ†(œáa ) ‚àí (1 ‚àí Œ≥)a
                                             O and since Œ†00 (b) < 0 in [0, b] there
                                  O                    ?

                                                                              0      ?

with a (œá ) = a (œá). Since Œ†(b) is decreasing, this implies that W (a (œá )) >
W (a (œá)). Hence œáÃÇ ‚â§ œá , and exact equality is possible only if either œá? = 0
      O                    ?

or aÃÇ
      O > max aO (œá). But œá? > 0 and aÃÇO (œá? ) > 0; and if Œ≥ < 1 then W (aO ) is
              œá
                 O        O ?
decreasing, so aÃÇ = 0 < aÃÇ (œá ).


Theorem.     [2 from the text] In a proper economy prots Œ†(œáaO (œá)) is decreasing in
œá, while tax revenues G(œáaO (œá)), tax power œáaO (œá), and the utility of state ocials
uO (œá, aO (œá)) are all increasing in œá. For œá ‚â• œáÃÇ producer utility is decreasing in œá
and if Œ≥ < 1 so is welfare. If Œ≥ ‚â• 1 welfare is decreasing for œáÃÇ ‚â§ œá ‚â§ œá? .
Proof.   The rst order condition for maximizinguO is œáG0 (b) = 1 so by the envelope
                       O        O     0   O          O
theorem we have du /dœá = a (œá)G (œáa (œá)) = a (œá)/œá > 0. So the utility of
                                                           2 00
state ocials is increasing in œá; and from db/dœá = ‚àí1/œá G (b) > 0 tax power is
                                            O
also increasing in œá. For tax revenues G(œáa (œá)) since tax power is increasing in œá
                       0  O
it is sucient that G (œáa (œá)) > 0, which follows from the rst order condition for
                O
maximizing u . Prots decrease with œá because it is assumed to be decreasing in
tax power which increases with œá.
                     ?           O                           O
     For œáÃÇ ‚â§ œá ‚â§ œá we have a (œá) increasing, while W (a ) is concave in a
                                                                                 O so

welfare is decreasing in œá. Since state ocial utility is increasing, it follows that
                                                 ?
producer utility must be decreasing. For œá > œá we have tax power b increasing
                   O
and state power a decreasing. Since producer utility is welfare minus state ocial
               P
utility it is u = Œ†(b) ‚àí G(b) + Œ≥a
                                    O and Œ†(b) ‚àí G(b) is assumed to be decreasing.
                                                        O
When Œ≥ < 1 we also have welfare W = Œ†(b) ‚àí (1 ‚àí Œ≥)a decreasing.

Web Appendix 1: Proof of the Main Theorem


Theorem. [Main Theorem from the text] For  > 0 there is a unique ¬µ() that
places positive weight on all states. As  ‚Üí 0 there is a unique limit ¬µ. There is a
critical value of A0 > 0. If A0 ‚â• A0 then ¬µ places positive weight on all states. If
A0 < A0 then ¬µ places weight only on hegemonic classes that have maximal state
power within the class of hegemonic classes.
Proof.   First, we examine hegemonic classes more closely and explain the role of                    A0 .
These can be ranked by their state power               Œì(st )   with   Œì‚àó   the maximal state power.
The resistance to disruption in a hegemonic class is
                                                            
                                               A0 + Œì(st )
                                       q
                                                  A0

which is non-decreasing in   Œì(st ),   and is zero for


                                     Œì(st ) ‚â§ A0 (œÜ ‚àí 1)

and strictly increasing for larger   Œì(st ).     Take    A0 = Œì‚àó /(œÜ ‚àí 1) > 0.        Then if   A0 ‚â• A0
the resistance of all hegemonic classes is zero.
   If the resistance of all hegemonic classes is zero or if                    > 0   then all feasible
transitions have positive probability. This implies that there is a positive probability
of moving from any state to any other state. First destabilize all the stable societies
by having them lose all their land. Then have each remaining unstable society lose
land in such a way as to match the target land holding of the target institutions.
Then change the action proles for each society to match the target. Repeat this
once, and for every society that is supposed to be stable in the target, make it stable.
   Hence if the resistance of all hegemonic classes is zero or if  > 0 the process M ()
is positively recurrent, implying that   ¬µ() is unique and places positive weight on all
states. Next, observe that the stationary distributions are the solutions of ¬µ() =
M ()¬µ(). Under our assumptions in the limit as  ‚Üí 0 we have M () ‚Üí M (0) from
which it follows that if ¬µ is any limit point of ¬µ() then ¬µ is a stationary distribution
for M (0). When A0 > A0 then, as ¬µ(0) is unique it follows that ¬µ() ‚Üí ¬µ(0).
    Now suppose A0 < A0 . A theorem of Young [49] shows that from the assumption
that M () is regular it is still the case that ¬µ() has a unique limit ¬µ. Now however
M (0) can have many stationary distributions, so the question is: which one is ¬µ?
Notice that any hegemonic class for which Œì(st ) > A0 (œÜ ‚àí 1) is absorbing in M (0)
since when  = 0 the probability of disruption is zero. On the other hand from any
other type of state, the argument of the previous paragraph shows that there is a
positive probability of reaching one of these absorbing classes, so all other states are
transient. Hence   ¬µ   can place weight only on such hegemonic classes. If                      A0 < A0
but suciently close, then the only such classes will be ones with state power                       Œì‚àó .
However, as   A0 decreases there will be other weaker classes that are also absorbing in


                                                  28
M (0).       However, a theorem of Ellison [24] shows that these classes have probability
zero in      ¬µ   and the application of Ellison's method yields other useful information
about the dynamics.
        H denote the set of hegemonic absorbing classes, that is, for which st ‚àà ht ‚àà
       Let
H Œì(st ) > A0 (œÜ ‚àí 1). In addition to writing st ‚àà H we write (j, aj ) ‚àà H when there
is a hegemonic state st at (j, aj ) in H .

    To apply Ellison's method we must determine for each hÃÇt ‚àà H the basin consist-
ing of states not in hÃÇt for which when  = 0 the probability of reaching st is one.
Suppose hÃÇt is hegemonic at sÃÇt and (j, aj ), and consider states st 6= sÃÇt in dierent
classes. If œÄ(1, Œìjt , Œì‚àíjt )[0] = 0, since we have assumed that united opponents are
stronger than divided ones and œÜ > 1 it must also be the case that for some k we
have œÄ(bk , Œìk , Œì‚àík )[0] > 0. Hence in this case there is no chance of j losing land,
and a positive probability of gaining it, meaning with probability one we return to
a hegemonic          j.    On the other hand if          œÄ(1, Œìj , Œì‚àíj )[0] > 0         so that there is a positive
chance       j   loses land, since that will only increase the subsequent chance of losing
land, there is a positive probability it will lose all its land and become absorbed in
some dierent hegemonic state. Hence the basin are exactly those states for which
œÄ(1, Œìj , Œì‚àíj )[0] = 0.
       The radius is dened as the least resistance path starting at a state                                sÃÇt ‚àà hÃÇt   out
of the basin. The initial resistance to losing a unit of land is
                                                                      
                                                        A0 + Œì(sÃÇt )
                                                q                            .
                                                           A0

Subsequently the greatest chance of losing another unit of land occurs when there is
a single opponent who has the highest possible state power. Consider then a society
k   and prole        ak   such that   Œ≥k (ak )   is maximal over all societies and proles. Such a
combination may not be an equilibrium so would be unstable, but we will assume
that even if it is an equilibrium it is unstable. Notice that this combination may
use the same institutions as            hÃÇt   but this is okay because we have assumed that there
are duplicate institutions. We refer to such a prole as a barbarian horde. When
the opponent is a barbarian horde the resistance to losing land is smallest until the
threshold        œÜ   is reached and resistance falls to zero.                       Denote by    Rj (aj )   the sum of
resistances until the threshold is reached, and notice that it is strictly increasing in
Œ≥j .   Once the threshold is reached there is then a zero resistance path to every other
hegemonic absorbing state: the horde remains unstable and takes over all the land
with no resistance. Since it is unstable, it than can lose units of land without any
resistance, and there is a positive probability independent of                                  so that the land is
lost to the target hegemony.
       We conclude that the radius of                   st   is   Rj (aj )       and this is strictly increasing in
Œ≥j .   On the other hand, to compute the co-radius of we must nd the hegemonic
absorbing state from which it takes the longest to get back to                                st .   So the co-radius




                                                             29
of   (j, aj )   is just
                                          CR =               min           Rk (ak ).
                                                  (k,ak )‚ààH\(j,aj )

Hence when          (j, aj )   attains   Œì‚àó   so that       Rj (aj )   is maximal we have       R > CR.

      Recall from Appendix 2 the solution to the problem of the producer:

                                                                            œÑ

                                                                           1‚àíc
The problem of the state ocial is to maximize

                                                 n       min{1, œÑ œáaO } o

Suppose         œÑ œá < 1.    Then for all      aO ‚â§ 1    and also           œÑ œáaO < 1   so


                                             œÑ œáaO                           œÑ œáaO

                                          1‚àíc

Thus for        œÑœá < 1     the optimal     aO = 0      which gives           uO (0) = 0.

The derivative is           œÑ œá ‚àí 2œÑ œáaO 1‚àíc ‚àí 1,           so the rst order condition gives

Thus

Note that        œÑ œáaO (œá) < 1 ‚àí c         for all     œá.    Thus the optimal tax rate is the following,




                                                              30

                                                2    œÑœá
And inserting this into optimal producer's choice we get (since           œÑÃÑ < 1 ‚àí c)
                                      œÑ           n 1      1 o

   Plugging back optimal choices we can compute utilities. For             œÑ œá < 1 aO = uO =
0, aP = 1   and   uP = (1 ‚àí c)/2.   Note that this is a libertarian equilibrium: ocials

impose no taxes because it would be unprotable to do so and producers exert

maximum eort.        But state power, crucial in interactions with other societies, is

zero.

   For   œÑœá ‚â• 1   we have

                           1      1                       1 ‚àí c œÑœá ‚àí 1
                       aP = (1 +    )         aO (œá) =
                           2     œÑœá                         2 (œÑ œá)2

Utility of producers can be computed to be

                                  1‚àíc 
                        uW P =           (œÑ œá + 1)2 + 4Œ≥(œÑ œá ‚àí 1)
                                 8(œÑ œá)2

Utility of state ocials: using     œÑ œáaW = (1 + œÑ œá)/2   and   aO (œá)   we get
