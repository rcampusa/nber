High Frequency Traders: Taking Advantage of Speed

                                            ABSTRACT

We propose a model of dynamic trading where a strategic high frequency trader receives an imperfect
signal about future order flows, and exploits his speed advantage to optimize his quoting policy. We
determine the provision of liquidity, order cancellations, and impact on low frequency traders as a
function of both the high frequency trader's latency, and the market volatility. The model predicts
that volatility leads high frequency traders to reduce their provision of liquidity. Finally, we analyze
the impact of various policies designed to potentially regulate high frequency trading.

1.      Introduction

High-frequency traders (HFTs) have become a potent force in many equity and futures markets. HFTs
invest in and develop a trading infrastructure designed to analyze a variety of trading signals and send
orders to the marketplace in a fraction of a second. The potential profit from any single transaction
resulting from an execution may be very tiny, and be achieved ex ante with a probability only slightly
above 50%, but HFTs rely on this process being repeated thousands, if not more, times a day. As
the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem relentlessly take their hold, profits ensue and
presumably justify their large investment in trading technology.
      Speed has always been of the essence in financial markets. Traders were among the first to adopt
the telegraph and then the telephone. Closer to us, “high frequency” meant anything intraday; then
minute-by-minute transactions became the norm, quickly to be replaced by second-by-second time
stamps. The time it now takes for an order to be sent and displayed on an electronic exchange, that
is, the latency associated with the implementation of an order, is currently measured in milliseconds.
The latest software and infrastructure developments are making it possible for the most cutting-edge
trading firms to implement microsecond-based algorithms.
      Measuring the extent of HFT activity is inherently a complex task. Although estimates vary across
markets, trading venues and time period, it is generally thought that HFTs represent anywhere between
40 and 70% of the trading volume in US futures and equity markets, and slightly less in European,
Canadian and Australian markets (see Biais and Woolley (2011)). The trend points towards high
frequency trading having perhaps plateaued in some of the markets where it was first introduced, but
still expanding globally in new markets.
      This significant amount of market activity has been accompanied by theoretical research addressing
some of issues arising from the rapid rise of HFTs1 . In particular, Foucault et al. (2012) consider
a setting in which a HFT enjoys a speed advantage when gathering information. They compare
two models of trading under asymmetric information which diﬀer in the presence of an informed
trader precessing information faster than the other market participants, and extend Kyle’s model by
incorporating heterogeneity in the speed of information processing. Foucault et al. (2013) develop
a model in which HFTs choose the speed at which to react to news, based on a trade-oﬀ between
the advantages of trading first compared to the attention costs of following the news. They focus in

(2010), Cespa and Foucault (2008).

particular on liquidity cycles, where traders compete alternatively to make (by positing limit orders)
and take (by sending market orders) liquidity from the market. Biais et al. (2011) analyze the arms race
and equilibria arising in a model where traders choose whether to invest in fast trading technologies.
Jovanovic and Menkveld (2010) study the eﬀect of high frequency trading activity on welfare and
adverse selection costs. Cvitanić and Kirilenko (2010) study the distribution of prices in a market
before and after the introduction of HFTs. They find that the introduction of HFTs results in more
mass around the center of the distribution and thinner tails.
   The innovation in our paper is the modeling of a fully dynamically optimizing HFT. The dynamic
optimization nature of the quoting process by HFTs is a departure from the existing literature, allowing
us to address a new set of inherently dynamic questions: we use the model to study the quoting
optimization by a HFT, initially in a monopolistic position, who enjoys a latency advantage and
trades against many uninformed LFTs; quantify the HFT’s latency advantage over LFTs; determine
why HFTs cancel their orders at a very rapid rate; how their (endogenous) inventory constraints help
shape their order placement and cancellation strategies; how the HFT’s provision of liquidity can be
expected to change in diﬀerent market environments, such as high volatility ones; and how competition
among HFTs can be expected to aﬀect the provision of liquidity and the welfare of LFTs.
   Additionally, a number of regulatory proposals have recently been discussed, and in some countries
implemented, generally aiming at curbing the growth of trading by HFTs. Some of the proposed
provisions include a transaction tax, limiting the ability of HFTs to cancel orders before some amount
of time has elapsed, or taxing such cancellations. Using the model of the paper, we analyze the
potential impact of these proposed regulations.
   Technically, the innovation is the use of multiple, staggered, Poisson processes to represent the
arrival of the various elements of the model: market orders by LFTs, signals to the HFT, changes
in the asset’s fundamental price, arrival of a competing trader who also provides liquidity, etc. This
modeling device keeps the analysis of the dynamic optimization problem facing the HFT tractable and
flexible, and makes it possible to analyze diﬀerent market environments by varying the parameters of
the model.
   In our model, a HFT is able to (imperfectly) predict the upcoming order flow and exploit his speed
advantage by placing and possibly canceling limit orders ahead of incoming market orders by LFTs.
The HFT receives a private signal about the likely type of the next upcoming market order, buy or
sell, and decides to quote or not to quote a limit order at the best available prices. These signals can



                                                   2
be interpreted as the observation of microstructure-level market events that are informative about the
direction of the order flow, such as limit order book imbalances, or new trades happening at diﬀerent
ticks in a correlated asset. HFT technology makes it possible not only to observe and process these
signals at high frequency, but also to send in orders or cancellations, and trade, in response to them.
   Our modeling choices are informed by some of the main empirical stylized facts that are known
about HFTs (see e.g., Brogaard (2011) and Brunetti et al. (2011)). They include the fact that HFTs
have a speed advantage in terms of order placement/cancellation; that there is a small number of HFTs
relative to the mass of LFTs; that HFTs are recognizable by their high frequency of execution, a high
number of trades, a high total volume traded, a small volume on each trade and the fact that they
carry a low inventory as their primary risk control strategy. HFTs act primarily as market makers,
unwilling to take directional bets. HFTs also tend to place many orders, with only some actually
leading to execution, and many cancelled; they appear to systematically beat the odds when trading
against LFTs; and they seem to exploit order flow information and generate trading signals on a very
short time scale rather than longer-run information about the fundamental value of the asset.
   This paper yields several new results. We show that, for fully optimizing HFTs, lower latency
translates into higher profits, higher liquidity provision and higher cancellation rates in normal times.
This is consistent with the view that has emerged out of both the academic literature on HFTs and
many public policy and industry analyses, namely that HFTs have the potential to improve market
quality by providing liquidity, contributing to price discovery, improving market eﬃciency and easing
market fragmentation (see e.g., Hasbrouck and Saar (2010), Hendershott et al. (2011), Chaboud et al.
(2010), Brogaard et al. (2012) and Menkveld (2013)).
   However, what also emerges out of the model is also the fact that HFTs’ provision of liquidity can
be expected to decrease when price volatility picks up. Since this is precisely when large unexpected
orders are likely to hit, markets can become fragile in volatile times, with imbalances arising because of
inventories that intermediaries used to, but are no longer willing to temporarily hold. This prediction
of the model is particularly salient in light of the evidence that has emerged regarding flash crashes
(see Easley et al. (2011) and Kirilenko et al. (2010)).
   When we introduce competition for order flow with another trader, and derive the change in the
HFT’s optimal quoting policy, we find that the two market makers split the rent extracted from LFTs,
liquidity provision increases and LFTs tend to be better oﬀ.
   Finally, we analyze the possible impact of three widely discussed HFT policies: imposing a trans-



                                                    3
action tax on each trade, setting minimum-time limits before orders can be cancelled, and taxing the
cancellations of limit orders. We find that, in the context of our model, imposing minimum time-limits
and cancellation taxes induces the HFT to quote more on both sides of the market, whereas transaction
taxes do not improve this measure of liquidity. One important finding is that when minimum time-
limits are in eﬀect, the fill rate of LFTs’ market orders by the HFT does not decrease substantially in
the presence of higher volatility, unlike the situation without minimum resting times.
     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the base model in continuous time. Section
3 derives the optimal quoting policy of the HFT. Section 4 provides a comparative statics analysis of
the model, while Section 5 develops the implications of the model for market structure, including the
HFT’s provision of liquidity, order cancellations, and the fill rate of market orders. In Sections 6 and
7, we introduce two extensions of the base model: first, to price volatility, and second to duopolistic
competition with another market maker. Section 8 analyzes in the context of the model the impact
of possible HFT regulations. Section 9 concludes.


2.     The Base Model

We consider a model where a HFT and a large number of LFTs are trading a single asset in an
electronic limit order book. The LFTs are uninformed and submit market orders which arrive at
random times according to a Poisson process with parameter 
     By contrast, the HFT is market-making, employing only limit orders. At each instant  = 0 1   ,
the fundamental price of the asset is denoted by  . The ask price is  + 2 and the bid price is
given by  − 2 for a constant bid-ask spread   0. Initially, we assume that  is constant, so
the only price moves are bid/ask bounces in response to transactions. We will relax this assumption
in Section 6.
     The HFT participates in the market by posting active limit orders to buy and sell at the best
price in the book. We assume initially that the HFT enjoys a monopoly in terms of providing limit
orders at the best price, an assumption we will relax in Section 7. Market orders are automatically
and instantaneously executed against the limit orders. The objective of the HFT is to capture the
spread as often as possible.
     The quantity of each order, market or limit, is fixed at 1 lot, so the HFT is not optimizing over the
quantity in each trade. Small volume on each trade matches what is observed empirically in markets
that are popular with HFTs, such as the S&P500 eMini futures. Generally speaking, the quantity


                                                     4
exchanged in each trade has been going down over time (see, e.g., Angel et al. (2010)).
      The HFT can post limit orders at the best bid ( = 1) or the best ask price ( = 1). He may
quote on either, both, or neither side of the market. He can also cancel his previously posted limit
orders, thereby withdrawing from providing liquidity.
      Besides speed, we endow the HFT with another advantage over LFTs. The HFT observes a signal
 that is informative about the likely sign of the next incoming market order. The signal arrives as
a Poisson process with rate , which is independent of the arrival process of the market orders. The
arrival rate of signals received by the HFT is much larger than the arrival rate of the market orders by
LFTs, i.e.,  À . The arrival rate of the signal is larger when the HFT has better trading technology,
i.e., he has the ability to process information at a higher rate.
      The signal is an i.i.d. Bernoulli random variable,  ∈ {“sell”,“buy”} with each being equally likely2 .
Each signal supersedes all previous signals. Conditional on a “sell” signal, the next market order by a
LFT to buy will arrive with a rate of  and the next market order to sell will arrive with a rate (1−)
where  ≥ 12 and vice versa if the signal is “buy.” Therefore, conditionally on the signal telling the
HFT to “sell”, the next market order by a LFT will be a buy order with probability  so if he followed
his signal to sell the HFT can expect his quote to sell to be crossed with the incoming market order to
buy with probability , and a sell order with probability 1 − . The parameter  measures the quality
of the signal, starting from  = 12 where the signal is uninformative, and increasing all the way to
 = 1, where the signal is perfectly predictive of the sign of the next incoming market order. With
the signal equally likely to be “buy” or “sell”,  does not change the unconditional arrival rate of the
market orders, which is 2 for both buy and sell orders sent by the LFTs.
      This mechanism is meant to model the realistic situation where the HFT is able to extract infor-
mation in real time from perhaps the current state of the limit order book, including any imbalances,
from the recent trading patterns that may be predictive of future orders, or from data acquired ahead
of other traders about trades about to be executed or confirmed, all obtained and processed on a
very short (typically, millisecond) time scale. The idea is that the HFT is exploiting fleeting trading
opportunities arising from the trading process itself.
      The HFT makes quoting decisions immediately after observing either a signal or market order.
Hence, on average, he is able to make new quoting decisions every 1( + ) time units. When the
arrival rate of signals increases, the HFT has the ability to make faster quoting revisions.
      The HFT’s position in the asset is denoted by  . This position can be positive or negative; in
  2
      This can be generalized to an arbitrary Markov process, including one with serial correlation in the signal.


                                                             5
the case of a stock this means that we impose no restrictions on short selling, while in the case of a
futures contract a positive (resp. negative) value of  denotes a long (resp. short) position in the
contract. We assume that the HFT is risk-neutral, but is penalized for holding excess inventory at a
rate of Γ| | where Γ is a constant parameter of inventory aversion. In practice, limiting or penalizing
inventory is indeed one of the primary sources of risk mitigation by HFTs. It is also the reason that,
despite the lack of competition and the constancy of the price in the basic model, the HFT will not
systematically quote on both sides of the market and attempt to systematically capture every spread.
   The HFT’s objective is therefore to maximize his expected discounted rewards earned from the
bid-ask spread minus the penalty costs from holding an inventory. The discount rate   0 is assumed
to be constant. Let  be any feasible policy that chooses  and  at trading decision times. Formally,
the HFT maximizes

where sell is the th market sell order and buy is the th market buy order. The first term represents
the HFT’s spread gain from a market order to sell crossed against his bid limit order, the second the
HFT’s spread gain from a market order to buy crossed against his ask limit order, and the third his
inventory penalty. We do not need to model explicitly any rebate provided by the exchange to market
makers. From the perspective of the HFT in the model, it can be thought of as an increase in 
   To keep the model tractable and focus only on the essential, a number of elements are necessarily
left out of the model; first, HFTs in our model are market makers and as such do not make a strategic
choice between limit and market orders, but employ limit orders only; second, HFTs do not place
orders larger than for one contract; third, HFTs’ limit orders are always placed at the best bid and
ask prices. The latter means that we exclude order placement strategies known as “quote stuﬃng”
that place large numbers of quotes away from the best prices to falsely give the impression to other
traders of an incoming imbalance, presumably without the intent of ever executing these orders. It also
means that we preclude the use by HFTs of the now-banned “stub quotes”, which are place-holding
quotes far from the current market price, employed by market makers to post quotes without any
desire to trade, but which may become relevant in a flash crash.

3.    Dynamic Optimization by the HFT

We now turn to solving for the HFT’s optimal strategy. The key advantage of our model’s Poisson-
based setup is that we can merge the two Poisson time clocks  and  into a single one, with signal
or market orders arriving at a combined Poisson rate of  + , and determine the HFT’s decisions
at the resulting discrete random times. That is, the HFT’s maximization problem in continuous-
time can be equivalently converted into a tractable discrete-time problem using the uniformization
methodology (see e.g., Puterman (1994)). We consider the continuous-time HFT problem at signal
(arrival ) or market order (arrival ) arrival times. The HFT’s trading decisions at each of these
arrival times do not aﬀect the timing of the next trading decision. Therefore, we can actually set-up
our problem in discrete-time where HFT decisions are undertaken at fixed time intervals. We describe
this methodology in the following section.


3.1. Discrete-time Equivalent Formulation

We start by recalling the definition of a discounted infinite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP),
before showing that our continuous-time HFT optimization problem can be represented as a MDP. A
MDP is defined by a 4-tuple, (   P(| ) R(| )), in which  is the state space,  is the action
space, i.e., the set of possible actions that a decision maker can take when the state is  ∈ , P(| ) is
the probability transition matrix determining the state of the system in the next decision epoch, and
finally R(| ) is the reward matrix, specifying the reward obtained using action  when the state is
in . The decision maker seeks a policy that maximizes the expected discounted reward
                                             "∞                                  #

where  is the discount rate. An admissible stationary policy  maps each state  ∈  to an action in
 . Under mild technical conditions, we can guarantee the existence of optimal stationary policies (see
Puterman (1994)). Conditioning on the first transition from  to 0 , we obtain the Hamilton-Jacobi-

3.1.1    State and Action Space

Specializing the general framework of MDPs to our problem, the state space can be represented by
the pair of ( ) where  denotes the current holdings of the HFT with  ∈ {    −2 −1 0 1 2   }
and  is the most recent signal received by the HFT, with  ∈ {1 −1}. Here “1” denotes the “buy”
signal and “−1" denotes the “sell” signal. The corresponding action taken by the HFT at each state
is whether to quote a limit order or not at the best bid and/or best ask, i.e.,  ( ) ∈ {0 1} and
 ( ) ∈ {0 1}. Going from 0 to 1 means putting a new limit order in place; going from 1 to 0 means
canceling an existing limit order; keeping the action at 1 means keeping an existing order alive longer;
and keeping it at 0 means continuing not to quote on that side of the market.


3.1.2    Transition Probabilities

We now calculate the transition probabilities at each state of the HFT. First, note that the state transi-
tions occur at a rate of + and the rate is the same for all states and actions. Let P((0  0 )|( ) (   ))
be the probability of reaching state (0  0 ) when the system is in state ( ) and the trader takes the
actions of  and  . First, we define
                                                      ⎧
                                                      ⎪

                                                      ⎩1 −       if  = −1


Suppose that the current state of the HFT is ( ). Let  sell and  buy be the random arrival times
of the market-sell and market-buy order, respectively. Note that  sell and  buy have exponential
distributions with means 1 (pr()) and 1 ((1 − pr())), respectively. Similarly, let  same and  opp
be the random arrival time of the same signal and opposite signal. Note that both these times
                                                                   ¡                              ¢
have exponential distributions with mean 2. Finally, let  ≡ min  sell   buy   same   opp which

has exponential distribution with mean 1( + ). Using this notation, we provide the transition
probabilities with respect to each action taken.
   First, if the HFT does not quote, we obtain

When the HFT does not quote, the only transition to a diﬀerent state is due to the arrival of a signal
of the opposite sign. The corresponding probability is given by

where min  sell   buy   same is exponentially distributed with mean 1(2 + ). This assumption
can be easily generalized. If 1       are each exponentially distributed with mean 1 , then
P ( = min {1       }) =  (1 +    +  ). We will use this fact in the remaining cases.
   When the HFT takes action (1 0), we have the following transition probabilities:

3.1.3     HFT’s Reward Function

Let ((0  0 )|( ) (   )) be the total reward achieved by the HFT when the system is in state
( ), the HFT chooses quoting actions  and  and the system reaches the state (0  0 ). We would
like to write the HFT’s objective in (2.1) in the form of an MDP objective function as in (3.1). We
first introduce the following notation. Let  be the time of the th state transition due to a signal or
market order arrival (by convention 0 = 0) and let  be the length of this cycle, i.e.,  =  − −1 .
   We start with the first two terms in (2.1) that measure the spreads earned by the HFT when there
is a trade. First observe that

where we define + (0 |    ) = 11 ( 6= 0 ) 11  = 1 or  = 1 . We can take the expectation of the
HFT’s discounted earnings using the independence of each cycle length,  , which is an exponentially

   By substituting the corresponding expressions for P |( ) (   ) and R |( ) (   ) , the
following lemma simplifies the implicit equations for the value functions in (3.7) and shows that the
optimal decisions on  and  are separable:

Proof. We prove the result only for ( 1) since the second equation is derived analogously. Using
(3.7), we substitute for the transition probabilities P and the reward function R derived in Section
3.1.2 and Section 3.1.3. We obtain the following expression involving a maximum where each term
corresponds to the expected value taking actions (0 0), (1 0), (0 1) and (1 1) respectively.

We can rearrange the first three terms in the maximum and write them in the same form as the last
term. This shows that we can actually separate the maximum into two maxima corresponding to the

   Lemma 1 shows that the maximum taken over all possible actions in (3.7) can actually be separated
into two maxima in each of which the HFT decides to quote or not to quote at the best bid or at the
best ask. He quotes at the best bid to buy another share if (2) ≥ ( ) − ( + 1 ) and similarly
he quotes at the best ask to sell another share if (2) ≥ ( ) − ( − 1 ). Note that when  = 1
(resp.  = −1), the probability of getting crossed by a market-sell (resp. market-buy) order is higher
than getting crossed by a market-buy (resp. market-sell) order.


3.2. Optimal Market Making Policy by the HFT

In this section, we describe the optimal quoting policy of the HFT and show that it is based on
thresholds. In the following theorem, we characterize the explicit structure of the quoting policy:

Theorem 1. The optimal quoting policy  ∗ of the HFT consists in quoting at the best bid and the

The limits ∗ and  ∗ are functions of the model parameters, but not of the state.

   We can interpret the result of Theorem 1 as follows. If the HFT receives a “buy” signal ( = 1) ,
he is going to act upon it by placing or keeping a limit order on the bid side of the book ( = 1) if his
current long inventory is not already too high (   ∗ ). But even if he receives a buy signal, he may
place a limit order of the ask side of the book instead ( = 1), that is, oﬀer to sell from his inventory,
if his current long inventory is already too high (  ∗ ).
   In other words, as long as his current inventory is between the action thresholds ∗ and  ∗ , the
HFT quotes in order to capture the spread in the direction suggested by his signal: he quotes on the
ask side if his signal says that the next market order will be a buy order, and on the bid side if his
signal says that the next market order will be a sell order. But outside these thresholds, his inventory
concerns take precedence and lead the HFT to potentially ignore his signal by systematically quoting
on the ask side when his positive inventory is too high and on the bid side when his inventory is too
negative, whatever the signal says.

Proof. Using the value iteration algorithm, we first establish by induction that ( 1) and ( −1)
are concave functions. Let (0) ( 1) = 0 and  (0) ( −1) = 0 for all . Then, the base case states that

In order to establish the concavity of  (+1) ( 1), we need the following lemma.

Lemma 2. Fix  ∈ R and define () , max { +  ( + 1)  ()}. () is concave if () is concave.

Proof. Define ∗ , min { : ()   +  ( + 1)}. For ∗ ≤ −2, ()−(+1) =  (+1)− (+2) ≤  and
is nondecreasing in  as  () is assumed to be concave. If  ≥ ∗ , ()−(+1) =  ()− (+1)   and
is also nondecreasing in  due to concavity of  (). If  = ∗ −1, ()−(+1) = + (+1)− (+1) = .
Thus, for all , () − ( + 1) is nondecreasing which makes () concave.

   A direct application of Lemma 2 also asserts that () , max { + ( − 1)  ()} is also concave
as it can be rewritten as () =  + max { ( − 1)  () − }.
                                                                        ©                                ª
  Using Lemma 2,  (+1) ( 1) becomes concave as both max 2             +  () ( + 1 1) () ( 1) and

max 2 + () ( − 1 1)  () ( 1) are concave. Since () ( 1) converges to ( 1), ( 1) is concave
in . Due to the same structure in (+1) ( −1), ( −1) is also concave.
                                                                                  
   Using Lemma 1, ∗ ( 1) = 1 if and only if ( 1) − ( + 1 1) ≤          2 .   Since ( 1) − ( + 1 1) is
nondecreasing in , there exists  ∗ such that

Similarly, ∗ ( 1) = 1 if and only if (−1 1)−( 1) ≥ − 2 . Since (−1 1)−( 1) is nondecreasing
in , there exists ∗ such that                           ⎧

   In order to prove the last part of the theorem, we will use the following intuitive lemma which
relates the value functions of diﬀerent signals.

using Lemma 3, we obtain (−∗  −1) − (−∗ + 1 −1)                             2   and (−∗ − 1 1) − (−∗  −1) ≤     2 .

Therefore, −∗ is the threshold limit for our optimal bid quote, i.e.,

3.3. Computation of the HFT’s Threshold Quoting Policy

In the previous section, we proved that the optimal market making policy involves thresholds. In this
section, we exploit this solution structure and provide an eﬃcient algorithm to solve for the threshold
limits ∗ and  ∗  and the value functions . We first prove that ∗ and  ∗ are finite:

                   2                       2
Lemma 4. ∗ ∈ [− (1−)  0] and  ∗ ∈ [0 (1−) ].

                                                                 16
Proof. ∗ cannot be positive as it is strictly better for the trader to sell the unit and both earn 2
and decrease the penalty cost. Similarly,  ∗ cannot be less than 0. We can obtain a lower bound for
∗ quite easily. We know that the discounted expected cost between decision epochs is ||. We know
                                                                                   2                    2
that the maximum discounted revenue from earning spreads is less than              1− .   Thus, ∗ ≥ − (1−) .
                                       2
Using the same reasoning,  ∗ ≤      (1−) .


   The following proposition provides a suﬃcient condition for threshold limits  and  to be optimal:

   If ( 1) − ( − 1 1)    2   and ( 1) − ( + 1 1)    2 ,   then the threshold limits (  ) are
optimal.

Proof. We use the fact that under any threshold policy, (  ), the inventory of the trader cannot
go beyond the band of [−  ]. When the inventory leaves the range of (  ), the trader will only
quote in one side of the market in order to pull the inventory back to this range. Since we know that
threshold policy is optimal, we compute ( 1) for the specified regions and replace ( −1) with
(− 1). At the end, we obtain the corresponding set of equations. Since the number of equations is
equal to the number of unknowns, we can solve for all value functions. If the value functions satisfy
the optimality equations of the quoting policy, (  ) must be optimal.

   Using this suﬃciency result, we can easily solve for the optimal threshold policies. We start by
initializing both  and  to 0. We then decrement  and increment  until they satisfy the optimality
equations given above.
   We now have all the elements in place to compute the HFT’s optimal strategy, and start by
providing a simple illustration.

3.4. Illustration: A Simulated Path

Figure 1 shows a simulated set of arrival times of signals and market orders by LFTs, the HFT’s
optimal quoting strategy in response, and the resulting transactions and inventory of the HFT. The
figure assumes the following parameter values:  = $006,  = 24 per minute,  = 080,  = 005,
 = 020, and  = 50 per minute. The optimal inventory limits that the HFT sets are ∗ = −2 and
 ∗ = 1.
   We observe that when the HFT buys one share, buy signals force the HFT not to quote at the bid
side. However, when the signal is sell, the HFT is in the quoting regime on both bid and ask sides.
This pattern leads to a cancellation of the bid quotes whenever the signal changes from sell to buy.
Similarly, when his inventory hits negative, the HFT starts not to quote at the ask side.

4.     Optimal Policy Comparative Statics

In this section, we will provide a comparative statics analysis of the model. We are specifically
interested in the dynamics of the HFT’s objective value and his optimal trading/inventory critical
limits, ∗ (“Sell Limit”) and  ∗ (“Buy Limit”), as a function of the model’s parameters: the arrival
rate of the LFTs, ; the arrival rate of the HFT’s signal, ; the accuracy of the signal, ; the bid-ask
spread, ; and the coeﬃcient of HFT inventory aversion, Γ These results serve primarily to explain
intuitively how the model works, and the dependence of the HFT’s optimal quoting policy on the
diﬀerent parameters.
     In each of the following subsections, we vary one of the parameters of the model at a time, leaving
the others fixed at the following values: the bid-oﬀer spread, , is $010, the arrival rate of market
orders,  is 100 (per minute), the arrival rate of signal,  is 100 (per minute), the signal accuracy, 
is 080, the discount rate  is 05 and the coeﬃcient of inventory aversion Γ is 02.


4.1. LFTs’ Market Orders Arrival Rate

We start by reporting in Figure 2 the dependence of the HFT’s optimal value and trading limits as
a function of the arrival rate of the market orders submitted by the LFTs, . Having more LFTs
in the market is unambiguously and monotonically good for the HFT, as their higher arrival rate
increases his trading opportunities. On the right panel, recall that the optimal policy for the HFT
consists in quoting according to the signal while inside the limits; quoting on the ask side of the book
independently of the signal when his inventory is above the buy limit; and quoting on the bid side of
the book independently of the signal when his inventory is below the sell limit. We see on the right
panel of Figure 2 that the HFT is willing to widen the trading bands where he systematically follows
his signal, since a higher value of  implies that the bid-ask spread will get captured by the HFT at
a higher rate, which in turn compensates the HFT for the additional potential inventory risk.
     Note that the optimal policy limits shown on the right panel of Figure 2 change in discrete incre-
ments. This is a consequence of the fact that the HFT is holding and quoting an integer number of
contracts, so the policy will only change if the underlying variable changes suﬃciently to justify an
integer change in the threshold limits.

4.2. HFT’s Signal Arrival Rate

Figure 3 shows the dependence of the HFT’s optimal value and his trading limits as a function of
the arrival rate of the signal, . As the arrival rate of the signal increases, the value to the HFT
increases, rapidly at first, and then reaches a plateau. This is because after some point the arrival of
the signal is already much faster than the arrival rate of the market orders,  which is held fixed for
this purpose. So the potential for achieving further profits is limited by the finite availability of LFTs:
this is matching the empirically observed limits to HFT profitability due to the absence of suﬃcient
trading opportunities, and is a limits-to-arbitrage type of situation. Beyond a certain point, better
and better trading technology (higher ) cannot deliver more trading opportunities when the pool of
LFTs () is bounded.
   The HFT’s optimal inventory limits gradually decrease in width with this increase in the signal
arrival rate, as the higher rate of orders’ updating align with the predictions for the next market order.
The HFT adjusts his quotes according to his inventory at a higher frequency, which enables him to
better manage his inventory risk.


4.3. Signal Accuracy

Next, we turn to the dependence of the HFT’s optimal policy on the accuracy of the signal he receives,
 When  = 12 the signal is uninformative, as buy and sell orders are conditionally and uncondi-

of the signal increases, the HFT’s value increases (left panel); the HFT is also more willing to trade
in the direction of the signal and overrule his inventory concerns, resulting in a wider trading band
(right panel).


4.4. Bid-Ask Spread

In Figure 5, we plot the optimal value and the inventory limits as a function of the bid-ask spread,
. When the bid-ask spread increases, it is intuitive that the HFT optimal value increases, as the
positive part of his objective function in (2.1) is simply increased without any adverse consequences.
We also observe that the HFT enlarges the width of his inventory limits: the increased reward in the
form of a higher value of  makes the HFT more willing to tolerate additional inventory risk.

4.5. HFT’s Inventory Aversion

Figure 6 illustrates the HFT’s optimal value and the inventory limits as a function of his coeﬃcient of
inventory aversion, Γ. Here, the comparative statics are the flip side of what we observed in Figure 5:
as Γ increases, the HFT is penalized more heavily for holding inventory and the negative part of his
objective function in (2.1) increases without any compensation. The HFT’s optimal value decreases
and the inventory limits become tighter.

5.     Implications of the Model for Market Structure

In this section, we consider empirical applications of our model. First, we will calibrate the model
parameters using real data. Using this calibration, we will study the implications of the model for
latency advantage, liquidity provision, welfare of LFTs and cancellation rates.


5.1. Main Calibration

In the upcoming empirical applications, we use the following values for our model parameters. We set
the bid-oﬀer spread, , to be $006, and arrival rate of market orders,  to be 24 (per minute). We
consider a range of  values such that the mean latency of the HFT (i.e., 1( + )) ranges from a
few milliseconds to a second. Finally, we use  = 080,  = 005 and Γ = 018 so that the optimal
inventory limits are empirically realistic. This calibration leads to ∗ = −2 and  ∗ = 1, consistent
with low HFT inventories.


5.2. HFT’s Latency Advantage

Is having a more frequent signal coupled with better trading technology, i.e., lower latency, beneficial
for the HFT? We answer this question by examining the impact of  on the HFT’s objective value
and discounted profit.
     Figure 7 illustrates the HFT’s net discounted profit after inventory costs (objective value) and the
corresponding discounted wealth generated by earning bid-oﬀer spreads as a function of mean latency.
We observe that decrease in mean latency provides higher trading profits to the HFT. Of course,


                                                                            23
these numbers are gross of the technological investment by the HFT that would most certainly be
necessary to decrease his latency. The gross gain in HFT objective value when going from 1 second to
1 millisecond latency is roughly 18%, corresponding to a gain in net wealth of around 12%. This gain
is due in the model to a wealth transfer from liquidity demanders, that is the LFTs, to the HFT.


5.3. Provision of Liquidity by the HFT

So, as he gets faster, the HFT gets richer. Yet, is he providing more liquidity to the LFTs? The
embedded Markov Chain in the HFT’s optimal market making strategy makes it possible to define
and compute a long-run rate of quoting on either or both sides of the market by the HFT at the
optimal policy, as follows. We first compute the optimal inventory limits, ∗ and  ∗ , and characterize
the optimal policy of the trader according to Theorem 1. Under this optimal policy, the inventory
of the trader will be in the set, [−  ]. At each inventory state, there are two possible signals, so
under the optimal policy the process is governed by a finite-state Markov Chain with the following
states. (− 1) (− −1)     (0 1) (0 −1)     ( 1) ( −1). Let opt be the probability transition
matrix defined on this state space under the optimal policy. Since the Markov Chain is aperiodic and
irreducible, a stationary distribution  exists for this Markov Chain which solves opt = . Let
( ) be the stationary probability corresponding to the state ( ).
    According to the optimal policy, if  = 1, the HFT provides liquidity on both sides of the market
when  ∈ (  ) and similarly if  = −1, the HFT provides liquidity on both sides of the market when
 ∈ (− −). Let quote be the long-run probability of quoting to buy and sell at the same time.
Then,
                                             X                      X
                                quote =              ( 1) +               ( −1)                      (5.1)
                                           ∈( )               ∈(−−)

As the mean latency decreases, the HFT improves his ability to keep his inventory under control by
predicting the order flow at a higher frequency. Consequently, the HFT has a higher chance of trading
with a LFT, who is a liquidity taker, and thereby earning the spread. In order to do that, the HFT
provides more liquidity to the market, on both sides, as his latency decreases, as shown in Figure 8.
This result is consistent with the empirical literature on HFT, which tends to suggest that HFTs have
a positive eﬀect on the liquidity and depth in the market (see, e.g., Hendershott et al. (2011) and
Menkveld (2013)).

5.4. Are LFTs Hurt by the HFT’s Speed Advantage?

So, more speed is good for the HFT’s (gross) profits, and he provides more liquidity by increase the
probability that he would quote on both sides of the market. How about the LFTs? In the model,
LFTs employ market orders: they demand liquidity and immediacy. In light of this, our proxy for the
welfare of LFTs is a function of the average fill rate that they are able to achieve for their market
orders, thanks to the quotes provided by the HFT. We therefore now turn to the impact of the HFT’s
latency on the long-run market order fill rate.
   Let fill be the unconditional long-run fill rate of a market order. fill is expected to be higher than
quote as the market order may get filled when the HFT is quoting on a particular side of the market.
Using the long-run stationary probabilities,
                                                                               ⎛                                            ⎞

                                                       fill = quote +  ⎝                  ( 1) +             ( −1)⎠

5.5. Order Cancellations by the HFT

Order cancellations are widely observed in empirical high frequency data. Hasbrouck and Saar (2009)
note that over one third of limit orders are cancelled within two seconds and term those “fleeting
orders”. Our model is consistent with this empirical fact and can generate a similar behavior when
optimal limits are not symmetric. In our model, an order cancellation consists in changing one of
the elements of the pair (   ), from 1 to 0 after the arrival of a signal event. Using the embedded
Markov Chain under the optimal policy, we can find the long-run probability that an existing limit
order will get cancelled by the HFT.
   When − is not equal to  , an existing order may be cancelled when the HFT’s signal fluctuates.
Cancellations will occur on the specific states of the HFT. We define the cancellation region as a
function of the signal as follows:
                                                             ⎧
                                                             ⎪
                                                             ⎨(  )\ ((  ) ∩ (− −))     if  = 1
                                                   C() ,
                                                             ⎪
                                                             ⎩(− −)\ ((  ) ∩ (− −))    if  = −1

   For example, when  = −2 and  = 1, C(1) = {1} and C(−1) = {−1}. Note that in these states,
the HFT is quoting on both sides of the market but need to cancel one of the existing quotes when


                                                                                 26
the signal changes as in the new state the HFT is no longer quoting at both sides. Consequently, a
cancellation of the order will happen if the signal received by the HFT changes before a trade occurs.
Let cancel be the unconditional long-run probability of an existing quote to be cancelled. We have:
                                                                       ⎛                                       ⎞
                                                                  2 ⎝    X                  X
                                                    cancel =                    ( 1) +             ( −1)⎠      (5.3)
                                                                2 + 
                                                                       ∈C(1)                ∈C(−1)


     Figure 10 illustrates the increasing long-run cancellation rate as the mean latency of the trader
decreases. Specifically, the long-run probability of order cancellations more than doubles to approx-
imately 30% when going from 1 second to approximately 1 millisecond latency, as signal revisions
become more frequent.

6.     Extension 1: Price Volatility

So far, the HFT in the model provides liquidity to the market, and the faster he is, the better. However,
one fundamental issue concerning the provision of liquidity by the HFT concerns the “quality” of that
liquidity that is being provided. Possible definitions of that quality vary, but most include the notion
that this liquidity is provided in a stable manner over time and over diﬀerent market environments.
Are HFTs fair weather liquidity providers ready to provide additional liquidity when the market
doesn’t really need it, only to remove it whenever the market becomes turbulent (and it would be

                                                                                 27
needed)? This question is of central importance for market stability, and to understand the potential
for systemic risk should HFTs suddenly suspend their provision of liquidity in response to a market
shock, resulting in an amplification of that shock.
   In our base model, the asset price was constant, which facilitated the analysis by reducing the
number of possible state transitions. It is possible nevertheless to extend the model by introducing
price volatility. Not surprisingly, assuming that price changes take the form of pure jumps, and that
these jumps are driven by a Poisson process is the most convenient way to proceed, as it adds one
more Poisson time clock to the two already considered ( and ). That is, let the fundamental price
of the security,  , be given by a compound Poisson process

                                                        
                                                        X
                                             = 0 +                                             (6.1)
                                                        =1


where  is a Poisson process with rate  counting the number of price jumps up to time  and  is
the stochastic magnitude of the th jump with E[ ] = 0, and a distribution subject to the requirement
that  remains positive. The variance of the price process is proportional to , and so the jump rate
represents the level of price volatility.
   Consistent with the notion that the HFT trades on the basis of short-lived market microstructure
information, we assume that the HFT receives no information regarding these fundamental price
movements; as before, his only signal is about the likely direction of the order flow. The optimal quoting
behavior of the HFT retains the same structure with a modified equation for the value function, with
revised transition probabilities due to price jumps. We can therefore derive the recursion for the value
functions using a similar approach to that of Section 3. The following lemma provides the resulting
dynamic programming equation:

   One advantage of our Poisson-based modeling approach is that the value function expressions in
Lemma 1 and Lemma 5 retain the same structure. The main diﬀerence is that with the introduction
of volatility, the probability of a trade in a single period, which is the only source of revenue for the
HFT, decreases. When the price jump occurs, the HFT can no longer trade with the LFT (and earn
the spread) with his existing limit orders.
   The optimal quoting behavior of the HFT retains the same structure:

Theorem 2. The optimal quoting policy  ∗ of the HFT consists in quoting at the best bid and the
best ask according to a threshold policy, i.e., there exist ∗ and  ∗ such that

The limits ∗ and  ∗ are functions of the model parameters, but not of the state.

   Note that the limits ∗ and  ∗ , now depend on the variability of the price, i.e., on the parameter :
for simplicity we use the same notation as before, but the limits are not the same as those of Theorem

1 unless  = 0. The proof of this theorem follows the same steps as the proof of Theorem 1, and is
omitted to save space.
   Figure 11 shows a simulated set of arrival times of signals and market orders by LFTs, the HFT’s
optimal quoting strategy and the resulting transactions and inventory of the HFT. The figure assumes
the following parameter values:  = $006,  = 24 per minute,  = 080,  = 005,  = 035,
 = 50 per minute, and  = 5 per minute. Optimal limits are ∗ = −2 and  ∗ = 1 as in the base
model. We observe that before the occurrence of the jump, HFT is quoting on the ask side as his
inventory is at the the buy limit. When the price jump occurs, the HFT’s existing ask quote becomes
inactive and he waits till the next signal event to peg his limit order to the new mid-price.
   Figure 12 shows how the HFT’s optimal value and threshold limits change when there are jumps
in prices, i.e., as a function of the arrival rate of price jumps, starting with 0 arrival, which matches
the base model.

   The impact of volatility on the quoting behavior of the HFT is another open question of interest.

Jumps.



This is an important concern for regulators. Specifically, during spikes in market volatility, we would
like to examine whether HFTs continue providing liquidity at the same rate or whether they tend
to withdraw their quotes from the marketplace. The model is capable of quantifying the change in
overall quoting activity by the HFT as a function of volatility, as a comparative statics analysis with
respect to the parameter . A higher arrival rate  of price jumps is synonymous in the model with
more volatility.
   We set the mean latency of the trader to be 60 milliseconds. The rate of jumps ranges from 0 to 50
per minute where the latter limit corresponds to the high volatility regime in which the probability of
a tick change is roughly two times the probability of a trade. Using this calibration, we can compute
the long-run rate of quoting at both sides of the market as a function of jump rates.
   Figure 13 illustrates the impact of volatility in the long-run probability of quoting. We observe
that in the high volatility regime, the rate of liquidity provision by the HFT on both sides of the
market decreases substantially. As the rate of jumps increases from 0 to 50, the long-run probability
of quoting decreases from roughly 58% to 30%, which corresponds to a drop of nearly 50% with respect
to the initial rate. The quoting rate by the HFT drops in stepwise increments as the rate of jumps
crosses certain thresholds. This is due to the integer inventory limits. For instance, in Figure 13, when
the rate of jumps is below 10 per minute approximately, the HFT sets the optimal limits as  = −2
and  = 1 When the rate crosses the 10 per minute level, the optimal policy requires quoting with
inventory limits  = −1 and  = 1
   In other words, the model does predict that the HFT protects himself against unanticipated price

jumps (over which he has no informational advantage) by quoting less frequently. We saw that in quiet
markets, HFTs do contribute liquidity resulting in a gradual improvement in standard market quality
metrics over time, which coincides with the growing prevalence of HFTs as market makers. But these
statistics are measured over long horizons, and may fail to account for the temporary dislocations that
appear in markets in the form of transitory minicrashes, since these are smoothed out over time.


7.    Extension 2: Duopolistic Market Making with Queuing Priority

The baseline model includes only a single HFT, who is enjoying monopolistic rents as the sole provider
of liquidity in the market. We now study a more realistic situation where the HFT is competing with a
second fast liquidity provider in order to capture the bid-ask spread earned by executing LFTs’ market
orders. For simplicity, this second liquidity provider is a nonstrategic trader. This means that we are
not solving a game between two strategic liquidity providers. Instead, we model the limit orders by
the second trader as arriving on (perhaps not too surprisingly by this point in the paper) yet another
Poisson clock, with rate . The second trader’s quoting actions are faster than the arrival rate of
market orders by LFTs (), but for the sake of concreteness slower than the HFT’s (), so we call this
second trader a medium-frequency trader (MFT). The HFT remains fully strategic, taking now into
account not only the arrival of the LFTs but now also the presence of the MFT he is competing with.


                                                                              32
Both the MFT and the HFT trade with the LFTs’ incoming market orders.
   Analyzing this situation, even with the MFT behaving non-strategically, necessitates that we model
an active limit order book, with price and time priority. There is now competition for priority and
the fully strategic HFT needs to take into account the state of the limit order book and the priority
or lack thereof that he would achieve when placing his own quotes.
   We assume that the MFT, like the HFT, has at most one share to buy or sell at the best bid and
ask queues. Suppose that order book events attributed to the MFT, which occur with a rate  have
equal likelihood to aﬀect either the best bid or ask queue. There are two possible event types that the
MFT can initiate in each queue. Consider the best bid queue. The MFT sends a limit order to the
best bid queue with rate 2 if he does not have an active order in this queue. On the other hand, if
he does have an active limit order, he will cancel this order with rate 2. The assumption of equal
submission and cancellation rates by the MFT is done for simplicity only and can easily be relaxed.
Fundamentally, this MFT is non-strategic; but the HFT is fully strategic. The analysis of the HFT’s
optimal strategy in this context proceeds by recognizing the presence of another Poisson time clock
( +  + ) in the model, with the HFT taking decisions at the arrival times of each event.
   Incorporating the MFT into the model, the state of the best bid or ask queue can be in one of five
states that are relevant for the HFT’s optimization. We will use the following notation to describe
each state:

   • “ee” denotes that the queue is empty, with neither HFT nor MFT currently quoting;

   • “hm” denotes that both the HFT and the MFT have active orders in the limit order book but
     the HFT has priority;

   • “he” denotes that only HFT has an active order, which then has priority;

   • “mh” denotes that both the MFT and the HFT have orders in the limit order book, but the
     MFT’s order has higher priority;

   • “me” denotes that there is only an order by the MFT in the book, which has priority.

   Consequently, in this framework the best bid and ask queue can be in one of 25 states by interacting
the 5 states for the bid queue with the 5 states for the ask queue. We can write the value function
corresponding to each state. For example, for the case of empty bid and ask queues, the corresponding

   The value function illustrates that the HFT has four actions to choose from. Each term in the
maximum appearing in (7.1) is the HFT’s payoﬀ when he chooses (   ) to be (0 0), (1 0), (0 1)
and (1 1) respectively. In each case, we now consider the possibility that the MFT may submit a
limit order at the best bid or best ask. If the HFT chooses to quote an order on either side of the
market, he gains priority for execution as the book is empty. However, if he does not quote, then in
the next period he may find the MFT’s order in the book and his order will have lower time priority.
We can solve for the optimal quoting policy of HFT in this framework. We employ the policy iteration
algorithm (see, e.g., Puterman (1994)) by truncating the HFT’s inventory after a certain limit. Since
the interesting inventory regime of the HFT remains in a very narrow band around zero, the truncation
has minimal impact.


7.1. Duopoly: Splitting the Rent

We first investigate the impact of priority due to queueing in the limit order book. We solve for
the HFT’s optimal policy and compute the optimal value he is able to achieve when competing for
priority with the MFT, and compare to our baseline model where the HFT is a monopolistic provider
of liquidity. We use the same calibration of the model parameters as in the illustrations contained in
Section 2. In the absence of the second trader,  = 0. As for the MFT, we assume that  = 50. This
calibration reflects the modeling choice that the MFT () is slower than the high frequency trader
(), but the MFT’s quoting actions are faster than the arrival rate of market orders by the LFTs ().

Fig. 14. HFT Optimal Values in the Monopoly (No Queuing) and Duopoly (Queuing) Situations.



   Figure 14 illustrates the impact of queueing on the HFT’s value due to the presence of the MFT,
as a function of mean latency in the baseline (monopoly) and extended (duopoly) models. First, we
observe that in the presence of the MFT, the HFT loses some of his profits to the MFT. Comparing the
slopes in the value function in both regimes, we also observe that higher latency is more detrimental
when the HFT is extracting monopolistic rents in the absence of the MFT: with the MFT present,
not being as fast is less costly for the HFT.
   Looking now at the eﬀect on the HFT and MFT, we see that they are eﬀectively splitting the rent
extracted from LFTs: as shown in Figure 15 the rent gets split between the two market makers. Not
surprisingly, the faster the HFT (holding the speed of the MFT fixed), the more of the rent he is able
to capture.


7.2. Duopoly vs. Monopoly: Implications for the LFTs

Figure 16 shows that LFTs are better oﬀ when market makers compete, compared to the monopolistic
HFT situation: the fill rate for their orders increases, providing a key improvement to the liquidity of
the market. The mean latency on the x-axis is the combined latency of the market makers, 1( + )
in the monopoly situation and 1 ( +  + ) in the duopoly situation.

8.      Comparing Diﬀerent HFT Regulations

Regulators around the globe are paying increasing attention to the impact of HFTs on the markets
they supervise, and have started debating, developing and implementing policies designed to stem the
rise of HFTs. The basic premise is that markets should remain primarily platforms to exchange risk,
and not become race tracks with the potential to ultimately discourage slower users from participating.
      In this section, we study the impact of some frequently proposed, and in some cases already enacted,
regulatory policies on the HFT’s objective value and provision of liquidity to the market. We view
additional liquidity in good times as being largely useless, and even counterproductive especially if it
dries up when markets experience volatility. So we view as a desirable outcome of a policy a reduced
provision of liquidity by HFTs in good (low volatility) times, in exchange for an increased provision
of liquidity in bad (high volatility) times. Such a countercyclical impact would be desirable for some
of the same reasons that advocate for banks’ capital requirements to increase in booms, in order to
limit the provision of speculative credit, and decrease in recessions, in order to speed up the economic
recovery.
      We specifically examine the impact of three widely discussed HFT policies through the prism of
our model: imposing a transaction tax on each trade, setting minimum-time limits before orders can
be cancelled, and taxing the cancellations of limit orders.
      These policies, or combinations thereof, capture the main elements that have been proposed in
various countries, and in some cases already implemented. In 2012, France introduced a 02% tax
on transactions in large stocks, and a 001% tax on HFTs penalizing them for a high rate of order
cancellations within a half-second3 ,4 . Similarly, in Italy, a tax of 002% on orders issued and then
cancelled within half a second, once above a threshold, has been introduced5 . The Deutsche Börse
introduced a tax in 2012 that charges HFTs for high “order-to-trade” ratios6 as does the London Stock
Exchange7 . Norwegian regulators too consider taxing traders who submit a large number of orders
relative to their actual executions8 . The CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has had for
a number of years message volume caps, designed to prevent excessive numbers of orders from being

discourage excessive order placement10 . Canadian regulators too began increasing the fees charged to
HFTs that flood the market with orders11 , while Indian regulators are studying ways to curb HFTs12 .
On the other hand, Brazil appears to welcome the influx of HFTs13 . Australian regulators want HFTs
to implement a “kill switch” to prevent future flash crashes, and are considering a tax charge, although
they appear to take a more benevolent view of HFTs than some of their counterparts in Europe14 .
      In January 2013, European Union finance ministers approved a transaction tax in Germany, France,
Italy, Spain and seven other Eurozone countries15 ; the UK, concerned about the impact on the City,
is opposed16 . It seems unlikely at present that the initially far-reaching package will get implemented
as proposed, if ever17 . The German government has advanced legislation that would, among other
things, force HFTs to register as such with the government18 and limit their ability to rapidly place
and cancel orders19 . The European Parliament has voted to require HFTs to honor the quotes they
submit for at least half a second; imposes a minimum half-second delay on executing orders in a bid;
possible use of circuit breakers to interrupt a sudden market plunge; and fee structures that would
discourage excessive algorithmic trades20 . These rules could potentially apply to all 27 member states
of the European Union if governments were to give their approval. In the US, the SEC and CFTC are
discussing similar kinds of regulatory actions21 , while transaction tax legislation has been introduced
in the Senate, although with little prospects of passage. Not surprisingly, many trade associations
representing trading firms are opposing these proposals22 .
      We find that imposing minimum time-limits and cancellation taxes induce the HFT to quote more
on both sides of the market, whereas transaction taxes do not improve this measure of liquidity. One
important finding is that when minimum time-limits are in eﬀect, the fill rate of market orders does not

decrease substantially in the presence of higher volatility. Of course, this analysis remains dependent
on the assumptions of the model, and excludes possible alternative responses by HFTs, such as trading
on an alternative, non-regulated, venue.


8.1. Tobin Tax: Taxing High Frequency Trades

The first policy we consider consists in taxing each trade that a HFT executes. Leaving aside the
question of identifying HFT trades (perhaps by requiring HFT firms to register with the regulators,
as has been proposed in Germany), a financial transactions tax is nothing new. Originally known as a
“stamp duty,” it was first implemented at the London Stock Exchange in the 17th century, was later
advocated by Keynes on the grounds that speculation by uninformed traders increased volatility, and
then by Tobin as a means of reducing currency fluctuations.
       The argument in favor of a transactions tax is that financial trading is under-taxed relative to
the rest of the economy; this encourages excessive trading, by HFTs in particular, which in turn
undermines financial stability as the ability of HFTs to get out of the market quickly undermines the
market’s liquidity when it is most needed.
       Of course, the law of unintended consequences may apply, as sophisticated traders may simply move
their trading to financial instruments or jurisdictions not subject to the tax. Sweden for instance
introduced a tax on the purchase or sale of stocks in 1984; the tax was repealed in 1990 after the
country experienced a large displacement of trades.23 A second argument often made against the tax
is that it will depress economic activity by imposing a large burden on the financial sector. These two
arguments are somewhat self-contradictory: either the tax is easily avoided so as to be inconsequential,
or it imposes a large economic penalty, but not both together24 .
       In the framework of our model, a transactions tax is straightforward to analyze. Suppose that the
HFT pays 2 dollars each time a market order crosses one of his limit orders. From the perspective
of the HFT, the transaction tax, , merely reduces the half bid-oﬀer spread that the HFT earns from
each trade. Defining the tax-adjusted bid-oﬀer spread as ̃ ≡  − , we can analyze the impact of the
tax policy on the objective value of the HFT and his long-run rate of quoting using the exact same
equations developed so far. Figure 17 displays four graphs illustrating objective value, long-run fill
rates, long-run quoting rates with respect to the Tobin tax rate and finally the long-run fill rates as a

function of volatility in the presence and absence of tax regulation. We use the same parameter values
as in Section 4 to facilitate the comparison with earlier applications.
      Figure 17 illustrates that the HFT’s objective value is decreasing with higher taxes that are up to
5% of the bid-oﬀer spread, , i.e., with a maximum  considered of 30 bps in line with the proposals
being considered or already implemented in Europe. This is consistent with our earlier comparative
statics for  since this policy is equivalent from the point of view of the HFT to reducing the bid-oﬀer
spread earned by the HFT. We observe that in the long-run transaction taxes do not incentivize the
HFT to quote more on both sides of the market. If the taxes are high enough, in fact, the HFT’s
long-run rate of quoting actually decreases, as seen in Figure 17. These predictions of the model
are consistent with what has been observed in Italy following the introduction of the Tobin tax: the
average daily trading volume for Italian-domiciled stocks has fallen by nearly 40% in March compared
to January and February 2013.25 . Lastly, we investigate how market liquidity, measured by long-run
rate of fill-rates, changes with respect to volatility when the Tobin tax is implemented. Setting  = 15
bps, we observe that the HFT’s quoting has the same sensitivity to volatility when compared to the
scenario in the absence of a Tobin tax.


8.2. Speed Bumps for HFTs: Imposing a Minimum Time Before a Quote Can Be Cancelled

Another possible policy consists in imposing a minimum time-limit on each limit order submitted by
the HFT. This is a widely discussed policy among regulators and exchanges. European and Australian
regulators have also recommended “resting-periods” for orders in order to slow-down HFTs’ activity.
One alternative policy might involve bunching together incoming orders every few milliseconds, so a
HFT would face queuing risk, as well as a minimum waiting time before a cancellation. EBS, one of
the major trading platforms in the foreign exchange market, has discussed such a proposal with its
users.
      We can incorporate random minimum time-limits in our model as follows. Although the policy
proposals all suggest a fixed waiting time, typically of half a second, it will come as no surprise to the
reader by this point of the paper that it is actually more convenient to analyze a version of the policy
where the waiting time before a cancellation is allowed is random, and is itself derived from a Poisson
process. The arrival rate of that Poisson process controls the expected amount of waiting time before
a quote can be cancelled. That is, we suppose that each active limit order cannot be cancelled before

a random time amount,  cancel , which is exponentially distributed with mean duration 2. When the
HFT is quoting on both sides of the market, the average time limit till a possible cancellation on either
side of the market is 1. In this case, state transitions will occur at rate ( +  + ) with respect to
the base model.
   The relevance of this cancellation constraint depends upon whether the HFT has in place a limit
order or not. So we need to add one more state variable,  ∈ {00 10 01 11}, which tracks the HFT’s
active limit orders that cannot yet be cancelled:  = 00 means that the HFT has no active limit orders
that cannot be cancelled, 10 (resp. 01) means an active limit buy (resp. sell) order, and 11 active limit
orders on both sides. When  6= 00, this state variable will limit the available actions to the HFT. For
example, when  = 01, the HFT must always choose  = 1.
   Using the same discrete-time transformation principle for Poisson processes as in Section 3.1, we
can obtain the optimality equations. The following lemma provides the optimality equations for  = 1:

   Lemma 6 illustrates that the HFT has 4 actions to choose from only when  = 00. He only chooses
the value of  when  = 10 and only chooses the value of  when  = 01. When  = 11, he has no
choice other than to continue quoting at both sides of the market, as neither order can be cancelled
yet. We can again solve for the optimal quoting policy of the HFT in this framework. We employ the
policy iteration algorithm by truncating the HFT’s minimum and maximum inventory.
   Figure 18 illustrates the objective value of the HFT as a function of the average time-limit, 1,
expressed in milliseconds. Note that the limiting case  → ∞, meaning that the minimum time-limit
is zero for active quotes, reverts to our base model. As the average time-limit increases, we observe
that the objective value of the HFT decreases. This tax policy is also good for overall liquidity as
measured by the long-run fill rate of market orders and long-run probability of HFT quoting.
   This tax policy has another desirable property: when the time limits are in eﬀect, the HFT
becomes less sensitive to the market volatility, i.e., his liquidity provision is more stable. The bottom-
right graph in Figure 18 highlights this stability. Setting the average minimum time limit to 20 ms

Fig. 18. Imposing a Minimum Time Before a Quote Can Be Cancelled.

Note: The left panels plot the eﬀect of imposing minimum time limits before orders can be cancelled on the
HFTs’ value and his provision of liquidity. The right panels display the eﬀect of the minimum time on the
fill-rate of LFTs’ orders (upper panel) and the sensitivity of the fill rate to volatility (in the form of price jumps)
before and after the minimum time regulation (lower panel).


for each active quote, we observe that long-run fill rates decrease only slightly whereas in the absence
of the regulation, the decrease is substantial.


8.3. Taxing Limit Order Cancellations

The last policy we consider consists in taxing the HFT whenever he cancels an existing quote. One
concern about the reported higher liquidity due to HFT activity is that the provided liquidity is very
short-lived, or “phantom”, i.e., HFT cancels his quote before LFTs get a chance to trade with it. This
tax proposal aims to make this type of HFT operation costlier.
    Similar to our procedure in Section 8.2, we can incorporate this tax policy in our framework by
including one more state variable,  ∈ {00 10 01 11}, which tracks the HFT’s most recent action.


                                                                                                        44
We will assume that the HFT pays  dollars as a penalty for each cancelled order. For example,
if the HFT chooses action (0 1) when  = 10, he will pay a cancellation tax of . Using the same
discrete-time transformation as in Section 3.1, we can obtain the optimality equations. The following
lemma provides the optimality equations for  = 1:

     The optimality equations are similar to those of the base model except that the HFT is penalized
when he cancels an active limit order. We numerically solve for the optimal quoting policy of the HFT
in the presence of cancellation taxes. We again employ the policy iteration algorithm by truncating
the HFT’s minimum and maximum inventory.
     Figure 19 considers the impact of such cancellation taxes. We consider cases where  is as high
as 5% of the bid-oﬀer spread, , i.e., 30 bps, as in Section 8.1. We observe that the objective value
of the HFT decreases in the presence of cancellation taxes. When there are cancellation taxes, the
HFT tries to set symmetric optimal inventory limits, if possible, to avoid any cancellation. That is,
as soon as the tax is introduced the HFT changes the optimal limits from  = −2,  = 1 to  = −2,
 = 2. With higher inventory limits, the HFT begins to quote more on both sides of the market,
which increases the long run fill rates and probability of quoting.
     One drawback of this tax policy is that the HFTs’ liquidity provision is still sensitive to market
volatility. Setting  = 15 bps, we observe that the HFT’s quoting has the same sensitivity to volatility
when compared to the base scenario without any regulation. When there are price jumps, the HFT
instantly lowers the inventory limits which adversely aﬀect the long-run fill rate of market orders and
hurts the LFTs.


9.     Conclusions

We proposed a theoretical model of dynamic trading with a strategic HFT. The model is based on
infinite horizon dynamic optimization. We superpose diﬀerent Poisson processes running on diﬀerent
time clocks to represent the arrival of diﬀerent elements of market information and orders, resulting in
a tractable and flexible framework. We characterize the optimal market making strategy of the HFT.

Fig. 19. Taxing Limit Order Cancellations.

Note: The left panels plot the eﬀect of cancellation taxes on the HFTs’ value and his provision of liquidity.
The right panels display the eﬀect of a cancellation tax on the fill-rate of LFTs’ orders (upper panel) and the
sensitivity of the fill rate to volatility (in the form of price jumps) before and after a cancellation tax regulation
(lower panel).




                                                                                                 47
   The model reproduces many important stylized facts about HFTs that have been documented,
including their propensity to place and cancel large numbers of orders and to provide plenty of liquidity
when the market is quiet but suddenly decrease their provision of liquidity when volatility picks up.
Under this policy, we find that the HFT’s long-run rate of quoting on both sides of the market increases
when he gets faster. We observe that lower latency also drives higher cancellation rates which could
be as high as 30% in a realistically calibrated model. Our model also quantifies the impact of higher
volatility on liquidity provision, with the HFT providing less liquidity when volatility increases.
   Next, we introduced competition for order flow with a nonstrategic medium frequency trader, and
computed the change in the HFT’s optimal quoting policy. We find that when market makers compete,
they split the rent extracted from LFTs, liquidity provision increases and LFTs tend to be better oﬀ.
   Finally, we analyzed in the context of the model the impact of three widely discussed HFT policies:
imposing a transaction tax on each trade, setting minimum-time limits before orders can be cancelled,
and taxing the cancellations of limit orders. We find that imposing minimum time-limits and cancel-
lation taxes induce the HFT to quote more on both sides of the market, whereas transaction taxes do
not improve this measure of liquidity. One important finding is that when minimum time-limits are in
eﬀect, the fill rate of LFTs’ market orders by the HFT does not decrease substantially in the presence
of higher price volatility, unlike the situation without minimum resting times.
