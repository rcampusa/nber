                                          ABSTRACT

A Ugandan government program allowed groups of young people to submit proposals to start
skilled enterprises. Among 535 eligible proposals, the government randomly selected 265 to
receive grants of nearly $400 per person. Blattman et al. (2014) showed that, after four years, the
program raised employment by 17% and earnings 38%. This paper shows that, rather than
rewarding the government in elections, beneficiaries increased opposition party membership,
campaigning, and voting. Higher incomes are associated with opposition support, and we
hypothesize that financial independence frees the poor to express political preferences publicly,
being less reliant on patronage and other political transfers.

1     Introduction
What are the political impacts of development programs? Governments that deliver public
or private goods to their constituents hope to be rewarded at the polls, even when those
policies are “programmatic” in that they are targeted based on need or merit rather than
in a political or clientelistic manner. There are good reasons for this belief. In developed
democracies there are longstanding arguments and evidence that voters punish or reward
incumbents for effective policies, for general economic conditions, and even for events well
beyond the government’s control.1 Forward-looking voters may also be swayed by effective
government programs. For instance, they could view programmatic policies as a signal that
the regime is either competent or taking a policy stance that matches voters’ preferences.2
    There is now a good deal of evidence that voters reward governments for programmatic
policies in middle-income democracies, especially from various social safety net programs in
Latin America. Golden and Min (2013), reviewing this evidence, note that most studies have
found that as transfers to a district rise, voter turnout and incumbent vote share tend to
rise as well.3 Nonetheless it is probably too early to draw firm conclusions. Golden and Min
not only note some exceptions to this pattern, but also raise concerns of publication bias
against null findings.4 Indeed, as this paper will show, transfer programs have sometimes
unexpected political consequences.
    Also striking is that we know very little about the effects of programmatic policies on
politics in low-income countries. The evidence we have comes mainly from high- and middle-
income countries, and it is especially scarce on programs that are not explicitly clientelistic
    1
      A large literature argues that voters reward incumbents for general economic conditions (“sociotropic
voting”) because they themselves are doing better or stand to gain (“pocketbook voting”) (e.g. Kinder and
Kiewiet, 1981; Gomez and Wilson, 2001). Achen and Bartels (2004) and Healy et al. (2010) also show that
voters punish politicians for irrelevant events, such as shark attacks or sports game outcomes, suggesting
voters may follow a form of blind retrospection.
    2
      These largely programmatic appeals and competition are at the heart of a more traditional theory of
responsible party government and programmatic politics rather than patronage-based government (Kitschelt
and Wilkinson, 2007; Golden and Min, 2013).
    3
      In Uruguay, Manacorda et al. (2011) find that households that benefited from a CCT are 11 to 13
percentage points more likely to support the current government than the previous one. In Colombia, Baez
et al. (2012) show that recipients of health and education transfers in Colombia were more likely to register,
vote and support the government. In Romania, Pop-Eleches and Pop-Eleches (2012) use a discontinuity in
a cash transfer program to the poor to show that receipt buys turnout and support for the incumbent. In
Mexico, De La O (2013) finds that villages randomized into a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program have
7% higher turnout and 9% higher incumbent vote share (though Imai et al. (2016) have pointed out that this
is primarily driven by increases in registration rather than higher turnout by registered voters, and Schober
(2016) argues that the effect is limited to turnout and not incumbent vote share).
    4
      Imai et al. (2016) evaluate a large-scale health policy experiment in Mexico supported by all political
parties and find that (perhaps because of this broad support across parties) little effect of the program on
vote turnout or shares for the incumbent regime.

or political pork—that is, programs that are legislated by a particular political party but
distributed in a relatively non-partisan way such that benefits cannot easily be withdrawn
or tied to political support.5 Patronage and pork are common and so deservedly get a lot of
attention in the literature. But parties also compete programmatically, and it is important
to understand the political rewards of programmatic policies as well.
    Another reason to be interested in the poorest countries is that many of their social
programs are funded by foreign aid. In Uganda, for example, foreign governments and the
World Bank fund the government to implement dozens of health, education, and economic
programs—totaling about 40% of the national budget. The specific program we study was
financed by the government, but with a concessionary loan and expertise from the World
Bank.
    If poor voters reward incumbents for foreign-funded development programs, then aid
could insulate incumbents from competition and accountability to citizens, possibly assist-
ing them to become more authoritarian or extractive.6 Uganda, for example, has a semi-
autocratic regime that tries to use programs and patronage to insulate itself from political
competition. It seems important to understand how large aid programs affect local politics.
But in spite of the undoubtedly high political stakes of national development programs,
Western donors prefer to view their development interventions in solely technical terms,
overlooking how their reforms and resources affect or are affected by the balance of political
power in the country.7
    In 2006-07 Uganda’s central government, with assistance from The World Bank, devel-
oped the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) to help poor and unemployed young adults
become self-employed artisans, such as carpenters or tailors. YOP targeted the under-
developed northern districts, and invited young people in these districts to form small groups
and submit proposals on how they would use a cash grant to train in and start independent
trades. Thousands of groups applied. Local government nominated proposals for funding
after being reviewed for technical qualifications by a government bureaucracy created for
the program. In 2008, the government bureaucratic agency identified 535 eligible groups
and worked with the authors to award the grants randomly to 265. Successful groups re-
ceived one-time grants to pay for training and start-up costs. The grants averaged $382 per
group member—roughly the annual income of the average applicant. A majority of people
   5
      Thachil (2011), for instance, has argued that the BJP political party in India benefited electorally when
its grassroots organizations provided generalized social welfare services to a non-traditional demographic of
poor and low-caste households.
    6
      See Moss et al. (2006) for a review of this literature. Besley and Persson (2011) also find that taxation
develops state capacity and accountability, and aid can undermine both.
    7
      This idea of aid donors as “anti-politics machines” has been argued generally by Ferguson (1990) and in
the specific case of Uganda by Tangri and Mwenda (2008).


                                                      3
attributed the program to the incumbent government, though foreign donors also received
significant credit.
    YOP had large impacts on employment and earnings. We experimentally evaluated the
economic impacts in 2010 and 2012 in a companion paper (Blattman et al., 2014) and found
that most group members invested the grants, partly in training but mainly in physical
capital. Four years later, YOP participants were more than twice as likely to be practicing
a skilled trade than the control group, and had 38% higher earnings and 17% more hours of
work. The absolute income gains are small (just under a dollar a day in purchasing power
parity or PPP terms). But this is a huge gain in relative terms for otherwise very poor
people. Consequently, YOP is one of the few examples of an employment program that has
documented substantial, cost-effective impacts on work levels and earnings.
    In this paper we compare successful and unsuccessful applicants to understand the polit-
ical impacts of YOP. Did these poor and largely poorly educated recipients reward incum-
bents at the polls for good policy and programs? If so, this could be a powerful incentive
for political parties to compete based on programmatic appeals instead of patronage.
    We find an unexpected result: three years after the program was completed, not only
were YOP beneficiaries no more likely to vote for the ruling party than the control group,
they were also more likely to work to get opposition parties elected. We document the
program, the randomized evaluation, the direct economic impacts, the longer term effects
on political behavior, and possible explanations for the results we obtain. We cannot draw
firm conclusions from the evidence, but overall the patterns are consistent with the idea that
programmatic policies and economic success free people to express their political preferences
and decouple them from clientelistic systems.
    For instance, YOP had little impact on election turnout or approval ratings for the ruling
party and incumbent President. If anything there was a modest decrease in support for the
President and ruling party. Eighty-eight percent of the control group reported that they
voted to reelect the President in 2011, but those who received YOP were 4 percentage points
less likely to do so. Given the small opposition vote share (12%), this increased opposition
vote share by a quarter.
    Unexpectedly, those who received YOP were also almost twice as likely to say that they
had joined the opposition or actively worked to get opposition parties elected (an increase of
3 percentage points on a base of about 4 percentage points). The effects were even larger in
more local elections: in electing district counselors, YOP applicants assigned to the program
were more than 21 percentage points less likely to vote for an incumbent ruling candidate
than an opposition one.
    Naturally, one explanation is systematic measurement error: that people who received


                                              4
YOP are simply more likely to tell us they voted for the opposition (or control group members
are more likely to report they voted for the President). While possible, we don’t see any
treatment effects on expressed preferences or support for either party. Rather we see only
treatment effects on voting and other public political behavior (such as encouraging others
to vote for a particular party). If survey measurement error is correlated with treatment, it
is not clear why reported behavior would be affected but not party preferences.
    Another possible explanation is that wealth and financial independence free voters from
clientelistic networks and allow them to act on their true political preferences—an effect
consistent with evidence from South Africa, Mexico and the Philippines (Magaloni, 2006;
Larreguy et al., 2015; De Kadt and Lieberman, 2015; Hite-Rubin, 2015). Three patterns in
Uganda are consistent with this view. First, voting and public actions for the opposition
change more than stated party preferences. Second, we see a strong correlation between
earnings and this public opposition support in our sample, suggestive evidence that this effect
of YOP on political action is mediated by the income change. Finally, YOP beneficiaries
were also slightly less likely to be mobilized to turn out to vote by election operatives.
    There are interesting parallels here to “modernization theory”—the idea that economic
development drives democracy. Welzel et al. (2003), for instance, argue that material security
increases people’s preferences for liberty and expressive political action. Our results are
consistent with this view, though we do not have the attitudinal data to test it more directly.
    There are other possible explanations for the null effect on support for the ruling party.
Our sample could simply attribute the program to foreign funders and either fail to reward (or
punish) the incumbent government.8 Or they could see that they were in fact selected by the
government, but randomly did not receive the program, and so have no reason to reward the
incumbent.9 While possible, these explanations do not seem to fit the patterns we observe.
First, they do not explain the increase in voting and public support for the opposition.
Second, people vary in whether they attribute the program to the government and recall that
assignment was random, and the treatment effects are not statistically significantly different
in these subgroups. Nonetheless, the difference is in the direction we might expect (YOP
recipients who attribute the program to the government or recall assignment was random are
less likely to support the opposition) and so we cannot dismiss these explanations outright.
    We did not anticipate these results, and political behavior was not a primary or prespec-
   8
     Using survey experiments in India, Dietrich and Winters (2014) find suggestive evidence that politicians
lose reputation when programs are revealed as foreign-funded.
   9
     In Bangladesh, Guiteras and Mobarak (2014) find that politicians opportunistically try to associate
themselves with foreign-funded projects by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). When the politician’s
role in program assignment wasn’t clear, citizens gave the political partial credit. When the assignment rules
and attribution of the projects were clear, however, citizens did not reward the politician at all.



                                                      5
ified outcome of the initial YOP evaluation. Thus, we must take these results with some
caution. Nonetheless, this study is a good example of how large program evaluations in
developing countries can be theoretically generative, by providing new and sometimes coun-
terintuitive results. In particular, we advance the hypothesis that anti-poverty programs
may free poor people from patronage networks and other pressures, enabling them to vote
their true preferences.
    This particular program evaluation is also important because there are relatively few
examples of government interventions that increase incomes. Most microfinance and skills
training interventions are implemented by NGOs and seldom have any impact on employ-
ment or earnings.10 Unconditional cash transfers, livestock, or asset transfer programs have
had more success at increasing employment and earnings, but these studies have generally
not measured changes in political behavior.11 This suggests there is an important opportu-
nity to conduct more “downstream experiments”, collecting political opinion data from the
beneficiaries of existing evaluations of government programs.


2      Context, intervention, and experiment
2.1     Setting
Uganda, a small landlocked country in east Africa, is extremely poor but with a stable
and growing economy.12 Since 2006, two major parties and a number of smaller ones have
competed in national elections every five years, but the ruling National Resistance Movement
(NRM) party and its leader, President Yoweri Museveni, have been in power continuously
for 30 years.
    While there is some competition at the local level, the ruling party suppresses political
opposition at the national level, and cements its position through various forms of patronage.
For this reason, most analysts consider Uganda a “hegemonic party system” or a “multiparty
autocracy” (e.g. Tripp, 2010; Magaloni et al., 2013).
    Museveni and the NRM are committed to economic growth and poverty reduction through
economically liberal policies. Uganda is commonly called a Western “donor darling” for this

      Shortly before the program, in 2007, it had a population of about 30 million and GDP per capita of
roughly $330. Real gross domestic product grew 6.5% per year from 1990 to 2007, inflation was under 5%,
and poverty rates were falling (Government of Uganda, 2007). This growth puts Uganda’s GDP per capita
slightly above the sub-Saharan average.

reason (Jones, 2009). Indeed, at the outset of this study, foreign aid constituted about 40%
of the national budget (Hickey, 2013). The ruling party’s development plans have mainly
focused on modernization and structural transformation in addition to poverty alleviation
(Hickey, 2005, 2013). At the same time, critics have argued that the ruling party has used aid
in general, and rural development programs in particular, to solidify support in the context
of increasing opposition competition (Mwenda and Tangri, 2005).

Northern underdevelopment

Northern Uganda is home to a third of the country’s population, and its economy historically
focused on subsistence agriculture, cattle herding, and some commercial agriculture. While
Uganda’s income per capita doubled in the past two decades, this growth was concentrated
in south-central Uganda (Hausmann et al., 2014). One of the government’s recent priorities
has been to develop the north of the country (Government of Uganda, 2007).
    The north is more distant from trade routes and, as an area of early opposition support,
received less public investment from the 1980s onward, especially for power and roads. The
north was also held back by insecurity. From 1987 to 2006 a low-level insurgency destabi-
lized north-central Uganda, and wars in Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo fostered
mild insecurity in the northwest. Cattle rustling and armed banditry were commonplace
in the northeast. As a result, in 2006 the government estimated that nearly two-thirds of
northern people were unable to meet basic needs, just over half were literate, and most were
(under)employed in subsistence agriculture (Government of Uganda, 2007).
    In 2003, peace came to Uganda’s neighbors and Uganda’s government increased efforts
to pacify, control, and develop the north. By 2006, the military pushed the rebels out of the
country and began to disarm cattle-raiders. The government also began to improve northern
infrastructure. Neighboring countries, especially South Sudan, began to grow rapidly. With
this political uncertainty resolved, and growth in linked markets, by 2008 the northern
economy began to catch up.

A programmatic approach to northern recovery and development

Northern development serves at least two government objectives. One is economic, as the
government tries to maximize growth and minimize poverty. The other is political. As mul-
tiparty elections become more and more competitive, and as NRM support in the capital has
waned, the ruling party appears to be interested in building a broader base of political sup-
port in areas such as the north. While pork and patronage around elections is commonplace,
the national government has also pursued a set of broad-based and relatively non-politicized


                                              7
programs that serve its broader development objectives.
    From 2003 to 2010, the centerpiece of the government’s northern development and secu-
rity strategy was a decentralized development program, the Northern Uganda Social Action
Fund, or NUSAF. NUSAF was Uganda’s second-largest development program, after the
national agricultural extension program. Starting in 2003, communities and groups could
apply under various NUSAF cash grants components for either community infrastructure
construction or livestock for the “ultra-poor”.
    The government wanted to do more to boost non-agricultural employment. To do so, in
2006 it announced a third NUSAF component: the Youth Opportunities Program, or YOP.


2.2     The Youth Opportunities Program
YOP invited groups of young adults, aged roughly 16 to 35, to apply for cash grants in order
to start a skilled trade such as carpentry or tailoring. The theory underlying the program
was that young unemployed people had high returns to investments in vocational skills and
equipment, but had no starting capital and were credit constrained, and hence were unable
to reach their potential.
    In 2006 there was little hard evidence on this theory and strategy, especially in Africa,
and one could reasonably worry that giving $7,500 to a group of inexperienced and low-
skilled 25-year-olds was not a successful development strategy. But in the ensuing years a
growing base of evidence has suggested that poor people in low-income countries generally
have high returns to capital and other inputs into microenterprise development (Banerjee
and Duflo, 2011; Blattman and Ralston, 2015; Banerjee et al., 2015).13
    YOP had five key elements:

   1. People had to apply as a group. One reason was administrative convenience: it was
      easier to verify and disburse to a few hundred groups rather than thousands of people.
      Another reason is that, in the absence of formal monitoring, officials hoped groups
      would be more likely to implement proposals. The YOP groups in our sample ranged
      from 10 to 40 people, averaging 22. They are mostly from the same village and typically
      represent less than 1% of the local population.14 In our sample, most groups are mixed
  13
     Like most of rural Africa, potential entrepreneurs have virtually no access to capital or loans. Formal
insurance was unknown and almost no formal lenders were present in the north at the outset of this study in
2008. While village savings and loan groups are common, loan terms seldom extend beyond three months,
with annual interest rates of 100 to 200%. This is common even with non-profit microfinance, and one reason
microfinance seldom leads to investment and poverty alleviation (Banerjee et al., 2013). Because of high
fees, real interest rates on savings are negative.
  14
     Half the groups existed already, often for several years, as farm cooperatives, or sports, drama, or
micro-finance clubs. New groups formed specifically for YOP were often initiated by a respected community
member (e.g. teachers, local leaders, or existing tradespersons) and sought members through social networks.

                                                     8
      (about one-third female on average), 5% of groups are all female and 12% all male. .

   2. Groups had to submit a written proposal. The proposal described how they would
      use the grant for non-agricultural skills training and enterprise start-up costs, and
      could request up to $10,000.15 In preparing the proposal, groups selected their own
      trainers, typically a local artisan or small institute. These are commonplace in Uganda
      (as in much of Africa) and there is a tradition of artisans taking on paid students as
      apprentices.

   3. Groups had to receive formal advising. Many applicants were functionally illiterate
      and so YOP also required “facilitators” (usually a local government employee, teacher,
      or community leader) to meet with the group several times, advise them on program
      rules, and help prepare the written proposals. Groups chose their own facilitators, and
      the NUSAF office paid facilitators 2% of funded proposals (up to $200).

   4. YOP applicants were screened at several levels of government. Villages typically sub-
      mitted one application, and that privilege may have gone to the groups with the most
      initiative, need, or connections. Village officials passed applications up to district-level
      bureaucrats, who verified the minimum technical criteria (such as group size and a
      complete proposal) and were supposed to visit projects they planned to fund. Districts
      said they prioritized early applications and disqualified incomplete ones, and while this
      is in line with our observations, unobserved quality and political calculations could have
      played a role. A central government NUSAF office—an executive bureaucratic agency
      created specifically for the implementation of the program—had final responsibility for
      validating and approving the list of district projects and disbursing funds.

   5. Successful groups received a large lump sum cash transfer to a bank account in the
      names of the management committee, with no government monitoring thereafter. In
      our sample, the average grant was UGX 12.9 million Ugandan shillings (UGX) per
      group, or $7,497 in 2008 market exchange rates. Per capita grant size varied across
      groups due to variation in group size and amounts requested, but 80% of grants were
      between $200 and $600 per capita, and they averaged $382 per person (or $955 in PPP
      terms). Unless otherwise noted, all UGX amounts reported in this paper are 2008
  15
     The proposal specified member names, a management committee of five, the proposed trade(s), and the
assets to purchase. Decisions were made by member vote, and nearly all members report they had a voice in
decisions. Most groups proposed a single trade for all, but a third of groups proposed that different members
would train two to three different trades. Females and mixed groups often chose trades common to both
genders, such as tailoring or hairstyling. Males and a small number of females often chose trades such as
carpentry or welding.

2.3     Was NUSAF a patronage program?
Government patronage is commonplace in Uganda (Green, 2011). New district creation and
public employment are prime examples of how the Ugandan government has sought to build
rural support (Grossman and Lewis, 2013; Green, 2010, 2011). Nonetheless, our assessment
is that the central government did not use NUSAF, including the YOP component, for
patronage purposes with individual voters.
    The World Bank was also closely involved in the design of the program, and monitored
impropriety, limiting the program’s ability to reward supporters. Ugandan activists and
press made frequent (and subsequently justified) allegations of corruption and impropriety
in NUSAF, especially at the district level, but accusations of mass patronage or vote-buying
were uncommon (e.g. Ojwee, 2008; Kavuma, 2010).17 Corruption in NUSAF, including ghost
projects and procurement contracts, may have transferred funds from the government to local
party machines, or strengthened other patron-client relations. But we are not aware of the
systematic targeting of villages or people for the grants.
    We also see no evidence that YOP targeted supportive villages, party members, or swing
voters. For example, as we show in Appendix A.1, there is no significant correlation between
percent of vote going to the incumbent party in the 2004 election and the per capita NUSAF
funds received between 2004 and 2007 at the subcounty level. Indeed, the nomination process
sought to avoid this kind of patronage by design. Targeting was highly decentralized, with
groups nominated by local leaders who may or may not be affiliated with the NRM.18 Group
nomination at the regional level was undoubtedly shaped by a range of local social and
political considerations (how could such a valuable program not be), but to the best of
our knowledge it was not captured or influenced by parties or party political operatives.
We observed the selection, deliberation, and auditing process firsthand and the choosing of
groups seemed to be a mix of first-come-first-serve, meritocratic, and ad hoc priorities and
procedures.
    Rather, our impression is that the national government viewed NUSAF as a way to build
support for the ruling party through programmatic effectiveness. The return of multi-party

  17
     Allegations of misuse concentrated on decisions prior to project nomination and selection, such as the
invention of “ghost projects” which transferred money directly to politicians or other insiders, or and the
awarding of construction contracts for the NUSAF components that involved local building projects.
  18
     Participatory nomination processes that involved the whole village were commonplace. Facilitators
helped groups organize and write their proposals, particularly teachers and local bureaucrats, and to our
knowledge facilitators were not typically political operators or organizers at election time.

politics to Uganda in 2005, coupled with the President controversially securing the right to
run for a third term, increased the ruling party’s incentives to use development policy to
mobilize electoral support (Hickey, 2013).


2.4    Experimental design
YOP was oversubscribed, and we worked with the national NUSAF office to randomize
funding among screened and eligible proposals. Thousands of groups submitted proposals
in 2006 and the NUSAF office funded hundreds in 2006-07, prior to our study. By 2008, 14
NUSAF-eligible districts had funds remaining. Figure 1 maps these study districts.19
    It’s important to note that the study population was only moderately affected by war
and political instability. None of the most war-affected districts (Gulu, Kitgum, and Pader)
had the funds to participate in the final round. Thus the districts in our study were either
on the margins of the conflict (center north), more vulnerable to banditry and cattle raiding
than conflict (northeast) or relatively secure but underdeveloped (northwest). There are
almost no ex-combatants in the study groups. In many ways, little distinguishes our sample
from other poor Ugandan youth.
    District governments nominated 2.5 times the number of groups they could fund. The
districts submitted roughly 625 proposals to the national NUSAF office, who reviewed them
for completeness and validity. To minimize chances of corruption the central NUSAF of-
fice also sent out audit teams to visit and verify each group. They disqualified about 70
applications, mainly for incomplete information or ineligibility.20
    In January 2008 the NUSAF office provided the research team with a list of 535 remaining
groups eligible for randomization, along with district budgets. We randomly assigned 265
of the 535 groups (5,460 individuals) to treatment and 270 groups (5,828 individuals) to
control, stratified by district. Control groups were not waitlisted to receive YOP in future.
During the baseline survey, before treatment status was known, groups were told they had
a 50% chance of funding and that there were no plans to extend the YOP program in the
future. Spillovers between study villages are unlikely as the 535 groups were spread across
454 communities in a population of more than five million, and control groups are typically
very distant from treatment villages. Figure 1 also maps eligible groups per parish.

2.5     Data and participants
We selected five people from each of the 535 groups to be tracked and interviewed three times
over four years—a potential panel of 2,677 people (seven were inadvertently surveyed in one
group at baseline). We worked with Uganda’s Bureau of Statistics to conduct a baseline
survey in February and March 2008, prior to the announcement and funding of treatment
groups. Enumerators and local officials mobilized group members to complete a survey of
demographic data on all members as well as group characteristics. Virtually all members
were mobilized, and we randomly selected five of the members present to be individually
surveyed and tracked.21 The NUSAF office disbursed funds between July and September
2008 via the central bank.
   Working with private, independent survey organizations, we conducted the first 2-year
endline survey between August 2010 and March 2011, 24 to 30 months after disbursement.
We conducted a 4-year survey between April and June 2012, 44 to 47 months after disburse-
ment, and just over a year after the 2011 national elections.

Participants

Table 1 reports baseline descriptive statistics for a selection of baseline variables, and we
report the full set of 57 variables reported in Appendix B.1. We see that members of the 535
eligible groups were generally young, rural, poor, credit constrained, and underemployed.
In 2008 they were 25 years on average, mainly aged 16 to 35. In 2011, 16.1% would have
been eligible to vote for the first time, and 34.1% would have been eligible to vote just for
the second time. Less than a quarter lived in a town, and most lived in villages of 100
to 2000 households. A quarter did not finish primary school, but on average they reached
eighth grade. Given that the three most war-affected districts did not participate in the
YOP evaluation, only 3% were involved in an armed group in any fashion.
    In 2008 the sample reported 11 hours of work a week. Half these hours were low-skill
labor or petty business, while the other half was in agriculture—rudimentary subsistence
and cash cropping on small rain-fed plots with little equipment or inputs. Almost half of our
   19

in the map, but YOP was organized, disbursed, and randomized using the original 14 districts from 2003.
   20
      e.g. many group members over 35 years, or a group size more than 40). The government also asked that
22 groups of underserved people (Muslims and orphans) be funded automatically.
   21
      Members were mixed up then lined up, and enumerators selected every N/5 person to survey (where N
is the total number present). 4% of the groups had missing members, and these were not included in the
baseline survey. Enumerators could not locate 13 groups (3% of the sample). Unusually, after the survey
it was discovered that all 13 were assigned to the control group. We investigated the matter and found no
motive for or evidence of foul play. District officials, enumerators, and the groups themselves did not know
the treatment status of the groups they were mobilizing. We were only able to find one of the 13 at endline.


                                                    14
sample reported no employment in the past month, and only 8% were engaged in a skilled
trade. Cash earnings in the past month averaged a dollar a day. Savings in the past six
months were $15 on average, and only 11% reported any savings.22
    Although poor by any measure, these applicants were slightly wealthier and more ed-
ucated than their peers. If we compare our sample to their age group and gender a 2008
population-based household survey, our sample has 1.7 years more education, 0.15 standard
deviations more wealth, is 7.5 percentage points more urban and 5.4 percentage points more
likely to be married, and has 1.6 fewer household members (see Appendix A.2).

Tracking and panel attrition

YOP applicants were a young, mobile population. Nearly 40% had moved or were away
temporarily at each endline survey. To minimize attrition we used a two-phase tracking
approach, as outlined in Appendix A.3. In the first phase we tracked all 2,677 members
of the sample, and in a second phase we did intensive tracking of a randomized sample
of unfound people. Our response rate was 97% at baseline, and effective response rates at
endline (weighted for selection into endline tracking) were 85% after two years and 82% after
four.
    Of slightly greater concern is correlation between attrition and treatment, reported in
Appendix Table A.3. The treatment group was 5 percentage points more likely to be found
at baseline in 2008. There is no treatment-control imbalance in 2010, although controls are
more likely to have been lost in 2008 and the treatment group in 2010. In 2012, controls were
7 percentage points less likely to be found. If unfound controls are particularly successful, we
could overstate the impact of the intervention. Such bias is conceivable: baseline covariates
are significantly correlated with attrition and the unfound tend to be younger, poorer, less
literate farmers from larger communities (see Appendix B.2). For this reason our treatment
effects estimates will control for baseline characteristics associated with attrition, and we
will test the sensitivity of results to various attrition scenarios.


2.6     Randomization balance
The computer-based randomization generated some imbalances across treatment arms. We
report balance tests for selected variables in Table 1 (for the full list see Appendix B.1).
For instance, at baseline the treatment group report 2 percentage points more vocational
training, 0.07 standard deviations greater wealth, 56% greater savings (though only in the
  22
    33% held loans, but these were small: under $7 at the median among those who have any loans, mainly
from friends and family. About 10% reported they could obtain a large loan of 1,000,000 UGX (about $580).



                                                   15
linear, not in log form), and 5 percentage points more access to small loans. Of 57 covariates,
6 (10.5%) of the treatment-control differences have p < 0.05, and 8 (14.0%) have p < 0.10. A
test of joint significance from an OLS regression on treatment assignment treatment indicator
reveals that baseline characteristics are jointly significant with p = 0.05.
    The missing 13 control groups could cause the imbalance. We estimate that if the miss-
ing controls had baseline values 0.1 to 0.2 standard deviations above the control mean, it
would account for the full imbalance (see Appendix B.3). If so, the observed control group
may be poorer than the treatment group, and will overstate true program impacts. Our
empirical strategy and sensitivity analysis below explicitly address the concerns that arise
from imbalance and potentially selective attrition.


2.7     Empirical strategy
In designing the experiment, our primary outcomes of interest were the direct economic ef-
fects of the business planning and cash on economic performance: investments in training
and business assets, levels and type of employment, and incomes.23 The longer-term polit-
ical impacts were of interest from the beginning, but we did not identify them as primary
outcomes, in part because any political effects were likely to be indirect and a function of suc-
cessful economic impacts. Thus, as with any set of downstream impacts (and like most other
evaluations of the political effects of public programs), the treatment effects on secondary
outcomes should be treated with some caution.
    We estimate intent-to-treat (ITT) effect on outcomes, Y , via the weighted least squares
(WLS) regression:

                                   Yij = θIT T T ij + βXij + γd + εij

where T is an indicator for assignment to treatment for person i in group j, X is the vector of
baseline covariates displayed in Appendix Table B.1, the γ are district fixed effects (required
because the probability of assignment to treatment varies by strata), and ε is an error term
clustered by group. We weight observations by their inverse probability of selection into
endline tracking.
  23
    The 4-year outcomes were derived from a formal model and pre-specified in the analysis of the 2-year
results. As the experiment pre-dated the social science registry, the trial was not formally pre-registered.

       Notes: Columns (1) and (4) report the control group mean, weighted by the inverse probability of selection into
       each endline sample. Columns (2)-(3) and (5)-(6) report the intent-to-treat (ITT) estimate and standard error
       (SE) of program assignment at each endline. Standard errors are heteroskedastic-robust and clustered by group.
       We calculate the ITT via a weighted least squares regression of the dependent variable on a program assignment
       indicator, 13 district (randomization stratum) fixed effects, and a vector of control variables that includes all of the
       baseline covariates reported in Appendix B.1. Continuous economic outcomes such as hours worked and earnings
       have a long upper tail, and some of these large values are potentially due to enumeration errors. Extreme values
       will be highly influential in any treatment effect, so we top-code all currency-denominated, hours worked, and
       employee variables at the 99th percentile.



3       Economic impacts of the program
YOP led to large and persistent increases in investment, work, and income. Table 2 reports
ITT estimates on economic outcomes two and four years after the interventions, as doc-
umented in our companion paper economic impacts of YOP (Blattman et al., 2014). We
summarize them here before moving on to the political impacts.

Compliance Of the 265 groups assigned to a cash grant, 89% received it. 21 groups could
not access funds because of problems with identifying the group leaders and banking details,
bank complications, collection delays, or corruption.24
  24
    Only 8 groups reported that they never received funds due to some form of theft or diversion. The groups
who did and did not receive funds (for any reason) are generally similar along baseline characteristics, but
groups were slightly more likely to be treated if they were educated and wealthier and did not have too many
members (regressions not shown). These traits probably lowered the probability of a disqualifying error in
the proposals.


                                                                   17
Investments A majority of groups and members invested the funds in skills training and
business materials, as planned. Between 2008 and 2010, 68% of the treatment group enrolled
in vocational training, compared to 15% of the control group and, on average, treatment
translated into 340 more hours of vocational training than controls. Among those who
enrolled in any training, 38% trained in tailoring, 23% in carpentry, 13% in metalwork, 8%
in hairstyling, and the remainder in miscellaneous other trades.
    Even so, the majority of the grants were invested in capital, as the median group estimated
they spent just 11% on skills training, compared to 65% on tools and materials (the remaining
24% was shared in cash or spent on other things).25 The control group reported UGX 290,200
($167) of business assets in 2010 and UGX 392,800 ($228) in 2012. By 2010 treatment had
increased capital stocks by UGX 377,023 ($219), a 131% increase over the control group. By
2012 stocks had increased by UGX 224,986 ($130), a 57% increase over the control group.
    Afterwards, group members typically went their own way to start individual businesses
rather than form firms or cooperatives.26

Employment impacts With these investments, YOP led these young people to shift their
occupations toward skilled work and cottage industry, thus increasing their labor supply
overall. After four years, people in groups assigned to receive a grant were more than
twice as likely to practice a skilled trade—typically as self-employed artisan in carpentry,
metalworking, tailoring, or hairstyling. After four years the treatment group worked 5.5
more hours weekly than the control group—a 17% increase.

Income impacts YOP’s ultimate aim was to reduce poverty, and these capital investments
and increases in labor supplied were means to an end: increases in earned income. Income
is notoriously difficult to measure, especially in poor and rural areas (like northern Uganda)
where the average person has volatile and seasonal work, multiple sources of income, and
both monetary and in-kind remuneration. We measured income in three ways: self-reported
earnings, consumption assets owned, and an estimate of total household consumption. The
  25
      Our survey data and qualitative interviews suggest that groups made bulk purchases of tools and other
materials, but these were distributed and individually owned. Groups commonly elected management com-
mittee members to handle procurement, making major training and tool purchases in bulk, largely for the
cost savings involved. These tools were typically distributed equally to individual members, but about half
the respondents said they shared some small or large tools with other group members. In the 2010 survey,
90% of group members said they felt the grant was equally shared, and 92% said the leaders received no
more than their fair share. Most of the remainder reported only minor imbalances.
   26
      Nearly all treatment groups reported meeting together after the grant, typically several times a year.
Half said their facilitator still engaged with the group, in part because they are from the area, had previous
ties to the group, or were interested in their progress. Control groups reported meeting just as frequently, in
large part because many of these groups preexisted and serve other purposes, and part because they hoped
to receive transfers in the future.


                                                      18
consumption and asset measures are thought to be better measures of stable or “permanent”
income.27
    All three measures increase significantly in the treatment group, as does a mean effects
index of all three measures standardized to have mean zero and unit standard deviation.
This overall index is useful for summarizing the three measures and reducing the number
of hypotheses we test. It suggests that YOP increased incomes by 0.17 standard deviations
after two years and by 0.24 standard deviations after four years. But while this index reduces
multiple comparison concerns, the components give a more concrete sense of the impacts.
    The control group reported monthly cash earnings of UGX 30,825 ($18) in 2008, UGX
35,200 ($20) in 2010, and UGX 47,800 ($28) in 2012.28 Such growth may have come in part
from a growing economy, but it also arose from young people gradually increasing their hours
worked, capital stocks, and output over time by investing earnings. Assignment to receive
a YOP grant increased monthly earnings by UGX 14,605 ($8.50) in 2010 and UGX 18,186
($10.57) in 2012. This earnings increase is modest in absolute terms—just under a dollar a
day in PPP terms. But relative to the control group’s earnings this is a roughly 40% increase
in earnings—a hugely important change for someone earning so little per day. We see similar
patterns in two alternative measures of income: durable and nondurable consumption. Both
rose over time and had large program effects.
    Both men and women benefited from the program. A third of applicants were women
and the program had large and sustained impacts on them: After four years, incomes of
treatment women were 73% greater than control women, compared to a 29% gain for men.
Over the four years, control men kept pace or caught up with treatment men. Women
stagnated without the program but took off when funded.
    These are extremely large impacts, especially considering how few employment programs
even pass a simple cost-benefit test. Blattman and Ralston (2015), in their review of the
evidence of the effectiveness of employment programs in poor, middle-income, and high-
income countries, identify the YOP program (and cash transfer programs like it) as some of
the highest return employment programs with evidence in the world.
  27
    See Blattman et al. (2014) for a full discussion.
  28
    The 2008 survey has data on gross cash revenues only, whereas gross and net earnings are available in
2010. For the 2008 value of net earnings, we use the 2008 gross amount multiplied by the 2010 ratio of gross
to net. This number is merely for descriptive purposes and has no bearing on treatment effect estimates.

4      Impacts of the program on political behavior
4.1     Theoretical motivation
YOP is unlike the sort of clientelistic program most commonly used in transactional politics
and vote-buying, such as public sector jobs: it was a large-scale state employment program
that was foreign-financed, relatively technocratic and non-politicized in its targeting and
implementation, and (unlike a public sector job) the grant was by its nature impossible to
revoke once given.29 Indeed, it transferred resources directly to voters, much like land titling,
conditional cash transfers, or skills training or other public programs. These are commonly
labeled “programmatic policies” rather than pork programs or traditional patronage.
    There is a growing base of evidence that voters reward incumbents for programmatic
policy, at least in aggregate. For instance, comparing areas with varying exposure to con-
ditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, Manacorda et al. (2011); Zucco (2013);
Diaz-Cayeros et al. (2016) argue that retrospective voting could account for the fact that
areas that received more assistance rewarded incumbents, sometimes even after the program
benefits had finished.30 Similarly, Casaburi and Troiano (2015) see an increase in incum-
bent vote share after a successful anti-tax evasion program, and Larreguy et al. (2015) see
incumbent vote share rise after a land titling program.
    The literature provides several plausible reasons why people assigned to treatment should
reward the ruling party at the polls for programmatic policies, and together they led us to
hypothesize that assignment to treatment would increase partisanship and electoral support
for the NRM and Museveni.
    The first reason, commonly called “pocketbook voting”, argues that economically suc-
cessful voters tend to reward the incumbent (Kramer, 1971; Fiorina, 1976). Overall, YOP
recipients experienced a large increase in wealth and may have rewarded the incumbent as
a consequence, independently of whom they attribute the responsibility of the program to.
This idea that voters are naïve and make simple calculations is supported by the literature
on how natural events, shark attacks or football games, can sometimes boost incumbents’
popularity (Healy et al., 2010; Achen and Bartels, 2004). One explanation is that poorly
  29
     One important different between conditional and unconditional transfers is the amount of interaction
individuals have with government. In the YOP case, young people interacted with the government, but in a
limited way and only during the application process or, in limited cases, briefly after receiving funds. Most
conditional cash programs deliver money in tranches over long periods of time, requiring greater interactions
with officials and more reliance on the continuation of the distribution. YOP participants neither needed
nor expected further interactions with government after receiving the program.
  30
     In one case, that of conditional cash transfers in Mexico, it is contested whether incumbent vote share
increased, or whether the effect was purely on turnout (Schober, 2016). Nonetheless, the argument that
incumbent vote share responds to programmatic policy extends well beyond Mexico.



                                                     20
informed voters interpret good fortune as plausible new information about an incumbent’s
quality or characteristics (Ashworth et al., 2016).
    A second reason is the theory of retrospective voting, where voters reward incumbents
because they interpret development programs as a signal that the incumbent is effective,
or that the incumbent will work to benefit voters like themselves in the future. Relatedly,
some theories emphasize reciprocity in voting—that voters reward incumbents out of a sense
of gratitude or perceived obligation—and this would generate similar predictions to retro-
spective voting: increased vote share for the incumbent, at least when they attribute the
program to that party or politician.
    The YOP program was one of the largest development program ever run in Uganda.
As such YOP could be viewed as a costly signal from the ruling party that it intended to
channel more funds in the future to the north of the country, thus changing the expected
benefits of keeping the party in power.31 This led us to predict that YOP beneficiaries might
reciprocate with votes for the ruling party.
    In general, at the outset of the study there was little theoretical apparatus or litera-
ture leading us us to predict the opposite effect: that YOP could augment support for the
opposition. We return to this question in the discussion and conclusions section below.


4.2     National election outcomes
YOP was first and foremost an employment program, and so the economic outcomes reported
above were our primary and pre-specified outcomes. Nonetheless, the literature on the effects
of central government programs on national political support led us to add questions on
partisanship and electoral behavior (before and after the election) to the endline survey. We
focus on these outcomes here, starting with partisan attitudes and actions.

Partisan attitudes and actions

Three years after the grants, we see no evidence that the program increased general political
participation or support for the ruling party. Rather, if anything, young people assigned to
the treatment increased their support for the opposition.
  31
    Of course, for there to be a differential effect on treated individuals, the actual receipt of YOP would
have to change these expectations. It is possible that treatment and control group members would see or
absorb the signal differently. For instance, NUSAF was widely perceived as corrupt. But those who actually
received the grants have direct evidence that it reaches people like them. Also, any element of reciprocity
would likely affect the actions of YOP recipients. That said, were non-recipients to reward the incumbent
for good policy, this would attenuate the treatment effects in our experiment. This highlights one of the
key differences that separates our study from previous ones: we examine variation between treated and
non-treated individuals in the same locality, rather than treated and non-treated localities.

          the dependent variable on a program assignment indicator, 13 district (randomization stratum)
          fixed effects, and a vector of control variables that includes all of the baseline covariates reported
          in Appendix B.1.

    Table 3 reports our main results on the impacts of receiving the program on political
behavior and attitudes towards the ruling party and opposition parties. To reduce the
number of hypotheses being tested, we group outcomes thematically into a small number of
families and calculate a standardized mean effects index of all component outcomes.32 Note
that the survey was conducted four years after the grant and a year after the last election.
Party and political attitudes (e.g. support for the ruling party) are reported at the time
of the survey, while electoral participation and political actions (e.g. attending a rally) are
retrospective measures of pre-election and election activities. For causal identification, this
requires that recall error is not correlated with treatment status.
    First, an index of ruling party support—vote intentions, support for, work for, and mem-
bership in the ruling party, plus support for the President in particular—falls by 0.05 stan-
dard deviations. This is not statistically significant but the sign of the coefficient is the
opposite of what we expected. Moreover, while 88% of the control group voted for the Pres-
ident, this declined by 4 percentage points with treatment, significant at the 5% level. This
latter result would not hold after correcting for multiple hypotheses within the family, and
so we must take it cautiously, but it is worth noting that it is probably the most important
political indicator for the national government and it runs in the opposite direction of our
prediction.33 We can certainly rule out an increase in support for the ruling party.34
    Second, support for and actions on behalf of an opposition party increased by 0.11 stan-
dard deviations among those assigned to treatment. The vast majority of opposition support
is for Kizza Besigye and his party, the FDC, but we pool all opposition candidates for this
analysis. Looking at the components of this family index, all treatment effects are positive.35
The proportionally largest and statistically significant changes are to feeling close to the op-
position party, working for the opposition, being a member of the opposition and actual
voting for the opposition. In this context, “working to get a candidate elected” can include
   32
      We standardize the components, average them, and re-standardize. Thus each component receives equal
weight.
   33
      If we adjust for seven comparisons within the family, the coefficient on voting for the President has a
p-value of 0.24. We use the Westfall and Young (1993) free step-down resampling method for the family-wise
error rate (FWER), the probability that at least one of the true null hypotheses will be falsely rejected, using
randomization inference.
   34
      Parish-level data also supports the view that the program’s effect on support for the ruling party was
limited. Using parish-level voting returns in 2011, we can examine the impact of having at least one NUSAF
group assigned in the parish, to see if local populations reward the President for targeting the parish with any
NUSAF project, including a YOP project. Support for the President is 2.2 percentage points higher in these
districts, with a standard deviation of 0.015 (not statistically significant.Table not shown, but the regression
is analogous to the treatment effects estimated above. There are 420 eligible parishes in the sample.
   35
      One feature of our population is that they are mainly under 35, with about a quarter eligible to vote for
the first time. As we illustrate in Appendix B.5, the results are not driven by these young and inexperienced
voters. There is no statistically significant difference between first time and older voters, and if anything the
average treatment effect is slightly higher when we exclude first time voters.

being a party activist (e.g. organizing events and rallies) but this role is rare, especially
among young people. Rather, in most cases this reflects more informal activities, such as
persuading friends and family to support your candidate or turn out to vote. Formal get-
out-the-vote efforts are actually outlawed on election day in Uganda. Treatment appears to
have increased voting for an opposition candidate from 12% in the control group to 16% in
the treatment, a relative gain of 33%. While we have to take the patterns within any family
with some caution, note that stated preferences for the opposition change proportionally
less, and are not statistically significant. Our results are robust to alternate specifications
but are sensitive to alternative attrition scenarios (see Appendix B.4). If we adjust p-values
for the two main family comparisons (NRM/Presidential support and opposition support),
the p-value on the opposition support family index is 0.07.

General political behavior

Increased political action seems to be concentrated among opposition supporters, since it
is not associated with a similar increase in political participation in the full sample. Table
4 reports impacts on political participation in general, irrespective of party. These include
measures from Table 3 where we ignore the ruling party/opposition distinction, but also
includes non-partisan political participation (or potentially partisan measures where we do
not know the party in question, such as attending a rally).
    The program had little effect on the general index of political participation or any of
the individual components: whether someone attended voter education meetings, met with
others to discuss the election, reporting of malpractice or even whether they voted in the
presidential election. The family index rises by 0.06 standard deviations but has a p-value
of 0.262. 91% of the sample reported voting, perhaps leaving little room for improvement
on this metric, but we likewise see no improvement in the other measures of participation.
    The program also had no statistically significant effect on general partisan actions—
including attending a political rally, participating in a primary, working to get a candidate
elected, or being a member of a party. Only one component measure shows any evidence
of change: self-reporting working to get a party elected increased from 64% in the control
group to 74% in the treatment, significant at the 10% level. These effects are largely driven
by the increase in activity on behalf of the opposition.


4.3    Subnational election outcomes
As we will see below, more than 87% of respondents attributed the YOP program to the
national government and ruling party. Nonetheless, given the close involvement of subcounty
and district officials in the nomination process, we anticipated that beneficiaries might reward
local candidates as well. These could include local councilors at the district level (called
LC5s), at the subcounty level (called LC3s) and the village level (called LC1s).
    Table 5 displays the program’s impact on support for incumbent LC5s who served during
the YOP disbursement and re-ran for election (about half of all races). It also displays
treatment effects for whether the individual voted in the LC5 election (a measure of local
political participation), and also the approval for current local councilors. We are principally
interested in support for incumbent LC5s, and we break down support based on whether the
LC5 was NRM or opposition.
    Treatment led to a 0.057 percentage point decrease in voting for or supporting the in-
cumbent LC5, regardless of party (not statistically significant). However, looking at the
subgroups reveals that support for NRM incumbents fell dramatically, by 12.5 percentage

points (significant at the 1% level), while support for opposition incumbents rose slightly (not
statistically significant). This difference between opposition and ruling party LC5 support
is statistically significant at the 1% level. We do not have party affiliation data for LC3s,
and LC1s are not officially affiliated with a party. But treatment did not lead to increased
support for the current LC1, LC3, or LC5, nor did it significantly increase the likelihood of
voting in the local elections.


5    Discussion
What accounts for these unexpected results, where the beneficiaries of a large state program
not only turn away from the incumbent President, but actually increase their public support
for the opposition? This section explores possible explanations, at least to the limits of what
our data can do. We first show that there is no lack of attribution of the YOP program
to the government, and so this is an unlikely explanation. Second, we show suggestive


                                                             26
evidence that increase in wealth is a major driver of this change in behavior, consistent
with a mechanism already suggested in the literature: wealthier people feel freer to vote
their conscience, possibly because they are less tied to patronage networks or less reliant on
local politicians and strongmen. Indeed, YOP beneficiaries were less likely to be mobilized
on election day. That said, they are not less likely to be enmeshed in general patronage
relations, perhaps because their greater wealth brings some influence.
    Before developing these more substantive explanations, however, we should note that
all of our data are self-reported and vulnerable to systematic measurement error. Nonethe-
less, we think it’s unlikely that measurement error accounts for our results. If those who
received YOP were more likely to report voting for the opposition, or otherwise expressing
their opposition preferences publicly, then this could account for the treatment effects we
observe. This could arise because the control group aspires to future government programs
and thinks that saying they voted for the President will increase their chances, even when
talking to a supposedly independent study firm. We cannot eliminate this possibility. Such
measurement error, however, is difficult to reconcile with the pattern of treatment effects we
observe, in particular the absence of any impact on attitudes towards the ruling party and
its challengers. It is possible that treatment affects the likelihood of reporting opposition
voting/membership/activities but not party support, but this narrows the set of plausible
systematic measurement error stories that could explain our results.


5.1    Did the ruling party get credit for NUSAF? Program attri-
       bution and beliefs
One possibility is that respondents did not attribute the YOP program, or their own selection
into the program, to the ruling party. We see little evidence for this view. While a majority
of our sample of YOP applicants attributed the program to the national government, they
did not perceive YOP as a political favor, a form of patronage, or even a gift. Rather
respondents viewed YOP as programmatic in nature. While this programmatic perception
might explain the absence of any increase in ruling party support, it is hard to see how
it explains the decline in Presidential voting or increased electoral action on behalf of the
opposition.
    Table 6 presents summary statistics and treatment effects on respondents’ beliefs about
the program. NUSAF was widely perceived as programmatic, in that 92% of the control
group said the purpose of NUSAF was northern development, versus 6% who said it was to
increase political support.
    Most respondents attributed the broader NUSAF program (including YOP) to either the

stratum) fixed effects, and a vector of control variables that includes all of the baseline covariates
reported in Appendix B.1.

central government (56% of the control group) or a foreign donor (32%), typically the World
Bank. Both answers were correct, since NUSAF was funded via a large credit from the World
Bank, and the government received significant technical assistance from the World Bank to
implement.36 People assigned to treatment were slightly more likely to assign the program
to a foreign donor, but the difference is not large.
    However, when asked who was the main group or individual responsible for selecting the
groups for funding, only 15.7% recalled that the selection was random. Instead, the majority
of respondents either did not know or identified their district NUSAF technical official (an
unelected bureaucratic position) as responsible for funding. Those assigned to treatment
were more likely to assign responsibility to the local NUSAF technical officer, perhaps due
to the fact that this officer was in frequent contact with treatment groups throughout the
program.
    The fact that groups did not identify the national government as responsible for funding
selection could explain why treated individuals were less likely to reward the government.
But we see only modest evidence that treatment effects on partisanship varied with program
attribution. Table 7 reports an ITT regression where we include post-treatment government
attribution as a covariate, and interact it with treatment. Unfortunately, we do not have
pre-treatment data on attribution, which means we have to interpret results with caution.
Nonetheless, the coefficients on treatment and the treatment interaction in Table 7 suggest
that the increase in opposition support is not limited to the people who attribute the pro-
gram to a foreign donor. On average, those who attribute YOP to someone other than the
government increase their support for the opposition by 0.168 standard deviations. Oppo-
sition support is 0.090 standard deviations lower among those who attribute YOP to the
government, but the coefficient on the interaction is not statistically significant. (It is also
worth noting that this difference is overstated to the extent that people who came to support
the opposition post-program are less likely to be charitable towards the government and give
them responsibility for YOP.)
    We also see little effect of beliefs about program selection on the opposition support
treatment effects. Among those who thought program selection was fair, opposition support
rose by 0.13 standard deviations, compared to 0.121 standard deviations among those who
perceived selection as unfair. Among those who thought program selection was random,
opposition support rose 0.169 standard deviations, compared to 0.123 standard deviations
among those who perceived selection as non-random (see Appendix B.6).
    Overall, a lack of attribution could help explain why the ruling party did not get rewarded
  36
   Regrettably, multiple answers were not collected on this survey question, and so we cannot be sure that
people did not attribute the program both to the government and the World Bank.

             from Table 3. In the remaining columns, we include a dummy for government attribution

             about attribution and selection are post-treatment, and could be affected by treatment status

at the polls by YOP beneficiaries, but it is more difficult to understand the rise in opposition
support among the treated.


5.2    Financial freedom and voting one’s conscience
There is a strand of democratization theory called “modernization theory” that argues that
economic prosperity contributes to democratization. This is a varied literature that often
emphasizes the relationship between economic and political elites, but there is also a “micro”
strand of this literature that argues that reducing poverty will create more engaged citizens.
One example is Welzel et al. (2003), who marshall theory, case evidence, and correlations
from the World Values Survey to argue that increased material security is associated with
preferences for liberty and political self-expression. They argue, in effect, that anti-poverty
programs create more self-aware, assertive, critical citizens, who will prefer to act on their
political ideals.
    There is also some evidence from other countries that financial independence makes
them more willing to hold governments accountable. For instance, De Kadt and Lieberman
(2015) find that access to public services is correlated with lower support for incumbents
across Southern Africa. Using attitudinal survey data, they suggest that improvements in
service delivery increase voter expectations of government in terms of service delivery and


                                                         30
corruption, and incumbents are punished for disappointing these expectations.
    Other evidence suggests that financial independence untangles poor people from clien-
telistic networks. In her qualitative study of Mexican politics (and the vote buying machine
of another hegemonic party, the PRI), Magaloni (2006) argues that financially independent
voters are less dependent on favors from the ruling party, and thus are more likely to support
the opposition. Larreguy et al. (2015) argue that programmatic policies could reduce clients’
dependence on political patrons and reduce the power of patrons. They find support for this
proposition from an urban titling program in Mexico that reduced the value of clientelistic
goods and services that patrons had to offer. Hite-Rubin (2015), studying an experimental
microfinance initiative in the Philippines, also finds that impersonal microcredit decreased
incumbent support. She argues that this is not because it increases incomes but because
it untangles people from the credit relationships that underlie party politics and turnout
efforts.
    Patronage is an important aspect of Ugandan politics. Despite a growing number of
opposition candidates winning office, especially in LC3 and LC5 races, the ruling party and
the national government control the vast majority of patronage in the country. This can
include opportunities for contracts, casual and permanent job opportunities, and so forth.
Vote buying is also common in Uganda, in particular cash gifts to encourage turnout on
behalf of the incumbent. Opposition parties have significantly fewer funds for vote buying,
and so this is an predominantly ruling party tactic (Blattman et al., 2016). With greater
income, people who received YOP may have chosen to trade off their chances of a cash gift
at election time (or other political patronage) in order to act on an intrinsic preference for
publicly supporting their preferred party.
    We do not have any way to directly test these propositions. Instead, we examine patterns
in the data, and find some suggestive evidence that economic success is associated with more
public action and political participation for the opposition.

Changes in actions rather than preferences At least one pattern in our data is con-
sistent with the more successful beneficiaries acting on their opposition preferences: people
change their political behaviors in support of a party more than their party preferences.
Looking at the ITT estimates on opposition support in Table 3, note that the largest and
most statistically significant impacts are on actions (voting, joining a party, or acting on
behalf of a party) and not party preference per se. Given the large number of components,
we must take these impacts with some caution. The differences across components are not
statistically significant. Nonetheless, the pattern is consistent with people changing their
behaviors more than their partisan preferences.

 fixed effects?


Notes: The 2012 income index is a standardized mean effects index of the three endline income measures, as
reported in Table 2. The other outcome indexes represent mean effects indexes of all outcomes analyzed in this
paper or the original economic impact analysis in Table VIII of Blattman et al. (2014). Treatment effects on
these other outcomes are reported in Appendix B.8. Columns (1) and (2) report the OLS regression of opposition
support on income in the control group and the full sample. Column (3) instruments for endline income with
the assignment to treatment dummy. Column (4) replicates the simple ITT on opposition support, from Table 3
above, for comparison purposes. Columns (5) and (6) examine possible mediators of the treatment effect, adding
first the endline income measure then all outcome indexes. All regressions include 13 district (randomization
stratum) fixed effects, and a vector of control variables that includes all of the baseline covariates reported in
Appendix B.1.
                                                          32
Association with wealth We also see that opposition support is correlated with wealth,
and have suggestive evidence that increases in wealth are associated with increases in op-
position support. Table 8 reports five OLS regressions and one instrumental variables (IV)
regression, examining the relationship between the endline index of opposition support (from
Table 3) and the endline income index (from Table 2).
    First, higher incomes are associated with more opposition support. In Column 1 of Table
8, we report the results from a regression of opposition support on endline income for the
control group only, controlling for all baseline covariates (including baseline income and
employment levels). This is not a causal estimate of income on opposition support, but it
does indicate how the variation in income that is not explained by demographics or initial
income correlates with opposition support. It is moderate in size (0.13 standard deviations)
and significant at the 1% level. It is roughly similar to the correlation in the full sample, in
Column 2.37
    Second, if we make the very strong assumption that all effects on opposition support are
mediated through income changes (i.e. the exclusion restriction) then we can use assignment
to treatment as an instrument for the effect of income on opposition support. This IV
coefficient, in Column 3, is roughly four times as large as the OLS coefficients. It is biased
upwards by any other mediators correlated with treatment, income and opposition support.
Thus we must take it with caution.
    Third, alternatively we can examine the evidence on income as a mediating factor, and try
to estimate how much of the effect on opposition support is due to a rise in income.38 Column
4 replicates the simple ITT on opposition support from Table 3, as a baseline reference.
Column 5 adds the endline income index, while column 6 also includes 8 other potential
mechanisms (for simplicity and consistency, we include every outcome family reported in
either this paper or Blattman et al. (2014)).39
  37
     If we omit the baseline covariates, we estimate nearly identical OLS coefficients on income (regressions
not shown).
  38
     See Imai et al. (2011) for a discussion of mediation analysis. They call the main assumption for causal
identification “sequential ignorability” because two ignorability assumptions are made sequentially. First,
given the observed pretreatment confounders, the treatment assignment is assumed to be unconfounded—a
straightforward assumption in an experiment. The second part implies that the observed mediator is ignor-
able given treatment status and baseline covariates. In Column 5 this mediator is endline income, and in
Column 6 it is all endline outcome indexes, although our main interest continues to be income). The second
part of the sequential ignorability assumption is unlikely to hold, but the analysis nonetheless provides sug-
gestive information about the importance of income in mediating the effect of the YOP program on political
behavior.
  39
     Six of these (family cohesion, community participation, public good contributions, anti-social behaviors,
protest index, and migration) are families secondary outcomes from Blattman et al. (2014) while the other
two (election intimation and existence of a patron) are families of secondary political variables collected for
the purpose of the paper. These encompass all secondary outcomes collected during the four year follow-up.



                                                      33
    The results suggest income is a major mediating factor.40 After controlling for income in
2012 (columns 4 versus 5), the treatment effect on opposition support falls by 25% (p < 0.01),
while endline income is just as correlated with opposition support as in Columns 1 and 2.
This suggests that a large fraction of the treatment effect we see in Column 4 is coming
through an increase in income. When we add in the other eight mechanisms and compare
columns 5 and 6, the treatment effect remains similar to that in column 5 (a difference of
2.0 percentage points, p = 0.27). Although the coefficient on income slightly drops when
adding in these eight mechanisms (p = 0.05), the correlation between endline income and
opposition support is still very high and very positive (p < 0.01). This suggests that a large
portion of the effect we observe on opposition support comes through increases in income.41

Exposure to electoral influence and patrons Finally, a reasonable (though not nec-
essary) implication of the financial freedom story is that treatment should increase the re-
spondent’s independence from party operators and patrons. Because we did not anticipate
changes in patron ties, we did not collect data on self-reported patronage or future expec-
tations of party support. We do, however, have self-reported data on attempts to influence
the respondent during the campaign, and his perceptions of his access to patrons in times of
need. We see some evidence that the treated were not targets of unlawful “get-out-the-vote”
efforts around the 2011 election, which may suggest fewer attempts to influence their vote,
but across a range of measures of election influence and intimidation we see little treatment
effects. Also, rather than seeing treated less entangled in patron-client networks, they report
being more involved in patron-client networks (though not necessarily ones related to the
election). Wealth could simply improve social networks and political access. Nonetheless, it
suggests there is no simple relationship between wealth and “detangling” from patron-client
networks.
    Table 9 reports treatment effects on instances of election influence and general patron-
client ties. We do not see any significant change in most threats and incentives to vote
one way or the other. Treated people were, however, about half as likely to be taken to
the poll on election day—a fall of 2 percentage points relative to a mean of 4 percentage
points in the control group. The mean is low because such voter mobilization on election
  40
    Though it may not satisfy the exclusion restriction assumed in Column 3.
  41
    While other endline indexes are significantly correlated with opposition support, this is not sufficient to
mediate the treatment effect on income. To do so, they must also be correlated with treatment, and none
are correlated with both treatment and the outcome to a significant degree other than income. This is why
we see no fall in the treatment coefficient when these other variables are added to Column 6. We expand on
these points, and illustrate treatment effects, in Appendix B.7, where we perform a more formal mediation
analysis based off of Keele et al. (2015). Consistent with the findings reported here, we estimate that almost
25 percent of the treatment effect comes from the measured increase in income—large compared to other
mediation analyses of this nature.

day is outlawed in Uganda. A mean effects index of election influence shows no statistically
significant impact.
    We find that the program has a positive and statistically significant effect on the exis-
tence of a patron—a family member, “big man”, or politician— the respondent feels he or
she can go to when in need of something. It is unclear whether these are political patrons
who mobilize people for political support, as we do not see a statistically significant rise in
one of these patrons trying to influence their political behavior during the election. Only
22% of respondents reported that a patron tried to influence their actions, and this increased
by 2 percentage points (not significant) with treatment. We only asked about attempts to
influence, not success, and so this does not rule out the possibility that the treated disen-
tangled themselves from election pressure and patronage. But nor is the pattern consistent
with the financial freedom story. One interpretation is that business activities and wealth
strengthen general financial and social networks, including political networks. Another is
that active and public support for a political party (in this case, opposition parties) creates
political connections.


6     Conclusions
We analyze the political consequences of a large scale, successful employment program in
Uganda. We find that, rather than rewarding the incumbent ruling party for this program-
matic policy, treated young people are less likely to vote for the President and are more
likely to engage in campaigning for the opposition. We show that the lack of reward for the
incumbent is likely not coming from a lack of attributing the program to the incumbent,
since a majority of beneficiaries do in fact attribute the program to the government. We see
suggestive evidence that opposition support is associated with wealth increases, and this is
consistent with a story where more successful youth are able to vote their conscience rather
than succumb to incentives or pressures to support the ruling party.
    Existing evidence points in the opposite direction, that incumbents are rewarded for
patronage and programmatic policies, and so it is possible that this result is unique to Uganda
or even this context. We would expect context to play a huge role in any treatment effect
of a policy on political behavior, and any number of factors could influence the recipient’s
reaction to YOP: the nature of the program, the issues at play in this election, or the fact that
these are largely first- and second-time voters. For example, many of the other programs that
have been studied examine repeated cash transfers over time, rather than one-time grants,
allowing political parties to claim credit repeatedly. These program features could change
the political interpretation and effects.

Notes: Column (1) reports the control group mean, weighted by the inverse probability of selection into
each endline sample. Columns (2)-(3) report the estimated intent-to-treat (ITT) coefficient and standard
error at endline. Standard errors are heteroskedastic-robust and clustered by group. The number of
observations in Column 4 may differ from the total number of people survey (1,868) because a small
number of people, typically less than 1–2%, declined to answer the political questions.We calculate the
ITT via a weighted least squares regression of the dependent variable on a program assignment indicator,
13 district (randomization stratum) fixed effects, and a vector of control variables that includes all of the
baseline covariates reported in Appendix B.1.

    Prominent reviews of the literature on distributive politics have called attention to incom-
plete evidence and possible publication bias. For example, Golden and Min (2013) note that,
“it is hard not to suspect that the cases that are studied are often selected precisely because
they display prima facie evidence of political distortions in allocative decisions” (p.86). They
go on to note that “either that the study of allocations is incomplete, a problem identified
by Cox (2010), or that the cumulative results of this research agenda are biased—or both.”
    Our hypothesis—that the program, by creating wealth, led to the financial freedom to
vote one’s true political preferences—is just that, a hypothesis. We do not have the data
or design to test the mechanism at work. Nonetheless, it accords with the conclusions of
political scientists in contexts as different as Mexico and the Philippines, and strikes us
as an important hypothesis for the literature, and future experiments, to take seriously.
Relatively few employment and anti-poverty program evaluations collect data on program
attribution and resulting political attitudes and behavior. Most regions, however, offer off-
the-shelf political survey questionnaires with nationally representative data for comparison
(e.g. Afrobarometer, Latinobarometer, etc.). Past experimental anti-poverty programs are
also fodder for downstream studies of political impacts. We hope this paper motivates such
data collection and addresses the gap in evidence, to investigate the idea that the escape
from poverty might be associated with political freedoms.

A      Additional design details
A.1     Was NUSAF politically targeted
As discussed in Section 2.3, we see little correlation between NUSAF funding and the per-
centage of votes cast for the ruling NRM party in the previous election at the subcounty
level.
    Figure 1 presents the NUSAF funding per capita (in Ugandan Shillings) for each of the
districts in northern Uganda and the percent of the vote going to the NRM.42 For any level
of support, the majority of districts are in the same range, approximately 10,000 USH to
30,000 USH of funding per person. The one exception is Kitgum district, where funding
per capita was very high. As this was the most conflict affected area, and NUSAF was on
paper a post-conflict development project, it is likely that funding was purposefully targeted
to this area for this mission. However, it is also the district with the lowest support of the
NRM, and so could have been subject to manipulation by the central government. In either
case, due to funding issues described in the main paper, Kitgum is not part of our sample
here.
    Manipulation of funding destination by the central government could also have been
achieved at the subcounty level, though this would have been a harder level to target due
to the complexity of the budgeting process in Uganda and the large number of subcounties
present. Table A.1 presents the results of a test for the correlation between the percent of
votes for the NRM and the natural log of the funds per capita in each of the subcounties.
The first column shows there is a negative and statistically significant relationship between
percent of votes and funding. However, this result is once again heavily skewed by data from
Kitgum district. In the second column we include district dummies. The results are now
much smaller and not significant.


A.2     Comparison to general population
Table A.2 compares baseline statistics for the NUSAF sample with those from a 2008 clus-
tered population-based household survey, the Northern Uganda Survey (NUS). The Uganda
National Statistics Bureau collected the NUS on behalf of Uganda’s Office of the Prime Min-
  42
    The data on NUSAF funding comes from administrative records that include all NUSAF projects funded
from 2004 to July 2007, one year before the disbursement to the YOP sample and about a year after the
most recent national election. Data on election returns come from

was conducted in all NUSAF districts and focused on consumption, labor market activity,
and health and education in the household. NUS sampling probabilities are estimates of the
probability of being sampled in the full northern population.


A.3     Two-stage surveys and response rates
Both endline surveys (2010 and 2012) were rolled out in two phases In Phase 1, we attempted
to interview all 2,677 people in their last known location. In 2010, 37% were not found in
their last know location, rising to 39% in 2012, and so they became eligible for tracking in
Phase 2. In Phase 2, we selected a random sample of the unfound—53% in 2010 and 38.5%
in 2012—stratifying by district and by the proportion unfound in the group for in-depth
tracking. For this subset of unfound groups, we made three attempts to find them in their
new locations and found 75% of them in 2010 and 59% in 2012. In the analysis, groups are
weighted to account for this two-stage process. Those found in Phase 1 receive unit weight,
those selected for Phase 2 tracking are weighted by the inverse of their selection probability,
while those not selected for Phase 2 tracking are dropped. We have no reports of survey
refusal, and no reward was offered for survey completion. See table A.3 for a more detailed
presentation of effective response rates.


A.4     Survey experiment
To manipulate participant ideas about the implementation of the program, we conducted a
survey experiment during the four-year endline. The goal of the survey experiment was to
manipulate respondents’ ideas about who was behind the implementation of the program
(World Bank versus the government) and how participants were selected (randomly selected
or nominated by the LC V). Individuals were randomized into one of five groups and in each
group the introductory script of the survey varied along these two dimensions.

  1. World Bank, Random. These surveys emphasized that the program was principally
     made possible by the action of the World Bank and that the groups were selected
     randomly to receive funding.

  2. World Bank, LC V. These surveys emphasized that the program was principally
     made possible by the action of the World Bank, but groups were selected by the NUSAF
     district technical officer (NDTO) under the supervision of the LC V Chairperson.

  3. Government, Random. These surveys emphasized that the program was principally

    Notes: Column (1) reports the full study sample sought in each round–in general, five people per group over 535 groups, save for one groups where baseline
    data on seven individuals was accidentally collected. Column (2) reports the percentage of these found in a first survey phase, where each respondent was
    sought at least once in the town they lived at baseline. Each endline had a second survey phase that tracked a random sample of migrants and other unfound
    individuals, and Column (3) reports average percentage randomly selected. This percentage varied exogenously by stratum according to the proportion missing
    and expense of tracking in that district. Column (4) reports the percentage of those sought in phase two successfully surveyed. Column (5) reports the final
    number of observations by survey round. Columns (6)-(9) report the corresponding response rates overall, by treatment status, and the treatment-control
    difference (calculated via regression, controlling for baseline district). Columns (6)-(9) are weighted by the inverse probability of selection in phase two of the
    survey (which varies by strata, with weights ranging from 1 to 4), and are referred to as "effective" response rates. Unfound respondents randomly dropped in
    phase two receive zero weight. Column (10) reports p-value on the difference term, using robust standard errors clustered at the group level.

      Notes: This table displays ITT results from our survey experiment. In column (1), we regress program attribution
      on an indicator for completing a survey where the introduction said the government was behind the program
      plus covariates and block fixed effects. In column (2), we include an indicator for completing a survey that said
      the World Bank was behind the program. In column (3), we regress believe in selection process on an indicator
      for completing a survey where the introduction said selection was random plus covariates and block fixed effects.
      In column (4), we include an indicator for completing a survey that said selection was not random.

      randomly to receive funding.

    4. Government, LC V. These surveys emphasized that the program was principally
       made possible by the action of the government, but groups were selected by the NDTO
       under the supervision of the LC V Chairperson.

    5. Neutral. None of the above information was presented.

Table A.4 displays the results of our survey experiment. The results show that the experiment
was not successful: individuals who were told the government was behind the program were
5 percentage points more likely to believe the World Bank funded the program. Similarly,
individuals who were told selection was not random were 6 percentage points less likely to
believe selection was not random.

Notes: Columns (1) and (2) report the control mean and standard deviation, respectively.
A small number of missing values are imputed at the median. Column (3) and (4) report
the difference between control and treatment and corresponding p-value from ordinary least
squares regressions of each baseline covariate on a treatment indicator, controlling for block
fixed effects and clustering by group.

B.2     Correlates of attrition
Table B.2 examines baseline correlates of attrition. We regress an indicator for attrition
on all baseline covariates including district fixed effects. Those who are younger, more risk
averse or work as casual laborers are more likely to attrit. Since attrition is higher among
the young and initially poorer, the average impact of treatment is predicted to be higher.
At the same time, the more literate are more likely to be unfound and so this could depress
their predicted returns from a grant.


B.3     Sensitivity of baseline balance to baseline non-response
Table B.3 looks at the sensitivity of randomization balance to alternate values for the miss-
ing control groups. The table examines four baseline covariates displaying randomization
imbalance at baseline: durable assets, prior vocational training, ability to obtain a 100,000
UGX loan, and savings in the past 6 months. All covariates are standardized and missing
data in the treatment group are imputed to the mean, or zero. However, missing control
group data are imputed to the mean (zero) plus 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, or 0.25 SD of the
covariate, thus gradually increasing the values of the covariates in the control group towards
balance. In general, imputed values of 0.10 to 0.20 SD are sufficient to bring the regression
differences to zero.


B.4     Robustness
We perform two sets of additional treatment analyses. Our first robustness check is to alter-
native specifications, which is displayed in Table B.4. We test four alternate specifications.
In the first, we drop all controls and only include randomization block fixed effects. In our
next one, we add only demographic covariates. Next we add all human and physical capital
controls. Our final specification includes all covariates but uses randomization inference to
calculate the standard errors. As shown in the table, our results are robust to these alternate
specifications.
    Our second robustness check is to alternative attrition scenarios. We impute outcome
values for unfound individuals at different points of the observed outcome distribution. The
most extreme bound, from Manski 1990, imputes the minimum value for unfound treated
members and the maximum for unfound controls. Following Karlan et al. 2015, we also
calculate less extreme bounds by imputing relatively high values of the dependent variables
for missing control group members, and relatively low values for missing treatment group

Notes: This table recalculates balance for four baseline covariates displaying randomization imbalance at baseline, in Table
B.1. Approximately 6% of control group observations are missing and a very small number of treatment group observations
are missing (people who completed the survey but did not respond to a specific question). All covariates are standardized and
missing treatment data are imputed to the mean, or zero. Missing control group data are imputed to the mean plus 0.05, 0.10,
0.15, 0.20, or 0.25 SD of the variable, thus gradually increasing the values of the covariates in the control group. Columns (1)
to (6) report summary statistics (mean, SD, and number of observations) for the imputed treatment and control group values.
Columns (7) and (8) recalculate treatment-control mean differences using an ordinary least squares regression of the covariate
on assignment to treatment and district (randomization strata) fixed effects. The standard error in Column (8) is robust and
clustered by group.

Notes: The table displays four alternate specifications to test the robustness of our results. Column (1) displays our main
specification. Column (2) displays the results of a regression of the outcome measure on treatment and randomization block
(district) fixed effects without any controls. Column (3) adds in demographic controls while column (4) adds in both demographic
controls and human and physical capital controls. Column (4) is the same as our main specification but calculates standard
errors using randomization inference. The overall summary indexes are the standardized mean of its composite outcomes,
standardized. Heterosketastic robust standard errors are reported in brackets.

Notes: The table reports robustness to alternative attrition scenarios. We impute missing dependent variables. In columns
2 – 5, we impute missing dependent variables for the treatment group as the found treatment mean minus a multiple of the
standard deviation of the treatment distribution. Similarly, we impute missing dependent variables for the control group as the
found control mean plus a multiple of the standard deviation of the control distribution. In column 6 we apply Manski bounds,
imputing the minimum value for unfound treated members and the maximum for unfound controls. Each regression controls for
baseline covariates and district fixed effects. The overall summary indexes are the standardized mean of its composite outcomes,
standardized. Heterosketastic robust standard errors are reported in brackets.

members.43 Specifically, we impute missing dependent variables for the treatment (control)
group as the found treatment (control) mean minus (plus) 0.025, 0.05, 0.10 or 0.50 SD of
the found treatment (control) distribution.
   Table B.5 reports ITT estimates under these attrition scenarios. Our results are generally
not robust to alternate attrition scenarios as the point estimate on opposition support is
generally positive but not significant.


B.5       Treatment effects by age
In table B.6, we analyze treatment effects by age to see if the effect is driven by first-time
voters. At baseline we could not collect data on whether individuals previously voted and
who they voted for, because of restrictions from the government partner and research funder
(the World Bank). We do, however, have their age at baseline, which allows us to separate
the sample by those who were old enough to vote in the previous election versus those who
were not.
    The figure shows that potential first time voters (individuals who were under 18 in
2005/20 or under in 2008) see no rise in opposition support. The effects are concentrated
  43
    This assumes the dependent variable points in the positive direction. If treatment leads to a decrease
in the outcome variable, as is the case for antisocial behaviors and antiviolent and anticriminal values, we
impute in the opposite direction (i.e smaller values for control, larger values for treatment).

                 Notes: The table reports treatment effects on opposition by age as a proxy for
                 first time voting. In column 1, we limit the sample to individuals aged 20 or under
                 (or those who were not eligible to vote in the previous election). In column 2, we
                 limit the sample to individuals above the age of 20 (or those eligible to vote inthe
                 previous election). In column 3, we use the entire sample and include a dummy
                 for being below 20 and an interaction between treatment and the dummy.

among those who were eligible to vote in the previous election.
    The lack of impact on young people offers some evidence that the effect we observe is
more about preferences. The impacts are coming from individuals who have more experience
voting These are not novices with an underdeveloped set of values. They are also more likely
to know the consequences of voting.. However, this is speculative so we take this result with
caution.


B.6    Heterogeneity by fair and random selection
In Table B.7, we display treatment effects by individual’s perceptions of the selection pro-
cess. Among those who thought program selection was fair, opposition support rose by 0.13
standard deviations, compared to 0.121 standard deviations among those who perceived
selection as unfair. Among those who thought program selection was random, opposition
support rose 0.169 standard deviations, compared to 0.123 standard deviations among those
who perceived selection as non-random

                Notes: This table displays ITT results by individual’s perceptions of selections. In
                columns 1 and 2 we show the treatment effect on individuals who thought selection
                was fair or not. In columns 3 and 4, we limit the sample to individuals who thought
                selection was random/not random.



B.7     Mediation analysis
In Table B.8 we conduct the mediation analysis described in Keele et al. (2015). In columns 1
and 2, we display treatment effects on all mediators displayed in section 5.2. In columns 3 and
4, we regress opposition support on treatment and each mediator, and display the coefficient
and standard error from each mediator. In columns 5 and 6, we regress opposition support on
treatment. In column 7, we display the percent of the effect on opposition support mediated
by each of variable listed. This is calculated by multiplying the coefficients in column 1 by
the coefficients in column 3, divided by the coefficients of column 5. We see that our income
index mediates a quarter of the total effect on opposition support, which is large compared
to other mediation analyses. The second largest factor is migration, which mediates only
10 percent of the effect we see. All other mediators explain only 5% of the effect we see on
opposition support.


B.8     Other outcomes
Table B.9 displays ITT effects on minor outcomes we collected that did not make it into the
main paper.

Notes: Columns (1) and (2) represent regressions of each mediator on treatment. Columns (3) and (4) display regressions of
opposition support on treatment and the mediator, Columns (5) and (6) display regressions of opposition support on treatment.
Column (7) displays the percent of the effect of opposition support mediated by the variables listed. This is calculated as the
coefficient in (1) times the coefficient in (2) divided by the coefficient of (3). See Keele et al. (2015) for more details. Standard
errors are heteroskedastic-robust and clustered by group.We calculate the ITT via a weighted least squares regression of the
dependent variable on a program assignment indicator, 13 district (randomization stratum) fixed effects, and a vector of control
variables that includes all of the baseline covariates reported in Appendix B.1.

‘Notes: This table displays ITT impacts on outcomes not displayed in the main tables. We regress each outcome
on treatment assignment, baseline covariates and block (district) fixed effects. We weight observations by the
inverse of the probability of selection into the endline survey.
