                        Tariffs, Saving and the Current Account



                                          ABSTRACT



       We
            investigate the effects of higher tariffs on the current account.

 Tariffs may        increase   or decrease investment depending on the capital intensity
 of   the   sector protected. We find that the response of saving to tariffs is

 sensitive to the modelling of saving behavior. In a model in which Consumers'

 discount rate varies endogenously (in the Uzawa preference form), saving falls

 with higher tariffs. This result may, however, be reversed in the

 lanchard—Yaarj type model in which consumers have uncertain lifetimes. We

 find that in both models the
                                      response of saving depends on a production
 distortion effect which changes steady—state income and an effect on

 steady—state expenditures.

       Tariffs are frequently proposed as a policy to reduce or eliminate

  current account deficits. This
                                   paper explores the effectiveness of those
  policies for a small country in the context of a two—sector neoclassical

  growth model. We find it less insightful to
                                                 examine the current account when
 written in its net exports form. A
                                        naive analysis leads one to conclude that

 since tariffs reduce imports, there must be a tendency to improve the current

 account. This is a very partial equilibrium
                                                 viewpoint that ignores
 adjustments throughout the economy. In static neoclassical trade models (in

 which the current account is zero
                                      by assumption) shifts in production and

 consumption patterns ensure that any reduction in imports is matched by an

 equal drop in exports. In a large class of
                                               macroeconomic models with flexible
 exchange rates the tariff also has no impact on the current account, because

 an exchange rate appreciation will
                                      immediately offset all changes from higher
 tariffs. To understand the long run
                                        consequences of tariff policies, we want
 to consider the components of the current account in its saving less

 investment form. This allows us to see clearly that if a tariff is to reduce

a current account deficit it must have the effect of decreasing the
                                                                          country's
international borrowi ng.

     We concentrate mainly on how tariffs change the level of saving. The

response of saving is found to be sensitive to the
                                                      specific modelling of
saving behavior. In particular, we
                                       compare saving behavior in two popular
intertemporal optimizing models of small open economies -   the endogenous
discount rate approach of Uzawa (1968) (which has been taken in the

international context by Obstfeld (1981, 1982) among others) and the uncertain

lifetime model of Blanchard (1985) and Yaari (1965).
                                                        In some respects, the
saving functions derived from these models are quite similar. Both assume

that savers maximize utility over an infinite horizon, and both
                                                                generate
                                        2




Metzlerian savi ng equations in which the level of saving is proportiona1 to

the difference between some target level of wealth and current wealth •         Yet,

the response of national saving to tariffs can be quite different in the two

formulations.   The target wealth level will change according to two effects

that we identify — a steady—state expenditure effect and a producti on

distortion effect. The distortion effect always works to increase saving when

tariff levels rise.    In the tizawa-type model tan ffs also increase saving

through the expenditure effect, in contrast to the uncert am         lifetime model in

which the expenditure effect may 1 ead to lower saving as tariffs go up.

     Our small open economy consi sts of two sectors - one that produces a good

that can be used either for current c onsumption or for in vestment, and the

other being a pure consumpti on good.   The composite good is manufactured with

labor and capital, while the pure cons umption good uses 1 abor and land i n its

production. This particular structure was chosen because it represents the

simplest possible arrangement that allows a capita 1 good to be produced and
                                                       1
traded, and that allows international borrow   i n g       It is well known that the

more familiar two sector models in which 1 abor and capita 1 are used to produce

both goods yield, in general, an indeterminate capital stock when foreign

borrowing is permi tted.2

     The model is dynamic, since international borrowing is inherently not a

static phenomenon.    Furthermore, we examine the dynamics of the current

account over an infi nite span of time. Another approach would have been to

look at a two—period model of the economy, but there are drawbacks to such a

tact. It is impossible in the two-period world to distinguish between the

short—run and long—run effects of policy changes.          Also, the two-period view

can be limiting when trying to study the dynamics of borrowing. A dollar

borrowed today must be paid back with interest in that set—up. With an
                                          3




  infinite horizon, the principal on the loan never needs to be paid back —
                                                                                 the
 present—value of the stream of interest payments equals the value of the

 principal.

      Since we wish to focus on the effect of tariffs on saving, we have

 assumed that there are no costs to adjusting the
                                                      capital stock. Thus, the
 entire investment response occurs on impact when the tariff rates change. If

 the tariff is placed on the
                               pure consumption good then production of that good

 expands, drawing labor out of the composite good sector. This lowers the

 marginal productivity of capital in that sector, thus making capital a less

 attractive asset than foreign bonds. Capital is immediately traded

 internationally for bonds until the marginal
                                                 productivity of capital increases
 into equality with the world interest rate. If the tariff were levied on the

composite good the opposite reaction would occur —     there   would be an immediate
export of foreign bonds for capital. Thus, the impact effect from investment

changes on the current account depends on which good the tariff is levied.

     Countries that are small in international
                                                   capital markets, and in which
individuals are infinitely lived and have constant discount rates, cannot

reach a steady—state with non—zero wealth
                                              unless the knife—edge condition is
met that the discount rate at home equals the world interest rate. The Yaari—

Blanchard model endogenizes the interest rate, in a sense which will be made

clear later. The Uzawa—Obstfeld
                                  approach assumes the discount rate changes in

response to changes in expenditure levels. Both models yield a saving

equation near the steady—state that can be written as



         s =     — a),
                                      4




where s is saving, a is tradeable assets (capital plus bonds) and   is the

steady—state level of a. Since a cannot change immediately when tariffs are

imposed (capital can only be acquired through borrowing in the very short

run), the effect on saving of a tariff is directly related to the effect on

steady-state holdings of tradeable assets. The response of    to the tariff,

however, may be very different in the two models.

     At this point it is worth emphasizing that we are interested only in the

positive question of how tariffs affect the current account in a small

economy, and do not examine welfare questions.

     Section 2 sets up the model and explores the effects of tariffs on

investment. In section 3, the response of saving to a tariff on the pure

consumption good is explored when consumers have Uzawa preferences, while the

same issue is dealt with in section 4 under the assumption that consumers have

uncertain lifetimes. Section 5 takes up briefly the case of a tariff on the

composite good. Conclusions are drawn in the final section. Much of the

formal mathematics is included in an appendix.




2. The Model



     There are two goods produced in our model — a pure consumption good and a

composite good that can be consumed or used as an investment good. The

composite good, which is labelled good 1, uses capital and labor in its

production. The production function is assumed to be constant returns to

scale, and output is given by
                                         S




             y1        kf(x/k)



 where k is the stock of capital and x is the amount of labor employed in

 industry 1. Output in the second industry uses land and labor in its

 production, and the technology is again constant returns to scale. Labor is

 mobile between industries and it is assumed that the total labor supply as

 well as the total land stock are fixed at 1. We can write



            y2 = g(1 -         x)


 Capital depreciates at a rate n, so



            I = k + nk




where I equals the rate of investment.

      The current account is equal to the trade surplus added to interest

earned on holdings of foreign bonds. We have



(1)        b =    rb   —
                           ,



where b is domestic holdings of
                                foreign assets,    is the trade deficit and r
is the given world interest rate. This
                                         equation says that the current account
surplus equals the rate of accumulation of foreign assets.

      For the economy as a whole
                                                6




 (2)           yl +        =z   +   i   —




where z is the value of total current consumption expenditure on the two goods

(valued at world prices) by domestic residents, and p is the world price of

good 2. This simply states that the value of Output equals consumption plus

investment less the trade deficit. (There is no government sector per Se.

Tariff revenue is redistributed back to consumers with lump—sum transfers.)

        It is convenient at this point to introduce the notation



               £     x/k




Competitive asset markets and the free mobility of capital internationally

ensure that bonds and physical capital offer the same rate of return:



(3)            r =   f(Q) — £f'(l)      — n



The right side of the equation is the net marginal productivity of capital.

For a given world rate of interest and depreciation rate this equation implies

i is fixed over time.

        Since labor is mobile between sectors, the marginal productivity of labor

will be equalized in the two industries:



(4)                   — £k) =   f'(z)       .




Here,   ' is   the domestic price of good 2, which will differ from the world

price if tariffs are in place. Except at the instant of a change in the
                                              7




  tariff rate,      does not change over time. Given that       2.   is   fixed from eq. (3),
  the capital stock k will only change at the moment the tariff is altered.
                                                                                         So,




  and




              i = nk




         This country may be net importers of
                                                   both goods, only one good or neither
 good at any point in time. From eq. (4)



             dk/d = gI/$   yfi   <o


 If   the tariff on the pure consumption
                                            good is increased, the capital stock
 falls. This occurs because production
                                            of good 2 increases, drawing labor out
 of sector 1 which is the
                          capital—using industry. So, there is an incipient
 drop in the marginal productivity of
                                      capital. Disinvestment occurs as capital
 is traded for foreign bonds. If the tariff on the pure consumption
                                                                    good is
lowered——or, equivalently, the tariff on the composite good is raised--the

capital stock increases.

        We can see now that the direction
                                            of the investment effect on the current
account of a change in the level of
                                      protection depends upon which good the
tariff is levied. If the capital—using good is protected, investment

increases and the current account falls.
                                                  The current account balance will go
up, on the other hand, if tariffs on the
                                              good that uses land and labor in its
production are raised.
                                       8



     In this get—up the capital stock can change discretely. If investment is

to occur over time there must be some rigidity that prevents the immediate

adjustment of the stock of capital. A popular, though somewhat ad hoc, way of

modelling this is to impose adjustment costs for both increasing and

decreasing the capital stock. A more natural way of allowing gradual

investment and disinvestment is to assume capital, once in place, cannot be

moved. Disinvestment could take place only at the rate of depreciation. New

investment could only occur as new capital goods are produced. A small

country might reasonably be able to meet its capital needs in a very short

period of time with capital imports, since its desired investment might be a

small fraction of current production of capital goods. However, a large

country could not increase its capital stock quickly since its desired

investment might exceed current investment goods production.

     Another direction in which the model of investment could be altered is to

allow a more general production structure. For example, we might allow all

three factors to move between industries. In this case, if the elasticities

of substitution between factors are equal in the two industries, then

protection of a good will unambiguously lead to an increase (decrease) in the

capital stock if that industry uses a larger (smaller) share of the countrys

capital stock than its share of the supply of labor or land. If there are

more goods and factors, some weaker general results are available in Ruffin

(1984) and the references cited therein.

 3. Saving in the lizawa-Obstfeld Model



         In this sector we will consider a model with
                                                               a representative consumer
 who has Uzawa preferences. We will assume the pure consumption good is

 protected and look at the effects on saving of increasing the level of

 protection.

        At any moment in time, current felicity depends on consumption of both

 goods —
           u(c1,   c2).       It is convenient, however, to express the level of

 felicity by the indirect utility function



             v(I, p) = max
                                  {u(c1, c2)1c1 +   'c2   I}




where I represents the level of expenditure at any given time, expressed in

terms of domestic prices.

        A consumer maximizes the integral


                             -A
            V=f vte tdt
                   0



where


                       t
               =
                   f ôds
                    0



and      is the instantaneous subjective discount rate at time s. Following

Uzawa, we take             to be a function of utility at time s:



               =   5(v)
                                                               10




As in lizawa, we assume




             ô>0, 5>0, 6-S'v>O, â">O.

      Consumers choose their 'level of expenditure subject to the constraint



(5)           =   rw +   f'(i.)   +       R    -   I   *




where w is the value of non-human wealth owned by the individual. By

definition



           w = b + k +      (g        -
                                              (1-x)g'(l-x))/r

The last term in this equation represents the value of 'land.               In eq. (5) R is

tariff revenue distributed to the individual. Consumers take R as given and

do not perceive that their choices alter its level. Since the capital stock

and the value of land do not change over time h = w.                Therefore, eq. (5) could
be rewritten as



           b =    rb
                       +y1 +'y2 +              R   —   I   -   I



Then we can see from eqs. (1) and (2)



           R =    ( - p)(c2       -
                                      y2)


      The aggregate model is shown in the Appendix to be characterized by

saddle stability. Therefore, near the steady-state we have
                                                      11




              b =          —
                               b)             >
                    e1(b            ,
                                         °1


  where       is the negative elgenvalue of the dynamic system. Define tradeable
  assets a to be




              a=b+k.

 Since equation (4) tells us capital is fixed over time, k =
                                                                               . Thus,    we can
 write




 (6)         b =   e( — a)

 This is a particularly useful
                                           equation to analyze. it represents the
 accumulation of foreign bonds over time              -
                                                           i.e.,   the current account. The
 current account just equals saving, because all investment changes occur

discretely at a point in time.

       The level of a is given to the
                                                  economy at any given time. Capital can be
traded for bonds, and vice—versa, but their
                                            sum can only change over time.
Thus, if tariffs are to affect saving it can
                                             only be through effects on .
According to equation (6), as                 rises so does   saving and the current account.
       Given our assumptions on the mobility of
                                                international capital               ,   any model
of saving that has a stable steady—state will
                                              yield a saving equation such as
(6) near the steady—state.
                                        However', different models of saving behavior
                                                                                      may
imply that the target level of traded assets a
                                               responds differently as tariffs
are increased.

       From eqs. (1) and (2), we have that in steady—state when b =
                                                                    0,
                                                                         12




             b = (1 -
                             y1
                                   -
                                       py2)/r
                                                       +       z/r


Therefore,


(7)            =   [k    +   (i    -
                                       y1
                                               —
                                                   py2)/r]           +       t/r]
      It is useful to look at the change in the two bracketed terms on the

right side of eq. (7) separately. We would like to know how each term changes

with an increase in tariffs. First let us note



             d(y1 +
                                           =
                                               d(kf(1)          + pg(1 —               k9j)/dk
                         py2)/dk


                                           =    ftt)       —
                                                                pig(1         -   x)


                                           =   r   + n +         ( — p)g'(1                —   x)



The last step uses eqs. (3) and (4). Remembering that i = nk, we then have



          d[k +         (I   —
                                  y1
                                       —
                                               py2)/r]/d'
                                                                     =       [1 +      (1/r)d(i     —
                                                                                                        y1
                                                                                                             —
                                                                                                                 py2)/dk]dk/d

                   =
                        -[('p — pLQg'(1                —
                                                               x)/rJdk/c1


This derivative is positive because                                      >    p   and dk/d < 0.

      We see that from the first term of eq. (7), steady—state holdings of

traded assets must rise with an increase in the tariff on the pure consumption
                                           13




  good. Intuitively, in order to maintain the same level of income in
                                                                            steady-
  state after the tariff is imposed, the
                                            capital that is shipped abroad must be
  replaced by bonds. But, in fact, the
                                           economy needs to replace the capital
  with more than an equal amount of
                                      bonds to generate the same level of
  income. With a tariff already in place there was a distortion that
                                                                     caused the
  economy to have a lower capital stock than it
                                                  would under free trade. An
  increase in the tariff worsens the distortion as it moves more
                                                                 resources to
 the protected sector. So, to maintain the same level of income, bonds
                                                                       must be
 imported not only to offset the lost capital but also to counteract the

 aggravation of the distortion. We call this effect on steady-state holdings
 of b + k the distortion effect, and it
                                        causes  to rise with an increase in
 the tariff rate irrespective of the model of saving behavior.

      The second term in eq. (7) involves
                                             the steady-state level of
 expenditure, .   If   consumers have the endogenous discount rate of Lizawa

 preferences, then over time expenditure
                                           adjusts so that in the steady state
 the discount rate equals the world rate of interest:



          ô(v(I, ))    =r


The steady—state level of felicity is determined by this
                                                         relationship, and
will not change if a tariff is
                                  imposed. (Thus, all welfare loss from the
imposition of a tariff comes
                               along the transition to the steady—state, but not
in the steady—state itself.)

     An increase in the tariff rate
                                      will raise the long—run level of
expenditure at world prices. Figure 1 demonstrates this increase in

expenditure for a finite tariff
                                starting from free trade. Before the tariff,
steady—state Consumption is at point a, and the expenditure is z. With the
C1

 tariff, consumers set their marginal rate of substitution equal to the

 domestic price given by the slope of the dotted line. So, in order to

 maintain the same long—run felicity, expenditure rises to z'. This same point

 can be demonstrated mathematically by using properties of expediture

 functions. We can define



              1(1, jS,   v)       =   mm     {c1 +
                                                         c2ru(c1,     c2) > v}



 Then

                    =

                                      +
                                          p122)
                                                     +   (—


                   = (p       —                      0

        We see that steady-state expenditure rises when the tariff increases.

Thus, in this model both the distortion effect and the expenditure effect

contribute to higher saving as tariffs go up.                            In the next section, we will
see that in the uncertain lifetime model
                                                                   steady—state expenditure falls with a
raise in the tariff rate.

 4. Saving in the Yaari—Blanchard Model



      In this section we take up a model in which there is a continuum of

agents, each of whom faces a constant probability of death it.   At each instant
of time a new cohort of size     is born. The population is constant and has a

size equal to 1.

     Each agent can own physical wealth in the form of bonds, capital or

claims on land. Since these assets are perfect substitutes, they all earn the

world rate of interest r.   In addition, each agent is assumed to make a deal

with an insurance company that he receive an additional rate of return ,t

from the company if he lives, but that the company receive his physical wealth

if he dies. Conversely, if the individual has net holdings of physical wealth

less than zero, he agrees to pay a premium rate of t per unit of debt on the

condition the insurance company assumes his debt if he dies. The expected

profit for the insurance company is zero.

     There are two types of wealth that are assumed not transferable to the

insurance company for an annuity. The individual's human wealth (the

discounted value of labor income) has no value upon death, so the insurance

company is unwilling to pay anything to have the privilege of owning this

asset after the person's death. Similarly, the individual has no claim on

tariff revenue after death. Tariff revenue is distributed only to living

persons, and not to anybody's estate.

     Individuals are assumed to maximize expected utility, which, given the

constant probability of death implies they maximize



         I       v(I, )e o)tdt
             0
                                                                      16




 They face the constraint



 (8)              =
                      (r    +
                                   it)w1
                                               +       f'()   + R —
                                                                       I
 where w. is the value of non—human wealth owned by individual i. That is,



 (9)         w =      b1
                           +
                                   k   +   (g           -
                                                            (1 -   x)g'(l   -




The last terin in eq. (9) represents the value of land. This can be seen by

noting that the return to owning a unit of land is (g — (1                             —
                                                                                           x)g'(l   —
                                                                                                        x))
plus t    times the value of a unit of land.

        We make an additional restriction on preferences in this section in order

to be able to aggregate individual consumption into an aggregate consumption

function. In particular, we assume that preferences are homothetic and can be

written in constant relative risk aversion form:



             v(I, )        = [I1/(1                     -




        The Appendix shows that aggregate expenditure is proportional to wealth

of all forms:




(10)        z =            + (f'()                 -
                                                       ( - p)y2)/(r         +   tfl]
where



            A =   r+           —    (r     —   6)/o
                                                        17




Human wealth is given by f()/(r + vt). The term -(                       - p)y2   is the sum of

tariff revenue and z — 1.               It represents the cost to the individual of a

tariff — he receives revenue R, but the price of good 2 is higher.

       For the types of wealth with which the individual cannot purchase an

annuity, there is no difference between the rate of return for society and the

individual. They might both be discounted at a rate r +                           So, we can say

the value of these assets is [f'(.) —                   (' — p)y2]/(r   + t). The return on these

assets is simply f'(.) -            ( — p)y2.       On the other hand, the rate of return on

physical wealth for society is only r. The annuity payment t is merely a

transfer from the insurance company to individuals. Thus, for society



(11)             = rw + f'() —          (' - p)y2   -    z



       This economy can reach a steady-state even though it faces a given world

interest rate and has a constant discount rate.                    In a sense, the total rate of

return on assets varies endogenously. The rate of return on physical wealth

is r and on non-tangible assets r ÷ t. The total return on the econoniys

portfolio is r + itX, where x is the share of wealth in non—tangible assets.

As     changes over time, the economy-wide rate of return adjusts.

       If r <       then the system is saddle—stable, and



              b =          —
                               b)       °2 >
                    e2(b


Unlike the previous section, this equation holds globally (not just near the

steady—state) because of our constant relative risk aversion assumption. Once

again, we can write
                                                    18




              b =   e2( — a)


 because the capital stock jumps immediately to its long run value.              So, the

 tariff will raise the current account if it causes              to jump up.

        Eqs. (2), (3), (4), (5) and (9) can be used to show that the asset

 accumulation equation (11) above is equivalent to eq. (1). Thus, there is no

difference from the previous section in the expression for the long—run level

of traded assets



 (7)            =   [k   + (i -      - py2)/r]    + [i/r]



As before, the distortion effect

will cause a to go up.

        Steady-state expenditures can be derived from eqs. (10) and (11) when
  =    0.   These expenditures are simply proportional to the

have called non—tangible assets:



             z =    Eit/( - r)J[(f)           -
                                                  ( - p)y2)/(r ÷)]

In this model, long run expenditures fall as the tariff is increased:



             d/d =                - r)(r   + )][.(p - p)g   — — g]
Here, at any point in time consumption is proportional to wealth —             much as in

a permanent income model.
                                    The steady—state requires that w be proportional to

non—tangible assets, which in turn implies steady—state consumption
                                              19




expenditures are proportional to the value of non—tangible assets. Since the

value of these assets falls with a tariff, so does long—run expenditure.

       So, in the Yaari—Blanchard world of uncertain lifetimes and a constant

discount rate, the distortion and expenditure effects of a change in tariffs

work in opposite directions on the current account. The expenditure effect

may in fact dominate the distortion effect, so higher tariffs could cause a

decrease in the current account balance.




5.     Tariffs on the Composite Good



       In this section we will briefly trace through the effects of a tariff on

the composite good. The results are not too different from the previous

section. The only change is that in the Yaari—Blanchard model the sign of the

expenditure effect is indeterminate.

       It is useful in this section to change numeraires so that expenditure

levels are expressed in terms of the pure consumption good. So, we now have



(12)        Z =        +        + Yt — p1



and




(13)        I =
                  y1   +
                           y2
                                + R +   r-1

We will also express the value of bonds and the current account in terms of

good 2:
                                                                 20




 (14)        b =   rb +            +         -       z -   p1
                             py1        y2


This implies that in steady—state, when b =                             0,   long-run bond holdings are

given by



             b =   (pi   -
                             py1
                                    -
                                        y2)/r         +    z/r

We now write the labor market equilibrium as: f'() g'(l -                                    k.).
        Both models are saddle—stable again, under the same set of assumptions.

So, foreign bond accumulation can once again be expressed as



             b=e(b —b) ,                9>0.

The capital stock will equal its long—run value at all times, so



(15)         b =   e( - a)

where



             a = b + pk




It follows that the tariff will affect saving only to the extent it influences

.      The steady—state level of                      is given by



(16)          =
                   [pk + (pi       —
                                        py1
                                                 —
                                                      y2)/r]     +    [/r]
                                               21




       Taking the change in the term in the first bracket in eq. (16) will yield

the distortion effect. It is again positive, so that higher tariffs tend to

 lead to higher levels of , and a higher current balance, through this

channel




            d[pk + (p1 —     —                 =
                                                             (1/r)d(pi

                                                                                   -
                                                                                       y2)/dk]dk/d'

                  =
                      [( - p)fU)/r]dk/d

This derivative is greater than zero because '               >p   and dk/d' >          0.
       In the model with Uzawa preferences, the increase in tariffs again leads

to a higher steady—state expenditure level. The current account rises from

both the distortion effect and the expenditure effect. Formally, the long—run

felicity level is determined by the condition



           o(v(I, ))     =r


Now, let us define




           I(, 1, v) =     mm   {'c1 +   c2Iu(c1,    c2) > v}



Then



           z =

                    = (p — )I]            > 0




        In the uncertain lifetime formulation, aggregate expenditure is given by



(17)         z    tjw +   (f'(.z) + ( — p)(i                   —
                                                                   y1))/(r    +



where



(18)        w = b   +k +       (g   —
                                          (1 —k))g')/r



Human wealth is given by f'(Z)/(r +                   ). The              term ( — p)(i   -
                                                                                              y1)    again

represents the change in the individual consumer's income from the tariff,

equalling the sum of tariff revenue arid z —                         I.
       Saving is given by the relation



(19)        w =     +   f'()        +     ( - p)(i    -
                                                           y1)
                                                                     -    z




Eqs. (12), (13) and (18) can be used to show that equation (19) is identical

to eq. (14). Thus, eq. (16) gives the steady—state holdings of                                      in this

model.

       We can use eqs. (18) and (19) to solve for long run consumption

expenditures:
                                          23




           z =        - r)][(f'() + (-p)(i         -y1))/(r+it)]


The change in    from an increase in the tariff on the composite good is given

by:



           dz/d =         - r)(r + it)]1( - p)(n      -
                                                          f(t))
                                                                  s:!K




                          — (kf()   —
                                        fCz) — nk)]


The first term in the second bracket is negative because f (9.)          >   n on the

assumption that the world interest rate is positive. This means the entire

expression for dz/d is less than zero if (kf() —          f'(z)     — nk) is positive.

This condition will be met if capital's income exceeds the income of labor

employed in the consumption goods sector.

      The expenditure effect on steady- state traded asset hal dings can be

negative (though it need not be). If it is negative, it may outweigh the

distortion effect. So, once again in the uncertain lifetime model rai sing

tariffs may lower the current account bal ance.




6. Conclusions



      We have examined in this paper how the current account responds to

increases in the level of protection, according to two popular models for

small economies that can borrow internationally. The two models——the Uzawa-

Obstfeld endogenous time preference set—up and the Yaari—Blanchard uncertain
                                           24




lifetime formulation--have much in common. Both assume consumers have

foresight and optimize; and both       under the proper set of assumptions,

descri be economies that converge to a steady—state         Yet, the reaction of the

current account to tariff changes can be quite d issimila r in these models.

     This conci usi on is of practical    importance.    There is increasing use in

the profes sion of general equilibrium models for small 1 ess developed

countries to try to give answers to policy questions. T hese models are

empirically b ased, and some (such as Kharas and Shishido (1985), and Ghanem

(1985)) have allowed intertemporal optimization          A less on of this paper is

that some p01 icy conclusions drawn about the ef fects of tariffs might be quite

sensitive to the structure of the model. It is necessary to know         whether

savers have a target level of long-run welfare a r whether their expenditure

levels are ju St   proportional   to permanent income.

     Although in some ways the models stud ied in this paper are limited, the

structure is rich enough to highlight the usefulness of the dynamic

I ntertemporal   approach to current account analysis. The effect on saving of

higher tariffs is seen to depend on matte rs that are not at all relevant in

static or two-pen od model s. The impact of the tariff on the steady—state

levels of income and consumption through the distortion effect and the

expendi ture effect are of primary importance.

A. Uzawa-Obstfeld Model

     In setting up the formal optimization problem for the model described in

section 3, it is useful to note



          dA =   5dt


We can write the level of utility as



          V =    f 0 (v/o)d

We also have



          db/dt =      (1/o)db/dA


     With these facts in nind, we can write the Hamiltonian for the

individual's optimization problem as



          H =   (1/o)(v   +   q(rb   +
                                         y1
                                              +
                                                  py2
                                                        +   R   -   - I))

We also impose the constraint that



          lim tbert >0.
                    —

          t-

Without this constraint, given the infinite planning horizon, an individual

could achieve an arbitrarily high level of utility by borrowing a large sum
now and meeting interest payments through future borrowing. When we solve the

individual's optimum problem, if the transversality condition is satisfied

then the constraint is also satisfied.

      The first—order conditions are given by



           —(o'v'Io)q(rb +
                                    y1   +y2 +            R       -    I   -   I)       +    (v'/o)(ô          -   o'v)   = q




or




           q     v'(ô —   ô'v)/[o        +   5v(rb            +
                                                                      y1 +'y2 +               R    —   I   -
                                                                                                               I)]

and




           q =   (a — r)q


      Taking the time derivative of the log of the first condition and equating

it to the second we have



          o    -r   =
                        [v"(o   -   O'v)     -   O"v'2v]I/v'(O                      -       o'v)


                                —   a'v'[rb       +   I       —       z]/[o + ô'v'b]

                                —   [&"v'2       +   ô'v"]bI/[a                 +       o'v'b]

      We will use the fact that z = (1 + (p —
                                                                               ')c)I              where c is the derivative

of c2 with respect to income, which is assumed to be positive.

      Solving out, we get
             •
                  —   [(1+(p—)c)v' (ô—ô'v)(o—r+ô'v'                (rb-z+y1÷py2—i)]

                      [vfl(oo1v)oIv12(v÷vIb)](o1v12,o)(ooIv)c1(p)

This is an expression for ; in terms of z and b. If we linearize this

expression near the steady-state we get



            z =
                      [(1+(p-)c)v'(ô-ô'v)o'v'r](b-b)/D

                            +



where D =   v"(o—ô'v)-o'v'2v                    —
                                                    (o'v'2Io)(o-o'v)cCp_p)      < 0. Both coefficients

in the above equation are negative. The first is less than zero because

1 +              > 0.        To see this, note that 1 -                =
      (p—)c                                                                cj   by Engel aggregation (no

relation). Assuming good 1 is normal, Cj > 0.

      This dynamic equation combined with the bond accumulation equation



            b =       r(b   —    5)    -
                                           (z   -




yields   a two—equation, two—variable linear dynamic system near steady state.

      The system has a positive and negative root, so it exhibits saddle

stability. As in the text, we have



            b =                 - b)


where —e1 is the negative root of the dynamic system.
       The transversality condition gives a sufficient condition for a path of b

that satisfies the first—order conditions to be optimal. In this case, it

is:3



            urn eAqb =    0




The path that leads to the steady state is an optimal path, so we will

concentrate on the dynamics along the saddle path. Notice that the

intertemporal budget constraint is satisfied along the saddle path •        If

initial conditions are given which are not on the path, then there will be a

jump in the state variables b and k    such that wealth remains constant

       In the case of a tariff on the composite good, the derivation of the

equations of the dynamic system fol lows in a straightforward fashi on the

methods for the tariff on the pure consumption good. The dynamic system once

again is saddle—stable.



B. Yaari—Blanchard Model

       The optimization problem described in the text is for an individual at

the beginning of his lifetime who is born at time 0. This particular problem

was set up for notational simplicity.

       The Harniltonian for the problem described is



            H =                    + q[(r)w     +   f'()   +   R   -
                                                                       I]
The first order conditions are given by
           Iv (
and



           q/q       r - 8




Taking the time derivative of the log of the first condition and equating it

to the second yields



                     =   r   — 5




This implies



                             ((r—o)k)t
              it —   0e

      We would like to get an expression for the evolution of z. Because we

assume homothetic preferences, c2 is a constant proportion of I. Therefore



           (   — p)c2    =    au



where a is a function only of            and not of I.   Therefore,



          z =    (1 —    a)I.

and we have
                    —
                    —             ((r-ô)/t,)t
                             0e

      We impose the transversality condition



                                      +n)t =
            urn w.te_
                 1




Rewriting   the dynamic budget constraint as



                =
                        (r   +
                                  it)w     +    f'()         —
                                                                     (' — p)y2   —
                                                                                     z1



we can integrate the transversality condition to get




            f   zjte)t                     dt =
                                                        w1       +   [f'()   -        - p)y2J/(r   +




Plugging in our expression for Zjt and solving, we get


            z1 =                  + [f'(i)          —
                                                        ( — p)y2]1(r             +




Aggregating as in Blanchard (1985) gives us the aggregate expenditure function
in the text.

      We have a two-equation, two—variable linear dynamic system, with the

equations of motion given by



                    r(w —         )    -   (z   -




and
               = [(r -               -   - M(w -


This system is saddle—stable if r        —A <   0.   We then have



               =            -
                   e2(b         b)



where




          e2
                   =A   —   r
