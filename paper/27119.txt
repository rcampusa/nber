A Note on Long-Run Persistence of Public Health Outcomes in Pandemics

                                          ABSTRACT

Covid-19 is the single largest threat to global public health since the Spanish Influenza pandemic
of 1918-20. Was the world better prepared in 2020 than it was in 1918? After a century of public
health and basic science research, pandemic response and mortality outcomes should be better
than in 1918-20. We ask whether mortality from historical pandemics has any predictive content
for mortality in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. We find a strong persistence in public health
performance in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Places that performed poorly in terms
of mortality in 1918 were more likely to have higher mortality today. This is true across countries
and across a sample of US cities. Experience with SARS is associated with lower mortality today.
Distrust of expert advice, lack of cooperation at many levels, over-confidence, and health care
supply shortages have likely promoted higher mortality today as in the past.

        The most recent global public health scares such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, and H1N1
influenza in 2009 were largely successfully contained without extraordinary levels of excess
mortality at the global level. This track record suggests high preparedness and ability to
manage pandemics. On the other hand, society has changed in the last 100 years and even in
the last decade since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
        Our research correlates population mortality rates for Covid-19 today with mortality
rates from influenza and pneumonia in the 1918-20 pandemic and with SARS in 2002-03.
We do so in a broad sample of countries and for a sample of large US cities.
        We find a strong long-run persistence in public health performance. In the weeks and
months of the Covid-19 pandemic, places that performed poorly in terms of mortality during
the “Spanish flu” were more likely to have higher mortality today. This is true across
countries and across a sample of US cities. Our results are robust to inclusion of a range of
fixed effects and control variables. The results for the US city data are robust to endogeneity
using an instrumental variables strategy.
        We also find that there has been some recent success consistent with the possibility
of learning (at the societal level) over time. Countries that were more strongly affected by
SARS in 2002-03 are likely to have lower mortality rates today, thus far, from Covid-19.
These places are mainly in East Asia and have a recent memory of a potentially highly lethal
pandemic. As we detail in the discussion, these successes (and failures) when compared to
history depend upon a number of deeper social and political determinants. In short “mis-
trust, isolationism and hubris” matter. These may not be persistent but, whether by
coincidence or not, they are arguably present now in the case of the many nations, especially
in many Western nations.


1.2 Preliminary Discussion and Background


       Can we compare public health outcomes in 1918 to today? What drives public health
today and in the past? Rapid geographic mobility due to air travel has increased dramatically
in recent decades and significantly so with respect to the years 1918-1920. International
connections have continued to grow even since 2002, but international cooperation is
waning as exemplified by recent US policy. Modern methods of communication like social
media, which have emerged in the last decade, complicate the search for accurate content
and often create confusion.
        Distrust of expert opinion has also heightened in the last decade. In many western
societies, including the US, experts have often been replaced with political appointees and
civil servants have been granted minimal leeway. Moreover, health infrastructure and
accessibility in many countries, even developed and advanced economies, was widely
predicted to be incapable of meeting surging demands induced by a pandemic. Such

                                              2
bottlenecks can raise cumulative mortality when health care provides viable means of
treatment.
        In this regard, the public health response to the Covid-19 pandemic represents a
significant test of preparedness and whether modern public health systems can do better
than they have done historically. Evidently, SARS-CoV-2 and the 1918 H1N1 influenza have
different etiologies and epidemiology. Nevertheless, the two pandemics seem to be roughly
similar in the magnitude of their case fatality ratios. An estimate of the case fatality rate
(CFR) for Covid-19 is 1.34% while the CFR for the 1918-20 influenza has been estimated to
be roughly 2.5% (Verity et al. 2020 and Short et. al, 2018). 1
       Given these numbers, and modern levels of knowledge and know how, one might
strongly expect better performance today. Given the estimated fatality rates, most would
predict lower mortality at this point in the pandemic than in 1918-20. After all, humanity has
a century of public health research and practice, along with experience gained from SARS,
MERS and Ebola. Contingency plans have been formulated at the behest of the WHO and
through national initiatives. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing)
designed to lower peak mortality have been investigated and shown to be effective (Bootsma
and Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et. al, 2007; Markel et. al, 2007).
       Recent data make us less sanguine. Figure 1 illustrates that many countries, especially
advanced western countries, have had a difficult time in keeping mortality rates below the
frontier defined by US mortality rates from flu and pneumonia in 1918 at similar stages in
the pandemic. Similarly, Figure 2 shows a number of US states also witnessed mortality rates
per 100,000 population above those witnessed in 1918 at a similar stage. These statistics
give us pause to re-consider the persistence of pandemic mortality.
       We emphasize that our goal in this paper is not to assess the level of mortality in one
pandemic versus the other. There are obvious problems comparing distinct diseases and
many data measurement issues. Neither do we wish to argue that Covid-19 will be worse in
terms of mortality than 1918-20. Instead, we compare relative outcomes across time. We ask
whether historical public health performance has any predictive content for public health
performance in a recent pandemic. We find that historical experience does help predict
recent experience.


    2. Data and Analysis


    2.1 Data Collection
       We collect data on country–level population mortality from the influenza pandemic
of 1918 and from Covid-19. Our baseline country sample covers 33 countries. The sample is

1Case fatality ratios for the 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics were roughly 0.27 and 0.15 (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2007).

                                                     3
determined by availability of estimated mortality rates from the 1918 influenza pandemic,
other control variables, and whether a country had recorded at least on death or confirmed
case of Covid-19. Therefore, our sample for cross-country comparison covers those
countries subjected to Covid-19 relatively early on in the global pandemic.
        Data on mortality from Covid-19 are expressed as the number of total deaths per
100,000 population and are from CSSE Johns Hopkins University (2020). Data on mortality
in the 1918 influenza pandemic are also expressed in numbers per 100,000 population and
come from Barro, Ursùa and Weng (2020). 2 These latter figures refer to estimates of excess
mortality rates from influenza (or influenza and pneumonia as was common historically)
between 1918 and 1920. Excess mortality is defined either relative to normal seasonal
mortality from influenza or pneumonia or from all-causes. Barro et. al. (2020) argue that
these two types of measures “correspond closely”.
       We added several data points for the 1918 flu pandemic from secondary sources
including Singapore, Hong Kong, and Korea. These are the official deaths from influenza and
pneumonia without reference to a baseline level of mortality. Deaths and confirmed cases of
Covid-19 were last updated on May 13, 2020 for our sample of U.S. cities and updated on
May 21, 2020 for our sample of countries. Our data begin as early as January 21, 2020. For
the 33 sample countries, the inter-quartile range of mortality in the 1918 pandemic is 620-
1360 deaths per 100,000 population with a median of 780 and a mean value of 1120. This
compares to the interquartile range across countries (as of May 21, 2020) for reported
Covid-19 deaths of 0.52 to 16.75 per 100,000 and a median of 4.88.
        We supplement the country mortality data with population mortality rates from SARS
in 2002-03, GDP per capita in 2018, population density in 2019, some measures of cultural
differences such as an index of individualism in a country, and a dummy variable for a
tradition of Confucianism. Places coded as Confucianist include mainland China, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.
       We also explore a historical data base of 46 US cities (Collins et. al, 1930). The total
population in these cities is equal to 20.4 million or about 18% of the US population. Data
cover most of the largest cities in the US. We include deaths attributed to influenza and
pneumonia, as the rest of the literature has done in the face of historical problems in coding
precise causes of death. In these years, the two were often confounded, although they were
strongly related.
       The mortality from the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic in these cities is expressed as
monthly or weekly excess mortality per 100,000 population of 1920. We use weekly data for
the period 10 September 1918 to 13 November 1918, covering the first six weeks of the
1918-20 pandemic for US cities. The excess mortality rates were the differences between the

2
 Barro, Ursùa and Weng (2020) rely on an original database of excess mortality from influenza and pneumonia
and total excess mortality. The primary data sources they rely on include Johnson and Mueller (2002), Murray,
et al. (2006), Mitchell (2007), and the Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org).

                                                     4
actual mortality rates and the median monthly mortality rates from influenza and
pneumonia in previous non-epidemic years in those cities. To make data even more
comparable to our data from Covid-19, we convert the weekly excess deaths to daily
observations by linear interpolation within the week to calculate daily cumulative excess
deaths since the first week of September 1918.
       We match US cities with continuous historical data to modern city or county-level
data. One issue associated with the long-run city-level comparison is that Covid-19 data are
separately reported only for some cities in our sample (New York City, St. Louis, Richmond,
etc.) while most data is reported at the county level. For cities in the historical sample
without separately reported Covid-19 data at the city-level, we use data from the counties
where the cities are located in. For example, we pair the 1918 data for Detroit with Wayne
County today.
       To calculate event time, we set a threshold level of mortality at the city level of 0.5 per
100,000 for each pandemic. Event time and observations begin as per this threshold
mortality rate. This threshold was chosen since this is the lowest recorded threshold for
excess deaths from influenza and pneumonia we have available in the historical city-level
data in 1918-20.


2.2.1 Analysis: Countries
         Our first test finds significant persistence of public health performance across
countries. In Figure 3, we plot the average daily growth rate of the total reported deaths from
Covid-19 in the first six weeks after each country started reporting their first death from
Covid-19 against the excess mortality rates from the 1918 influenza pandemic. The scatter
plot is conditional on several country-level covariates, including population density, GDP per
capita, percentage of population aged 70 or over, an index of individualism and Confucianism
tradition, as well as the geographic regions. The conditional scatter plot suggests a positive
and statistically significant correlation between the two pandemics (robust t-statistic = 3.26,
adjusted R2 = 0.39)
       The positive correlation reveals that some countries performing poorly in terms of
mortality in the 1918 pandemic, such as Spain and Italy, also experienced fast mortality
growth in the recent Covid-19 pandemic. However, the persistence between 1918 influenza
and the current Covid-19 pandemic might not be a universal phenomenon for all countries.
We note that some places such as Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, fall below the regression
line, suggesting these countries are performing much better than what their 1918
performance predicted.
      Results from formal regression analysis are reported in table 2. Besides country-level
mortality in the 1918 pandemic, we also include these countries’ mortality rates from the
SARS in 2002-03. We run cross sectional regressions of the following form


                                                5
                         𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 𝛽𝛽1 ⋅ 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖1918 + 𝛽𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′ 𝛾𝛾 + 𝜌𝜌𝑟𝑟 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖

       where i indexes countries, 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 is the average daily growth rate of deaths from
Covid-19 in the first six weeks since the first reported death, 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖1918 is the total excess
mortality rate from the 1918 influenza pandemic, 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 is the total mortality from SARS in
2002-03, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 includes a set of control variables, 𝜌𝜌𝑟𝑟 is a set of regional fixed effects, r indexes
five regions (East Asia, South Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania), and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 is an error
term. We use heteroscedasticity robust standard errors in all specifications.
      Our baseline results are reported in column (3) of Table 2. We also explore the
dependent variable of the daily growth rate of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the first six
weeks after the 100th confirmed case. These results are reported in column (4)-(6).
        All these findings suggest that, even after conditioning on a set of observable
characteristics, countries performing poorly in the 1918 pandemic tended to fail to control
mortality growth of Covid-19 in the first month and a half of the outbreak. The point estimate
of the coefficient for 1918 mortality is 0.0373 (p-value: 0.037, 95% C.I.: 0.0025 to 0.0721) 3.
This implies that a one standard deviation rise in 1918 mortality is associated with a 0.52
standard deviation rise in the growth rate of deaths from Covid-19.
       On the other hand, there is some evidence of learning. The negative correlation
between mortality from SARS and Covid-19 mortality reveals that the countries hit harder
by the more recent epidemic have been more successful in slowing down the development
of Covid-19 in the first several weeks and months. The point estimate of the coefficient for
2002-2003 SARS mortality is -0.13 (p-value: 0.001, 95% C.I.: -0.30 to -0.06). This implies a
one standard deviation rise in SARS mortality is associated with a fall in the growth rate of
deaths from Covid-19 of 1.63 standard deviations. This is suggestive evidence that some
countries strongly learned from their more recent experience.


2.2.2 Analysis: US Cities
        Next, we examine the persistence of public health performance in a group of large U.S.
cities. We compare the early trajectories of population mortality rates in the 1918 influenza
and the contemporary Covid-19 pandemic. Data are for 46 cities for which high frequency
data in 1918 are available.
      In Figure 4, we plot the trajectory of the mortality rate (excess deaths per 100,000
population) from influenza and pneumonia and Covid-19 in the days after total deaths
crossed the 0.5 per 100,000 people in those cities. 4 The city-by-city comparison of historical

3The coefficients and 95% confidence intervals are multiplied by 1000 for better presentation.
4
 Excess deaths rates serve as good measurement of the severity of the 1918 pandemic across cities with
potentially different seasonal influenza patterns. The threshold of 0.5/100,000 is chosen to attain a
comparable starting mortality rates for two epidemics across cities. Most cities in our sample reached this
threshold early in both epidemics. Our results are robust to other alternative thresholds such as 1/100,000.

                                                              6
and contemporary mortality trajectories reveals high similarity of the two epidemics in most
cities.
       We conduct regression analysis with daily observations for the 46 large cities. We
start with regressions of the following form
                             𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶                1918 )
                       ln�𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐        � = 𝜋𝜋1 ⋅ ln(𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐   + 𝜏𝜏 + 𝜏𝜏 2 + 𝜅𝜅𝑐𝑐 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

        where c indexes cities, 𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
                                   𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
                                              is the number of cumulative deaths from Covid-19,
  1918
𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the number of cumulative deaths from influenza and pneumonia in 1918 in event
time, and 𝜏𝜏 indexes the event time, 𝜅𝜅𝑐𝑐 is a set of city fixed effects and 𝜖𝜖 is an error term. To
compare the mortality from Covid-19 and 1918 influenza at a similar stage, we line up the
event time for both epidemics by the number of days since the death rate reached the
threshold of 0.5 per 100,000 population. We try specifications with state fixed effects to
control somewhat for spatial correlation, and we also try including calendar day fixed effects
instead of event time trends. As for spatial correlation, correcting the standard errors with
arbitrary spatial weights makes little qualitative difference to the results. Calendar time fixed
effects are highly correlated with event time which makes it hard to control for both at the
same time.
        Regression results are reported in Table 3 and indicate that Covid-19 deaths are
positively correlated with total excess deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic conditional on
being at a similar stage in the epidemic (point estimate: 0.337, p-value: 0.000, 95% C.I.:
0.146-0.528). The results are robust to the alternative specifications and are not driven by
the city of New York (column 4).
       We also compare the growth rate of total deaths from the 1918 flu to the growth rate
of deaths from Covid-19 over the first 3, 4, or 5 weeks after total mortality reached 0.5 per
100,000 population in each pandemic. In figure 5, we plot the average daily growth rate of
total deaths during the two pandemics in the first 4 weeks after mortality reached 0.5 per
100,000 population. The positive correlation suggests that the cities experiencing faster
mortality growth in 1918 tend to experience the same fast growth in the initial phase of
Covid-19.
       Regressions relating the growth rate of deaths in Covid-19 to the growth rate of
deaths from the 1918 pandemic are reported in Table 4. Regressions take the form
                                   �𝑐𝑐𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 𝜃𝜃 ⋅ 𝐷𝐷
                                   𝐷𝐷                   �𝑐𝑐1918 + 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐′ 𝜙𝜙 + 𝜈𝜈𝑐𝑐

         where 𝐷𝐷�𝑐𝑐𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 denotes the average daily growth rate of deaths from Covid-19 for city
   �𝑐𝑐1918 is the average growth rate of deaths from influenza and pneumonia, 𝑋𝑋 is a set of
c, 𝐷𝐷
control variables, and 𝜈𝜈 is an error term. We condition on historical and contemporary
population density and age distribution.
        A positive and statistically significant correlation between the growth rates in the first
3, 4, and 5 weeks after mortality rates reached the given threshold is evident. For the first 4

                                                         7
weeks, the estimated coefficient of mortality growth in the 1918 pandemic is 0.40 (p-value:
0.000, 95% C.I.: 0.23 to 0.60). This implies a one standard deviation rise in mortality growth
of the 1918 influenza is associated with a 0.43 standard deviation rise in the mortality
growth from Covid-19 in the first 4 weeks.
       The strong persistence of public health performance in U.S. cities could be explained
by some unobservable but pre-existing or long-run persistent characteristics of the cities
driving growth in both pandemics. To understand whether the identified persistence might
be driven by such factors or whether historical mortality plays a more direct role in
influencing health outcomes today, we employ an instrumental variable strategy.
        Our excluded instrument for mortality in the 1918 flu during the early phase
leverages the distance between cities and U.S. Army training camps. Historical evidence
suggests that military personnel were among those who were affected early and contributed
significantly to disease spread in nearby cities (Crosby, 1989; Barry, 2004; Byerly, 2010).
Military camps were located across the US for training recruits for World War I in the early
years of World War I. Their precise location was likely determined by strategic concerns
rather than being associated drivers of public health in a pandemic. Clay et. al. (2018) use a
measure of distance to military training camps as a determinant of morality from in the 1918
pandemic. Hilt and Rahn (forthcoming) use distance to military camps as an excluded
instrumental variable to predict excess mortality in October 1918 while Correia, Luck, and
Verner (2020) use distance weighted by the number of personnel at the bases as an excluded
instrument to predict mortality from influenza in late 1918.
       We construct our own index of exposure to influenza in military camps. For each city
                                 ln(𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 )
𝑐𝑐, exposure is defined as ∑𝑗𝑗                               , where 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 is the number of (camp) hospital
                                 ln(𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 )
admissions due to influenza and pneumonia in military camp 𝑗𝑗 in the two months of August
and September 1918. The variable 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 is the geodesic distance between city 𝑐𝑐 and
camp 𝑗𝑗. For each city, we include the five closest camps in this calculation. The data on
location and flu-related admissions for the major army camps come from the 1919 Annual
Report of the War Department.
        Figure 6 shows a simple correlation between the mortality growth of 1918 flu and the
exposure to influenza in nearby military camps. The positive correlation is consistent with
our hypothesis that cities more exposed to the influenza outbreaks in nearby camps had
faster mortality growth in the early phase of the 1918 pandemic. This could be due to the
fact that the intensity tended to be higher in the South and East where the pandemic started
and where local public health systems and populations were caught off-guard. We re-
estimate the relationship between mortality growth of 1918 influenza and contemporary
Covid-19, with two-stage least squares (2SLS).
        The 2SLS estimates are reported in the Table 5. The first stage results show large F-
statistics. A weak instrumental variable is not a concern. The coefficients on mortality
growth in the 1918 flu remain statistically significant and positive. These findings suggest

                                                                   8
that the identified positive correlation between the early performance in these two
pandemics were not solely driven by potential unobservable pre-existing city
characteristics. These results are some evidence that there is a plausible link between
contemporary, albeit so far unidentified, drivers of modern mortality performance. We
discuss some possibilities below.


    3. Discussion
       What factors inhibit prompt response and success during a pandemic? Let us assume
that they include “distrust, isolationism and hubris” (Parmet and Rothstein, 2018). In our
discussion it will become clear that all these factors mattered for performance in both 1918
and in 2020. These factors seem to be correlated over time across countries. It is not clear
however whether these factors are recurrent features of societies which have been
unfortunately timed with the outbreak of a new infectious disease like Covid-19, whether
these factors indeed persist over time or whether they are exacerbated by historical
experience with pandemics.
         Ackerknecht (1947) suggests that public health responses in the 19th century may
have reflected dominant political philosophies and even competing interest groups
representing such dogmas and pardigms. 5 “Contagionism” and “quarantinism” were often
associated with a heavy handed approach to governance and seen as antithetical to
commercial/economic interests. The “sanitationists” who advocated behavioral approaches
and better public hygiene stemmed from a more liberal tradition. While most social
distancing policies, and other NPIs, like shelter-in-place today are a far cry from the
lazarettos of the past, they may in fact be the modern-day equivalents of quarantine and
lockdowns. These approaches would seemingly be more appealing or viable in nations with
interventionist traditions. Mainland China for instance indeed opted for intensive
quarantining during Covid-19 as has been well documented. On the other hand, the so-called
red states of the US, but the US more generally in a comparative context, have resisted the
call to implement long duration lockdowns. The US has historically been more apprehensive
of policies including lockdowns that interfere with the economy and individual liberty. In
sum, long-running political cleavages may be an integral part of the explanation for societal
responses to pandemics.
        Mistrust may be driven by experience with historical pandemics. Modern socio-
political pathologies may have historical roots. Aassve, Alfani and Le Moglie (2020) argue
greater mortality in the 1918-20 pandemic generated lower trust in the long run. 6 This may
help explain some of the persistence we see in the data both across countries and within the

 The measure of trust is based on the General Social Survey question: “Generally speaking, would you say that
most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?”

US. This may also be why our instrumental variables results show that mortality in 1918
may not merely be correlated with long-run demographic or geographic features of cities.
       At the country level, our regression analysis rules out individualist cultural
explanations and other geographic/regional unobservable factors. The issues of distrust,
hubris and isolationism return to the forefront and are evident in 1918 and now and may
have even been exacerbated over the long run by earlier pandemics. This makes it less likely
that simply unfortunate timing is the main explanation for the persistence of these enabling
factors. On the other hand, East Asia seems to have been hit harder by the flu in 1918 and
by SARS but has performed better in the early stages of Covid-19. Perhaps these nations have
greater trust for other reasons that has offset some of the potential losses from past
pandemics.
       Whatever the case may be, history is surely not destiny nor does history repeat itself.
We do not want to suggest either. The correlations we highlight in this paper emphasize that
if public health objectives are to be met, societies must substitute innovative efforts to
overcome adversity when other social and political forces such as “distrust, isolationism and
hubris” handicap public health responses.
        Still, historical experience has seemingly affected the path of mortality in the Covid-
19 pandemic. First, in a positive sense. Experience with SARS is likely to have promoted
societal learning and reaction. Meanwhile, where the mortality of the 1918 influenza was
high, mortality is likely to be high today. Why? As we discuss below, local public health
“traditions” may be historically persistent, but the timing of Covid-19 and the flu of 1918
have been somewhat unfortunate as well.
3.1 SARS and Recent History
       East Asian nations, the places most affected by SARS in 2002-03 have been more likely
to act quickly to mitigate spread and to have lower mortality from Covid-19 thus far. The
searing lessons of SARS, along with particular national characteristics, appear to have
positively influenced pandemic preparedness. The key national characteristics for success in
battling a pandemic -- trust, cooperation, and a lack of hubristic over-confidence --- are
present in these nations and they have provided a favorable environment for learning from
the past. Are there other explanations?
        It is plausible that experience with SARS obscures national characteristics since SARS
had a limited geographic reach, largely affecting selected places in East Asia. Indeed, places
in East Asia like Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and mainland China have
kept reported cumulative cases and deaths from Covid-19 at low levels especially when
scaled by population. The population mortality rate has averaged 0.34 per 100,000 in these
six places and if we exclude Japan and China it was 0.32. This is well below the average of
20.64 in other advanced economic nations in western Europe, the Americas and Australia as
of May 21,2020 (Table 1).


                                              10
        We control for regional fixed effects and some religio-philosohical and cultural
traditions including “Confucianism” and collectivism. None of these eliminate the statistically
significant association between past pandemics and Covid-19. Neither of these “deep”
cultural factors is statistically significant. Many of these places have been at the epicenter of
recent pandemics like SARS but also including MERS and the recent Covid-19 pandemic.
There is strong evidence that these places saw the threat of SARS due to recent experience.
Meanwhile the western nations less affected by these recent pandemics “saw the threat
through the lens of influenza” according to the editor of The Lancet Richard Horton. (Ahuja,
2020).
       East Asian nations appear to have used their trusted and competent technocratic civil
services to learn from recent experience and to develop a high level of preparedness for a
pandemic. The pandemic preparedness plans for the East Asian nations most affected by
SARS often mention recent local experience with SARS. Pandemic response to Covid-19 has
been swift and forceful. A host of specialized protocols have been followed including border
checks of travelers for illness, international travel bans from affected regions, high rates of
testing and contact tracing, social distancing, using masks and raising public awareness.
       Another plausible explanation for East Asian success in the recent period may be
competency and trust in the civil service. This may have allowed them to manage things
better in comparative terms in this sever pandemic. China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and
South Korea, the countries most affected by SARS, have an average percentage of people
having “a great deal of trust” or “quite a lot of trust” in civil service of 56.68 % (std. dev.
=13.96) according to the 2010-2014 World Values Survey. The average of western nations
available in the sample (Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden and the USA) was
45.9% (std. dev. = 5.06) and that for all other nations in the sample excluding these places
was 42.5% (std. dev. = 19.18).
        The salience of events in recent living memory combined with high trust and
competence in the civil service most likely helped these nations to learn from past
experience. East Asian success has been built upon the realization that a new pandemic was
likely given the recent experience. As one can see in Figure 1, many of these E. Asian nations
are below the regression line implying better than expected performance during the early
phases of Covid-19. In western nations pandemics had largely been relegated to history with
influenza being the most recurrent issue. Population mortality rates from influenza have
been significantly lower since 1918 and most influenza since then has had a CFR much lower
than that of Covid-19.


3.2 Influenza Mortality in 1918-20 and Covid-19 Mortality: Countries
        Today, many western nations have elected officials that have openly discussed
abandoning international agreements of the post-World War 2 era. The US is not alone in
this. So-called populist tendencies have emerged in many western democracies. Electoral

                                               11
success has risen, but many countries see this manifested in the strength of opposition
parties like the AFD in Germany, the FN in France, and UKIP in the UK. These political
movements also are amplifications of public mistrust of officials and experts. The
politicization of public health responses has been highlighted (Eichengreen, 2020).
        In 1918 many countries in the West were involved in all-out war. Reporting on the
influenza pandemic was minimized as most historians agree. The Italian interior minister
was not alone in denying the spread of the pandemic (Martini et. al, 2019). In the US,
politicians downplayed the menace of the flu. Similar responses have been heard today in
Italy. The mayor of Milan promoted “Milan doesn’t stop” on day 6 of the Covid-19 outbreak
leaving bars, restaurants, and cafes open (McCann et. al, 2020). In the United States, the
president declared Covid-19 to be a “hoax” in late February 2020.
       Another unfortunate similarity between today and in the past was the inadequate
preparation of many health care systems for surge demand. During World War I, the US
military had 300,000 physicians on duty which is over 1/5 of the total number of physicians
in the USA at the time. 7 Other nations fighting in the war also had skewed their health
infrastructure to war efforts. Today, a nearly constant discussion about equipment
shortages, lack of PPE and beds in ICUs has been a common theme. Access to health care in
the United States is problematic especially in places where poverty is high, inequality is high,
and the social safety net is over-stretched. This characterizes the health care system in New
York but in other localities in the US as well.
        Finally, politics was on a knife-edge and highly polarized in many western nations in
1918. Many countries were fighting in the war, facing imminent revolutions or momentous
political changes or both. Mussolini and fascists in Italy were rising to power, Spain was
unstable, Russia was recovering from recent revolution. Even in the US, Woodrow Wilson’s
political mandate was handicapped by the narrow Republican victory in a New Mexico
Senate race leading to Republican control of the Senate.


3.3 US Cities in 1918 versus Today
        Perhaps the most striking correlation that we have uncovered is the apparent long-
run correlation between mortality in 1918 and today in US cities. Again, the role of politics
is manifest. Historians have found evidence that that non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) mattered for peak mortality and cumulative death rates. Cities that adopted NPIs
earlier and/or maintained them longer had some success in keeping these variables lower,
especially peak mortality. Cities like Philadelphia which delayed and allowed a “Liberty
Bond” rally to go ahead have been compared unfavorably to St. Louis which limited public
gatherings and sustained school closures. St. Paul has been compared to Minneapolis and

 Number of medical personnel in the military as of November 1918 300,000 (Statistical Abstract of the United
States of America, 1919, p. 728). Number of physicians in the United states in 1920 1.542 million according to
Carter et. al. (2006).

                                                     12
San Francisco has been compared to New York. In the former pair St. Paul delayed longer in
implementing NPIs than Minneapolis suffering the consequences. San Francisco
implemented a mask ordinance in mid-October 1918 while New York implemented light
touch social distancing. At the time there was much debate about how far to go with these
measures and about their effectiveness. For instance, the Anti-Mask League of San Francisco
was a political force in late 1918. Opponents of William Hassler, the city Public Health Officer
who promoted mask-wearing, also attempted to murder him such was their mis-trust and
dislike of his public health policies. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Disease, and a key proponent of social distancing, was given a security
detail in late March against “un-specified threats” (Diamond, 2020).
        Across US cities there has been political debate on the effectiveness of social
distancing and NPIs. It is interesting that the mayors of San Francisco and New York had
opposing viewpoints in March on how to handle Covid-19. While mayor London Breed of San
Francisco emphasized pandemic preparedness for a major disruption on 2 March, Mayor Bill
de Blasio of New York was “encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives” on twitter
even making a recommendation for watching a movie in a cinema. Historian John M. Barry
has emphasized that Tammany (a corrupted political machine) was in control of New York
in 1918 and had appointed Royal Copeland, a homeopath, as president of the New York City
Board of Health. Copeland downplayed the epidemic at first and failed to close schools.
Copeland went on to become a US Senator. Hassler would eventually become the president
of the American Public Health Association. Perhaps the trust in local government that was
lost in 1918 never returned.
       None of this is to ascribe the correlations we have found to extreme persistence in
public health capabilities and the politics of public. However, the coincidence of divergent
opinions and political and social malaise in the West is notable. It is impossible to blame the
disease itself on these issues. It may however be possible to credit slow response times and
delayed action to these matters. In other words, while history has not repeated itself, certain
outcomes are remarkably similar.

Notes: Figure shows the population mortality rates of Covid-19 based on data from CSSE Johns Hopkins. We break the data for the US into three parts:
mortality for the entire US, mortality rates for the states of New York and New Jersey, the hardest hit states and for the US excluding these two states.
Data for the Influenza pandemic of 1918 are for total weekly deaths per 100k from influenza and pneumonia for data from 46 cities in the USA (Collins
et. al. 1930). Data are plotted for countries in 2020 that had reached a threshold of 1.34 deaths per 100,000. This is the first available level of the mortality
rate in the 1918 for the national level data for the USA. Data from 2020 are as of 27 April 2020.

Notes: This graph plots the average daily growth rate of total deaths from Covid-19 in the first 6 weeks since the first death in each country against the
estimated excess mortality rate from the 1918 Influenza pandemic, both conditional on a set of country-level covariates. Data are described in the data
                                                                                           41
appendix. The average growth rate of cumulative deaths for Covid-19 is calculated as �𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑖42 ⁄𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑖1 ) − 1. The robust t-statistic for the
coefficient on deaths from influenza in 1918 is =3.26, and the regression has an adjusted R2 = 0.69.

Notes: These charts provide city-by-city comparisons between the trajectories of population mortality rate from influenza and pneumonia in 1918
and Covid-19 in 2020. We plot the logarithm of total deaths per 100,000 (for Covid-19) or total excess deaths per 100,000 (for 1918 influenza and
pneumonia) on the y-axis versus the number of days since mortality rates reached 0.5/100,000 population. The 16 cities present here are those
with largest population in 2019. Trajectories for other cities are available upon request from authors.

Notes: Chart shows the unconditional relationship between the average daily growth rate of total deaths during Covid-19 in the first 21 days compared to the average
growth rate of excess deaths in the first 21 days of the 1918-20 pandemic. The coefficient of the regression (which includes a constant) is 0.355 with a robust t-statistic of
4.09 and a 95% C.I. of 0.179 to 0.531. The average daily growth rates of total deaths (or total excess deaths for 1918 influenza) in the first 21 days are calculated by
20
 �𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−20 ) − 1. The first 21 days refer to the 21 days since the total deaths (for Covid-19) or total excess deaths (for 1918 Influenza) reached 0.5 for
every 100,000 population.

Note: The data of influenza and pneumonia admissions by major military camps are from the Report of the Surgeon General, which is Volume 1 of the
War Department Annual Report of 1919. We have 39 major army camps and the distance between cities and camps are determined by the distance

Notes: Estimates of mortality rates of 1918 Influenza come from the recalculation and compilation by Johnson and
Mueller (2002) except for Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore. For the latter three see the data appendix for sources.
Mortality rates for 2002-2003 SARS come from WHO and include the deaths from cases from November 1, 2002 to July
31, 2003. Mortality rates for Covid-19 come from the CSSE of Johns Hopkins University. Population-weighted averages
are presented for each region.

Notes: Dependent variables in columns (1)-(3) is the average daily growth rate of total deaths of Covid-19 in the first 42 days since first death case. Dependent
variable in columns (4)-(6) is the average daily growth rate of total confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the first 42 days since the 100th confirmed cases. Estimation is
by OLS. The estimated coefficients and standard errors on the total mortality rate of 1918-20 influenza were multiplied by 1000 for presentational purposes. All
regressions control for region fixed effects (the sample covers 5 regions: East Asia, South Asia, Europe, Americas, and Oceania). Robust standard errors are reported
in parentheses. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Notes: Dependent variables are the logarithm of total deaths of Covid-19 per 100,000 population. These and total excess death rates from the 1918-20
influenza are at the daily level. All specifications control for state or city fixed effects. Event days are defined as the days since total deaths (for Covid-19)
or total excess deaths (for 1918 Influenza) reached 0.5/100,000 population. The data on Covid-19 were last updated on 21May, 2020. The full list of cities
can be found in data appendix and are the same as those from Collins et. al (1930). All regressions are weighted by population in 2019, except for the
column (3). Standard errors are clustered at the state level and reported in the parentheses. * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic in U.S. Cities
The mortality data in 46 major U.S. cities come from the public health reports (Collins, 1930).8 We interpolate
the weekly excess deaths to daily basis by linear interpolation. Then, we calculate the cumulative excess deaths
from the week of September 14, 1918, when continuous weekly deaths became available in Collins (1930). For
cities with negative excess deaths in the mid-September, we start counting total deaths when excess deaths
became continuously positive.




8The original reports by Collins (1930) includes 47 cities. We exclude the city of Memphis from our analysis as its
weekly mortality data are not available until the week of October 12, 1918.
