1. Introduction

         Because we tend generally to focus our efforts on applications of modern

quantitative methods, practitioners of empirical health economics might be forgiven for

paying little heed to the recent 50th anniversary of the publication of one of the most

important papers in its methodological heritage: James Tobin's widely-cited Econometrica

paper (Tobin, 1958) that developed what later became known as the Tobit estimator. This

golden anniversary milestone provides a fitting opportunity to reflect on Tobin's contribution

and to assess the role that econometric limited dependent variable modeling has played in

empirical health economics.

         Roughly contemporaneous with the publication of Tobin's paper in January 1958,

other developments in econometric methodology and inquiry were from today's perspective

-- in particular, the perspective of applied health economics -- quite noteworthy.     In the

October 1957 issue of Econometrica1 appeared the classic "Hybrid Corn" paper on

technological change by Zvi Griliches (Griliches, 1957).2      Later in 1958 Econometrica

published John Denis Sargan's seminal paper on instrumental variables estimation that

derived the asymptotic properties of IV estimators in a modern, moment-based context

(Sargan, 1958), and another paper by Irving Hoch that -- while less well-known among

today's applied economists -- instructed importantly about biases that are likely to arise

when production functions are estimated econometrically in contexts where input choices

may depend on unobservable determinants of outputs (Hoch, 1958).3           Also at this time


1
 In 1958, Econometrica was published in four issues or numbers compared with today's six,
and French-language articles were still relatively common. In January 1958, the journal
was edited by managing editor Robert Strotz and co-edited by Edmond Malinvaud. All six
members of the January 1958 Editorial Board ultimately became Nobel Laureats (Ragnar
Frisch, Milton Friedman, J.R. Hicks, Tjalling Koopmans, Paul Samuelson, and J.R.N. Stone),
as did six of the fourteen associate editors (Lawrence Klein, Tjalling Koopmans, Herbert
Simon, Robert Solow, J.R.N. Stone, and J. Tinbergen).
2
  See Jonathan Skinner and Douglas Staiger, 2005, for an application of Griliches's idea to
technology adoption in a health care setting.
3
    On the silver anniversary of the publication of their own seminal work, it might be noted
                                           (continued)
appeared in JASA Joseph Berkson's classic discussion of smoking and lung cancer (Berkson,

1958), as well as Daniel Suits's seminal paper on the coding and interpretation of

categorical dummy variables in regression models (Suits, 1957).

       In 1958 the impact that Tobin's contribution would ultimately have on applied

microeconometric work could hardly have been anticipated. And while the applications of

the specific censored-normal regression estimator Tobin devised are many,4 the ultimate

impact of Tobin's paper has been far greater: Tobin's contribution raised awareness of the

implications of analyzing any economic outcome having limited range, and spawned an

enormous body of methodological research on limited dependent variable estimation

strategies.

       Of primary focus here is how Tobin's estimator came to be, came to take root in

empirical health economics, and came to influence subsequent analytical developments.

This paper provides a brief history of Tobin's estimator and related methods up through

about 1971 (section 2); discusses the early applications of Tobit and related estimators in

health economics, i.e. the "technology diffusion" of Tobit in health economics (section 3);

and offers some concluding remarks (section 4). The scope is intentionally modest; readers

interested in other perspectives on the history and applications of econometric methods in

health economics are referred to Martin Feldstein, 1974, Joseph Newhouse, 1987, and

Andrew Jones, 2000.

that Hoch's paper was not cited by Mark Rosenzweig and Paul Schultz, 1983, in their
treatment of the estimation of health production functions in settings where input choices
may be influenced by factors unobserved by econometricians but possibly known by health
producers. Rosenzweig and Schultz do, however, cite the better-known paper by Yair
Mundlak and Hoch, 1965, that is an extension of Hoch's 1958 paper.

 Tobin's estimation strategy has been influential not only within economics but also beyond.
A JSTOR full-text search on "tobit" conducted on Oct. 9, 2008, had 2,074 hits in economics,
but also 149 in statistics, 193 in political science, and 402 in sociology. There were also 735
hits in religion, but most of these relate to the Book of Tobit in the Old Testament.

2. Tobin and Tobit

Probit and Beyond

        Tobin's censored-regression estimator grew out of earlier unpublished work he did on

what would now be considered standard binary probit analysis, i.e.




         Pr ( y = 1 X1 ,..., Xk ) = Φ ( X1β1 + ... + Xk βk ) ,

with

               (        )
         y = 1 y* > 0 and y* ∼ N ( X1β1 + ... + Xk βk ,1) .




Binary probit analysis had just come to be recognized in the 1940s in biometric, typically

dose-response, contexts.5 Tobin's extension and application (Tobin, 1955) of binary probit

analysis to the multivariate regression context in a model of determinants of households'

decisions to engage in any spending on consumer durables was itself a remarkable

contribution.6 Notably, this paper appeared as No. 1 in the Cowles Foundation Discussion


5
    See the citations in Tobin, 1955.
6
   The application of binary probit analysis to microdata was itself novel in economics,
although the methodology had been exposited much earlier in biometrics by Frank
Garwood, 1941. Garwood's paper derives the probit MLE for grouped data, but his
likelihood function is also suitable for individual data (zero or n successes in groups of size
n, where n could be 1). Garwood's likelihood function was written in the original paper as
                   n!
         ∏ s! (n − s) ! P   n− s
                                   Qs

with corresponding log-likelihood function, which was written as

        ln L = const. + S ⎡⎣(n − s ) logP + s log Q ⎤⎦ .

(In modern practice this would typically be written as

        lnL = const. +        ∑ (n − y ) ln (1 − p) + y lnp ,
where p would be p ( x; β ) in a regression setting, typically Φ ( xβ ) for probit. "S" was the
common summation operator in earlier days). With binary microdata, const.=ln(1)=0, n=1
and y ∈ {0,1} .




                                                           2
Paper Series (henceforth CFDP-1); the original draft was dated July 14, 1955, with a

revision dated December 1, 1955.7

       The sample Tobin used for his probit estimation comprised 1,036 observations drawn

from the 1952 and 1953 Surveys of Consumer Finances; the model included two

explanatory variables (X1=disposable income, X2=liquid asset holdings) plus a constant

term. Not least remarkable in this research was its computation of the maximum likelihood

estimates of his probit model by brute-force calculation and table lookup.

       Of ultimately greater interest for purposes at hand were the concluding sentences of

CFDP-1, which provide some suggestion that Tobin was already imagining the development

of "Tobin's probit":

       The example has been presented for illustration of a method rather than for
       substantive results. Still more variables would be needed for a better
       explanation of durable goods purchasing behavior. Moreover, it is wasteful of
       information to disregard amounts spent by those who purchased. Some
       combination of probit analysis and regression is indicated, to handle a
       variable with a large probability of having zero value and the remaining
       probability spread over a positive interval. [Italics added]


Tobin's Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Censored Dependent Variables

       Tobin wasted little time. Dated September 15, 1955, "Estimation of Relationships for

Limited Dependent Variables" was issued as Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper No. 3, with

a revision dated July 25, 1956 issued as CFDP No. 3R. A year and a half later a revised

version of CFDP-3R was published in the January, 1958 issue of Econometrica.8

       Tobin began his discussion with the following:



7
 Tobin became Director of the Cowles Foundation in 1955 at the time the Foundation
moved from Chicago to Yale (Robert Shiller and Tobin, 1999).
8
  The published version was nearly identical to CFDP-3R. In the published paper: the
reference to CFDP-1 that appeared in CDFP-3R was deleted; a reference to the "method of
scoring" with a corresponding citation to C.R. Rao's Advanced Statistical Methods in
Biometric Research was added; several sentences on the estimation algorithm were added
on p. 30; figure 2 and table VI were added; and a variety of minor grammatical and
typographical modifications were made.




                                              3
       In economic surveys of households, many variables have the following
       characteristics: The variable has a lower, or upper, limit and takes on the
       limiting value for a substantial number of respondents. For the remaining
       respondents, the variable takes on a wide range of values above, or below,
       the limit.
                                                 Tobin, 1958, p. 24


Picking up on the theme with which he concluded CFDP-1, Tobin then went on to write:


       If only the probability of limit and non-limit responses, without regard for the
       value of non-limit responses were to be explained, probit analysis provides a
       suitable statistical model.... But it is inefficient to throw away information on
       the value of the dependent variable when it is available. If only the value of
       the variable were to be explained, if there were no concentration of
       observations at a limit, multiple regression would be an appropriate statistical
       technique. But when there is such concentration, the assumptions of the
       multiple regression model are not realized....

       A hybrid of probit analysis and multiple regression seems to be called for, and
       it is the purpose of this paper to present such a model.

                                                   Tobin, 1958, p. 25


One standard modern description of the limited dependent variable structure thus described

would be:




       y* = xβ + u ,             (
                            u ~ N 0, σ2   )
       E ⎣⎡y* | x ⎦⎤ = xβ

         ⎧L,  y*<L
       y=⎨           .
         ⎩y*, y* ≥ L



In Tobin's notation, the role of y was played by "W" and the role of E[y*|x] was played by

"Y"; there was no specific symbol used to describe the latent random variable y*.

Specifically, Tobin uses



       Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2 X2 + ...βmXm




                                              4
and then bases estimation on the normalized coefficients




          ( a0 , a1, a2 ,..., am , a) = (β0 / σ, β1 / σ, β2 / σ,..., βm / σ,1 / σ ) .


Figure 1 reproduces figure 1 from Tobin's paper and exhibits one of the main foci of Tobin's

paper, i.e. the discrepancy between E[W] and Y (using his notation).

         Tobin's empirical analysis again drew on the 1952 and 1953 Surveys of Consumer

Finances, now using a sample of 735 primary nonfarm spending units.                              The observed

censored dependent variable, W, is defined as "the ratio of 1951-52 total durable goods

expenditure to 1951-52 total disposable income."                                 The explanatory variables are

x=[1,X1,X2], with X1 defined as "the age of the head of the spending unit, as reported in

1953,"9 and X2 defined as "the ratio of liquid asset holdings at the beginning of 1951 to

1951-52 total disposable income."10 W is defined as a ratio of expenditure to income, but a

ratio that can presumably exceed one in situations where spenders are dissavers.11                        The

maximum likelihood estimates of the normalized parameters aj are presented in Table II in

Tobin's paper and reproduced here in table 2. Age and liquid assets contribute negatively

and positively, respectively, to the latent spending index.

         Many aspects of the paper are noteworthy. Tobit's derivation allowed the lower limit

of observations to be an arbitrary real value L -- thus enhancing the applicability of the

estimator -- instead of zero, which would have been a natural threshold given the


9
  This variable was coded as "1" for ages 18-24, "2" for ages 25-34, "3" for ages 35-44, "4"
for ages 45-54, "5" for ages 55-64, and "6" for ages 65 or more. Tobin makes no mention
of why this coding strategy was used instead of, e.g., simply including age recorded in
natural units.
10
     Note that this is not the same x-vector as used in CFDP-1.
11
  Given the data as reproduced here in Table 1, the unconditional mean and variance of W
can be computed as .083 and .011, respectively.




                                                              5
expenditure data he was analyzing.                 Moreover, while much subsequent discussion in the

literature of Tobin's estimator focused on estimation of the parameters of the latent index

E ⎡⎣y* | x ⎤⎦ = xβ ,12 Tobin derived the explicit formula for the conditional mean of W -- which

he termed "the expected value of W for given values of Y and L" -- and devoted

considerable attention to the properties of this parameter (see esp. pp. 35-36 in Tobin,

1958).

         In addition, one and a half printed pages were dedicated to the derivation of the

likelihood function and the first and second derivatives of its log, with another one and a

half pages used to describe the Newton solution algorithm.                  The empirical parameter

estimate iterative solution sequence, a detail that would surely never appear in a modern

publication, was presented in two full tables. Given the significant effort involved in 1955 in

undertaking what would by today's standards be considered a routine nonlinear regression

estimation exercise, it is hardly surprising that the mechanics of the computations were

noteworthy and publishable.               Regarding computation, Donald Hester recalled (personal

communication, Nov. 17, 2008):



         I was an undergraduate research assistant...for Tobin at Yale in 1954-55 and
         did the calculations on a Monroe desk calculator. It was a bit of a challenge,
         because one of the papers Tobin was drawing on (by Cornfield and Mantel if I
         recall correctly) had a missing negative sign and for about six weeks I was
         minimizing rather than maximizing a likelihood function. After Tobin derived
         the function himself, the iterations converged rather nicely.13




12
     Postulating Tobin's conditional mean structure

         E ⎡⎣ y x ⎤⎦ = Φ ( xβ / σ ) xβ + σφ ( xβ / σ )

as a prior conditional mean model for a nonnegative dependent variable seems far-fetched.
For instance, juxtapose this with streamlined current-day specifications like an exponential
conditional mean E ⎡⎣ y x ⎤⎦ = exp ( xβ ) .
13
   See Ray Fair, 1977, and Randall Olsen, 1978, on further aspects of Tobit model
estimation.




                                                         6
Early Related Approaches

       Randall Olsen, 1978, credits Anders Hald, 1949, with the development of the

maximum likelihood estimator for outcomes of what Hald termed "censored" distributions.

Olsen wrote: "The basic form of the model was suggested by Hald [5] with a later

independent paper by Tobin [7] developing the model in a regression setting." Hald

carefully distinguished the "censored-" and the "truncated-" distribution cases, and provided

a unified estimation framework in a non-regression framework to accommodate both

situations. Yet Hald, in turn, credits W.L. Stevens (see Bliss, 1937) with the development of

the "censored" normal model and its estimation.

       Pre-dating the publication of Tobin's paper by three years, John Aitchison, 1955,

exposited a precursor of what has subsequently come to be known as the two-part model in

econometrics.14   While Aitchison's exposition was not in a regression setting, it provides

nonetheless an analytical foundation to limited dependent variable estimation that clearly

complements Tobin's:


       In a study of household expenditures it is often of interest to estimate, from a
       sample of household budgets, the mean expenditure per household on a
       certain commodity, say children's clothing. Over the period of investigation it
       may well happen that a number of households in the sample spend nothing
       on children's clothing whereas the expenditures by the remainder of the
       households necessarily arise from the distribution of a positive variable,
       probably skew and possibly approximated by a lognormal curve. If such is
       the case, then clearly the correct procedure in any analysis is to recognize
       explicitly this dichotomy of the population into the categories, spender and
       non-spender. (Aitchison, 1955)


Aitchison's model for outcome variable X (using his notation) is:




14
  Neither Aitchison's nor Hald's paper was cited by Tobin in his 1958 Econometrica paper.
Younger readers may be interested to learn, however, that Tobin did not have access to
Google searching in the late 1950s.




                                              7
          P {X = 0} = θ ,   P {X > 0} = 1 − θ


          P {X ⊂ ( x, x + dx ) x > 0} = g(x)dx


          P {X ⊂ ( x, x + dx )} = (1 − θ ) g(x)dx,   x>0




Aitchison defined further α and β as the mean and variance of g(x) and γ and δ as the

mean and variance of the distribution of X.                The emphasis in his paper was primarily on

efficient estimation of γ and δ .

         In a remarkable one-two punch in his classic textbook Econometric Theory, Arthur

Goldberger, 1964, not only coined the term "Tobit model" in expositing Tobin's 1958

estimator,15 but in the preceding page provided probably the first systematic exposition of

an econometric two-part regression model (2PM) as an estimator of E[y|x] (where "y" is the

observed nonnegative outcome), which he terms the "twin linear probability function"

(Goldberger, 1964, pp. 252-253). Goldberger credits16 Guy Orcutt with the development of

the twin linear probability model, noting further that it was "known locally as the Orbit

model."      In the Orbit model, linear regressions are specified for both the binary {0,1}

outcome as well as for the magnitude of the positive outcome with a restriction to the

sample of positives, and E[y|x] is estimated as the product over the entire sample of the



15
     Tobin's response to Shiller's (1999) interview inquiry about "Tobit":
         Tobit -- well that's related to "probit," so that's understandable. But it was
         also related to a reference to me in a novel by Herman Wouk, a friend of mine
         in the officers' training school in 1942, called The Caine Mutiny, where I
         appear for one or two sentences in the first chapter, and I'm named in a
         thinly disguised way as Tobit. I asked Arthur Goldberger why he used this
         label in his statistics text, whether it was The Caine Mutiny or just the elision
         of Tobin and "probit." He wouldn't say. So I don't know.
Yet in a personal communication (Nov. 6, 2008) Art Goldberger noted that he didn't know of
The Caine Mutiny reference at the time, and that his "...coinage of Tobit was simply a
slurring of Tobin & Probit..."
16
     Personal communication, Nov. 6, 2008.




                                                       8
two component estimates.17           Goldberger's 1964 exposition of the twin linear probability

function was:




       Ey =   ∑ yif(y) = ∑ 0if(0) + ∑ yif(y)
                              y =0      y >0



         =0+    ∑ {yi⎡⎣f(y | y > 0)⎤⎦if(y > 0)}
                y >0



         = f(y > 0)i   ∑ {yi⎡⎣f(y | y > 0)⎤⎦}
                       y >0


         = Prob {y > 0}iE(y | y > 0)




       Indeed, in the early 1960s a research program focusing on durable goods and other

consumer expenditure patterns at the Social Sciences Research Institute at the University of

Wisconsin-Madison18 deployed regression variants of such two-part models (e.g. Goldberger

and Maw Lin Lee, 1962; Janet Fisher, 1962; De-Min Wu, 1965).              In this research, two

regression equations were estimated for each expenditure category: a linear probability

model for the {0,1} indicator of any spending; and a linear regression model for the

magnitude of spending estimated only on the observations for which positive expenditure

was recorded.     Arnold Zellner, 1990, offered the following assessment that, among other

things, links this research program to the two-part modeling strategy in health

econometrics:




17
   Goldberger (perhaps) anticipates some recent one-part modeling strategies (e.g. John
Mullahy, 1998, and Joshua Angrist, 2001) with "...the procedure does not directly attempt
to fit Ey to y...."

         The two-equation model used by Chau, Goldberger, Orcutt, and others at
         Wisconsin in the 1960s is still central in analyses of micro-data in many areas
         and has resulted in reinterpretations of firms' investment and divided [sic]
         behavior -- see Laub (1972) and Peck (1974) and consumers' behavior with
         respect to medical expenditures. Indeed, it has been the subject of a lively,
         recent exchange, Duan et al. (1983) on the relative merits of the "sample
         selection bias" model and the "two-part" and "four-part" models (new names
         for old Wisconsin models) in Duan et al. (1984).


         Several years later, John Cragg, 1971, provided a comprehensive treatment of such

2PM or Orbit models. He offered this rationale for why such structures might describe well

certain outcomes19:


         In some situations the decision to acquire and the amount of the acquisition
         may not be so intimately related. In particular, even when the probability of
         a non-zero value is less than one half, one might not feel that the values
         close to zero are more probable than the ones near some larger value, given
         that a positive value will occur.


In Cragg's framework, the second part of the model (for y>0) could be treated in a linear

regression framework use a log-transformation of the positive y values (which works

whether or not these positive y values are lognormally distributed) or could be treated in a

maximum likelihood context by assuming the positive y values followed a truncated normal

distribution.    Cragg's probit/truncated-normal model was exposited (using now-standard

notation) as:



         Prob(yt = 0 | x1t , x2t ) = Φ(− x1tβ)

and

                                             {                   }
         f(yt | x1t , x2t ) = (2π)−1/2 σ−1 exp −(yt − x2t γ)2 / 2σ2 Φ(x1t β) / Φ(x2t γ / σ), for yt > 0




Cragg noted that the Tobit model arose as a restricted version of his probit/truncated-



19
     Cragg's paper appears to have coined the now-familiar term "hurdle" model.

3. Early Limited Dependent Variable Modeling in Health Economics

        Given its computational complexity and the relative paucity of microdata at the time,

it is not surprising that the Tobit estimation technology had initially a slow diffusion rate.

Yet given the LDV measures that described interesting outcomes in health individual- or

firm-level data available even then, it is also not surprising that Tobin's estimator and

related approaches attracted the attention of empirical economists working in health as

early as the mid-1960s.

        Among the earliest recognitions of the LDV phenomenon in health economics was

that by William Comanor, 1965. In his study of technological change in the pharmaceutical

industry, one of the main dependent variables is a firm's total sales over two years of all

new chemical entities introduced by the firm of the period 1955-1960.       For 17 of the 57

firms in Comanor's sample, this measure was zero.           Using least squares regression,

Comanor estimated his model of sales determinants both with and without the inclusion of

these seventeen observations (in modern terminology, a "one-part model" and "part two of

a two-part model," respectively), finding sizable (threefold) differences in the point

estimates of the key R&D parameter between the two. Comanor commented in a footnote:



        While a more sophisticated technique exists for dealing with this matter, the
        computational problems involved were too great to warrant its use. See
        James Tobin, 'Estimation of....'


        As software capable of tackling nonlinear estimation with microdata samples became

more widely available in the mid-1970s,21 the nascent health economics literature witnessed


20
   Tsai-Fen Lin and Peter Schmidt, 1984, devised a Lagrange multiplier strategy for testing
this parameter restriction.
21
     For an informative overview of the econometric software evolution, see Charles Renfro,
                                         (continued)


                                             11
a surge of scholarly empirical work in which limited dependent variable model estimators

were deployed in applied work.

       Richard Rosett and Lien-fu Huang's, 1973, study of health insurance effects on

medical care use and spending appears to be the first published application of Tobit analysis

of a topic in health economics.    Rosett and Huang used data from the 1960 Survey of

Consumer Expenditures to estimate price and income demand elasticities. The dependent

variable was actual or imputed spending on health services, specifically hospitalization plus

physican services. Rosett and Huang used what they called "the probit-regression model of

Tobin" to model this censored-at-zero outcome as a function of covariates.      In the same

year, Charles Phelps, 1973 (his dissertation), analyzed using Tobit and other methods data

from a national survey undertaken by the Center for Health Administration Studies at the

University of Chicago to study determinants of spending on health services and health

insurance premiums.

       The LDV-based health economics literature began to expand rapidly soon thereafter.

In 1975, three important papers were, at least in part, Tobit-based.       Frank Sloan and

Somchai Richupan, 1975, soon followed with an analysis of nurse labor supply based on

data from the 1960 U.S. Census. They used both Tobit analysis as well as the twin linear

probability model (or linear-linear 2PM) sketched by Goldberger.22       In fact, Sloan and

Richupan used an instrumental variable version of the Tobit estimator in which predicted

wage rates were used as a RHS covariate.

       Jan Acton's classic study (Acton, 1975) of nonmonetary cost impacts on several

forms of health care utilization in New York City uses linear simultaneous equations methods

to control for endogeneity of price (distance) and utilization measures.      Anticipating a



(cont.)
2004, esp. pp. 22-33.
22
    It is noteworthy that Sloan and Richupan anticipated some of the later debates about
the properties of the 2PM.




                                             12
literature to emerge years later, Acton explicitly eschews using Tobit methods in his

analysis: "Estimating a simultaneous Tobit system with 12 or so endogenous variables is

probably unwarranted with this data base." Finally, Karen Davis and Roger Reynolds, 1975,

use data from the 1969 National Health Interview Survey to examine determinants of health

care utilization for Medicare beneficiaries. Since their outcomes are counts of various forms

of healthcare utilization with nontrivial zero frequencies, they utilize Tobit methods to

estimate their utilization models.23

         Soon to follow this pivotal mid-1970s literature were the aforementioned innovations

in24 and controversies surrounding25 estimation methodologies that arose from the RAND

HIE, a surge of development of generally likelihood-based estimation methodologies for LDV

models26, and the literature on selection bias correction stimulated by James Heckman's

work27. A comprehensive assessment of this subsequent literature is beyond the scope of

the present paper.



4. Conclusions

         While some limitations of Tobin's original estimator have come to light since 1958,28

from the perspective of the mid-1950s when Tobin wrote, the development of the Tobit

estimator was nothing short of an econometric tour de force.                The advances in

23
   The application of Poisson-type count data estimators in health economics was still
several years in the future. See Jerry Hausman et al., 1984, for one of the earliest
examples.
24
   See, e.g., Naihua Duan, et al., 1983, 1984, Newhouse, et al., 1980, and Willard Manning,
et al., 1987.

     See, e.g., Joel Hay and Olsen, 1984.

     See G.S. Maddala, 1983.
27
   See Heckman, 1976, 1979, and Robert Haveman, 1997, for an overview of the use of
selection models in policy contexts.
28
     For instance, several studies have identified the lack of robustness of the Tobit MLE when
                        (
the baseline latent N xβ, σ2   )   assumptions fail to hold.   See, e.g., Abbas Arabmazar and
Schmidt, 1981, 1982, and James Powell, 1984, 1986.




                                                13
microeconometric estimation it stimulated have had extraordinary influence on the practice

of applied microeconomics in general, and -- given the vast array of LDV structures in

health data -- on the evolution of scholarly empirical work in health economics in particular.
