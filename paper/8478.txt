       Political instability is believed to have strong adverse effects on economic prosperity.
However, to date, the evidence on this matter is scarce; probably because it is difficult to
know how economies would had evolved in absence of political conflicts.
       This article investigates the economic impact of conflict, using the terrorist conflict in
the Basque Country as a case study. The Basque conflict is especially interesting from an
economic perspective. At the outset of terrorist activity in the early 1970’s, the Basque
Country was one of the richest regions in Spain, occupying the third position in per capita
GDP (out of 17 regions). In the late 1990’s, after 30 years of terrorist and political con-
flict, the Basque Country had dropped to the sixth position in per capita GDP.1 During
that period, terrorist activity by the Basque terrorist organization ETA resulted in almost
800 deaths. Basque entrepreneurs and corporations had been specific targets of violence
and extortion (including assassinations, robberies and kidnappings-for-ransom). Not sur-
prisingly, the economic downturn suffered by the Basque economy during these years has
been attributed, at least partially, to the effect of terrorism. However, to the best of our
knowledge, almost no research has been carried out to assess the economic effects of the
conflict.2
       This type of study is difficult. On the one hand, a pure time series analysis of the
severity of terrorism and the evolution of the Basque economy will be contaminated by the
economic downturn which Spain suffered during the second half of the 1970’s and the first
half of the 1980’s, at the peak of terrorist activity. On the other hand, at the outset of
terrorism, the Basque Country differed from other Spanish regions in characteristics that
are thought to be related to potential for economic growth. Therefore, a simple comparison
of the evolution of the Basque economy and the economy of the rest of Spain would not
only reflect the effect of terrorism but also the effect of pre-terrorism differences in economic
growth determinants.
       Our analysis rests on two different strategies. First, we use a combination of other Span-

   2
     The only exceptions that we are aware of are Enders and Sandler (1991, 1996) who study the effects
of terrorism on tourism and foreign direct investment in Spain.

ish regions to construct a “synthetic” control region which resembles most of the relevant
economic characteristics of the Basque Country before the outset of Basque political ter-
rorism in the 1970’s. The subsequent economic evolution of this “counterfactual” Basque
Country without terrorism is compared to the actual experience of the Basque Country.
We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism, per capita GDP in the Basque Country de-
clined about 10 percent points relative to the synthetic control region. Moreover, this gap
seemed to widen in response to spikes in terrorist activity. The second part of this study
uses the unilateral truce declared by ETA in September 1998 as a natural experiment to
estimate the effects of the conflict. If the terrorist conflict was perceived to have a negative
impact on the Basque economy, stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in
the Basque Country should have shown a positive relative performance as the truce became
credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire. We find evidence
that is consistent with this conjecture using event study methods.
       Most of the empirical literature on the effects of political conflict on economic variables
have used cross-sections of country-level data. Using a cross-section of countries, Alesina
and Perotti (1996) and Venieris and Gupta (1986) concluded that political instability has a
negative effect on investment and savings. Also using a cross-section of countries, Alesina
et al. (1996), Barro (1991), and Mauro (1995) have argued that political instability has a
negative effect on economic growth.3 A potential caveat of this literature is that part of
the observed association between political conflict and economic variables across countries
is thought to be created by reverse causation, since political instability is not only a cause
but also an effect of fluctuations in economic variables.4 Instrumental variables techniques
can be used to correct for reverse causation. However, the validity of instruments in
cross-country regressions has often been questioned.5 Another potential shortcoming of
studies based on country-level data is that political conflicts in different countries may be

on the relationship between political instability and economic variables.
   4
     Conventionally, it has been argued that economic growth promotes political stability. Olson (1963)
has argued, however, that rapid economic growth produces social dislocation and it may cause political
unrest.

radically different in nature. Such heterogeneity may create problems when comparing the
experiences of different countries and interpreting the results.
       Case studies, like the one presented in this paper, look like the natural avenue to validate
or refute the results given by cross-country studies.


                    i. A Brief History of ETA’s Terrorist Activity

ETA was founded in 1959 to promote the establishment of an independent Basque state.6
However, it was not until 1968 when ETA produced its first victim. In fact, ETA did not
implement a large scale terrorist activity until the mid 1970’s. Table 1 shows the number
of killings and kidnappings from 1968 to 2000. ETA’s terrorist activity was low before
1973 with no more than 2 victims in any given year. The death toll increased sharply
during the mid 1970’s, with an average of almost 16 victims per year in the period of
1974-1977. The bloodiest three years of ETA, 1978-1980, witnessed a total of 235 victims.
In subsequent years, the number of killings decreased gradually. On average, during the
1980’s, ETA’s activity resulted in 39 deaths per year; this figure was reduced to 16 per year
during the 1990’s. The number of kidnappings during the sample period was smaller than
the number of killings but evolved similarly. In September 1998, ETA declared a total and
indefinite cease-fire. The cease-fire lasted approximately 14 months; in November 1999,
ETA announced the end of cease-fire. In the year 2000, ETA killed 23 persons.
       In order to finance its operations, ETA has used kidnappings-for-ransom, extortion,
and (less frequently) robberies. The main targets of such money-rising activities have
been Basque entrepreneurs, who have since begun to abandon the Basque Country in large
numbers in order to escape extortion or abduction by the terrorist group. In addition, the
terrorist conflict has been frequently cited as a deterrence for domestic and foreign direct
investment in the Basque Country (see, e.g., The Economist, Nov. 25, 2000).
       Finally, although terrorist attacks have occurred in almost all Spanish regions, most of
   6
     Basques are spreaded over the Basque Autonomous Region and Navarra in Spain, and part of the
French Atlantic Pyrenees Department. The Basque Autonomous Region in Spain has been, however, the
main scenario of the conflict; for the rest of the paper, we use the term “the Basque Country” to refer to
this region.

Interior (2000)).7


   ii. Using Other Spanish Regions to Construct a “Synthetic” Basque
                        Country without Terrorism

The goal of this section is to assess the impact that terrorism has had on economic growth
for the Basque Country. Table 2, in columns (1) and (2), reports values of some variables
typically associated with growth potential,8 for the Basque Country and Spain for the
immediate pre-terrorism years. During the 1960’s, relative to the whole country, the Basque
Country had higher per capita income, higher investment ratio (investment/production),
was more densely populated, had a higher percentage of industrial production, and a better
educated labor force. As a result, a simple comparison between the Basque Country and
the rest of Spain during the terrorism years may not only reflect the impact of terrorism,
but also other pre-terrorism differences which affected subsequent economic growth.
      We approach this problem by comparing the economic evolution of the Basque Country
during the terrorist era with that of a weighted combination of other Spanish regions chosen
to resemble the characteristics of the Basque Country before terrorism. We conceptualize
such weighted average of other Spanish regions as a “synthetic” Basque Country without
terrorism, against which we can compare the actual Basque Country with terrorism. Let
J be the number of available control regions and W = (w1 , ..., wJ )0 a (J × 1) vector of
non-negative weights which sum to one. The scalar wj (j = 1, ..., J) represents the weight
of region j in the synthetic Basque Country. Each different value for W produces a different
synthetic Basque Country, and therefore the choice of a valid subset of control regions is
embedded in the choice of the weights W .
      As said above, the weights are chosen so that the synthetic Basque country most closely
resembles the actual one before terrorism. Let X1 be a (K × 1) vector of pre-terrorism
values of K economic growth predictors for the Basque Country (i.e., those values in Table
  7
      See also Kurlansky (1999) and CNN (2001) for background information on the Basque conflict.

      See, e.g., Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995).




                                                   4
2, column (1)). Let X0 be a (K × J) matrix which contains the values of these same
variables for the J possible control regions. Let V be a diagonal matrix with non-negative
components. The values of the diagonal elements of V reflect the relative importance of
the different growth predictors. The vector of weights W ∗ is chosen to minimize (X1 −
X0 W )0 V (X1 − X0 W ) subject to wj ≥ 0 (j = 1, 2, ..., J) and w1 + · · · + wJ = 1. The
vector W ∗ defines the combination of non-terrorism control regions which best resembled
the Basque Country in economic growth determinants at the outset of terrorism. Since W ∗
depends on V there is something to be said about the choice of V . Arguably, the choice
of V could be subjective, reflecting our previous knowledge about the relative importance
of each particular growth predictor. Here, we adopt a more eclectic method, choosing V
such that the real per capita GDP path for the Basque Country during the 1960’s is best
reproduced by the resulting synthetic Basque Country (see Appendix B for details).
       The reason to restrict the weights in W to be non-negative and sum to one is to
prevent extrapolation outside the support of the growth predictors for the control regions.
Without this restriction (and if all the diagonal elements of V are positive), X1 would
be perfectly fitted as long as the rank of X0 is equal to K. When the weights in W are
restricted to be non-negative and sum to one, X1 cannot be perfectly fitted in general
even if the rank of X0 is equal to K.9 Column (3) of Table 2, reports growth predictors
for the synthetic Basque Country before terrorism: X1∗ = X0 W ∗ . These figures give an
indication of how well the weighted combination of control regions reproduces the values of
growth predictors for Basque Country before terrorism. As expected, the synthetic Basque
Country looks comparable to the actual one, although some growth determinants cannot
be perfectly fitted. In particular, during the 1960’s, the Basque Country was the Spanish
region with the highest industrial share as a percentage of total production. Therefore, a
convex combination of other Spanish regions cannot perfectly reproduce the Basque sectoral
shares before terrorism.
       Let Y1 be a (T × 1) vector whose elements are the values of real per capita GDP for
   9
    X1 will be perfectly fitted only if it lies in the “support” (convex hull) of the growth predictors for the
control regions.



                                                      5
the Basque Country during T time periods. Let Y0 be a (T × J) matrix which contains
the values of the same variables for the control regions. Our goal is to approximate the
per capita GDP path that the Basque Country would have experienced in the absence of
terrorism. This counterfactual per capita GDP path is calculated as the per capita GDP
of the synthetic Basque Country, Y1∗ = Y0 W ∗ .
   Figure 1 plots Y1 and Y1∗ for the period 1955-1997. The Basque Country and the
synthetic control behave similarly until 1975. From 1975, when ETA’s terrorist activity
becomes a large-scale phenomenon, Y1 and Y1∗ diverge; the Basque Country per capita
GDP takes values up to around 12% below those of the synthetic control. The gap in per
capita GDP seems to decrease at the end of the period, taking values around 8%-9% in
1995-97. Overall, Figure 1 suggests a 10% loss in per capita GDP due to terrorism for the
1980’s and 1990’s.
   Of course, a question remains about whether the estimated gap truly responds to the
effect of terrorism or is merely an artifact of the inability of the control regions to reproduce
the growth path for the Basque Country in the absence of terrorism. We approach this
question from two different angles. First, we analyze the statistical relationship between
the estimated gap and the intensity of terrorism. Second, we perform a “placebo study,”
applying the same analysis to a “non-terrorism region” (a region other than the Basque
Country).
   Since production factors are fixed in the short run, we expect terrorism to have a
lagged negative effect on per capita GDP. In Figure 2, we plotted the estimated GDP
gap as a percentage of Basque GDP (100 × (Y1 − Y1∗ )/Y1 ) and the number of deaths
caused by terrorist actions (used as a proxy for overall terrorist activity). As expected,
spikes in terrorist activity seem to be followed by increases in the amplitude of the GDP
gap. This pattern is confirmed by Figure 3 which shows the estimated impulse-response
function of terrorism on the GDP gap. The impulse-response function shows the estimated
contemporaneous and lagged response of per capita GDP gap to an increase of terrorist
activity, proxied by an increase of one unit in the number of victims per year (see Appendix



                                               6
B for details on the estimation of the impulse-response function). The effect of terrorism
on the GDP gap is negative for every time lead, it is maximal after two to three years,
and it decreases monotonically (in absolute value) after that. Terrorist activity explains
the GDP gap almost perfectly (see last row of Table A.1 in Appendix B), and it does so in
a way that is consistent with our previous beliefs about the lagged impact of terrorism on
output.
   An alternative way to check if the estimated GDP gap is generated spuriously by the
analytical methods that we adopted is to apply the same techniques to a control region.
To conduct this “placebo” study we chose Catalonia which was the region with the largest
weight in the synthetic control for the Basque Country (see Appendix B). In addition
to being the region most similar (under our methodology) to the Basque Country before
terrorism, Catalonia resembles the Basque Country in many characteristics, some of which
are not directly measured in our data. In particular, at the end of Franco’s dictatorship,
both the Basque Country and Catalonia were highly industrialized regions, and both had
historical demands for self-governance, which led to the first two regional autonomy statutes
of the post-Franco era in 1979. Since then, autonomy statutes have been granted to the rest
of Spanish regions, however Catalonia and the Basque Country have always been among the
regions with the highest degree of political autonomy. While in both regions large fractions
of the population have traditionally demanded higher levels of self-governance, Catalonia
never experienced a large-scale outbreak of political terrorism. Figure 4 shows the actual
real per capita GDP path for Catalonia and the one implied by a “synthetic Catalonia”
constructed as a weighted combination of other Spanish regions (excluding the Basque
Country) as explained above. The weighted combination of Spanish regions reproduces
per capita GDP for Catalonia with high accuracy up to the late 1980’s. During 1990-1997
Catalonia over-performed the synthetic control by around 4% in per capita GDP. This gap
does not come as a surprise if we consider the heavy investments and economic expansion
that Catalonia experienced during that period as a result of the 1992 Summer Olympic
Games hosted in Barcelona. Since Catalonia is the main contributor to the synthetic



                                             7
control for the Basque Country, an abnormally high level of per capita GDP for Catalonia
during the 1990’s may artificially widen the GDP gap for the Basque Country in Figure
1. Therefore, our placebo study suggests that, while GDP per capita for Catalonia can
be reasonably well reproduced by our techniques, the catch-up in per capita GDP for the
Basque Country during the 1990’s (relative to the synthetic control region) may have been
more pronounced than what Figure 1 indicates.
       As noted earlier, the Basque Country has been the main scenario of the terrorist con-
flict. However, ETA has also operated in other Spanish regions. Even though there is
no indication that entrepreneurs have abandoned Spain as a result of the terrorist threat,
Basque terrorism might have imposed a negative reputational externality on other Spanish
regions, and foreign investment might have chosen alternative destinations with no terror-
ist conflicts. If it is in fact the case that the Basque terrorist conflict has had a negative
economic effect on other Spanish regions, this effect is arguably weaker than the economic
effect of terrorism on the Basque Country. To the extent that the regions which form the
synthetic control might have been economically hurt by the conflict, our estimated GDP
gap would provide a lower bound on the economic effect of terrorism on the Basque Country
economy. On the other hand, the conflict may have diverted investment from the Basque
Country to other Spanish regions biasing our estimated gap upwards. However, since the
size of the synthetic Basque Country is much larger than the actual Basque Country, this
type of bias is arguably small.10 In the next section we show evidence that support the
view that the effect of the conflict was small outside the Basque Country.
       A more important criticism of the analysis in this section is that, as long as the synthetic
control cannot reproduce exactly the characteristics of the Basque Country before terrorism,
the GDP gap may have been created by differences in growth predictors between the Basque
Country and the synthetic control before terrorism (columns (1) and (3) in Table 2). In
particular, it might be argued that the GDP gap was caused by the higher industrial
concentration in the Basque Country in the pre-terrorism years, since terrorism developed
  10
   For the 1964-1975 period, GDP for the synthetic region was 2.5 times larger than GDP for the Basque
Country, this figure increased to more than 3 during the terrorism era.



                                                  8
during a period of industrial decline, when many industrial plants closed. In fact, the
industrial share of GDP declined 17 percentage points (from 45% to 28%) for the Basque
Country during the 1964-1993 period. The industrial share of the GDP decreased 15
percentage points (from 38% to 23%) for the synthetic control during the same period.
Notwithstanding the potential importance of this criticism, we believe that differences
in industrial decline between the Basque Country and the synthetic control cannot fully
explain the GDP gap between the two regions during the 1980s and 1990s. As discussed
earlier, the GDP gap seems to respond to the intensity of the the terrorist activity in the
Basque Country. Such association is consistent with the interpretation that the gap was
caused by terrorism, and would be left unexplained under the alternative explanation that
the gap was generated by a more pronounced industrial decline in the Basque Country.
   Figure 5 graphs population series for the Basque Country, the synthetic control and
Spain (the series are normalized to 100 in 1964). The population of the Basque Country
and the synthetic control grew at similar rates during the late 1960s and the early and the
mid 1970s, well above the rate for the whole country. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the
patterns of the series changed dramatically; population growth decelerated for the synthetic
Basque Country and Spain, and became negative for the Basque Country. The results on
per capita GDP gap presented in this section do not reflect this relative population loss in
the Basque Country. Once the population dynamics are considered, the gap in per capita
GDP documented in this section becomes even more striking.
   Finally, it is worth noticing that the results in this section are consistent with the find-
ings in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995, page 399, Figure 11.8) who document an atypically
low growth rate for the Basque Country during the period 1950-1999 relative to other
European regions.


         iii. Using ETA’s 1998-1999 Truce as a Natural Experiment

On September 16, 1998, ETA announced a cease-fire (starting on September 18, 1998).
Fourteen months later, on November 28, 1999, ETA announced the end of the truce. Table 3
presents a chronology of some of the most important events related to the truce. Anecdotal

                                              9
evidence suggests that the truce was not perceived as credible from the beginning (note,
for example, the Spanish government’s reaction to the announcement of the cease-fire in
Table 3, event number 4). In fact, ETA had declared other cease-fires in the past, but none
of them lasted more than three months; the previous one, in 1996, had only lasted one
week. Peace prospects became more realistic as months passed without terrorist actions
and the Spanish government confirmed contacts with ETA. Weeks before the end of the
truce the situation deteriorated as the Spanish government announced that the process was
paralyzed.
   If financial markets are efficient, asset prices should reflect all available information and,
thus, react only to new information. Therefore, if the terrorist conflict was perceived to have
a negative impact on the Basque economy, Basque stocks (stocks of firms with a significant
part of their business in the Basque Country) should have shown a positive performance
relative to non-Basque stocks (stocks of firms without a significant part of their business in
the Basque Country) as the truce became credible. Similarly, Basque stocks should have
performed poorly, relative to non-Basque stocks, at the end of the truce. In this section,
we use the method of event study to explore these questions.
   A challenge with this exercise is that there is no obvious way to classify stocks into
the Basque/non-Basque categories. A classification that relies solely on companies’ regis-
tered addresses seems problematic. Registered addresses are sometimes chosen for historic,
convenience, or tax-related reasons and do not necessarily imply that the company has an
important presence in the area. Unfortunately, data on geographical location of firms’ ac-
tivities are rarely available. To solve this problem we adopted a simple and direct approach.
Since what is relevant for our event study is which companies were perceived by the markets
as carrying a significant part of their business in the Basque Country, we asked a group of
market analysts at a certain Basque financial institution to produce this classification for
us. We used this information to divide stocks into Basque stocks and non-Basque stocks.
Again, the idea is to label firms which have a large part of their business in the Basque
Country as Basque stocks, even if they are not located in the Basque County. All other



                                              10
firms with little exposure in the Basque Country were labeled as non-Basque stocks.11
       We collected series of daily stock returns for 1998, 1999 and 2000 and constructed two
buy-and-hold portfolios: one composed of 14 Basque stocks and the other composed of
59 non-Basque stocks (see Appendix B for details on selection of stocks for our sample
and construction of portfolios). Buy-and-hold portfolios represent the portfolio of a passive
investor who constructed a value-weighted Basque or non-Basque portfolio at the beginning
of our sample.12
       Table 4 contains descriptive statistics for our sample. Fifty-seven percent of the firms
that compose our Basque portfolio have registered addresses in the Basque Country, while
none of the non-Basque firms are registered in the Basque Country. On average, Basque
firms are smaller and have a higher book-to-market ratio.13
       In contrast with more conventional event study settings, where most of the information
is revealed during short event windows, the informational content of the truce evolved
gradually during a 14 month period. Therefore, to study the effect of the truce is important
to control for long-run risk factors in stock returns. The empirical finance literature (see,
e.g., Fama and French 1993, and Lyon et al. 1999) has shown that common risk in stock
returns is fairly well explained by the so-called Fama-French Three-Factor Model:

                         Rtj = αj + β1j Rtm + β2j SM Bt + β3j HM Lt + ARtj .                            (1)

Rtj is the excess return (over the risk free rate) on a buy-and-hold portfolio of j =
Basque, non-Basque stocks on day t, Rtm is the excess return on the market portfolio
at time t, SM Bt (“small minus big”) is the difference between the returns of portfolios
composed by small and big size stocks at time t, and HM Lt (“high minus low”) is the dif-
  11
     The list of Basque and non-Basque stocks used for the analysis is provided in Appendix B, Table A.2.
  12
     The strategy of constructing portfolios of firms exposed and not exposed to certain risks is often used
in event studies. See for instance Kho, Lee, and Stulz (2000). By using buy-and-hold portfolios we avoid
“rebalancing” bias (the bias induced by the rebalancing necessary to maintain a value-weighted or equally-
weighted portfolio). In addition, since we only consider stocks with data available for the whole sample
period, the analysis does not suffer from “new listings” bias (the bias induced by the reweighting necessary
because new stocks enter the market or some exit). See Lyon, Barber, and Tsai (1999).
  13
     Size is the market valuation of a common stock. The book-to-market ratio is the ratio of the book
value of a stock to its market value.



                                                    11
ference between the returns of portfolios composed by high and low book-to-market stocks
at time t.
       Rtm represents the usual market factor in stock returns, while SM Bt and HM Lt are
meant to capture risk factors related to size and book to market equity respectively. The
residual, ARtj , is a zero mean abnormal portfolio return not explained by common risk
factors.14
       Columns (1) and (2) of Table 5 report the results of fitting equation (1) by OLS to
the Basque and non-Basque portfolios. The coefficients on Rtm , SM Bt and HM Lt are all
significant. The coefficients on Rtm are positive in both cases, whereas the coefficients on
SM Bt and HM Lt have positive signs for the Basque portfolio and negative signs for the
non-Basque portfolio. This result is in line with Fama and French (1993) who find that
returns of portfolios constructed from stocks with small market valuation and high book-to-
market (as the Basque portfolio) respond positively to SM Bt and HM Lt , whereas returns
of portfolios constructed from stocks with big market valuation and low book-to-market
(as the non-Basque portfolio) respond negatively to SM Bt and HM Lt .
       The residuals of the regressions are the estimated abnormal returns on the Basque
and non-Basque portfolios. Abnormal returns are now suited for comparison, as they are
adjusted for known risk factors. However, abnormal returns are too noisy to be visually
instructive. In order to visually inspect the difference in performance of the two portfolios
abnormal returns are customarily aggregated through time. We calculate cumulative ab-
normal returns as the compounded abnormal return of a portfolio from the day after the
announcement of the truce:
                                              t
                                                           !
                                              Y
                                 CARtj =        {1 + ARsj } − 1.                                   (2)
                                              s=1

Figure 6 graphs cumulative abnormal returns for the Basque and non-Basque portfolios
from the beginning of the truce to the end of 1999 (the vertical line in Figure 6 represents
the end of the truce). The Basque portfolio over-performs the non-Basque portfolio for most
  14
    See the influential paper by Fama and French (1993) and Appendix B for more information about the
definition and construction of these variables. Lyon et al. (1999) discusses the use of the Fama-French
Three-Factor Model to calculate long-run abnormal returns in event studies.


                                                    12
of the truce period except at the beginning (when the cease-fire had not gained credibility)
and at the end (when the cease-fire lost credibility).
   To perform a statistical test on the effect of the truce we added two dummy variables to
equation (1). Good News t takes a value of one for the period between the trading sessions
after event 5 and event 7 in Table 3, and a value of zero otherwise. Bad News t takes a value
of one for the period between the trading sessions after event 11 and event 14 in Table 3,
and a value of zero otherwise. The Good News period comprises 22 trading sessions and
the Bad News period 66. During the Good News period, the credibility of the truce gained
ground, starting with the offer of a revision in the policy towards ETA activists in jail,
if peace consolidated, by the Spanish Prime Minister (event number 5), and culminating
with the announcement of the authorization of direct contacts with ETA by the Spanish
government (event number 7). In contrast, the Bad News period was characterized by the
collapse of the peace process, starting with the acknowledgment that contacts had been
interrupted, made by the Spanish Prime Minister (event number 11), and ending with the
announcement of the end of the truce by ETA (event number 14). Columns (3) and (4) of
Table 5 report the regressions including the dummy variables Good News and Bad News.
The estimated coefficients on the dummy variables represent average daily abnormal returns
during the Good News and Bad News periods for the Basque and non-Basque portfolios. As
expected, for the Basque portfolio, the coefficient of Good News is positive and significant
while the coefficient of Bad News is negative and also significant. For the non-Basque
portfolio, the effects are small in magnitude and not statistically different from zero, which
supports the view that Basque terrorism has a minor impact on the economy outside the
Basque Country. The last column of Table 5 shows the result on the difference regression.
The difference regression can be interpreted as the one that corresponds to the portfolio
of a passive investor who takes a long position in Basque stocks and a short position in
non-Basque stocks. This regression reflects a positive abnormal performance of Basque
stocks relative to non-Basque stocks during the Good News period and a negative relative
performance during the Bad News period.

                            iv. Summary and Conclusions

Much has been said about the pernicious effects of political conflict on the economy. How-
ever, to date, little case study research has been produced on this matter. This paper
presents evidence of a negative economic impact of the terrorist conflict in the Basque
Country. The first part of this study shows a 10% average gap between Basque per capita
GDP and the per capita GDP of a comparable synthetic region without terrorism which
emerges over a period of two decades. Moreover, changes in per capita GDP gap are shown
to be associated with the intensity of terrorist activity. The second part of this study
uses the 1998-1999 cease-fire as a natural experiment to measure the effect of the conflict
on the stock value of a sample of Basque and non-Basque firms. We show that Basque
stocks over-performed non-Basque stocks as the truce became credible. At the end of the
cease-fire, Basque stocks showed a negative performance relative to non-Basque stocks.
   Although we focus here on the Basque conflict, the methods applied in this paper can
be used to investigate the economic effects of conflicts elsewhere. The application of the
techniques in this paper to the study of other conflicts will also shed light on the robustness
of the procedure and serve as a cross validation.
   Research of this sort could potentially have an undesirable impact if terrorists learn
that their actions affect the economy negatively, assuming that is what they want to do.
However, we do hope that, as Nelson and Scott (1992) found that media attention does
not cause terrorism, academic attention does not cause terrorism either.

Data on terrorist activity (deaths and kidnappings) are provided in Spanish Ministry of Interior (2000).
Regional data on GDP, investment, population density, and sectoral production come from Fundación BBV
(1999). The regions used for the analysis are the 17 autonomous communities of Spain (leaving out the
small autonomous towns of Ceuta and Melilla on the coast of Africa). Data on human capital for different
regions have been collected by Mas et al. (1998). One day public debt repurchase agreement rates come
from the Bank of Spain. Data on stock prices, firm size (market value of outstanding shares), book equity
and dividends are routinely collected by the Madrid Stock Exchange (http://www.bolsamadrid.es).

                                  Appendix B: Technical Details
Estimation of per capita GDP gap: Consider the problem,

                                     minimize (X1 − X0 W )0 V (X1 − X0 W )
                                       W ∈W
where W = {(w1 , ..., wJ )0 s.t. w1 + · · · + wJ = 1, wj ≥ 0 (j = 1, ..., J)}, and X1 , X0 , and V are as
described in the text. The solution to this problem, W ∗ (V ), depends on the diagonal matrix V whose
diagonal elements are weights which reflect the relative importance of the variables in X0 and X1 . We
selected V such that per capita GDP for the Basque country during the 1960’s is best reproduced by the
synthetic control defined by W ∗ (V ). Let Z1 be a (10 × 1) vector containing the real per capita GDP values
for the Basque Country during the period 1960-69. Let Z0 be (10 × J) matrix containing the values of the
same variables for the J potential control regions. Then

                               V ∗ = argmin(Z1 − Z0 W ∗ (V ))0 (Z1 − Z0 W ∗ (V )),
                                        V ∈V
where V is the set of all non-negative diagonal (K × K) matrices. The weights for the synthetic control are
given by W ∗ = W ∗ (V ∗ ). There are infinitely many solutions for V ∗ (if V ∗ is a solution so is V ∗ (c) = c · V ∗
for any positive scalar c), so we can normalize the Euclidean norm of V ∗ (or any positive diagonal element
of V ∗ ) to one.
The optimal weights, W ∗ , are .8508 for Catalonia, .1492 for Madrid and zero for the rest of the regions.
Small variations in V generate small positive weights for regions other than Catalonia and Madrid without
altering the results substantively.
Estimation of the impulse-response function: Since the number of periods is small we adopted a
convenient parameterization to estimate the impulse-response function. We started considering a flexible
dynamic model with AR(1) disturbances similar to the one proposed by Harvey (1990, p. 268):

                      Gt   =    µ + α1 Gt−1 + α2 Gt−2 + β0 Dt + β1 Dt−1 + β2 Dt−2 + ut ,                      (A.1)
                      ut   =    ρut−1 + εt

where Gt and Dt are respectively the per capita GDP gap and number of death victims in period t, and
εt are serially independent shocks. The vector of unknown parameters θ = (µ, α1 , α2 , β0 , β1 , β2 , ρ)0 is to
be estimated. Note however, that equation (A.1) cannot be directly estimated by least squares, since the
error term ut is correlated by construction with Gt−1 and Gt−2 . Expressing ut−1 in term of lags of Gt and
Dt we get:

            Gt = π0 + π1 Gt−1 + π2 Gt−2 + π3 Gt−3 + π4 Dt + π5 Dt−1 + π6 Dt−2 + π7 Dt−3 + εt ,                (A.2)

where the vector π = (π0 , π1 , ..., π7 )0 is a nonlinear function of θ. We estimated equation (A.2) consistently
by least squares for the period 1955-97. The parameters in θ were recovered from the estimates of π by
minimum distance (see, e.g., Newey and McFadden (1994)). The result is reported in Table A.1 column
(1). We proceeded sequentially eliminating non-significant parameters in columns (2) to (5), which are



                                                        15
estimated by least squares. Our preferred specification, which contains terms in Gt−1 , Gt−2 and Dt−1 is
reported in column (5). Inverting the autoregressive terms, we obtain the impulse response function:
                                            
                                                       0         if s = 0
                                   ∂Gt+s
                             δs =         =            β1         if s = 1
                                    ∂Dt     
                                               α1 δs−1 + α2 δs−2 if s ≥ 2,
where s runs over non-negative integers. We report standard errors that are robust to misspecification.
Computation of asset returns: We collected daily end-of-the-day stock prices from Madrid’s continuous
trading stock exchange market for a sample period from January 2, 1998 to December 29, 2000 for a total
of 748 daily observations. We restricted the analysis to firms with complete data for the sample period.
This restriction eliminates all firms which entered the market during the sample period, had their quotation
suspended or merged with other firm in the data file. This resulted in a sample of 81 firms. During 1998
stock prices were quoted in Spanish pesetas and starting in January 4, 1999, quotations were in euros,
thus requiring adjustment by multiplying the euro figures by the 166.386 pesetas/euro fixed exchange rate.
Stock prices were also adjusted for splits. Then, daily returns were calculated and adjusted for dividends
and equity issue (also adjusted for pesetas/euro conversion and splits). The return on the market portfolio
was proxied by the rate of change of the general index of the Madrid Stock Exchange (IGBM) and the
risk-free asset return was taken to be the return on the one-day public debt repurchase agreements. To
construct the size and book-to-market portfolios, we used end of 1997, 1998 and 1999 book value and
market valuation, this information was not available for 7 firms which reduced the sample to 74 firms.
Then, we proceed as in Fama and French (1993) to compute the returns on the size and book-to-market
portfolios. We first ranked stocks according to market size and the median was used to split the sample in
two groups, small (S) and big (B). Then, we classified stocks into three book-to-market groups, the bottom
30% (Low), middle 40% (Medium) and top 30% (High). The size and book-to-market figures used in 1998,
1999 and 2000 correspond to the end of 1997, 1998 and 1999 figures respectively. Then, we constructed
six portfolios (S/L, S/M, S/H, B/L, B/M and B/H) and computed daily value-weighted returns on those
portfolios. The size portfolio used in the regressions is the daily difference between the average return on
the small-size portfolios (S/L, S/M and S/H) and the average return on the big-size portfolios (B/L, B/M
and B/H). The book-to-market portfolio is the daily difference between the average return on the high-
book-to-market portfolios (S/H, and B/H) and the average return on the low-book-to-market portfolios
(S/L and B/L).
We then computed calendar time returns on buy-and-hold Basque and non-Basque portfolios. We excluded
an additional Basque firm since its market valuation accounted for 75% of the value of Basque portfolio
total market valuation. The Basque portfolio contains 14 stocks and the non-Basque portfolio 59 stocks.
Table A.2 provides a list of the stocks in the Basque and non-Basque portfolios.
The buy-and-hold portfolios constructed at the beginning of the sample were value-weighted. There is
no rebalancing (buying or selling stocks) in the buy-and-hold portfolios, reflecting a passive investment
                j
strategy. Let Vi,t be the market valuation of all shares of stock i held in portfolio j in period t. Let Vtj be
the market valuation of portfolio j at time t, that is
                                                         nj

                                                               Vi,t ,

where nj is the number of stocks in portfolio j. Let Ri,t       be the market return of stock i in portfolio j
