              Expectations and the Forward Exchange Rate


                                 ABSTRACT




    This paper provides an empirical examination of the hypothesis that the

forward exchange rate provides an "optimal" forecast of the future spot ex-

change rate, for five currencies relative to the dollar. This hypothesis

provides a convenient norm for examining the erratic behavior of exchange

rates; this erratic behavior represents an efficient market that is quickly

incorporating new information into the current exchange rate. This hypothesis

is analyzed using two distinct, but related, approaches. The first approach

is based on a regression of spot rates on lagged forward rates. When using

weekly data and a one month forward exchange rate, ordinary least squares

regression analysis of market efficiency is incorrect. Econometric methods are

proposed which allow for consistent (though not fully efficient) estimation of

the parameters and their standard errors. This paper also presents a new ap-

proach for testing exchange market efficiency. This approach is based on a

general time series process generating the spot and forward exchange rate. The

hypothesis of efficiency implies a set of cross—equation restrictions imposed

on the parameters of the time series model. This paper derives these restrictions,

proposes a maximum likelihood method of estimating the constrained likelihood

function, estimates the model and tests the validity of the restrictions with

a likelihood ration statistic.

                            1 Introduction

       The hypothesis of efficiency has been used in many studies of the

foreign exchange market. This hypothesis implies that there are no unex-

ploited profit opportunities. In the foreign exchange market this implies

that the forward rate summarizes all relevant and available information

useful for forecasting the future spot rate. Analyzing this aspect of

efficiency requires an equilibrium model of pricing in the foreign exchange

market. Consequently, any empirical test of efficiency is a joint test of

efficiency and the equilibrium model.

       This paper will focus on two different methods of testing market

efficiency. Section 2 will examine the issue of efficiency from the point

of view of the standard regression model. This procedure emphasizes the

regression of the spot rate on the lagged forward rate. Several econo-

metric difficulties arise and must be overcome when the forecast horizon

(one month) exceeds the sampling interval (one week). The stochastic

structure of the error term may be interpreted as new information reach-

ing the foreign exchange market. To analyze the nature of efficiency with

this procedure requires an empirical analysis of the properties of the

error term. This will be done in Section 3.

       Section 4 will present a new, and alternative, procedure for analyz-

ing the hypothesis of efficiency. This procedure is based on a time series

analysis of the spot and one month forward rate. It is assumed that the

spot and forward rate can be described by a bivariate stochastic process.

The structure of the stochastic process provides a convenient method for

extracting forecasts of the future spot rate as a function of all avail-

able information (given the model being assumed). The hypothesis of
                                     -2-



market efficiency states that, in general, the expected value of the

future spot rate is the current forward rate. Therefore, the parameters

of the original stochastic process are not free, but must be constrained.

The restrictions are highly nonlinear. Section 4 provides a computa-

tionally feasible method for calculating the likelihood function subject

to these restrictions. The restrictions are then tested for five curren-

cies relative to the dollar. Section 5 concludes the paper.


                   2 Econometric Testing and Procedures

       Conventional tests of foreign exchange market efficiency focus on

the relation between spot and lagged forward rates.        (Assume, for now,

that one month is exactly four weeks.) If one wants to forecast lnS,

based on information up to (and including) time t, then the following

regression is appropriate:

             lnS =   x'13 +   u4                                               (1)


where x represents variables relevant for forecasting lnS÷4, and where

          E(u÷4:     lnS, lnS1,    ...,    x,   x1, .. .) = 0.                 (2)


Conditions   (1) and (2) imply Euuk = 0, for all k > 4 so that u is a
moving average of order 3 process, NA(3). The reason for this serial corre-

lation of the errors is that the forecast horizon (four weeks) exceeds the

sampling interval (one week). This data overlapping problem induces serial

correlation since, loosely speaking, it takes four weeks to realize an

error has been made)




       LThe four week forward rate set on Tuesday is for delivery four weeks
hence, also a Tuesday. However, a one month forward rate set on Tuesday is
for delivery four weeks and two days hence, on a Thursday. The extra two
days induces additional serial correlation, so the error term will be MA(4).
(See also Stockman (1978).) Notice that if one examines inS     - inS   one
                                                                      ,

would expect an MA(3) process, since the comparison is betwe4spot rites
on different Tuesdays.
                                        -3-



          Given that u can be written as an MA(3) process, one can write
      =    +        + e2e2 + e3c3 =                    Notice that equation (2)
                                              e(L)e.
does not require that x be strictly exogenous (at all leads and lags).

Obtaining estimates of the         vector by ordinary least squares is equi-

valent to minimizing the sum of squared prediction errors. To test the

forecasting ability of the forward rate, equation (1) will be restricted

by requiring x to consist of a constant and lnF. Therefore, equation

(1) may be rewritten as

               lnS =   a   + blnF + u                                             (1')

where

               E(u: lnS, lnS1, ...,         lnF,   lnF1, ...) = 0.             (2')

For    future reference let    =
                                    (lnS,     lnS1, ...,   lnF,   lnFi, ...
Restricting     the x vector in this way will impose restrictions on the data

that can be rejected. These restrictions test if the forward rate summarizes

all information (and that the risk premium, if it exists, is such that

equation (1') holds).

          There are several difficulties involved in estimating equation (1')

efficiently as a regression equation. The problem arises since lnF is

not strictly exogenous (that is, lnFt is a lagged endogenous variable)

and the errors are serially correlated. Because of these two facts, one

must be careful in applying generalized least squares. It does not appear

that there exists a simple and efficient two step GLS procedure with

lagged endogenous variables and moving average error terms. It is, however,

possible to obtain consistent, though not fully efficient, estimates of a
                                   -4-



and b by using ordinary least squares.1 It is not fully efficient since

one does not use the information that u is MA(3); it is, however, more

efficient than dropping three-fourths of the observations.

      A sufficient condition for the forward rate to be an unbiased fore-

cast of the future spot rate is a = 0 and b = 1 in equation (lt).2 Two

of the studies using weekly data with a forward rate of maturity greater

than one week (Stockman 1978 used a one-month forward rate and Hansen and

Hodrick 1979 used a three month forward rate) constrained, a priori, b = 1.




       1The nature of the inconsistency in this case can be easily seen
(see Hansen 1979). Let u have an NA representation: u =             where
                                                              e(L)e,
(L) is invertible, with inverse B(L)1. Multiplying equation (1') by
      we have
          e(L)1lns÷4 =     ae(L)1 + b8(L)1 1nF +
Now, it is the case that     is serially uncorrelated; however, in general
it will be the case that

          E[e(L)1lns:       e(l)1, e(L)1lnFt aO(l) + be(L)1lnFt
since we cannot rule out possible correlation between et and
                                                                       B(L)11nF.
Hansen (1979) shows that the usual standard errors (as reported in most
computer packages) are incorrect.

                                          =
       21f unbiasedness means
                                E(S÷4:        F   and u is normally distributed
in (3'), then it is easily shown that the "correct" null hypothesis is

a = -      and b = 1 (see Frenkel 1979). A difficulty is that to state the
null hypo'hesis, one must make some distributional assumption on the residuals
(normally, we make distributional assumptions when we want to test the null
hypothesis (see Garber 1978)).

'Stockman set b = 1 so that he could estimate the moving average para-

 meters efficiently and Hansen and Hodrick set b = 1 to induce station—

 arity. However, constraining b = 1 may bias the other coefficent.1

       Much of the attention in the paper will be focussed on the residuals

 u .   There are two reasons for this. The first, discussed earlier, is that
  t

 if the forward rate is to be an efficient forecast of the future spot rate,

 then the residuals should be a pure forecast error. The second reason comes

 from considering the return from holding foreign currency. Decompose the

 total return from holding foreign currency, lnS÷4 —
                                                            lnS, as   follows:


       lnS4 — lnS   =            —             + (ElnS+4   — inS)
                        (lnS+4       E1nS÷4)                                      (3)

return (Poole 1967 and Bilson 1979). The second term on the right hand side,

ElnS÷4, is a known quantity (to the economic agent), it is the expected

change as of time t in the exchange rate. The first term, lnS+4 —

foreign   currency, due to new information which affects the exchange rate.

Since agents are compensated for bearing uncertainty, one is led to focus

on that term. But equation (1') states that ElnSt+4 = a + blnF; hence

           E lnS        =
lnS4 —             +4

   It   was stated earlier that u can be written as u =
                                                          O(L)C,   where 0(L)

is a third degree polynomial in the lag operator L. Since one can write

u = 0(L)e,     equation (1') may be rewritten as


        lnS4 = a + blnF + 03C +1   + 02€ +2 + OlCt+3 +          (1")




Assuming the C—shocks strike with equal weight over time, one would expect

the 0's to be approximately equal to 1.    Appendix A provides an interpre-

tation of the 0's and the C's.


                            3 Econometric Results


   Equation (1') is estimated for five currencies, with respect to the dollar,

for the period April 1973 to May 1977.1 Ordinary least squares estimates of a

and b are reported in Table 1. In all cases b is less than one. However,

only in the case of the Netherlands and Germany is b significantly less than

one. In addition, the constant term is significantly less than zero for the

Netherlands and Germany, but insignificantly different from zero for Canada,

Switzerland and the U.K. These results indicate a significant risk premium for

only the Netherlands and Germany.

   Having obtained consistent estimates of a and b from Table 1, a consistent

estimate of u is obtained. An MA(4) process was fit to the OLS residuals.

The results are reported in Table 1.      01 and 02 are generally within one

standard deviation of unity and 03 is generally within two standard deviations

of unity. Switzerland is the exception, where 0l O2 and 03 are all signifi-

cantly less than 1.0. 04 is significantly less than 1.0, as expected, since

   is picking up "the last two days of the month." These results conform to

one's prior notion of of 0's.


   As stated previously, b has often been constrained to be unity (Hansen and

Hocrick 1979 and Stockinan 1978).   If b is in fact unity, then this method will

provide efficient estimates of a and the 0s. However, if the data rejects the

assumption that b is unity, imposing this restriction will bias our results.

Table 2 reports the estimates of a obtained from constraining b to be unity.

In all cases, a is insignificantly different from 0. Estimates of 9. are

also reported in Table 2 for the case in which b is constrained to be unity.

In this case, a and 9(j= 1, 2, 3, 4) are jointly estimated in an efficient

manner; lnF was taken to the left hand side so that all right hand side

variables (a constant) are strictly exogenous. The results are similar to

those in Table 1, except that 93 is significantly different from unity for

the Netherlands and Germany.

   As stated previously, the time series behavior of the residuals is of

great interest. In particular, does u follow and MA(4) process, or equiva-

lently, is    white noise? To test this a number of tests of         being

white noise are reported. Durbin's periodograrn test (Durbin 1969) provides

a frequency domain test of the null hypothesis that       is white noise, against

the alternative hypothesis that      is not white noise (PER in the tables).

PER = 0 means that the actual cumulative periodogram does not differ

significantly from the expected cumulative periodogram, at any frequency. The

Box Pierce Q—statistic, Q(k), tests the null hypothesis that the first k auto—

correlations are equal to zero. It can be shown that Q(k) is distributed as

x2(k—q), where q is the number of parameters estimated. So far, only a very

broad alternative has been considered:       is not white noise. It is possible

to test more restrictive alternative hypotheses.1 One particular alternative

that is considered is that u is MA(5).

     The results of these tests of white noise are reported in Table 1. In

all cases, Durbin's periodogram test indicates that c. is white noise (PER =

0 in the table). The Box—Pierce Q—statistic also indicates that c is white

noise for the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. However, for Canada and

the U.K, the Box—Pierce Q(12) statistic of 13.8 and 16.6 indicates that there

is a departur.e from white noise, at the 5 percent level of significance for

these currencies. (Note that Q(12) is insignificant at the Q(24) and Q(36)

are insignificant at the 5 percent level.)

     To test if    is MA(5), an MA(5) process was fit to the OLS residuals.

The results are reported in Table 3. One finds that 05 is statistically

significant for all currencies except Canada and the U.K. Recall that Canada

and the U.K. had significant Q(12) statistics. This would seem to imply that

although for these currencies there is serial correlation in u beyond an

MA(4), it is not of a moving average form. To test this assertion, one can

perform a likelihood ratio test of whether one needs to go to an MA(5) process

for u (over an MA(4)). The results of this test are reported in Table 4 under




     1The power of a test relates to the alternative hypothesis. A test may
be powerful against some alternatives but less powerful against other alterna-
tives. Durbin's periodogram test has good power against the alternative of
white noise, however, there are more powerful tests against, for example, an
MA(S) alternative.

     NOTE: The column Error tests the hypothesis that u is MA(4) against
M5). A likelihood ratio test is used, where 2lnX is distributed x2(1),
where
                     (T/2)
where A =                       The critical values are 2.71 (10 percent),


3.84 (5 percent) and 6.63 (1 percent). The column Variance tests the hypoth-
esis that the variance of    is equal in both periods (a2(PER1) = a2(PER2))
against the hypothesis that they are unequal. An F—statistic is calculated
as F =
          s/s,   F is distributed as F(99,97). Critical values, using
F(lO0,100), for the two sided alternative are: 0.719 < F < 1.39 (10 percent)
and 0.629 < F < 1.59 (2 percent). To test if the variance decreases over
time, the critical values are 1.39 (5 percent) and 1.59 (1 percent). To test
if the variance increases over time, the critical values are 0.719 (5 percent)
and 0.629 (1 percent). The column Theta tests the hypothesis that 8(PER) =
O(PER2). A x2 statistic can becalculated to test this hypothesis (see
Morrison 1967). The critical values for x2(4) are 7.78 (10 percent), 9.49
(5 percent) and 13.3 (1 percent).

the column headed "Error.tt For the Netherlands and Switzerland an MA(5)

yields   significantly better results at the 10 percent level, but not

significantly better results at the 5 percent level, as indicated by x2

values of 3.32 and 3.79, respectively. For Germany, Canada and the U.K.

there is no significant improvement at the 10 percent level. In fact, for

Canada and the U.K., the variance of       is unchanged, reflected in x2 values

of 0.000, thereby confirming our earlier assertion.

     As stated earlier, another issue of interest concerns the behavior of

the system over time. For example, can one assert in any meaningful way

that the system has become less noisy over time? Also, have economic agents

reacted to new information in the same way over time? To answer these ques-

tions, the sample period was divided into two equal halves (non—overlapping) and

equation (1') was reestimated for each half. The results are presented in

Tables 5 and 6.      F—statistic was calculated to test the hypothesis that

2 is the same in both periods. The results of this calculation are re-

ported in Table 4 under the column headed "Variance." In all cases one can

reject the hypothesis (at the 10 percent and 2 percent level) that the vari-

ances are equal, due to the extreme values of the F reported. For the

Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland one can accept the alternative (at the

5 percent and 1 percent level) that the variance has increased over time, as

reflected in the large values of F. On the other hand, for Canada and the U.K.,

one can accept the alternative (at the 5 percent and 1 percent level) that the

variance has increased over time, as reflected in the small values of F.

     The reaction of economic agents to the new information coming to the

market is summarized by the 8—vector. A x2 test can be used to test if the 8's

change over time. The result of such a test is reported in Table 4 under

column headed "Theta." For the Netherlands and Canada, one can reject, at the

at the 5 percent level, the hypothesis that the B's are the same in both

periods. For Germany, Switzerland and the U.K. one cannot reject the

hypothesis that the 0's are the same in both periods. As a general pro-

position, it appears that 0(period 2) is larger than 0(period 1).

     In summarizing the results in Tables 1—6, it is helpful to look for any

patterns that emerge. The 0—vector does appear to equal a vector of ones (ex-

cept, of course, for 0k). Switzerland is a striking exception since the 0's

are significantly less than one. In addition, there is a tendency for 0. to

decrease as j increases. Finally, although the slope is significantly less than

one only for the Netherlands and Germany, the point estimates are always less

than one. This might seem to indicate that in fact b < 1.       Notice, however,

that this is not an exact statistical statement since the five exchange rates

are not independent. What this observation suggests is that pooling all five

currencies might lead to more precise estimates. In fact, this is what Bilson

(1979) finds in a slightly different context.

     It is also possible to divide the sample into two groups: (1) Canada and

U.K. (2) the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. For Canada and the U.K. the

constant in equation (1') is negative, while for the others it is positive. For

a given slope, this implies that the U.S. dollar is safer, with respect to the

Canadian dollar and U.K pound, but riskier with respect to the Dutch guilder,

German mark and the Swiss franc. Canada and the U.K. were the only countries

that showed any indication of serial correlation in the c(Q(l2) was signifi-

cant at the 5 percent level). This indicates that for these two countries 1nF

did not summarize all information about the value of lnS    .   (It   should be noted

that all other tests of randomness indicated a lack of serial correlation in

      Finally,    increased in the second period for Canada and the U.K.,

while it decreased for the others. How, then, is Canada and the
                                  -17-


U.K. different from the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland? A major

difference would seem to be that the U.S. dollar appreciated against the

Canadian dollar and U.K. pound for the period as a whole, while it depre-

ciated against the other currencies. Not coincidently, Canada and the

U.K. had the highest rates of inflation for the whole period and each of the

two subperiods.

     To understand the change in the variance of the system (02), one should

consider some of the institutional changes. In March of 1973, Germany and

the Netherlands agreed to fix their rates within 2.5 percent but to float

against the dollar. Late 1973 witnessed the dramatic increase in the price

of oil. In December 1975 (at the Rambouillet meeting) and January 1976 (in

Jamaica) it became "official" that we were in a period of floating exchange

rates; previously, there was some hope of a return to fixed exchange rates.

Finally, there was the IIIF support of sterling in late 1976: in June of 1976,

a $5 billion stand—by credit and in December of 1976, a $3.9 billion loan.

     Equation (1') expressed E(ZnS÷4:I) as a linear function of

,r1F: E(LnS:I) = a + bLnF. This is quite a strong assumption, and one
would like to test it. One possibility is to include variables x. in the

regression equation (1') and test if the coefficients are significant (see,

for example, Hansen and Hodrick 1979); one would like a more efficient method.

In addition, one would like to obtain a more efficient estimate of b.

       Assume that {st, f} is a bivariate, linearly indeterministic,

empirical   work, that             s and t         are the first differences of the logarithms

of St and F. Under the assumption that s,                                         is invertible, one can

express             f} as an infinite order bivariate autoregression. Assuming

one can truncate the autoregressionat lag N, one can write

Then, one can rewrite equation (4) as
            = A
                  x1 +      a                                           (5)

Defining c = (1 0 ... 0) and d = (0          ...    0 1 0 ...    0),   rewrite (4), using

(5), as

                  = c A x1 + w                                                         (6)

Taking expectations of both sides of (7), conditional on information up to

t   -   1, It-i' one obtains

             E(s+.IIti) = A3+l        x1 .                                            (8)

Recalling that s = c A x1 + w, one can calculate Et 1S by pre-

multiplying both sides of (8) by the(row) vector C:

                            E(c xt÷.II         =   c A3+l
                                                            x1                        (9)

The assumption that t suimnarizes all information implies that

          E(st÷4IIi) = b E(fjIti).

Equation (6) implies that
                            = b(dA)                                                   (10)
             b E(fII                    x1 .
Therefore, by equating equations (9) snd (10), the following set of cross-

equation restrictions are obtained:

                   b(dA) = c A5                                                       (11)

          The assumption that the forward rate is an unbiased estimate of the

future spot rate implies b = 1.          Therefore, the restrictions embodied in
                                        -21-

(11) become

                  dA = CA5.                                               (12)

        Under the hypothesis that (we, v) is bivariate normal, the likeli-

hood function of a sample of size T of [we, v) can be written

                                                T/2           T    -l

Maximizing (13) unconstrainded is equivalent to estimating (4) by least-squares

(to obtain efficient standard errors, one would use Zeliner's unrelated

regression).

        The restrictions implied by equations(ll) and (12) are highly non-

linear. First, consider estimation strategies for the restriction implied

by b = 1.   Sargent (l979b) proposes two alternative estimation strategies.

The first method requires estimating row one of A, equation (4a), by least

squares. Then, the (11+1) St row of A, equation (4b), is calculated using

an iterative procedure. Form a preliminary estimate of A, call if A, by

setting row M + 1 to a row of zeroes, and all other rows to their known (or

consistent) values. Calculate the (M1-l)st row of A, at iteration i + 1, as

            (row M+I)j+1 =
                              dA.+i
                                      = c   A                             (14)


where A. is the estimate of A on the i'th iteration. At each step in

forming A., all rows (except the (M+1)st) are kept equal to the corres-

ponding row of A. If this procedure converges, it will find an A that

satisfies (12). The condition for convergence is that the roots of A be
                                       -22-


less than one in modulus. Since the elements of row 1 are consistently

estimated by least squares, the (M-l-l)st row will be consistently estimated

as a function of the first row of A.

       Define the solution to the iteration on (14) as the (set) function :

                     (y,o) =   (a, )                                          (15)
  maps the a's and 's into a set of y's and 6's that satisfy restriction

(12). Hence, one (consistent) estimator of y, 6 is

       Estimating equation (4), with restriction (11) imposed, is analogous.

As before, begin by estimating the first row of A, equation (4a), by least

squares. An initial guess for b is obtained from Table 1.           Then, the (M+l)st

row of A, equation (4b), is calculated using an iterative procedure. In a

manner similar to before, one can obtain as a solution to the iteration

procedure the set function :                  =   (y,ô).   maps the ct's, 's and b

into a set of y's and 6's that satisfy restriction (11).

       Under the restriction (12) (equivalently (15)), the likelihood

function in (13), L(a, ,        y,   fs),           becomes a function only of the

a's and n's. As Wilson (1973) argues,maximum likelihood estimates with

an unknown V, are obtained by minimizing lvi, with respect to the a's and

n's, where


             lvi =
                               e(a,)e(a,    )'l

and the e(a,), the residuals from (4), are functions of the a's and 's

only, since they were calculated from (4) with (12) (equivalently (15)

imposed.

       A derivative free nonlinear minimization routine can be used to

estimate (2.8) under the restriction (2.16) or (2.15). The IMSL subroutine
                                     -23-

ZXMIN, which uses a quasi-Newton method, was used. Generally, 600 itera-

tions were required to obtain three significant digits. The least squares

estimates of a and     were used as starting values.

       Tables 7-Il report three estimates of equation (4) under various

assumptions for the five currencies vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. The tables

report estimates of the bivariate autoregression (4) unconstrained, the

maximum likelihood estimates that impose (12) (b=l) and the maximum likeli-

hood estimates that impose (13) (b free). Also reported are the ro sums of

the a's, n's, y's and ô's. The likelihood ratio statistic, which is distri-

buted X2(8), and the marginal significance level, which is the probability

that a random variable that is distributed X2(8) attains a value greater

than or equal to the test statistic, are also reported.

       According to the likelihood ratio statistic, the hypothesis is

generally rejected. Only for Germany, with b free, is the marginal signifi-

cance level greater than 0.02. The assumption that
                                                             fJ is stationary
is equivalent to the assumption that the characteristic roots of A are all

less than one in modulus (Sargent (l979a), p. 273). The roots of A were

calculated for all three sets of estimates and all were found to be less

than one in modulus.

       There appears to be a number of regularities that can be found in

these results, some of which may be related to the cause for rejection.

One regularity concerns the sign pattern of the coefficients. In all cases

but two (Canada and the U.K.), the sum of the a.'s and the sum of the ô.'s
                                                  1                          1
are negative, while the sum of the ,.'s and the sum of the         are posi-

tive. Recall that the a.'s   are   the coefficients on lagged St's and the

's are the coefficients on lagged fe's in the s equation, while the y's

are the coefficients on lagged se's and the 5's are the coefficients on

lagged fe's in the t     equation.    In other words, the "own" lagged coeffi-

cients are negative while the "cross" lagged coefficients are positive.

This indicates that if S iS high this period, $ will be lower next period

and f will be higher next period. For the unrestricted estimates, the

sum of the a.'s and 's (the parameters of the 5 equation) and the sum

of the y's and ô's (the parameters of the         equation) are both positive.

This fact, in conjunction with the previous facts, indicate that the

positive "cross" effects dominate the negative "own" effects. However,

when one examines the restricted (b=l) estimates, one observes a difference.
In this case, the sum of the parameters of the s equation is negative,

while the sum of the parameters of the         equation is positive. That is,

for the restricted estimates, the negative "own" effects dominate the

positive "cross" effects for the s equation, but not for the          equation.

Finally, both the sum of the parameters of the         equation decrease in

going from the unrestricted to the restricted estimates.


                              5. Conclusions

       Many studies of the foreign exchange market assume that the market

is efficient. This implies that there are no unexploited profit opportun-

ities. In terms of the foreign exchange market, this means that the f or-

ward rate summarizes all relevant, and available, information about the

future spot rate. If one desires to test such an assumption, one requires

an equilibrium model of pricing in the foreign exchange market which

includes specifying an information set. Consequently, any empirical test

of market efficiency 'is a joint test of market efficiency and the equi-

librium model being used. Therefore, a rejection of the empirical test

may   reflect   a rejection of market efficiency, or a relection of the

model being used, or both.

        The first section of this paper examined the regression

lnS =      a   + blnF + u4. The results were mixed, but generally

favorable. For Canada, Switzerland and the U.K. the hypothesis that

a =   0, b =   1 could not be rejected; for the Netherlands and Germany,

the hypothesis could be rejected. More importantly, for the Netherlands,

Germany and Switzerland, the residuals behaved in a random fashion,

indicating that the forward rate does summarize all available information.

Canada and the U.K., on the other hand, had a significant Q(12) statistic,

indicating a departure from randomness. When the restriction b=l was

imposed, the constant term was insignificantly different from zero and

the residuals behaved in a similar fashion to when b was free.

        The second half of this paper examined a bivariate autoregression

                                           the results were unfavorable. It
for (lnS -
                lnS1,   lnF -   lnF1);
is worth noting that the null hypothesis is a single point in the para-

meter space. Consequently, when this single point is rejected, what

model is to be accepted as an alternative: it takes a model to reject

a model. What was shown is that the model proposed is not compatible

with the data; not that the hypothesis of market efficiency is to be

rejected. What are some, possible reasons for this rejection?

        The reason could be purely econometric: For example, was
                                                                           fJ
a linearly indeterininistiè stationary stochastic process? The simple

evidence indicates that s and         were stationary. However, Section 3

showed that c was not constant over the sample period and so {
                                                                      5'
might not have been stationary: the variance might have changed over
time.
                                     —31—

       The other reason questions the theory used in developing the hypo-

 theses. As Michael Jensen stated, in a slightly different context

 (1978, p. 95): ". .   . as   our econometric sophistication increases, we

 are beginning to find inconsistencies that our cruder data and techniques

missed in the past," and "the eventual resolution of these anomalies will

 result in more precise and more general theories of market efficiency

and equilibrium models of the determination of asset prices under uncer-

tainty" (Jensen 1978, p.96). The theory also relies on the assumption of a
constant risk premium. If the risk premium was not constant--perhaps it

followed some (low order) stochastic process or was a function of other

variables--then the model was misspecified. In addition, Harris and

Purvis (1978) construct a model in which a distinction is drawn between

permanent and transitory shocks. Consider, for example, a permanent

shock such as the oil crisis. People initially interpreted this as a

temporary shock, and only over time was it perceived to be a permanent

shock. It is only over time, while people accumulated new information,

that the exchange rate (gradually) attained its new level. Consequently,

looking at a time series we observe serial correlation.
                                                            However, this
serial correlation simply reflects people eliminating their initial con-

fusion of whether the oil shock was permanent or transitory; it does

not represent irrational behavior.

      Finally, much of the theory is taken directly from the theory of

efficient markets in finance (see Fama 1969). There are a number of

differences that need to be considered. The foreign exchange market is

much less regulated than the U.S. stock market.    However, there is much

more direct government intervention in terms of manipulating exchange
                                   —32—


rates than in the U.S. stock market. Finally, there is a stronger

presumption that the equilibrium stock price is constant than that the

equilibrium exchange rate is constant.

                             Data Appendix

       Five exchange rates (with respect to the dollar) will be examined.

These currencies are (1) the Dutch guilder (the Netherlands), (2) the

German mark, (3) the Canadian dollar, (4) the Swiss franc and (5) the

U.K. pound. The period to be analyzed is April 24, 1973 to May 5, 1977.

The ending date was arbitrary, while the starting date reflected the fact

that there appeared to be a structural change in the international mone-

tary system in March 1973, when the EEC agreement to stabilize the dollar

value of their currencies within a 2.25 percent band was abandoned (see

Frenkel 1978, FrenkelLevich 1977, and Levich 1977 for evidence on this

observation). Weekly observations were obtained (from the International

Monetary Market Yearbook) on bid spot and one month forward rates on the

New York foreign exchange market. Forward rates are (generally) observed

on Tuesdays, while spot rates are observed on Thursdays. The reason for

this staggering of observations is that one month is equal to (approxi-

mately) four weeks and two days. See Hakkio (1979) for a more detailed

description of the data and some summary statistics for the whole period

and its two subperiods.

     Assume that {s,f} is a bivariate, linearly indeterministic,

covariance stationary stochastic process. Therefore, using the Wold decompo-

Therefore, z4 can be expressed as an MA(4) process, by virtue of it being a

5—step ahead predictor. Using (1'), z4 can also be written as


     z         = s        — E              =    (2nS         —E          inS            — (inS         — E         inS

It is reasonable to expect that                        and v are at least contemporaneously

correlated. To determine l' 2'                                    (and hence e, 2' Q3) and 2 one would

normally next calculate the autocovariogram of z4 based on equation (Al) and

equation (A8'); however, v appears in both (A7) and (A8'). Proceeding with

For    equation (A8'), one obtains (assuming v and                                          are only contemporaneously

Equating equations (A9) and (Alo) yields five nonlinear equations in the unknown
parameters               =
                             l'      2' 03 '                  b}       (the set l'                       4} is a

transformation of the three parameters e,            02
  =
      1' 2' a3, a4 1' 2' 3' a av awv}                       .   Therefore, if a solution
exists, and if it is unique, it can be written as


                                         = F(Pk)                                        (All)



      Since z4 is an MA(4) process, one can write z4 =                              where F(L) is
                                                                     '!(L)n÷4   ,



a fourth degree polynomial in L. Assuming 'I'(L) is invertible, and equating (A7)

to 'I(L)n+4, one obtains

                                 a'(L)             ____                                 (2)
                                  (L) W4 + (L) v4
                             -
                             —
                      t+4
where the definitions of a'(L) and '(L) are obvious from (A7). Therefore,

      is an infinite order distributed lag of w+4 and                   One would have preferred

being able to write z as a function solely of the C             in   equation (A1O). In that

case, one could then write          as an infinite order distributed lag of w4 and

       which would provide the desired interpretation of Ct÷4.            However, in light of

equation (A8), this does not seem to be possible.
