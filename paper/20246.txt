                                            ABSTRACT

What contributes to the growing income inequality across U.S. households? We develop an information-
based general equilibrium model that links capital income derived from financial assets to a level of
investor sophistication. Our model implies income inequality between sophisticated and unsophisticated
investors that is growing in investors' aggregate and relative sophistication in the market. We show
that our model is quantitatively consistent with the data from the U.S. market. In addition, we provide
supporting evidence for our mechanism using a unique set of cross-sectional and time-series predictions
on asset ownership and stock turnover.

The rise in wealth and income inequality in the United States and worldwide has been one
of the most hotly discussed topics over the last few decades in policy and academic circles.1
A significant step towards understanding the patterns in the data is the vast empirical and
theoretical literature on wage inequality, skill-biased technological change, and the polar-
ization of the U.S. labor market.2 Less understood thus far has been inequality in capital
income generated in financial markets. An important component of total income, capital
income is by far the most polarized part of household income in the United States, and ex-
hibits a strong upward trend in polarization.3 A growing literature in economics and finance4
analyzes household behavior in financial markets and especially its impact on financial re-
turns. Some of the robust general trends in the behavior are growing non-participation in
high-return investments and a decline in trading activity. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
an ever present and growing disparity in investor sophistication, or investor access to supe-
rior investment technologies, is partly responsible for these trends. An early articulation of
this argument is Arrow (1987) and more recently Piketty (2014); however, micro-founded
treatments of such mechanisms are still missing.
    In this paper, we provide a micro-founded mechanism for the return differential and show
that in a general equilibrium framework, it can go a long way in explaining the growth in
capital income inequality, qualitatively and quantitatively. The main friction in the model
is heterogeneity in investor sophistication. Intuitively, when information about financial
assets and its processing are costly, individuals with different access to financial resources
differ in terms of their capacity to acquire and process information. Sophisticated investors
have access to better information, which allows them to earn higher income on the assets
they hold. In addition, unsophisticated investors perceive their information disadvantage
through asset prices and allocate their investments away from the allocations of informed
investors. As a result, sophisticated investors earn higher returns on their wealth, and over
time their capital income diverges from that of unsophisticated investors with relatively less
information.
    This basic intuition resonates well with robust empirical evidence that documents the
growing presence of sophisticated, institutional investors in risky asset classes, over the last
20-30 years (Gompers and Metrick (2001)). Specifically, the average institutional equity
ownership has more than doubled over the last few decades, and it accounts now for more
than 60% of the total stock ownership. Our hypothesis also fits well with a puzzling phe-
nomenon of the last two decades of a growing retrenchment of retail investors from trading

Perspectives and in Piketty (2014).

      Using the data from the Survey of Consumer Finances we document that approximately 25% of house-
holds actively participate in financial markets. Capital income accounts for approximately 15% of this
group’s total income, ranging from 40% to less than 1%. Between 1989 and 2010, the ratio of the capital
income of the group in the 90th percentile of the wealth distribution relative to that of the median group
increased from 27 to 60.

and stock market ownership in general (Stambaugh (2014)),5 even though direct transaction
costs, if anything, have fallen significantly. We document such avoidance of risky assets
both for direct stock ownership and ownership of intermediated products, such as actively
managed equity mutual funds. Specifically, we find that direct stock ownership has been
falling steadily over the last 30 years, while flows into equity mutual funds coming from
less sophisticated, retail investors began to decline and turn negative starting from the early
2000s, implying a drop in cumulative flows by 2012 by an astounding 70% of their 2000
levels.
    To formalize our arguments and to assess their qualitative and quantitative match to the
data, we build a noisy rational expectations equilibrium model with endogenous information
acquisition and capacity constraints in the spirit of Sims (2003). We generalize this theo-
retical framework by accounting for meaningful heterogeneity both across assets and across
investors. Specifically, we consider an economy with many risky assets and one riskless as-
set. The risky assets differ in terms of volatilities of their fundamental shocks. A fraction
of investors are endowed with high capacity for processing information and the remaining
fraction have lower, yet positive capacity. Thus, everyone in the economy has the ability to
learn about assets payoffs, but to different degrees. Investors have mean-variance preferences
with equal risk aversion coefficients and learn about assets payoffs from optimal private sig-
nals. Based on their capacity and the observed assets characteristics, investors decide which
assets to learn about, how much information to process about these assets, and how much
wealth to invest.
    In a departure from existing work, both the number of assets that are actively traded (i.e.,
learned about) in the market, and the mass of investors choosing to learn about each asset
are determined endogenously. In equilibrium, learning exhibits specialization, preference
for volatility and liquidity, and strategic substitutability. First, each investor will choose to
invest all their capacity into learning about one asset, while trading the other assets in their
portfolio based only on their priors. The aggregate learning strategy, however, will have
an interior solution for the number and types of assets that are learned about. Second, in
the aggregate, investors will prefer to learn about assets with highly volatile payoffs or high
average supply–that is where the gains from spending information capacity are the greatest,
ceteris paribus. Third, the gains from learning about an asset will decrease with the number
of investors already learning about it thus making investors prefer stocks that are relatively
less explored.
    We provide an analytical characterization of the model’s predictions, which we then
quantify in the parameterized model. First, in the cross-section of investors, sophisticated
investors generate higher returns and capital income relative to unsophisticated investors.
This divergence in returns and incomes is driven by two forces: (i) sophisticated investors
have better information to identify profitable assets, and (ii) unsophisticated investors reduce
their exposure to assets held by sophisticated investors because, through the increase in
   5
     We view the Stambaugh (2014) study as complementary to ours. It aims to explain the decreasing
profit margins and activeness of active equity mutual funds using exogenously specified decline in individual
investors’ stock market participation. In contrast, our study endogenizes such decreasing participation as
part of the mechanism which explains income inequality.


                                                     2
prices, they find these assets less compelling to hold. The latter effect is a direct consequence
of general equilibrium forces and would not hold under partial equilibrium.
    The second set of analytical predictions investigates the response of our outcome variables
to shocks to sophistication, which in our framework are modeled as shocks to information
capacity. Specifically, the sophisticated ownership increases with the overall growth in aggre-
gate market sophistication, which can be also understood as general progress in information-
processing technologies. This result holds even if we keep the relative sophistication of the
two investor types constant. The intuition for this result is that in our economy, the more an
investor knows, the easier it is for her to learn on the margin. This effect reinforces the gen-
eral equilibrium effect that the same growth in sophisticated investors’ capacity raises prices
more than that of unsophisticated investors’ and leads to unsophisticated investors being
priced out of the risky asset market. We also characterize the effect on the growth of income
inequality of a relative increase in sophistication between sophisticated and unsophisticated
investors holding the total degree of market sophistication constant.
    Finally, to provide identification of the proposed mechanism, we develop a set of addi-
tional analytical predictions. Specifically, we characterize responses to aggregate and relative
sophistication shocks for market values, cross-asset exposure, and trading intensity. We show
that sophisticated investors are more likely to invest in and learn about more volatile assets
within a set of risky assets. Moreover, the mechanism implies a robust, unique way in which
investors expand their risky portfolio holdings as the total capacity in the economy expands.
In particular, they keep moving down in the asset volatility dimension. At the same time,
unsophisticated investors abandon risky assets and hold safer assets. Similar effects occur
in terms of trading intensity. Sophisticated investors frequently trade their assets while un-
sophisticated investors turn over their risky assets much less. Finally, we show that the
symmetric expansion in capacity leads to lower expected market returns. These results play
an important role in that they cut against plausible alternative explanations, such as the
model with heterogeneous risk aversion or differences in trading costs.
    To evaluate the quantitative fit of our theoretical predictions to the data, we calibrate
the model using U.S. data spanning the period from 1989 to 2012. We parameterize the
model using micro data on stocks and aggregate retail and institutional portfolios, which
allows us to pin down details of the stochastic structure of assets payoffs. In the benchmark
calibration, we set the parameters based on the first half of our sample period, and treat
the second subperiod data moments as a test for the dynamic effect coming from progress
in information technology. Specifically, in order to generate the dynamic predictions of the
model, we introduce aggregate (not investor-specific) progress in information technology,
which increases the average equity ownership rate of sophisticated investors from 23% (the
data average for 1989-2000) to 43% (the data average for 2001-2012), while keeping the
remaining parameters unchanged.
    We show that the analytical predictions from the model are qualitatively and quanti-
tatively borne out in the empirical evidence. First, for the benchmark parametrization,
sophisticated investors, on average, exhibit higher rates of returns that are approximately
2.7 percentage points per year higher in the model, compared to a 3 percentage point dif-
ference in the data. Hence, the model not only delivers return inequality qualitatively but


                                               3
also quantitatively. As an additional unique feature of our mechanism, the model predicts
that cross-sectional asset turnover is monotonically increasing with asset return volatility
and with the ownership share of sophisticated investors, both results being consistent with
the data. Second, we show that the dynamic predictions further confirm our economic mech-
anism. In response to symmetric growth in technology, sophisticated investors increase their
ownership of equities by first entering the most volatile stocks and subsequently moving into
stocks with medium and low volatility–a pattern we also document in the data. At the same
time, sophisticated investors’ entry into equity induces higher asset turnover, in magnitudes
consistent with the data, both in the time series and in the cross-section of stocks.
    Our benchmark results point to quantitatively significant effects of heterogeneity in in-
vestor sophistication on rates of return. In a final quantitative experiment in the model,
we explore the potential consequences of information capacity heterogeneity by linking it to
wealth and returns on financial assets. Intuitively, a high fixed cost and low marginal cost
of access to information would endogenously lead to wealthier individuals obtaining better
access to information, along the lines outlined in Arrow (1987). Here, we take this as a
guiding principle in mapping the investors in our model into different wealth deciles in the
Survey of Consumer Finances. Specifically, in the population of households who participate
in asset markets, we use the ratio of average financial wealth of the 10% wealthiest investors
relative to 50% poorest investors in 1989 as a proxy for initial relative investor sophistica-
tion, and posit that the growth in financial wealth maps directly into growth in investors’
sophistication. We then show that introducing this feedback in our model generates endoge-
nous evolution of capacity and capital income that can match very accurately capital income
inequality growth in the data. The model implies the average inequality growth of 107%
between 1989 and 2010, whereas the same number in the data equals 90%. Moreover, we
can closely match the evolution of the growth rate over the entire sample period. We con-
clude that from the perspective of our model, wealth is a good proxy for sophistication, and
hence this exercise can be viewed as a quantification of the economic mechanism proposed by
Arrow (1987), in which financial wealth facilitates access to more sophisticated investment
techniques, and begets even more wealth. This result is also consistent with evidence in
Chapter 12 of Piketty (2014) in which he attributes differences in portfolio returns among
University endowments to differences in their investment levels.
    In addition to our quantitative analysis, we provide a discussion of general empirical
regularities which qualitatively correspond to the analytical predictions of the model. We
show that unsophisticated investors tend to hold an increasingly larger fraction of their wealth
in safer, liquid assets. They have also tended to reduce their aggregate equity ownership.
In the data, we observe a steady outflow of unsophisticated, retail money from risky assets,
such as direct equity and equity mutual funds, while the flows from sophisticated investors
into such assets are generally positive. Somewhat surprisingly, these outflows in the data
continued until recently despite a large increase in the risky assets valuations.
    This paper spans three strands of literature: (1) the literature on household finance; (2)
the literature on rational inattention; and (3) the literature on income inequality. While
some of our contributions are specific to each of the individual streams, our additional value
added comes from the fact that we integrate the streams into one unified framework within


                                               4
our research context.
    Our results relate to a wide spectrum of research in household finance and portfolio
choice. The main ideas we develop build upon an empirical work on limited capital market
participation (Mankiw and Zeldes (1991); Ameriks and Zeldes (2001)), growing institutional
ownership (Gompers and Metrick (2001)), household trading decisions (Barber and Odean
(2001), Campbell (2006), Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009b, 2009a), Guiso and Sodini
(2012)), and investor sophistication (Barber and Odean (2000, 2009), Calvet, Campbell, and
Sodini (2007), Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Linnainmaa (2009)). While the majority of the
studies attribute limited participation rates to either differences in stock market participation
costs (Gomes and Michaelides (2005), Favilukis (2013)) or preferences, we relate the decisions
to differences in sophistication across investors.
    Another building block of our paper is the literature on rational inattention and en-
dogenous information capacity that originates with the papers of Sims (1998, 2003, 2006).
More germane to our application are models of costly information of Van Nieuwerburgh and
Veldkamp (2009, 2010), Mondria (2010), and Kacperczyk, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Veld-
kamp (2013). The literature on endogenous information acquisition generally assumes that
informed investors have homogenous information capacity, face a homogeneous set of risky
assets, or learn about a single asset in the aggregate. In contrast, we study the implications
of a model with heterogeneous agents in an environment with many heterogeneous assets,
and we solve for the endogenous allocation of investor types across assets types. We show
that the implications of such a model for portfolio decisions and asset prices are very dif-
ferent than those of the model with homogeneity. In addition, we study the quantitative
implications of information frictions for income processes of investors and the equilibrium
holdings of assets with different characteristics, such as volatility or turnover, all features
which are absent in the present literature.
    Our last building block constitutes the literature on income inequality that dates back
to the seminal work by Kuznets and Jenks (1953) and has been subsequently advanced by
the work of Piketty (2003), Piketty and Saez (2003), Alvaredo, Atkinson, Piketty, Saez,
et al. (2013), Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2006), and Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez (2011).
In contrast to our paper, a vast majority of that literature explain total income inequality
looking at the income earned in labor market (e.g., Acemoglu (1999, 2002); Katz and Autor
(1999); Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2006, 2008); and Autor and Dorn (2013)); and they do
not consider explanations that relate to informational sophistication of investors.
    The closest paper in spirit to ours is Arrow (1987) who also considers information differ-
ences as an explanation of income gap. However, his work does not consider heterogeneity
across assets or investors and does not attempt a quantitative evaluation of the strength
of the forces in general equilibrium. Both these elements are crucial for the results of our
paper, and especially to establish the validity of our mechanism. Thanks to having a richer,
equilibrium framework, we are able to parameterize the model and show that it comes very
close to the data moments. Another work related to ours is Peress (2004) who examines
the role that wealth and decreasing absolute risk aversion play in investors’ acquisition of
information and participation in risky assets. In contrast to that paper, we focus on micro
foundations of how investors attain superior rates of return on equity. In addition, we model


                                               5
how different investors allocate their money across disaggregated risky asset classes. This
allows us to test our information-based mechanism using micro-level data.
    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 1, we provide the general equilibrium
framework to study behavior and income evolution of heterogeneously informed individuals.
In Section 2, we derive analytical predictions, which we subsequently take to the data.
In Section 3, we establish our main results and provide additional evidence in favor of
our proposed mechanism. Section 4 concludes. All the proofs and derivations are in the
Appendix.


1     Theoretical Framework
   We study portfolio decisions with endogenous information a la Grossman and Stiglitz
(1980). We first describe the investment environment. Next, we present investors’ portfolio
and information choice problems. Finally, we characterize the equilibrium and its properties.

1.1    Model Setup
    The financial market consists of one riskless asset, with price normalized to 1 and payoff
r, and n risky assets, indexed by i, with prices pi , and independent payoffs zi ∼ N (z i , σi2 ).
The riskless asset is assumed to be in unlimited supply, and each risky asset is available in
                                  2
stochastic supply xi ∼ N (xi , σxi  ), independent of payoffs and across assets.
    Assets are traded by a continuum of atomless investors of mass one, indexed by j, with
mean-variance utility over wealth Wj , and risk aversion coefficient ρ > 0. Prior to making
their portfolio allocations, each investor can choose to obtain information about some or all of
the risky assets payoffs. Information is obtained in the form of endogenously designed signals,
which are then used to update the beliefs that inform the investor’s portfolio allocation. The
investor’s signal choice is modeled following the rational inattention literature (Sims (2003)),
using entropy reduction as a measure of the amount of acquired information. Each investor
is modeled as though receiving information through a channel with fixed capacity.
    In our modeling, we make two departures from existing work. First, we assume that all
investors in the economy have the ability to learn about assets payoffs, but to different de-
grees. Specifically, mass λ ∈ (0, 1) of investors have high capacity for processing information,
K1 , and are referred to as sophisticated investors, and mass 1 − λ of investors have low ca-
pacity for processing information, K2 , and are referred to as unsophisticated investors, with
0 < K2 < K1 < ∞. Second, we model multiple risky assets which are heterogeneous with re-
spect to fundamental volatility σi , which means our model will have non-trivial implications
for the allocations of information and portolios across assets.
    Each decision period is split into two subperiods. In the first subperiod, investors solve
the information acquisition problem. In the second subperiod, shocks are realized, investors
receive signals in accordance with their information acquisition strategy, and they choose
their portfolio allocations.

1.2    Portfolio Decision
  We begin by solving each investor’s portfolio problem in subperiod 2, for a given infor-
mation structure. Each investor chooses portfolio holdings to solve

where E2j and V2j denote the mean and variance conditional on investor j’s information set

investor j in asset i.

where µ bji and σbji are the mean and variance of investor j’s posterior beliefs about the payoff

about a particular asset, then the investor’s beliefs—and hence her portfolio holdings—for
that asset’s payoff are determined by her prior, which coincides with the unconditional
distribution of payoffs.

1.3    Information Choice
    In subperiod 1, each investor obtains information about assets payoffs in the form of sig-
nals, which are then used to update the beliefs that inform the investor’s portfolio allocation.
The investor chooses the allocation of information capacity across the different assets—the
distribution of the signals—optimally, to maximize her ex-ante expected utility,

    Each investor j receives a separate signal sji on each of the asset payoffs, zi . It is
important to note that we do not impose that all of these signals are informative. For
analytical tractability, we make the following assumption about the signal structure:

Assumption 1 The signals sji are independent across assets.6

Assumption 1 implies that the total quantity of information obtained by an investor can be
expressed as a sum of the quantities of information obtained for each asset. The information
constraint then becomes
                                            n
                                            X
                                                   I (zi ; sji ) ≤ Kj ,                                     (8)
                                             i=1

where I (zi ; sji ) measures the information about the asset payoff zi conveyed by the private
signal sji .
    The information constraint (8) imposes a limit on the amount of entropy reduction that
each investor can accomplish through the endogenously designed signal structure. Since
perfect information requires infinite capacity, each investor compresses the payoff into a sim-
pler representation, and hence necessarily faces some residual uncertainty about the realized
payoffs. For each asset, investor j decomposes the payoff zi into a lower-entropy signal
component, sji , and a residual component, δji , that represents information lost due to the
compression of the random variable:7

                                               zi = sji + δji .                                             (9)
   6
      This assumption is common in the literature. It is necessary for the analytical tractability of the model.
Allowing for potentially correlated signals requires a numerical approach, and is beyond the scope of this
paper.
    7
      The literature on costly information often assumes an additive noise signal structure, where the signal
is equal to the payoff plus noise. That specification has enabled a direct comparison to the literature on
exogenous information. However, in the context of limited capacity, investors compress, or simplify the state
of the world (in terms of entropy), rather than amplify it with noise. This formulation of the state as a
decomposition into the signal and data loss is conceptually closer to the information theoretic framework
that underpins rational inattention, but it does not affect the results in this particular application. For
applications in which such compression is critical to obtaining the correct optimal signal structure, see the
work by Matějka (2011), Matějka and Sims (2011), and Stevens (2012).



                                                         8
    For analytical tractability, we introduce the following additional assumption on the signal
structure:

Assumption 2 The signal sji is independent of the data loss δji .8

    Since zi is normally distributed, assumption 2 implies that sji and δji are also normally
distributed, by Cramer’s Theorem:
                             2                     2
                                                         with σi2 = σsji
                                                                       2      2
                                                      
              sji ∼ N z i , σsji   and δji ∼ N 0, σδji                    + σδji .

Therefore, an investor’s posterior beliefs are also normally distributed random variables,
independent across assets, with mean and variance given by:
                                                           2    2
                                      µ
                                      bji = sji      and σ
                                                         bji = σδji .                                   (10)

A perfectly precise signal would be associated with no information loss, such that the variance
of the data loss, and hence the investor’s posterior uncertainty, would be zero. Conversely,
a completely uninformative signal would result in the investor’s posterior uncertainty being
equal to her prior uncertainty, σi2 .
    Using the signal structure and the implied ex-ante distribution of expected excess returns,
                                                                             2
the investor’s objective becomes choosing the variance of the data loss, σδji  , for each asset
i, to solve the following constrained optimization problem:

is the component of the ex-ante variance of expected excess returns that is common across
investors. The distribution of excess returns and the information constraint in equation (12)
are derived in the Appendix.

      The decomposition of the shock into independent components is optimal if the agent’s signaling problem
is to minimize the mean squared error of si for each i, (see, for example, Cover and Thomas (2006)). However,
in general, the optimal signal structure may require correlation between the signal and the data loss (such
correlation may result in a higher posterior precision about asset payoffs). We assume the independent
decomposition to maintain analytical tractability.

   The following proposition presents the solution to the information capacity allocation
problem of each investor.
Proposition 1 In the solution to the maximization problem (11)-(14), each investor allo-
cates her entire capacity to learning about a single asset. All assets that are actively traded
(that is, learned about in equilibrium) belong to the set L of assets with maximal expected
utility gains:                         n                  o
                                   L ≡ i | i ∈ arg max Gi ,                                (15)
                                                      i

where the expected gain of asset i to the agent’s utility is

                                               Sbi + R bi2
                                         Gi ≡              .                              (16)
                                                   σi2
    The linear objective function and the convex constraint imply a corner solution for the
individual allocation of attention: each investor specializes, learning about one asset within
the set of assets with maximal gains. Equilibrium conditions will then determine the set
of assets L, as well as the mass of investors learning about each of the assets in the set L.
Both the set of actively traded assets and the mass of investors learning about each asset
are determined so as to equate the maximum gains from learning Gi , across all assets that
are actively traded.
    Using Proposition 1, and substituting the optimal capacity allocation in equation (12),
we characterize the posterior beliefs of investor j learning about asset lj ∈ L by:
                       (                                    (
                         sji if i = lj ,            2        e−2Kj σi2 if i = lj ,
                 µ
                 bji =                      and σ  bji =                            .     (17)
                         zi    if i 6= lj ,                  σi2       if i 6= lj .

Investors’ posterior beliefs about payoffs are equal to their prior beliefs, for assets which they
passively trade. On the other hand, for assets about which they learn, the posterior variance
is strictly lower, and it is decreasing in capacity Kj , whereas the posterior mean is equal to
the received signal. Conditional on the realized payoff, the signal sji received by investor j
about the actively traded asset i is a normally distributed random variable whose mean is a
weighted average of the true realization, zi , and the prior, z i ,

                              E (sji |zi ) = 1 − e−2Kj zi + e−2Kj z i .
                                                      


The higher is the capacity of an investor, the larger is the weight that the expected private
signal puts on the realized payoff zi relative to the investor’s prior, z i .

λmi ≥ 0, of sophisticated investors who choose to learn about asset i, and M2i denotes the

i.9
    Following Admati (1985), we conjecture and verify that the equilibrium asset prices are
linear functions of the underlying shocks. The following proposition presents the solution
for equilibrium prices given the investors’ individual allocation of capacity.

Proposition 2 The price of asset i is given by

                                            pi = ai + bi zi − ci xi ,                                       (19)

                      ai =           , bi =              , ci =              ,         (20)

where φ ≡ λ e2K1 − 1 + (1 − λ) e2K2 − 1 is a measure of the total capacity for processing
information available in the market, and mi is the mass of investors learning about asset i.

    The price of an asset reflects the asset’s payoff only if at least some investors dedicate
capacity to learning about this asset through private signals, such that mi > 0. Conversely,
for assets that are not learned about, the price only reflects the noisy supply, xi .
    Using the solution for equilibrium prices, the expected utility gain for each asset becomes

                                                       1 + ρ2 ξi
                                              Gi =               ,                                          (21)
                                                     (1 + φmi )2
                  2
where ξi ≡ σi2 (σxi + x2i ) is a term summarizing the properties of asset i. Equation (21)
implies the following comparative statics:
                                     ∂Gi           ∂Gi           ∂Gi
                                         > 0,          ≤ 0,          ≥ 0.
                                     ∂ξi           ∂mi           ∂φ

Hence, learning in the model exhibits preference for volatility and liquidity (high ξi ) and
strategic substitutability (low mi ). For assets that are learned about, the value of learning
about an asset also falls with φ, the aggregate amount of information in the market. As a
result, as the market’s capacity for processing information increases, investors in the aggre-
gate expand to learning about more and more assets, even though each individual investor
remains specialized to learning about a single asset.
    We next determine which assets are learned about in equilibrium, and we solve endoge-
nously for mi , the mass of investors learning about each asset. This represents a departure
from existing work which assumes that all investors learn either about a single asset or
    9
      Since the gains from learning are the same across all investors, regardless of investor type, the participa-
tion of sophisticated and unsophisticated investors in learning about a particular asset will be proportional
to their mass in the population.


                                                       11
about all assets, in equal proportion. For sufficiently large information capacity, we obtain
an interior solution (namely, multiple assets are learned about in the aggregate) from the
aggregation of the individual corner solutions.
    Given the aggregate allocation of attention, the quantity (φmi ) represents the amount of
capacity that the market allocates to learning about asset i in equilibrium. The following
proposition determines the set of assets that are learned about and the allocation of investor
learning across assets.

Proposition 3 Without loss of generality, let assets in the economy be ordered such that for
all i ∈ {1, ..., n − 1}, ξi > ξi+1 . The set L of assets that are learned about and the allocation
of investor learning across assets, {mi }ni=1 , are determined by the following conditions:
    (i) There exists a threshold φ1 > 0 such that for φ < φ1 , only one asset is learned about
in equilibrium: m1 = 1 and mi = 0 for all i > 1, where
                                              s
                                                1 + ρ2 ξ1
                                        φ1 ≡              − 1.                                (22)
                                                1 + ρ2 ξ2

   (ii) For aggregate capacity φ ≥ φ1 , at least two assets are learned about in equilibrium.
The equilibrium masses satisfy

                                            |L|

                                            i=1

and mi = 0, ∀i ∈ {|L| + 1, ..., n} .
   (iii) Let h index an asset that is not learned about (mh = 0). Then

                                        1 + ρ2 ξ1
                        1 + ρ2 ξh <               , ∀h ∈ {|L| + 1, ..., n}                   (25)
                                      (1 + φm1 )2

    The selection of investors into learning about different assets is pinned down by the
|L| − 1 indifference conditions (23), combined with the condition that each investor learns
about some asset, (24). The allocation of investors’ masses is determined only by exogenous
variables: {ξi }ni=1 , ρ, and φ. In turn, the solution for {mi }ni=1 pins down equilibrium prices,
by Proposition 2, thereby completing the equilibrium solution.
    The market learns about assets in decreasing order of ξi . As the overall capacity in
the economy increases investors expand their learning towards lower volatility assets. The
aggregate amount of information capacity may not be high enough to enable the allocation of
capacity to the lowest volatility assets, such that in equilibrium not all assets are necessarily
learned about. Furthermore, it can be easily seen that mi > mi+1 for all i ∈ {1, ..., |L|}.
Since the expected utility gain is increasing in ξi and decreasing in mi , the mass of investors

                                                  12
learning about each assets is decreasing in ξi , in order to ensure that the gains are equated
across all assets that are learned about.
    In order to further characterize learning in the economy, we introduce the following
notation:

Definition 1 Let φk be a threshold for φ, such that for any φ < φk , at most k assets are
actively traded (learned about) in equilibrium, while for φ ≥ φk , at least k + 1 assets are
actively traded in equilibrium.

    Using the above definition, Proposition 3 implies that the threshold values of aggregate
information capacity are monotonic: 0 < φ1 < φ2 < ... < φn . The following proposition
further characterizes the solution to the aggregate allocation of investors to learning about
different assets:

Proposition 4 Suppose that φk−1 ≤ φ < φk , such that k assets are actively traded in
equilibrium, with 1 < k ≤ n. Then, the equilibrium allocation of active investors across
assets, {mi }ni=1 , satisfies the following conditions:
    (i) There exists a threshold asset ı̄ < k, such that for all assets i ∈ {1, ..., ı̄}, the mass mi
is decreasing in φ, and for all assets i ∈ {ı̄ + 1, ..., k}, the mass mi is increasing in φ.
    (ii) For all assets i ∈ {1, ..., k}, the quantity (φmi ), the aggregate capacity that the market
allocates to learning about asset i, is increasing in φ.
    (iii) For all assets i ∈ {1, ..., k}, the quantity mi (e2Kj −1), the aggregate capacity allocated
to learning about asset i by investor group j ∈ {1, 2}, is increasing in Kj at an increasing
rate.

    Proposition 4 shows that as the amount of aggregate capacity φ increases, the amount of
capacity allocated to each asset (φmi ) strictly increases for all assets that are learned about
(part (ii )), even though the mass mi of investors learning about the most volatile assets
decreases, so that investors shift to new assets to be learned about (part (i )). Furthermore,
the amount of capacity allocated to each asset by each investor group (mi (e2Kj − 1)) also
increases, but it increases by more for the group of sophisticated investors, who have higher
capacity (part (iii )). In Section 2, we use this proposition to derive analytical predictions on
the patterns of investment by investor type, in response to both cross-sectional dispersion
and symmetric growth of capacity.

1.5    The Value of Prices
    We have presented each investor’s information acquisition problem in terms of a constraint
on the information obtained through private signals alone, disregarding the information
content of prices. However, when some agents in the economy acquire information through
private signals, prices become informative about asset payoffs. In the literature on portfolio
choice with exogenous imperfect information, investors are often assumed to learn about
payoffs not only from their exogenously given private signals but also from equilibrium
prices, which aggregate the information of all investors in the market (e.g. Admati (1985)).

                                                 13
Hence, we now ask: would the investors in our model have an incentive to allocate capacity
to learning from prices rather than only from their own private signals? We show that the
answer to this question is no: if costly to process, prices are an inferior source of information
when the investor has the opportunity to observe endogenously designed signals on the
payoffs themselves.

Proposition 5 The rationally inattentive investor chooses to devote all her capacity to
learning about payoffs through private signals on asset payoffs, rather than devoting any
capacity to learning from prices.

    The investor weakly prefers learning through the private signal as long as the objective
function does not exhibit strategic complementarities. She strictly prefers learning through
the private signal in the presence of strategic substitutability, which corresponds to the model
in this paper.
    To prove this result, we consider the signal choice of an individual investor, taking the
choices of all other investors as given by the solution in the previous subsection. Processing
information through either prices or private signals consumes the investor’s capacity. Hence,
whatever the source of information, the investor cannot acquire a total quantity beyond
her capacity limit, Kj . We outline the proof below, leaving the algebraic details for the
Appendix.

Case A. As a first case, we consider the setting in which the investor cannot process prices
without error. This case is consistent with the information theory paradigm, in which any
continuous random variable cannot be perfectly processed. In this case, the investor can
obtain information about payoffs through two signals: a signal sji on the payoff directly, and
a signal spji on the price. The price signal will be a compressed representation of the price, a
result of decomposing the price into the part that is processed by the investor and the part
that is lost in the compression:
                                          pi = spji + εji .                                (26)
Using the same two independence assumptions          that were     used in setting up the private
signal, we have that spji ∼ N pi , σspji
                                    2
                                                        2

                                           , εji ∼ N 0, σεji   , and σpi = σspji + σεji .
    Suppose that the investor allocates capacity to learning the price of asset i. The amount
of capacity that is consumed by the price signal is given by the mutual information between
the signal and the random variable on which it is designed:
                                                       2 
                                            p

                                                  2     σεji

However, the quantity of information about the payoff of asset i that is obtained via this
signal is                                                     

where bi and ci are the coefficients of the equilibrium price level, determined in Proposition 2.
   For any positive level of capacity allocated to the price signal, the amount of information
about the payoff itself is strictly lower,

                                      I zi ; spji < I pi ; spji .
                                                              
                                                                                             (29)

The price signal is a linear combination of both the payoff and the stochastic supply. Hence,
it is an indirect and “garbled” signal on the payoff. By allocating capacity to the price signal,
the investor uses up capacity on superfluous information that is irrelevant to her decision
(since her decision depends only on her beliefs about payoffs). This inequality in turn implies
that, compared with the private signal sji , the price signal spji provides an inefficient use of
capacity:
                                     I zi ; spji < I (zi ; sji ) .
                                                
                                                                                             (30)
As a result, if the investor must compress the price into a simpler price signal, learning from
this price signal is an inferior use of capacity compared with learning from the private signal
that is designed to provide information directly on the payoff.

Case B. As an alternative case, we suppose that the price itself is a potential signal for
the investor, and moreover, we suppose that it is, in principle, a perfectly observed public
signal, with no idiosyncratic error. Nevertheless, the price signal is not free: we maintain
the assumption that any piece of information consumes the investor’s capacity. While in
principle inconsistent with information theory (since the price is after all just another random
variable), the perfect observability assumption may be more intuitive, and it also allows us
to draw a closer comparison to the literature on exogenous information.
    The capacity cost of the price is equal to the mutual information between the price and
the asset payoff, which, using equilibrium prices, is given by
                                                "             2 #

                              I (zi ; pi ) = log 1 +                .                        (31)
                                            2          ρσi σxi

Note that this quantity is determined in equilibrium and the individual investor cannot
control how much information prices convey about payoffs. If no other investor is learning
through their private signals about this asset, then mi = 0 and I (zi ; pi ) = 0, making the
price irrelevant for the inference regarding payoffs. Hence, a first requirement is to focus
on assets for which other investors are allocating at least some capacity to learning through
private signals, such that I (zi ; pi ) > 0. In this case, the investor could learn about payoffs
from both the price and her own private signal, depending on the magnitude of I (zi ; pi )
relative to the investor’s capacity, Kj . If the information content of the price of an asset
exceeds the investor’s capacity, then the investor cannot perfectly observe the price. Rather,
the investor would have to design a signal on the price. But as shown in Case A, any capacity
spent on compressing the price into a lower entropy signal would be inefficiently used. Hence,
a second requirement is to focus on assets for which the capacity cost of the price does not
exceed the investor’s capacity, I (zi ; pi ) ≤ Kj .

                                               15
    We next demonstrate that the investor’s ex-ante expected utility is higher when allocating
all her capacity to learning from private signals than when allocating at least a portion of her
capacity to learning from prices, owing to strategic substitutability. The investor’s objective
is to maximize                                                    !

    Suppose that the investor uses capacity to learn from pi , and let posterior beliefs about
zi conditional on pi be denoted by yi . Then, the investor designs a signal conditional on the
information obtained from the price,

where we maintain the same two independence assumptions that were used in setting up
the private signal in the absence of learning from the price. Under this signal structure, the
ex-ante mean is the same, regardless of whether the investor learns from pi or not:

                                                                          eji                                        (37)

otherwise, where we have used the fact that the information constraint implies that the
                                                    2
investor’s posterior variance, here denoted by σ   eji , is the same in both cases. Both cases
imply a corner solution, with the investor allocating all capacity to learning about a single
asset. The remaining question is: will the investor allocate any capacity to learning from
the price, or will she use all capacity on the private signal? It can be easily seen that for any
positive level of capacity allocated to the price signal,

                                                       Vji > Veji .                                                  (38)



                                                               16
Hence, the investor’s ex-ante utility is lower when she devotes any positive amount of capacity
to learning from prices. Learning from prices increases the covariance between the investor’s
posterior beliefs and equilibrium prices, thereby reducing the investor’s excess returns. This
case is similar to that of Kacperczyk, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp (2013), who show
that prices are an inferior source of information in a portfolio choice model with an additive
constraint on the sum of signal precisions.
    Hence, regardless of the informativeness of prices relative to the investor’s capacity, the
investor is always better off learning through signals that provide information directly on
the payoffs. In our framework prices lose their special role as publicly available signals.10


2        Analytical Predictions
   In this section, we present a set of analytical results implied by our model. We first present
the predictions for capital income inequality followed by a set of theoretical predictions that
are specific to the information-based mechanism. These results allow us to compare the
model’s implications with evidence from stock-level micro data.

2.1      Capital Income Inequality
   Let πji denote the average profit per capita for an investor of type j ∈ {1, 2} , from
trading asset i:
                              Q1i (zi − rpi )               Q2i (zi − rpi )
                        π1i ≡                   and π2i ≡                   ,              (39)
                                     λ                          1−λ
where Q1i and Q2i are the aggregate holdings of asset i for sophisticated and unsophisticated
investors, respectively, obtained by integrating holdings qji across investors of each type:
                                "                                       #
                                  (z i − rpi ) + mi e2K1 − 1 (zi − rpi )
                       Q1i = λ                                              ,              (40)
                                                    ρσi2

and                                    "                                  #
                                    (z i − rpi ) + mi e2K2 − 1 (zi − rpi )
                      Q2i = (1 − λ)                                          .                           (41)
                                                      ρσi2
   Our first result is that heterogeneity in information capacity across investors drives capital
income inequality as sophisticated investors generate higher income than unsophisticated
ones. This is summarized in Proposition 6.
                                    P          P
Proposition 6 If K1 > K2 then i π1i − i π2i > 0.
    10
     In practice, it may be the case that individual investors are more constrained in their choice of signals
as modeled here. For instance, it may be the case that the relatively unsophisticated investor is restricted
to processing information about payoffs only through publicly available signals, or that she cannot design
signals on the payoffs themselves that are as precise as her capacity constraint would allow them to be. This
would introduce a degree of unlearnability for asset payoffs, which may make publicly available signals, such
as equilibrium prices, more valuable. This assumption may be an interesting avenue for future work.


                                                     17
    The informational advantage manifests itself in two ways. First, sophisticated investors
achieve relatively higher profits by holding a different average portfolio (the average effect).
Second, they also achieve relatively higher profits by obtaining larger gains from shock real-
izations that are profitable relative to expectations, and incurring smaller losses on unprof-
itable shock realizations (the dynamic effect). These two effects show up in the average level
and in the adjustment of holdings in response to shocks, and are summarized in Propositions
7 and 8.

Proposition 7 (Average Effect) Let K1 > K2 and φk−1 ≤ φ < φk , such that the first
k > 1 assets are actively traded
                              n in equilibrium.
                                          o      The following statements hold:
   (i) For i ∈ {1, ..., k}, E λ − (1−λ) > 0, and for i ∈ {k + 1, ..., n}, Qλ1it − (1−λ)
                               Q1it Q2it                                           Q2it
                                                                                        = 0.
   (ii) Suppose that xi = x and σnxi = σx foroall i. nFor any twooassets i, l ∈ {1, ..., k}, if
                                            Q2i
E(zi − rpi ) > E(zl − rpl ), then E Qλ1i − (1−λ)  > E Qλ1l − (1−λ)
                                                               Q2l
                                                                    .

    Proposition 7 demonstrates that sophisticated investors choose higher average holdings of
risky assets (part (i)), and that on average, they also tilt their portfolios towards profitable
assets more than unsophisticated investors do (part (ii)).

Proposition 8 (Dynamic Effect) Let K1 > K2 and φk−1 < φ < φk , such that the first
k > 1 assets are actively traded in equilibrium. For i ∈ {1, ..., k}, Qλ1i − (1−λ)
                                                                              Q2i
                                                                                   is increasing
in excess returns, (zi − rpi ).

   Proposition 8 illustrates the dynamic effect of investor sophistication. It shows that for
every realized state xi , zi , sophisticated investors are able to adjust their portfolios (contem-
poraneously) upwards if the shock implies high returns and downwards if the shock implies
low returns. Hence, also dynamically, they are able to outperform unsophisticated investors
by responding to shock realizations in a way that increases their profits.
   To see explicitly the impact on capital income inequality coming from the dynamic effect,
we express the total capital income of an average sophisticated investor as11
                                         n
                                         X              n
                                                        X
                                                π1i ≡         αi π2i ,                            (42)
                                          i=1           i=1

where, by (40) and (41),

                             π1i   (z i − rpi ) + mi (e2K1 − 1)(zi − rpi )
                      αi ≡       =                                         ,   ∀i.                (43)
                             π2i   (z i − rpi ) + mi (e2K2 − 1)(zi − rpi )

That is, capital income of an average sophisticated investor can be expressed as a weighted
sum of an average unsophisticated investor’s capital income from each asset, but the weights
depart from 1 whenever the asset is actively traded (mi > 0).
  11
     Here, we are implicitly assuming that profits are never exactly zero. For such case, the arguments
extend trivially.


                                                    18
    To see the dynamic effect, consider how variation in the weights αi drives income dif-
ferences. For assets that are actively traded in equilibrium, they vary depending on the
realization of the shocks zi and xi . There are two possible scenarios. First, π2i > 0, which
by (43) implies π1i > 0 and αi > 1. Hence, sophisticated investors have a larger gain in
their (positive) capital income from asset i. Second, π2i < 0 and either (i) π1i < 0 and
0 < αi < 1, or (ii) π1i > 0 and αi < 0. The first case implies that sophisticated investors put
a smaller weight in their portfolio on the loss, while the second case means that the profit
of sophisticated investors puts a negative weight on the loss. In both cases, sophisticated
investors either incur a smaller loss or realize a bigger profit, state by state.
    These arguments lead to the following comparative result: increases in sophistication
heterogeneity lead to a growing capital income polarization. Intuitively, greater dispersion
in information capacity means that, relative to unsophisticated investors, sophisticated in-
vestors receive higher-quality signals about the fundamental shocks xi , zi , and as a result,
they respond more strongly to postive/negative realized excess profits zi − rpi . This is the
essence of Proposition 9.

Proposition 9 Consider an increase in capacity dispersion of the form K10 = K1 +∆1 > K1 ,
K20 = K2 + ∆2 < K2 , with ∆1Pand ∆2Pchosen such that total information capacity φ remains
unchanged. Then, the ratio i π1i / i π2i increases, that is, capital income becomes more
polarized.

    The results show that heterogeneity in capacity generates heterogeneity in portfolios,
which in result decreases the relative participation of unsophisticated investors. Below, we
explore the intuitive reasons behind unsophisticated investors’ retrenchment from risky assets
in the presence of informationally superior, sophisticated investors.

Intuition Suppose that the realized state is such that in equilibrium zi − rpi > 0 for some
asset i. Consider one of a set of homogeneous investors with capacity K2 who learns about
asset i and receives the mean signal for her type, S2 = z̄i e−2K2 + zi (1 − e−2K2 ). Her allocation
is then                                                  
                                           2K2   S2 − rpi
                                   q2i = e                   ,
                                                   ρσi2
where e−2K2 σi2 is the variance of the her posterior beliefs.
   Let the allocation of investors to learning about different assets, {mi }ni=1 , also be fixed at
the equilibrium level, and exogenously increase the capacity of mass γ < mi of investors to
K1 > K2 so that they become more sophisticated. These new sophisticated investors have
average demand given by                                  
                                           2K1   S1 − rpi
                                    q1i = e                 ,
                                                   ρσi2
where the mean signal they receive is S1 = z̄i e−2K1 + zi (1 − e−2K1 ).
   There are two effects that lead to an increased relative participation of sophisticated
investors in risky assets in this example: a partial equilibrium one and a general equilibrium
one.

                                                19
    First, absent any price adjustment, the partial equilibrium effect is that the remaining
unsophisticated investors do not change their demand q1i for asset i, but the new sophisti-
cated investors now demand more, because S1 > S2 (we are considering a good state where
zi > z̄i ), and also this signal is more precise (e−2K1 σi2 < e−2K2 σi2 ). Hence, in partial equi-
librium, we would observe growth in sophisticated investors’ ownership. However, we would
see no change in the strategies of unsophisticated investors.
    Second, there is the general equilibrium effect working through price adjustment, which
makes unsophisticated investors perceive an informational disadvantage in trading asset i af-
ter sophisticated investors enter. In particular, in accordance with market clearing conditions
(19) and (20), the price will adjust to the greater demand from the relatively more informed
investors; in particular, it will be more informative about the fundamental shock zi ,12 and
since zi − rpi > 0, the equilibrium price will increase13 . Through that price adjustment,
both types of investors will see their returns go down, but only unsophisticated ones will
choose to decrease their holdings. Their signals are not of a high enough quality to sustain
previous positions as the optimal choice. Through this general equilibrium effect, the entry
of sophisticated investors spills over to an informational disadvantage for unsophisticated
investors and causes their retrenchment from trading the asset.

2.2      Testing the Mechanism
    In this section, we provide further analytical characterization of our model’s predictions.
These analytical results, together with the quantitative predictions from our parameterized
model, serve as a test of the main mechanism of the model when compared with the same
features in the data.
    We start with the characterization of properties of the market return in response to growth
in the overall level of information in the economy. As aggregate information increases, prices
contain a growing amount of information about the fundamental shocks, and excess market
return drops. This is summarized in Proposition 10.
Proposition 10 (Market Value) Growth in total information processing capacity leads to
  (i) higher average prices, dp
                             dφ
                                i
                                  ≥ 0, and hence a higher average value of the financial
market;
  (ii) lower average market excess returns, dE (zit − rpit ) /dφ ≤ 0.
   Next, in Proposition 11, we consider the effects of a pure increase in dispersion of so-
phistication, without changing the aggregate level of sophistication in the economy. Such
polarization in capacities implies polarization in holdings.
Proposition 11 Consider an increase in capacity dispersion of the form K10 = K1 + ∆1 >
K1 , K20 = K2 + ∆2 < K2 , with ∆1 and ∆2 chosen such that total     information
                                                                             P Qcapacity
                                                                       Q1i
                                                                 P
φ remains unchanged. Then, the average ownership difference E         i λ  −      2i
                                                                              i 1−λ  in-
creases.
   12
      The coefficient bi will rise and ai and ci will drop, because we increased φ in the market for asset i by
increasing total capacity of investors trading in that market.
   13
      Both the price and its derivative with respect to φ in state xi , zi are proportional to zi − z̄i + ρσi2 xi .


                                                        20
    Using Proposition 4, we can show that the aggregate symmetric growth in information
technology, modeled as a common growth rate of both K1 and K2 , leads to a growing re-
trenchment of unsophisticated investors and hence an increased ownership of risky assets
by sophisticated (Proposition 12), as well as growing capital income polarization (Proposi-
tion 13).
Proposition 12 (Dynamic Ownership) Consider symmetric information capacity, such
that K1t = Kt and K2t = Kt γ, γ ∈ (0, 1), and consider φk−1 < φ < φk such that the first
k > 1 assets are actively traded in equilibrium. In equilibrium, the average ownership share
by sophisticated investors increases across all assets: for all i

Proposition 13 (Capital Income Polarization) Consider symmetric information ca-
pacity, such that K1t = Kt and K2t = Kt γ, γ ∈ (0, 1), and consider φk−1 < φ < φk
such that the first k > 1 assets are actively traded in equilibrium. In equilibrium, the average
capital income becomes more polarized:

3     Results
    In this section, we provide a discussion of the results corresponding to our analytical pre-
dictions. We first lay out empirical facts on return differential across investor types. We then
discuss the parametrization of the model and show its quantitative performance. Further,
we present results that help us to identify our economic mechanism in the data. Next, we
report results from a parametrization of the model in which we build a link between infor-
mation capacities and financial wealth–an exercise which allows us to relate our quantitative
results to data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. Subsequently, we proceed with the
discussion of alternative mechanisms that could potentially explain the data. Finally, we
provide additional empirical evidence that supports our analytical predictions.

3.1    Returns Inequality
    In this section, we discuss empirical evidence on returns inequality. Our evidence is based
on institutional portfolio holdings data from Thomson Reuters. These data contain a large
sample of portfolios of publicly traded equity held by institutional investors. Thanks to its
rich micro-level structure, the data allow us to directly test the predictions of our model
for portfolio composition and its evolution for different asset classes. The data come from
quarterly reports required by law and submitted by institutional investors to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the official requirement for reporting is that the
minimum asset size exceed $100 million, and thus not all investors are in the data, in reality,
the data are comprehensive as more than 95% of all dollar investments are included.

                                              21
    To map the model to the data, we define sophisticated investors as those classified as
investment companies or independent advisors (types 3 and 4) in the Thomson data set.
These investors include wealthy individuals, mutual funds, and hedge funds. Among all
types, these two groups are known to be particularly active in their information production
efforts; in turn, other groups, such as banks, insurance companies, or endowments and
pensions are more passive by nature. Our definition of unsophisticated investors is other
shareholders who are not part of Thomson data. These are individual (retail) investors.
    We provide evidence on growing capital income polarization, using data on aggregated
financial performance of each group of investors over the time period 1989-2012. We proceed
in three steps. First, we obtain the market value of each stock held by all investors of a
given type. Market value of each stock is the product of the number of combined shares
held by a given investor type and the price per share of that stock, obtained from CRSP.
Since the number of shares held by unsophisticated investors is not directly observable we
impute this value by taking the difference between the total number of shares available for
trade and the number of shares held by all institutional investors. Second, we calculate the
value shares of each stock in the aggregate portfolio by taking the ratio of market value of
each stock relative to the total value of the portfolio of each type of investor. Third, we
obtain the return on the aggregate portfolio by matching each asset share with their next
month realized return and calculating the value-weighted aggregated return. We repeat this
procedure separately for sophisticated and unsophisticated investors.
    To compare financial performance of the two investor types we calculate cumulative values
of $1 invested by each group in January 1989 using time series of the aggregated monthly
returns ending in December 2012. We present the two series in Figure 1.

   Our results indicate that sophisticated investors systematically outperform unsophisti-
cated investors. The value of $1 invested in January 1989 grows to $5.32 at the end of
2012 for sophisticated investors and only to $3.28 for unsophisticated investors. This result
implies that sophisticated investors generate significantly more equity capital income per


                                                                                                               22
unit of financial wealth they invest, which in turn implies income inequality and growing
polarization.

3.2     Parametrization
    In this section, we describe the details of the parametrization of the model that we subse-
quently use to assess the validity of our economic mechanism. We parameterize the model to
stock-level micro data and aggregated investors’ equity shares. Using these data allows us to
match the general pattern of outperformance of sophisticated over unsophisticated investors.
In addition, we are able to test the model’s predictions regarding portfolio allocations and
asset turnover across assets and over time. We parameterize the model to match key mo-
ments of the data for the period 1989-2000. We think of this as the initial period in our
model and treat it as a point of departure for our dynamic comparative statics exercises.
    The key parameters of our model are the information capacity of each investor type
(K1 and K2 ), the averages and volatilities of the fundamental shocks (z̄i , σi ) and the supply
shocks (x̄i , σxi , , i = 1, ..., n), the risk aversion parameter (ρ), and the fraction of sophisticated
investors (λ).
    For parsimony, we restrict some parameters and normalize the natural candidates. In
particular, we normalize x̄ = 5, z̄ = 10 and restrict σxi = σx . To capture heterogeneity in
assets returns, we set the lowest volatility σn = 1 and assume that volatility changes linearly
across assets, which means that it can be parameterized by a single number, the slope of the
line.14 We pick the remaining parameters to match the following targets in the data (based on
1989-2000 averages): (i) aggregate equity ownership of sophisticated investors, equal to 23%;
(ii) real risk-free interest rate, defined as the average nominal return on 3-month Treasury
bills minus inflation rate, equal to 2.5%; (iii) average annualized stock market return in
excess of the risk-free rate, equal to 11.9%; (iv) average monthly equity turnover, defined as
the total monthly volume divided by the number of shares outstanding, equal to 9.7%; (v)
the ratio of the 90th percentile to the median of the cross-sectional idiosyncratic volatility
of stock returns, equal to 3.54. In addition, we arbitrarily set the fraction of assets about
which agents learn to 50%.
    To generate the dynamic predictions of our model, we assume a symmetric growth in
information capacity of each investor type, in order to match the 2001-2012 average equity
ownership rate of sophisticated investors, equal to 43%. The progress in information capacity
required to achieve this target amounts to a roughly 5% capacity growth annually (for 11
years from the middle of the first sub period to the middle of the second sub period). We
think of this approach as a way of modeling technological progress in investment technology
which affects both types of investors in the same way—hence, the reported results are not
driven by differential growth but come solely from the general equilibrium effects of our
mechanism.
    The above procedure leaves us with one key parameter left—the ratio of information
capacity of sophisticated versus unsophisticated investors, K1 /K2 . We set this parameter to
   14
      In particular, we set σi = σn + α(n − i)/n which, given our normalization of σn , leaves only α to be
determined.

3.3     Quantitative Results
    In this section, we report our quantitative results. We first discuss findings related to
returns inequality. Next, we show that predictions specific to our economic mechanism are
borne out in the data, which we view as independent tests of our model. We then test the
predictions of our model for capital income polarization using a setting in which we explicitly
link information capacity to financial wealth levels. We conclude by providing a discussion
of alternative hypotheses.

3.3.1    Returns Inequality
    We report the results in Table 3. The parameterized model implies a 2.7 percentage point
advantage (14% versus 11.3%) in average portfolio returns between sophisticated and unso-
phisticated investors, which accounts for 90% of the difference in the data for the 1989-2000
period (13.4% versus 10.4%). Thus, the model can account, quantitatively, for a significant
fraction of the empirical difference in returns across the two investor types. Given that our
mechanism has an economically large implication for the difference in performance across
agents with different information capacities, this suggests that a similarly large economic
effect may also exist within the household sector. In particular, if sophistication can be

                                                   24
approximated by financial wealth (as implied by a setting in Arrow (1987)), then our mech-
anism would imply a growing disparity in capital incomes across households. We explore the
quantitative implications of this hypothesis in Section 3.3.3.

Decomposing the Return Differential As our analytical results suggest, sophisticated
investors outperform unsophisticated investors for two reasons: (i) they are more exposed
to risk because they hold a larger share of risky assets (compensation for risk); and (ii) they
have informational advantage (compensation for skill).
    In this section, we decompose the returns of each investor type to shed light on the
relative importance of these two effects. To this end, we first derive the conditional CAPM
model in our setup, which gives the asset pricing equation

                                                covt (rit , rmt )
                              Et (rit ) − r =                     (Et (rmt ) − r)                       (44)
                                                  vart (rmt )

So, the conditional market βit of asset i is covt (rit ,rmt )
                                              vart (rmt )
                                                              . In the above, rit is the return on asset
                                                                      P                     P
i in period t, pmt is the price of the market portfolio (pm := xi pi ), and rmt =             zit xit /pmt
is the market return.15
    In order to evaluate returns on a portfolio of average investor type j = 1, 2, define
portfolio weights of investor j at time t as
                                                   qijt pit
                                           ωijt = P            .
                                                    l qljt plt

The time t expected excess return on the portfolio of type j is
                                      X
                                Rjt =    ωijt (Et (rit ) − r),
                                                i

   15
      Both the expectation and the covariance are conditional on the information available to the average
investor in period t. For detailed derivation, see Appendix.



                                                      25
and the ex-ante expectation of that return is

                                            R̄j = αj + β̄j (E(rmt ) − r))                     (45)
                P
where β̄j =         i   Eωijt Eβit , and
                                  X                            X
                           αj =        cov(ωijt , Et (rit )) +   Eωijt cov(βit , Et (rmt ))
                                    i                          i

    Quantitatively, the pure skill effect captured by αj accounts for all of the return dif-
ferential in the model. In fact, if we computed counterfactual returns in which we shut
down the skill difference alone by using α2 in the sophisticated investor’s average return, the
sophisticated portfolio would generate 11.2% versus 11.3% of the unsophisticated portfolio.16
    This exercise can also shed light on whether the αj differential in the model comes
from superior active response to shocks or just different portfolio weights across types on
average. These two effects are captured by the first and second expression which determines
alpha, respectively. Quantitatively, active portfolio adjustment in response to shocks is the
dominant force determining α: It accounts for 84% of the sophisticated investors’ α and 80%
of the unsophisticated investors’ α.

3.3.2      Testing the Mechanism
   The results in the previous section demonstrate a significant potential of our information
mechanism to account for the return differential and by that, capital income inequality
observed in the data. In this section, we provide a set of quantitative predictions for the
benchmark parametrization, which allow us to provide additional support for our mechanism
by comparing it to the corresponding data moments. These are robust predictions of our
mechanism and are proven analytically in Section 2. Below, we show a good fit of these
results not only qualitatively but also quantitatively.

Market Averages Technological progress in information capacity in the model implies
large changes in average market returns, cross-sectional return differential, and turnover.
We report these statistics generated by the model and observed in the data in Table 3.
    The changes implied by the model not only match the changes in the data qualitatively,
but they also come close quantitatively. Both the model and the data imply a decrease in
market return and a decrease in the return differential of portfolios held by sophisticated
and unsophisticated investors. Intuitively, in the model, lower market return is a result of
an increase in quantity of information: The price reflects that and tracks much more closely
the actual return z than it does in the initial parametrization with lower overall capacity
(for additional intuition, see Proposition 10).
    The model also predicts a sharp increase in average asset turnover, in magnitudes con-
sistent with the data. As with the market return, this result is a direct implication of our
  16
       α1 /α2 is equal to 1.67 in the model.

mechanism and is not driven by changes in asset volatility. In fact, fundamental asset volatil-
ities (σi s) are held at the same level across the two sub-periods in the model. Intuitively,
higher turnover in the model is driven by more informed trading by sophisticated investors,
both due to their holding a larger share of the market as well as them receiving more precise
signals about asset payoffs.

Ownership Investors in our model prefer to learn about assets with higher volatility. In
particular, upon increasing their information capacity, they first invest it in the most volatile
asset until the benefits from a unit of information become equalized with those of the second-
highest volatility asset, then third, and so forth (see Proposition 3). This process implies
a particular way in which sophisticated investors expand their portfolio holdings as their
capacity (through overall capacity) increases. Specifically, we should see that sophisticated
investors exhibit the highest initial growth in ownership for the the highest-volatility assets,
then lower-volatility assets, etc. This prediction is robustly borne out in the data, as exhib-
ited in Figure 2, which shows the evolution of this growth in the model and in the data over
the period 1989-2012.17
    In Figure 3, we show the change in asset ownership by sophisticated investors over the
periods 1989-2000 and 2001-2012, where assets are sorted by volatility of their returns. This
cross-sectional change underlies the average ownership targets in the model of 23% in the
initial period and 43% in the later period. Both the data and the model exhibit a hump-
shaped profile of the increase and they are also very close quantitatively.
    In conclusion, even though we parameterize the model to match the aggregate ownership
levels of sophisticated investors in the pre- and post-2000 period, the model is also able to
explain quantitatively how ownership increases across asset volatility classes, both in terms
of timing of the growth levels and in terms of the absolute magnitudes of the ownership
changes.
       17
    To generate this graph in the model, we increase aggregate capacity from zero to the level that matches
48% sophisticated ownership, which is the last point in the data.

Turnover Our model implies cross-sectional variation in asset turnover, driven by differ-
ential investment of investors’ information capacity. Intuitively, if an asset is more attractive
and investors invest more in it, then there are more investors with precise signals about this
asset’s returns, and these investors want to act on such better information by taking larger
and more volatile positions. Since the sophisticated investors receive more precise signals,
and they have preference towards high-volatility assets, we should see a positive relationship
between volatility and turnover. We report turnover in relation to return volatility in the
model and in the data in Table 4.

    The first two rows compare data and the model prediction for the initial parametrization
to 1989-2000 data. Both data and model show increasing patterns in turnover as volatility
goes up, which are quantitatively close to each other. In the next two rows, we compare
data for the 2001-2012 period to results generated from the dynamic exercise in the model
in which we increase overall capacity. The model implies an increase in average turnover
compared to that in an earlier period and additionally matches the cross-sectional pattern of
the increase. This effect is purely driven by our information friction, since the fundamental

volatilities remain constant over time in this exercise.18
    At first it may appear as though our results are at odds with evidence in Barber and
Odean (2000) who find that trading intensity is negatively related to performance, while
our findings would suggest that sophisticated investors achieve superior returns and they
trade more. We argue that the two are not necessarily contradictory. First, we highlight
the relationship between gross (portfolio) returns and turnover while their result is about
net returns to emphasize the role of transaction costs. In fact, they do find that turnover is
weakly positively related to gross returns. Second, their data set covers a subset of (retail)
investors over the short period of 1991-1997. Hence, the capital income distribution is likely
truncated from above. Our data set instead also includes most sophisticated investors and
our theory predicts that these most sophisticated investors have disproportionately higher
information advantage. Finally, we look at turnover at the stock level, while they look
at turnover by investor type; thus, conceptually different statistics. But if there are any
investor-fixed effects, the investor-based results would be skewed.

3.3.3    Linking Wealth to Information Capacity
    Our benchmark results point to quantitatively significant effects of the heterogeneity of
investor sophistication on rates of return and portfolio holdings. However, we are silent as
to the determinants of sophistication in terms of observables. In this section, we explore
endogenous determinants of information capacity, focusing on one prominent example in the
literature: wealth levels. Following the work of Arrow (1987) and Calvet, Campbell, and
Sodini (2009b), we investigate, through the lens of our model, how initial wealth levels can
propagate information capacity differences through time. Specifically, we map investor types
in our model into households in different wealth groups in the Survey of Consumer Finances
(SCF). We then explicitly map the ratio of wealth levels into initial ratio of information
capacities and posit that the growth in information capacity is linearly related to the growth
of the financial portfolio of each investor type. Hence, differences in rates of return endoge-
nously propagate into different capacity levels in subsequent periods. The guiding principle
of our exercise is the existence of a technology of obtaining capacity that is characterized by
high fixed and low marginal costs, as explored in Arrow (1987). The idea is that wealthier
individuals have access to better information production or processing technologies, which
in the language of our model means they have greater information capacity. Below, we first
proceed to describe the relevant groups of individuals in the SCF, and then present model
results.
    In order to map our investor types into household types in the SCF, we restrict our
data to households with non-zero investment in either stocks or non-money market mutual
funds (i.e., relatively active investors), and consider two subsets of households: a group
of 10% of households with the highest level of total wealth at each point in time (sophis-
ticated investors) and a group of 50% of households with the lowest level of total wealth
  18
    Our model also implies a positive turnover-ownership relationship, which we further confirm in the data.
This result is consistent with the empirical findings in Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2011).

(unsophisticated investors).19
    We proceed to set the initial ratio of investors’ information capacity, K1 /K2 in the model,
to the 1989 ratio of average financial wealth in the top 10% and the bottom 50% of the total
wealth distribution of our households. In the data, this ratio is equal to 29.92. We then
pick the initial aggregate capacity level to match the excess return on the market portfolio,
equal to 11.9% in the data. We then assume that the growth of each investor type’s capacity
is equal to her return on equity. We simulate the model for 21 years forward, which is the
time span of our data set. As the outcome of the experiment, we obtain the endogenous
capital income dispersion growth implied by our mechanism. The results of this exercise are
presented in Table 5 and Figure 4.

   Capital Income Dispersion Growth                        90%                       107%


    We obtain a 107% growth in capital income inequality (90% in the data), which is over
100% of the growth observed in the data. We conclude that our mechanism implies a strong
role of wealth as a proxy for sophistication and growth in wealth as a proxy for growth in
sophistication, especially in explaining capital income polarization observed in the data. As
Figure 4 shows, the model matches well not only the overall growth but also the timing of
the increase in capital income polarization.

3.3.4    Additional Supporting Evidence
    So far, we presented quantitative results supporting analytical predictions that are based
on our parameterized model. Specifically, our theoretical predictions imply that differences in
capital income can stem from two sources: heterogeneity in prices of investable assets and the
differential exposure of investors to holding such assets. In this section, we provide additional
evidence on each of these channels that offers support for our predictions qualitatively but
cannot be assessed quantitatively.

Unsophisticated Investors’ Retrenchment We show that cross-sectional differences in
assets holdings of investors with different levels of sophistication are consistent with predic-
tions of our model and thus contribute to capital income inequality and its growing polariza-
tion. Our main prediction is that unsophisticated investors should be more likely to invest
  19
     Income ratios are highly dispersed cross-sectionally, with sophisticated investors earning at the minimum
45 times more dollar income than unsophisticated ones. This dispersion also grows strongly over time up to
150 in 2004. Even though it subsequently diminishes slightly, it remains at a very high level of at least 100.
In the data, we also find that the ratio in rates of returns for sophisticated vs. unsophisticated investors on
average equals 1.7 and varies between 1.1 and 2.15 in the time series–which suggests that the capital income
polarization is not driven mechanically by financial wealth differences.

in assets with lower expected values. In the quantitative tests of the model in Figure 2,
we show that sophisticated investors allocate their wealth first into assets with highest level
of volatility and subsequently into assets with lower levels of volatility. Now, we provide
additional evidence which suggests similar investors’ preferences.
    Our first piece of evidence is based on SCF data regarding households’ holdings in liquid
wealth. The idea of this test is that unsophisticated investors should be more likely to invest
in safe (liquid) assets. SCF provides detailed classification of wealth invested in such assets
that include checking accounts, call accounts, money market accounts, coverdell accounts,
and 529 educational state-sponsored plans. As before, in each period, we divide households
into two groups: top 10% and bottom 50% of the wealth distribution. For each of the groups,
we calculate the average ratio of liquid wealth to total financial wealth. Higher ratios would
imply greater exposure to low-profit assets. We present the two time series in Figure 5.

     We find evidence that strongly supports predictions of our model. First, the average ratio
of liquid wealth for sophisticated investors, equal to 15.3%, is significantly lower than that for
unsophisticated investors, which in our sample equals 25%. In addition, while the exposure
to liquid assets by sophisticated investors is generally non-monotonic (u-shaped), similar
investment for unsophisticated investors exhibits a strong positive time trend, especially in
the last 20 years: The average investment goes up from 16.7% in 1998 to 39% in 2010.
This evidence strongly supports our economic mechanism in that differences in information
capacity lead to retrenchment by unsophisticated investors from risky assets and relocation
to safer assets.
     We further confirm this claim using evidence on institutional holdings from Thomson
Reuters. To this end, we calculate average (equal-weighted) equity ownership of sophisticated
investors (mutual funds and hedge funds) and unsophisticated (retail) investors. We report
the respective time series quarterly averages of the ownership over the period 1989-2012 in

    The results paint a picture that is generally consistent with our model’s predictions. Al-
though the average ownership level of unsophisticated investors is higher in an unconditional
sample and equals 61%, the time-series evidence clearly indicates a very strong pattern: The
average equity ownership for unsophisticated investors goes down while that for sophisticated
investors significantly goes up.20 We argue that this evidence is consistent with the view
that the observed expansion of relative financial wealth drives the expansion of information
capacities. Realizing a positive shock to information capacity sophisticated investors enter
the profitable equity market at the expense of unsophisticated investors who perceive the
informational disadvantage in the market and as a result move away from equity. Notably,
the retrenchment of unsophisticated investors from directly holding equity happened despite

     The visible positive trend in active ownership has been documented before by Gompers and Metrick
(2001) and is even stronger if one accounts for differences in market values across assets and the preference
of sophisticated investors for large-cap stocks.

Figure 7: Cumulative Flows to Mutual Funds by Sophistication Type: Equity vs. Non-
Equity


the overall strong performance of equity markets over the same time period. This suggests
that investors do not simply respond to past trends in equity returns.
    As a final auxiliary prediction we consider money flows into mutual funds. The idea is
that equity mutual funds are more risky than non-equity funds. As such, unsophisticated
investors should be less likely to invest in the former, especially if information capacity gets
more polarized.
    To test this prediction in the data we use mutual fund data from Morningstar. Morn-
ingstar classifies different funds into those serving institutional investors and individuals
whose investment is at least $100,000 (institutional funds) and those serving individual in-
vestors with investment value less than $100,000 (retail funds). For the purpose of testing
our predictions, we define sophisticated investors as those investing in institutional funds
and unsophisticated investors as those investing in retail funds. Subsequently, we calculate
cumulative aggregated dollar flows into equity and non-equity funds, separately for each
investment type. Our data span the period 1989-2012. We present the results in Figure 7.
    We find that the cumulative flows from sophisticated investors into equity and non-
equity funds increase steadily over the whole sample period. In contrast, the flows from
unsophisticated investors display a visibly different pattern. The flows into equity funds
keep increasing until 2000 but subsequently decrease at a significant rate of more than 3
times by 2012. Moreover, the decrease in cumulative flows to equity mutual funds coincides
with a significant increase in cumulative flows to non-equity funds. Overall, these findings
support predictions of our model: Sophisticated investors have a large exposure to risky
assets and subsequently add extra exposure to less risky assets, whereas unsophisticated
investors leave riskiest assets and move into safer assets as they perceive higher information
disadvantage.
    One could point out that the increase in equity fund flows by unsophisticated investors
observed in the early sample period is inconsistent with our model. However, we argue that
this result could still be rationalized by contrasting it with the steady decrease in holdings

                                                33
of individual equity documented earlier. To the extent that individual equity holdings are
more risky than diversified equity portfolios, such as mutual funds, this only means that in
the earlier period unsophisticated investors reallocate their wealth from riskier to safer asset
class.

Stock Selection Ability The second building block of our economic mechanism is the
ability of sophisticated investors to better choose assets. Our quantitative evaluation maps
the model prediction to the observed differences in performance between sophisticated and
unsophisticated investors. Here, we provide an additional qualitative result in which we
show that equity holdings of sophisticated investors are higher for stocks which realize higher
returns.
    To conduct this test, we obtain data on stock returns come from Center for Research on
Security Prices (CRSP), and for each stock we calculate the market shares of sophisticated
investors. Next, we estimate the regression model over the period January 1989-December
2012 with stock/month as a unit of observation. Our dependent variable is the share of
sophisticated investors in month t and the independent variable is return corresponding to
the stock in month t. Our regression model includes year-month fixed effects and standard
errors are clustered at the stock level to account for the cross-sectional correlation in the
data. We report the results of this estimation in Table 6.

    We find strong evidence that sophisticated investors tend to invest more in stocks that
generate higher returns (which is consistent with our model’s prediction summarized in
Proposition 7). Hence, we conclude that sophisticated investors in our sample exhibit supe-
rior stock-selection ability. This finding corroborates that in a number of other studies that
show the strong existence of stock-picking ability among sophisticated investors, such as ac-
tively managed equity mutual funds (e.g., Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997),
Cohen, Coval, and Pástor (2005), Kacperczyk, Sialm, and Zheng (2005), Kacperczyk and
Seru (2007)). At the individual level, there is ample anecdotal evidence that shows superior
investment ability of wealthy investors such as Warren Buffett or Carl Icahn.
    Overall, our evidence is consistent with the premise of our economic mechanism that
sophisticated investors are good at choosing assets and relocating their resources to the
most profitable ones.

3.3.5    Discussion of Alternative Mechanisms
    Our findings so far strongly suggest that heterogeneity in information capacity has the
ability to explain cross-sectional and time-series patterns in capital income inequality, while
simultaneously producing results that are consistent with other micro-level financial data.
While the information friction constitutes a plausible economic mechanism, there may cer-
tainly exist other mechanisms which could contribute to the patterns observed in the data.
To our knowledge, our paper is the first to embed the proposed friction in an equilibrium
model and formally test its predictions vis a vis the data to provide an independent verifica-
tion for the proposed mechanism. Our view is that any alternative mechanism put forward
should be subject to the same verification procedure. While their formal modeling is beyond
the scope of this paper, below we discuss some of the popular alternative explanations in
light of micro-evidence.

Risk aversion differences It is possible that capital income inequality in the data is
driven by differences in risk aversion among investors. In particular, if one group of investors
is less risk averse they would hold a greater share of risky assets with higher expected returns
and hence would have higher expected capital income. Such a setting would also encompass
situations in which investors are exposed to different levels of volatility in areas outside
capital markets, like labor income.
     Within our mean-variance specification, growing differences in risk aversion would pro-
duce growing aggregate ownership in risky assets of less risk-averse investors, but it would not
generate any difference in investor-specific rates of return on equity, or differential growth
in ownership reported in Figure 2. The reason being that differences in risk aversion imply
different exposures to risky portfolio but not different risky portfolio weights, and hence im-
ply a uniform proportional retrenchment of the high risk aversion agents from equity. This
result, supported additionally by regression results in Section 3.3.4, suggests that the excess
market performance is driven by sophisticated investors explicitly picking different portfo-
lio shares (as opposed to pure timing). Finally, differences in risk aversion across investors
cannot explain the cross-sectional turnover profile of assets (in Table 4).21
     We are not the first ones to point out that preference-based approaches to explaining
household portfolio choice suffer from serious drawbacks. Analysis in Dumas (1989), as well
as arguments in Chien, Cole, and Lustig (2011) suggest that differences in risk preferences
cannot account for observed differences in rates of returns across agents with different degrees
of sophistication.22

Saving rates Another explanation for the growing capital income polarization could be
differences in savings rates among households. If less wealthy households have lower savings
   21
      Note that in a model with CRRA specification, portfolio weights will also be identical across risky
assets, and hence even in that specification, rates of return on equity will be equalized across investor types.
   22
      Using a different approach, Chien, Cole, and Lustig (2011) explore the role of exogenous heterogeneity
in investment technologies in explaining wealth distribution. We build a micro-founded model of such
heterogeneity, and focus on capital income (flows) and differences in rates of return.



                                                      35
rates (which go towards financial wealth), then their financial wealth will grow slower than
that of the more wealthy households and hence capital incomes of the two groups will diverge.
We view this explanation as separate from our mechanism, since it implies no differences in
rates of return on financial wealth, and works through pure size effects of the financial wealth.
This directly contradicts our finding, presented in Figure 8, on differences in rates of return
on financial wealth across wealth groups in the Survey of Consumer Finances. In particular,
for each of the group identified by us as sophisticated and unsophisticated in Section 3.3.3
(top 10% and bottom 50% of wealth distribution), we compute a rough measure of rate of
return by taking capital income relative to financial wealth for each group of households.
Figure 8 plots the ratio of these rates of return in our data. Sophisticated investors earn
on average a 70% higher rate of return on their financial wealth relative to unsophisticated
investors, with the number being positive in all survey years. We conclude that there are
large and persistent return differences between household groups, which are captured by
our mechanism and by the nature of return construction are not driven by savings rates
differences.

Age-dependent investment policies Capital income polarization in our data also does
not seem to be driven by age demographics. In principle, our measure of capital income
includes capital gains and the endogenous household decision of when to realize them. This
could depend on a variety of life-cycle factors which we will proxy by using investor age.
Figure 9 plots the average age of sophisticated and unsophisticated investors in the SCF.
As expected, the wealthy households are older on average. However, the figure reveals that
there is no special time-series dynamics to the age difference that could possibly explain the
observed capital income dynamics.
    Further analysis also rules out the possibility that capital income differences are the
outcome of differences in market returns over time combined with buy-and-hold, passive
strategies of households in different age cohorts. Figure 10 plots, for each year, the past

15-year and 5-year cumulative return on holding the market (left panel)23 . It simulates the
cumulative return of a household which buys the market index at age 40 and sells at 44 or
at 55 - a completely passive strategy. As we can see, the cumulative return on the passive
strategy actually exhibits a declining trend, more so for the 15-year strategy. This implies
that if all investors used the passive strategy and the only difference would be how much of
the capital gain is realized by each age group, we should observe the 44-year olds’ capital
income (driven by cumulative return over the last 5 years) to go up relative to the 55-year
olds’ (driven by returns over the last 15 years). This is presented in the right panel of Figure
10. Compared with the data in Figure 4, it is clear that the passive investment strategies
imply a counterfactual evolution of capital income polarization.

Transaction costs Finally, we discuss the potential of differences in transaction costs
across investors to account for the data. To the extent that less sophisticated investors face
higher transaction costs in risky asset markets they would be willing to participate less, as
argued in Gomes and Michaelides (2005) and others.
    While this explanation might have some merit to explain cross-sectional patterns in the
data, we believe it is less likely to explain the time-series results. In particular, we observe
that more sophisticated households generate significantly greater gap in their incomes over
time, which is hard to reconcile with the fact that there was not much change in the overall
quantity of transaction costs, as reported in French (2008). In fact, if anything, growth
in internet access and services made an access to more direct investing extremely easy and
relatively less costly for the average citizen as opposed to just the few privileged ones.
  23
    The patterns we document are essentially the same for other choices of the two horizons, like 20-year
and 10-year cumulative returns.

4     Concluding Remarks
    What contributes to the growing income inequality across households? This question
has been of great economic and policy relevance for at least several decades starting with a
seminal work by Kuznets. We approach this question from the perspective of capital income
that is known to be highly unequally distributed across individuals. We propose a theo-
retical information-based framework that links capital income derived from financial assets
to a level of investor sophistication. Our model implies the presence of income inequality
between sophisticated and unsophisticated investors that is growing in the extent of total
sophistication in the market and in relative sophistication across investors. Additional pre-
dictions on asset ownership, market returns, and turnover help us pin down the economic
mechanism and rule out alternative explanations. The quantitative predictions of the model
match qualitatively and quantitatively the observed data.
    Although our empirical findings are strictly based on the U.S. market, our model should
have similar implications for other financial markets. For example, qualitatively, we know
that income inequality in emerging markets tends to be even larger than the one documented
for the U.S. To the extent that financial sophistication in such markets is much more skewed
one could rationalize within our framework the differences in capital incomes. Similarly, the
U.S. market is considered to be the most advanced in terms of its total sophistication, which
is possibly why we find a greater dispersion in capital income compared to other developed
markets, such as those in Europe or Asia.
    More generally, one could argue that although the overall growth of investment resources
and competition across investors with different skill levels are generally considered as a
positive aspect of a well-functioning financial market, our work suggests that one should
assess any policy targeting overall information environment in financial markets as potentially
exerting an offsetting and negative effect on socially relevant issues, such as distribution of
income. We leave detailed evaluation of such policies for future research.

Appendix
Theoretical Framework
The distribution of excess returns. Let R           bji and Vbji denote the mean and variance
of the ex-ante distribution (in subperiod 1) of the posterior beliefs about excess returns,
bji − rpi . We have that E1j (b
µ                             µji ) = z i , and hence

                                             bi = z i − rpi ,
                                             R

the same across all investors j. The variance of posterior beliefs about excess returns is

                                           µji ) + r2 σpi
                            Vbji = V ar1j (b           2
                                                          − 2rCov (b
                                                                   µji , pi ) .

From the distribution of posterior beliefs,

                                                       Cov 2 (zi , sji )
                                    V ar1j (b
                                            µji ) =           2
                                                                         .
                                                           σsji
                                                        2                              2
The signal structure implies that Cov (zi , sji ) = σsji    such that V ar1j (b
                                                                              µji ) = σsji . We
compute Cov (bµji , pi ) exploiting the fact that posterior beliefs and prices are conditionally
independent given payoffs, and hence

                                                 Cov (b
                                                      µji , zi ) Cov (zi , pi )
                             Cov (b
                                  µji , pi ) =                                  ,
                                                             σi2

with Cov (zi , pi ) = bi σi2 and Cov (b             2
                                      µji , zi ) = σsji . Then, Vbji becomes

                                                        2
                                    Vbji = (1 − 2rbi ) σsji + r2 σpi
                                                                  2
                                                                     .

   Equivalently,
                                                                2

Proof of Proposition 1. The linear objective function and the convex constraint imply a
corner solution for the optimal allocation of attention for each investor. Let lj index the asset
to which investor j dedicates her entire capacity. Then, from the information constraint, the
investor’s posterior variance is given by

Since e2Kj > 1, the objective is maximized by allocating all capacity to the asset with the
largest utility gain: lj ∈ arg maxi Gi .

Let mi ∈ (0, 1] denote the mass of investors learning about asset i ∈ L. Since the gain factor
Gi for each i is the same across all investors, regardless of investor type, the participation
of sophisticated and unsophisticated investors in learning about a particular asset will be
proportional to their mass in the population. Hence, let M1i denote the set of sophisticated
investors who choose to learn about asset i, of measure λmi ≥ 0, and let M2i denote the set
of unsophisticated investors who choose to learn about asset i, of measure (1 − λ) mi ≥ 0.

which completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 3. For any K1 , K2 > 0, at least one asset will be learned about in
the economy.
    (i) First, suppose that only one asset is learned about, and let this asset be denoted by
l: ml = 1 and mi = 0 for all i 6= l. This implies that Gl > Gi for any i 6= l, i.e.

                                       1 + ρ2 ξl
                                                 > 1 + ρ2 ξi ,
                                       (1 + φ)2

or, equivalently,
                                      1 + ρ2 ξl
                                           2
                                                > (1 + φ)2 .
                                      1 + ρ ξi
Since 1 + φ > 1, the inequality holds only if ξl > ξi for any i 6= l. We have assumed, without
loss of generality, that assets in the economy are ordered such that, for all i ∈ {1, ..., n − 1},
ξi > ξi+1 . Hence, l = 1: the asset learned about is the asset with the highest value of ξ1 .
Moreover, since the left-hand side of the inequality is decreasing in ξi , the threshold for
starting to learn about the second asset, namely the point at which the inequality above no
longer holds, taking shocks and risk aversion as given, is
                                           s
                                             1 + ρ2 ξ1
                                      φ1 ≡             − 1.
                                             1 + ρ2 ξ2

At this threshold market capacity, investors begin learning about the second asset, ξ2 .
    Second, let 0 < φ < φ1 . Suppose that more than one asset is learned about. To induce
investors to dedicate capacity to more than one asset, it must be the case that equilibrium
masses the utility gains from learning across these assets. In particular, suppose that the
first L assets are learned about (since the gains are increasing in ξi ). Then it must be the
case that G1 = G2 , i.e.
                                   1 + ρ2 ξ1      1 + ρ2 ξ2
                                             =              ,
                                 (1 + φm1 )2    (1 + φm2 )2
with m1 + m2 + ∆ = 1, where ∆ is the residual mass allocated to the remaining L − 2 assets.
Equivalently,                               s
                                 1 + φm2       1 + ρ2 ξ1
                                          =              .
                                 1 + φm1       1 + ρ2 ξ2


                                                 47
Using the definition of φ1 , this becomes
                                        1 + φm2
                                                = φ1 + 1,
                                        1 + φm1
which, rearranging, yields
                                   φ1 + φ1 φm1 + φm1 = φm2
                             ⇔ (φ1 − φ) + φ1 φm1 + 2φm1 + φ∆ = 0.
But this is a contradiction, since we have assumed that φ < φ1 and all the other terms are
positive. Hence, for 0 < φ < φ1 , only one asset is learned about in equilibrium.

   (ii) For φ ≥ φ1 , at least two assets are learned about in equilibrium. The gain factors
must be equated for all assets learned about in equilibrium, G1 = Gk , for any k ∈ {2, ..., L} ,
which yields                          s
                          1 + φm1        1 + ρ2 ξ1

                          1 + φmk        1 + ρ2 ξk

   (iii) Any asset not learned about in equilibrium must have a strictly lower gain factor,
Gh < G1 , for any h ∈ {L + 1, ..., n} , or equivalently,

                                                      1 + ρ2 ξ1
                                      1 + ρ2 ξh <               .

and mi = 0 for any i ∈ {k + 1, ..., n}, where

which results in a solution for m1 given by
                                                    1

                                        m1 =             Pk                  .           (49)

   Note that equation (48) implies that the masses mi are strictly decreasing across the
assets that are learned about:
                                 m1 > m2 > ... > mk ,
since c11 = 1 and ci1 < 1 is strictly decreasing in i.

   (i) Note that for any φ > 0, m1 changes continuously with φ. Differentiating equation
(49) with respect to φ, we obtain
                                       "P                  #

since for all i > 1, 0 < ci1 < 1. Hence, m1 is decreasing in φ.
    Likewise, for each asset i ∈ {2, ..., k}, mi changes continuously with φ. Differentiating
(48) with respect to φ, we obtain
                                                

                                 dφ           dφ     φ

Substituting in the derivative of m1 and rearranging we obtain

                               dφ    φ              j=1 cj1

where we have used the fact that c11 = 1. Since ci1 < 1 and ci1 is strictly decreasing in i,
then dm
      dφ
         i
            is increasing in i.
    Next, consider the case of a local increase in φ to some φ0 < φk , such that no new assets
are learned about in equilibrium. Since Σi mi = 1, there must be at least one asset i > 2 for
which dmdφ
           i
              > 0, and this asset defines the cutoff i.
    Finally, consider the case of an increase in φ to some φ0 with φk ≤ φ0 < φk+x , such that
x ≥ 1 new assets are learned about in equilibrium24 . Let the equilibrium masses associated
with aggregate capacity φ0 be denoted by m0i for i ∈ {1, ..., k + x}. For the new assets,
m0i > mi = 0 for all i ∈ {k + 1, ..., k + x}, hence the mass is increasing in φ. From above,
  24
       With x ≤ n − k, since there are only n assets in the economy.

                                                        49
m01 < m1 and m0i < mi for at least one asset i ∈ {1, ..., k}. Since Σi mi = 1, the new cutoff
              0
will be some i > i.

   (ii) First, consider the case of a local increase in φ to some φ0 < φk , such that no new
assets are learned about in equilibrium. For assets that are not learned about, i > k, mi = 0
both before and after the capacity increase, hence d(φmdφ
                                                          i)
                                                             = 0. By Proposition 3,

                                               1 + φmi
                                                       = cil , ∀i, l ≤ k.

                    1+ρ2 ξi
where cil ≡         1+ρ2 ξl
                              > 0. Equivalently,

                                               1 + φmi = (1 + φml ) cil .
                                 d(φmi )
Totally differentiating,           dφ
                                           is given by
                                                                      
                                                  dmi              dml
                                           mi + φ     =     ml + φ       cil .             (50)
                                                   dφ               dφ

Suppose that there exists an asset i such that d(φm dφ
                                                       i)
                                                          ≤ 0. Then for all other assets l ≤ k,
l 6= i, the right-hand side of equation (50) must be negative. Since cil > 0, ml > 0, and
φ > 0, then we must have that dm  dφ
                                    l
                                      < 0 as well. Hence for all assets learned about, the mass
decreases with the increase in φ. But Σi mi = 1, hence there must be at least one asset for
which dm dφ
           i
             ≥ 0, which is a contradiction. Hence for all i ≤ k, d(φm
                                                                   dφ
                                                                      i)
                                                                         > 0.

    Second, consider the case of an increase in φ to some φ0 with φk ≤ φ0 < φk+x , such that
x ≥ 1 new assets are learned about in equilibrium25 . For assets which remain passively
traded, i > k + x, mi = m0i = 0; hence, there is no change in the aggregate capacity
allocated to these assets. For the new assets that are actively traded, i ∈ {k + 1, ..., k + x},
m0i > mi = 0; hence, φ0 m0i > φmi . Finally, from Proposition 3, an asset i that was actively
traded both before and after the increase, i ≤ k, had, prior to the increase, a utility gain
strictly larger than that of an asset l that was previously not learned about:

                                                  cil − 1 − φmi > 0

and has, after the increase, a utility gain equal to that of asset l,

                                              1 + φ0 m0i = (1 + φ0 m0l ) cil .

Substituting the inequality for cil into the equality above, φ0 m0i − φmi > φ0 m0l (1 + φmi ).
Since the right-hand side is positive, it follows that φ0 m0i > φmi , which completes the proof.

   (iii) Let K1 = K and K2 = γK, for some γ ∈ (0, 1), and consider the case of a local

       With x ≤ n − k, since there are only n assets in the economy.

                              dK
   First, consider the case in which miφ > 0. Then, since e2K > e2Kγ > γe2Kγ , we have that

Proof of Proposition 5. We consider the choice of an individual investor, taking the
choices of all other investors as given, characterized by the solution in the main text.
    Case A.       First, we consider the case in which the investor treats the price as any
other random variable that cannot be processed perfectly for free. Suppose that the investor
allocates capacity to learning the price of asset i. This investor will observe a compressed
representation of the price, spji , that is the result of the decomposition

                                           pi = spji + εji ,

that are learned about in equilibrium (i.e., if mi > 0). Also, K1 > K2 > 0 implies φ > 0. It
follows that mi > 0 for at least one i.

Proof of Proposition 7. Using equations (40)-(41), the ownership difference for asset i

where we have used the fact that expected excess returns are, by equations (19) and (20),

                                                      1 + φmi
Since K1 > K2 and xi > 0, the result follows.
    (ii) First, we show that if E(zi − rpi ) > E(zl − rpl ), then mi > ml . Since i, l < k, their
gain factors are equated, Gi = Gl . Using (54), and the fact that xi = x and σxi = σx for all
i, the gain factor of asset i can be written as

                                  1 + ρ2 (σx2 + x2 ) σi2
                           Gi =                          [E(zi − rpi )]2 ,
                                        ρ2 x2 σi4

and a corresponding expression holds for Gl . The inequality in excess returns implies that

                          1 + ρ2 (σx2 + x2 ) σi2   1 + ρ2 (σx2 + x2 ) σl2
                                                 <                        ,
                                   σi4                      σl4

which reduces to σi2 > σl2 . Proposition 3 implies that mi is increasing in ξi , which, under
                                           2
the maintained assumptions that xi and σxi   are equal across i, implies that mi is increasing
    2
in σi . Hence, mi > ml .
    Next, from the expression for the expected ownership differential in (53), the difference
in expected relative ownership across the two assets is
                                                                     

ence for asset i becomes

If i ≤ k, the equilibrium level of mi > 0 is an ex-ante decision, and hence it is constant
across realizations. The result follows.

Proof of Proposition 9.        Our derivation keeps the aggregate information quantity φ
constant, and hence the masses mi unchanged, by equation (23), which in turn implies that
prices also remain unchanged, by equations (19) and (20). By equations (39), (40), and (41),

                    i π2i    i {(z i − rpi )(zi − rpi ) + mi (e          i     i

Since K10 > K1 and K20 < K2 , each element of i π1i increases and each element of i π2i
                                                     P                                  P
decreases.

Proof of Proposition 10. (i) From equations (19) and (20), the average equilibrium price
of asset i can be expressed as

                                             ρσi2 xi
                                                    

                                    r       1 + φmi

For i > k, mi = 0, and pi remains unchanged. For i ≤ k, mi > 0, and pi is increasing in
φmi , which in turn is increasing in φ, per Proposition 4.
   (ii) Equilibrium expected excess returns are

                                                            ρσi2 xi
                                     E (zit − rpit ) =              .
                                                           1 + φmi
For i > k, mi = 0, and expected excess returns remain unchanged. For i ≤ k, mi > 0, and
the expected excess return of asset i is decreasing in φmi , which in turn is increasing in φ,
per Proposition 4.

Proof of Proposition 11. The average ownership difference is given by

                          λ    (1 − λ)          1 + φmi

For our designed deviation of information capacities, the aggregate information quantity φ
constant, and hence the masses mi are unchanged by equation (23). Polarization in e2K1
versus e2K2 gives the result.

Proof of Proposition 13.          Using equations (39) and (40), the expected income from
holding asset i for the sophisticated investors is given by:

                                   mi (e2K − 1)(σi2 + ρ2 ξi ) − φmi σi2 + ρ2 ξi

and hence, the ratio of expected profits is

                      Eπ1i   mi (e2K − 1)(σi2 + ρ2 ξi ) − φmi σi2 + ρ2 ξi
                           =
                      Eπ2i   mi (e2Kγ − 1)(σi2 + ρ2 ξi ) − φmi σi2 + ρ2 ξi

which can be written as
                                Eπ1i   mi (e2K − 1)α − φmi + ω
                                     =

Then consider the difference between old and new expected profit between two levels of
overall capacity K ∗ > K, with K ∗ associated with the endogenous mass of investors m∗i and
K with mi :

                                                  57
We will show that ∆ > 0, i.e.

                 m∗i (e2K ∗ γ − 1)α − φ∗ m∗i + ω   mi (e2Kγ − 1)α − φmi + ω

    Suppose that expected profits for each investor are positive (which must be true for them
to hold the asset), then the above is equivalent to
        ∗                                                                                  ∗

     Since the first term in square brackets is positive by Proposition 4, for our result to hold
it is enough to show that (factoring out αm∗i mi > 0)

    To obtain a closed-form expression for the second bracketed term, plug in the definition
of φ, to obtain

   Hence, a sufficient condition for ∆ > 0 is

    Since α > 1, it is enough to show that
                                         the term in square  brackets is positive. To see that,
                        ∗                                 ∗
define f (K ∗ ) = e2K − 1 e2Kγ − 1 − e2K − 1 e2K γ − 1 and notice that f (K) = 0.
                                                                 

Furthermore, also notice that f 0 (K ∗ = K) = 0 and f 0 (K ∗ ) = 0 for all K ∗ if γ ∈ {0, 1}, and
that f 0 (K ∗ ) has a single maximum with respect to γ for each K ∗ , and that maximum is
attained at γ ∈ (0, 1). To see that, calculate

                0     df 0 (K ∗ )            ∗         ∗
                                  = 2 2Ke2K e2Kγ − e2K γ e2K − 1 (1 + 2γK)
                                                                         
               fγ ≡
                          dγ
                                                          
                        2K ∗ γ 2K             1
                    > 2e      e      2K +       − 1 (1 + 2γK) .
                                            e2K
           0
Clearly, fγ = 0 for a single value of γ. Additionally, by the arguments in the proof of
Proposition 4, we know that at γ = 0, fγ0 = 0. Hence, for any K ∗ , K, f 0 = 0 for γ ∈ {0, 1},
f 0 is increasing in γ at γ = 0 and f 0 has a single maximum with respect to γ. It follows that
for all γ between zero and one, f 0 (K ∗ ) > 0, and hence equation (55) is satisfied.

Derivation of (44) and (45) We can derive the conditional CAPM equation in our model
by using the market clearing condition (we omit the time notation for clarity of exposition):
                               Z                Z
                                  sij              1
                                    2
                                       dj − rpi         dj = ρxi ,
                                  σ̂ij            σ̂ij2

where σ̂ij2 is equal to σi2 if the investor is not learning, e−2Kj σi2 if investor type j is learning
about asset i. sij are not correlated with σ̂ij2 , so we can express the market clearing as

                                        1
                                           (Si − rp) = ρxi
                                        Θi
where sij = z̄i for investors who don’t learn and
                                              Z
                                         Si = sij dj,
                                                 Z
                                          1            1
                                             =              dj.
                                          Θi          σ̂ij2
That gives
                                         rpi = Si − ρΘi xi .
                             P
Define the market payoff:     zi xi . The (conditional) covariance of zi with the market is a
function of the average conditional variance of zi :
                                              X
                                     cov(zi ,   xi zi ) = xi Θi ,


                                                 59
so the price of the asset is
                                     1              X
                               pi = [Si − ρcov(zi ,    xi zi )],
                                     r
                                         P
Consider
P          the weighted  average p m  :=   xi pi as the price of the market portfolio, and
  zi xi /pm the return on the market. Then the expected return is Si /pi , given by

                                            E(ri ) − r = ρpm cov(ri , rm ),

For the whole market,
                                           E(rm ) − r = ρpm cov(rm , rm ).
Substituting out pm ρ gives

                                                              cov(ri , rm )
                                       E(ri ) − r =                         (E(rm ) − r)
                                                               var(rm )
                                         cov(ri ,rm )
So the market βi of asset i is            var(rm )
                                                      .   By i.i.d. shocks assumption,
                                                                           X
                           cov(ri , rm ) = 1/(pi pm )cov(zi ,                   xi zi ) = Θi xi /(pi pm )

and                                                   X               X
                                   var(rm ) = p2m var(  xi zi ) = p2m   x2i Θi .
                                                                  i

   Using the conditional CAPM, we can price the return on strategy {ωijt }ni=1 at time t,
                                    X
                              Rjt =    ωit (Et (rit ) − r).
                                                              i

The unconditional expectation of that return is
            X                         X                          X
         E0     ωit (Et (rit ) − r) =   cov0 (ωit , Et (rit )) +   E0 ωit E0 [Et (rit ) − r]
                   i                               i                                    i
                               X                                  X
                           =       cov0 (ωit , Et (rit )) +               E0 ωit E0 [βit (Et (rmt ) − r)],
                               i                                      i

where the covariance and the expectation are unconditional. We can thus express the ex-
pected return on the portfolio as
               X                           X
         R̄j =    cov0 (ωit , Et (rit )) +   E0 ωit cov0 (βit , Et (rmt )) + β̄(E0 (rmt ) − r)]
                       i                                  i
             P
where β̄ =     i   E0 ωit E0 βit .
