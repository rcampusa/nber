   A STRATEGIC ALTROISM MODEL   IN   WHICH RICARDIAN EQUIVALENCE DOES NOT HOLD

                                      ABSTRACT


     This article demonstrates that Ricardian Equivalence does not

necessarily hold in   models with altruistic transfers once one takes into
account the strategic behavior of recipients as well as donors. To influence
the final allocation of consumption in altruistic settings, potential

recipients can threaten to refuse as well as accept transfers.
     We apply   the Extended Nash Bargaining Solution to the problem   of an
altruistic parent and a possibly altruistic child. The parent and child
first choose a threat point noncooperatively; this threat point then
influences the final allocation of consumption through the standard Nash

Bargaining Solution, While the potential recipient can refuse transfers from
the potential donor, he cannot refuse transfers from the government. When
the golrernrnenr redistributes between the parent and child, it changes their
endowments and the equilibrium threats,     and thus the final allocation of
onsuaption.
     The feature of the cooperative model presented here that leads to the
failure of Ricardian Equivalence may be characteristic of a wider class of

cooperative and noncooperative altruism models.     This feature is that non-
interior strategic postures underlie interior transfer behavior and that
these non-interior strategic postures are altered by government
redistribution.

I.   Introduction

     It is now 15 yesrs since Robert Barro (1974) wrote his ingenious article

showing how love of children (intergenerational       altruism) can economically

link current and future generations and thereby neutralize intergenerational

redistributionby the government (Ricardian Equivalence).          During this time

the Barro model, despite its critics, has taken its place wIth the Keynesian

and Life Cycle models aa a principal paradigm of saving and growth.        Several

critics have pointed out reasons why the requirement for Ricardian Equivalence

of interior transfers may not be satisfied (e.g., Barro, 1974; Drazen, 1978;

L.aitner.   l979a, 1979b, 1988 and Feidstein,    1988).   Others (Kotlikoff, 1983 and

Sernheim and Bagweil. 1984) have cast doubt on the model by showing how

intermarriage    c.toas Barro dynasties   can lead to incredibly large groups of

intrageneratlonally    linked ndividuala, redistribution      among whom will also he

neutralized.

     None of the critics has, however, questionedwhether Ricardian

quivalence necessarily follows from the basic elements in Barro'a study.

This article does lust that.     It examines the strategic game between an

altruistic parent and a possibly altruiatic child and shows, under the

Extended Nash Bargaining Solution1, that Ricardian Equivalence will almost

never hold.     The Extended Nash Bargaining Solution is simply the standard Nash

Bargaining Solution extended to permit its threat (disagreement) point to be

determined endogenously as an equilibrium of a noncooperative        game of threat—

strategy selection.     This noncooperative     game is played prior to the Nash

bargaining game, and the equilibrium threats in our setting turn out to be the
                                            —2—




players'    initial endowments.      When the government redistributes, it changes

each player's endowment and, therefore, the equilibrium of the threat game.

Since the bargaining solution depends on the equilibrium of the threat game,

government redistribution,        in general, changes the outcome of the bargaining

game.

        Barro does not make explicit the game he models between an altruistic

parent and child, but in his formulation the child appears to be quite passive

and simply takes whatever transfer is given.         There is no scope for the child

to manipulate the parent by threatening to refuse transfers that are below a

specified    level and\or by threatening to transfer funds to the parent if the

parent is not sufficiently generous.         Stated differently, there is no scope

for strategies    associatedwith statements such as "If that's the best you can

do, forget it."     The apparent restrictions on the actions of children in the

Barro model become more apparent if parents not only love (are altruistic with

respect to) their children, but children love (are altruistic with respect to)

their parents.     While parents and children may care for each other, they are

unlikely to agree on the exact net amount to be transferred between them.            For

families with reciprocal altruism (presumably most families) the problem than

is one of competing altruism in which parents may be trying to transfer to

their children at the same time that the chLldren are trying to transfer to

their parents.     In such a setting the assumption that each player simply

accepts whatever is offered seems unrealistic.         Individuals seem equally

empowered both to make and to refuse gifts.2

        The next section,   II,   computes the Extended Nash Eargaining Solution to a

game involving a parent and child, at least one of whom is altruistic toward
                                                —3.—




the other.     Section    lI   shows why the solution will almost never be neutral

with respect to government redistribution between the two players.                    Section LV

discusses the differences between cooperative and noncooperative                  solutions    to

this game and suggests a way of distinguishing             empirically between the two.

Section V concludes       and presents ideas for future research that would expand

on the framework presented here.



II.   The Exten           isajnSoltiOn in a                 Two—PersonAruism ame

      There are two stages in the Extended Nash Sargaining                 Solution to this      -




altruism   game.    In the second stage the players agree to aaxmize the product

of their utility gains relative to the respective values of utility at the

threat point.3      From this maximization one can compute the indirect utility of

each player as a function of the threat point,                In the firat stage the players

choose threat strategies noncooperatively.              The payoffs in this stage are the

indirect utilities       for t:e point resulting from any pair of threat strategies.

Any noncooperative        (Nash) equilibrium of this first stage game generates,

therefore, a Pareto optimum in the second stage.                 It is well known (see, e.g.

Kalai and Rosenthal,       1978) that all equilibria        in   the.   first—stage game are

equivalent in the sense that they produce the same second—stage                   bargain.




  The Second Stage

      Equation     (1)   expresses the maximand, N, of the second stage.             The terms

in this stage.

where the functions u( ),             w(   ), m( ), and n(        )   are continuously

differentiable,         increasing, and concave.4

subject to the constraint that both factors in brackets on the right—hand side

of (1) be nonnegative.               Any solution to this maximization problem satisfies:

(5)          [u   (C)   —   v   (Ck)][m(Ck)

There    are two different ways equation (5) could be satisfied.                                  One way is for

both terms in (5) to be zero (i.e., at least one of the factors of each term

to be zero).         This can occur, for instance, if both parent and child remain at
                                                      —5—

the threat point or if the factors involving derivatives                                       zero.   The

second way is for the ratio of                                          (the first   factor in    square

by u'(x)—w'(E—x)

to right on the horizontal axis and                  C from right                     their sum being

fixed at E.          The first assumption ensures that the parent's and child's sost

                                   (their respective bliss points)            lie    between 0 and     E on
preferred allocations

the horizontal axis.               The second assumption ensures that the parent's

child's) bliss point involves more consumption by the parent (child) than

does the    childs         (parent's) bliss point.               Points A and B indicate allocations

corresponding         to the bliss points of the parent and child, respectively, Any

 allocation lying between points A and B, such as Z, is a Pareto—optimal

 allocation.

      As described below, the first—stage game leads to the determination of a

                         on the horizontal                      axis.    The threat values of the

where the ratio of the slope of          V to that of Vk equals minus       the ratio of the

parent's utility gain to the child's utility gain.                (The point D necessarily

lies between points A and B because to the left of A snd to the right of B the

slopes of         and Vk have the same sign, making their ratio nonnegative.)                Note

the right of the parent's bliss point the bargaining solution will again map

to a point between the two bliss points.             In the case that the child does noc

care about the parent (n(C)—O violating assumption i)), the graph

corresponding to Figure 1 is similar except that Vk rises monotonically

between CkO and ckE.

the parent offers a and accepts       fl   while    the child offers    -y   and accepts 6,

then min(m,8) — min(fl,-y) is the net transfer from parent to child.                  Since the

                                                           the second—stage
 threat—point allocation differs from the endowment point,

 one player and lower utility for the other than the second—stage solution
                                               —8—




 arising from the endowment threat.           Hence, as before, one player will resist

 any change in the threat point, and the endowment is an
                                                         equilibrium.



III.     The Failure of Ricardian Equivalence

        Ricardian Equivalence means that if there is a positive net transfer from

the parent (child) to the child (parent) both before and after the

government's redistribution,       the private transfer will be changed such that

the government's       redistribution has no real consequences.     This property
almost never holds for the model considered here.           To see this examine again

Figure 1.       For there to be a positive net transfer from one player to the

other both before and after the government's redistribution,          the endowment

must either lie initially to the left of point A-and remain to the left of

point A or lie initially to the right of point B and remain to the right of

point B.      A   government redistribution    that leaves the endowment to the left of

point    A   or leaves the endowment   to the right of point B, while it leaves

unchanged the direction of the bargained net transfer, will, nonetheless,

change the threat point in stage 1 and, therefore, the solution.

        In the Figure, government redistribution from the parent to the child

that moves the endowment point, and therefore the threat
                                                         point, from point R

to point Q moves the solution from point D to point J.           In the Figure, point J

lies to the right of D (though it need not in general).           Hence, the government

policy is successful in increasing both the consumptionand welfare of the

child; i.e., in this example, private transfers do not fully offset the

government's      transfers.

        Private transfers may. however, more than fully offset government

redistribution.       As an example, if the government redistributes     from the
                                           —9—




parent to the child by moving the endowment from point R to point M, the

solution will move from point D to a point between A and C.          The solution must

lie to the left of C because to the right of C the parent is made worse off

than remaining at the threat point K.        Compared with point 0, a solution to

the left of point C involves smaller net transfers to the child; i.e.          private

transfers more than offset the government's        transfers.   From the Figure it is

clear that, in general, if the government        redistributes enough to the net

recipient of private transfers, but not so much as to move the endowment         point

into the region between A and B, the private response will more than offset

the government policy.        Thus, if the government takes sway too much of the net

transferee's bargaining leverage, the net transferee will definitely end up

worse off.

      There can be isolated instances where the government's transfer is

exactly offset; here Ricardian Equivalence holds.         Also in the case A—B the

unique Pareto—optimal allocation is the solution in the second stage no matter

what transfers occur; hence, for this case Ricardian Equivalence holds.



IV.   Comoaring   the,   Extended Nash Bsrpaininz Solution to the Noncooperative

      Equilibrium

      In contrast to the Extended Nash Solution, the noncooperative equilibrium

in this same static framework does exhibit Ricardian Equivalence.5          In the

noncooperative equilibrium each player takes the other player's maximum offer

and acceptance as given and chooses his best response.          In terms of Figure 1

if the endowment point lies between points A and B, the only noncooperative

equilibrium is the same as the cooperative solution, resulting in each player
                                          —10—




consuming his endowment.       In this region the issue of Ricardian Equivalence

does not arise as there are no transfers before or after the government's

redistribution.    If the endowment lies to the left of point A the following

describes all the equilibria: The parent offers to transfer just enough funds

to the child to move the allocation to the parent's bliss point A and the

parent accepts nothing.        The child offers nothing and accepts the amount of

the parent's offer (or more).       The same reasoning indicates that if the

endowment point lies to the right of point B, all the noncooperative

equilibria require the child to transfer an amount sufficient to move the

allocation to point B and for the parent to accept this transfer,        Starting

from endowments to the left of A (or to the right of B), government

redistribution    that keeps    the endowment to the left of A (or to the right of

B) leaves unchanged the equilibrium outcome.       The players still move to the

same bliss point with the same utility payoffs.        Here Ricardian Equivalence

holds.

     One might argue that the noncooperative       solution is more plausible   than

the cooperative solution.        Rather than agree to play the cooperative game, why

doesn't the potential net transferor simply call the other player's bluff.

For example, if the endowment lies to the left of point A, why doesn't the
                                                            doesn't the chti
parent simply tell the child "take it or leave it," and why

simply take it.     One answer is that since the child knows the parent's

altruistic utility,    the child calls the parent's bluff.     This assumes the

parent has no last—mover advantage (but we have been abstracting from the fine

details of the bargaining process throughout; see Section V).

     Another answer may be that the child cares about the bargaining procea

as well as the outcome.        If the child feels he is being toLd tek.e it or    le'
                                            —11—




it," he may leave it because he resents being treated in that manner.                The

child may also feel a loss of pride in accepting a transfer, so the transfer

may need to be conveyed to the child in a manner that preserves the child's

pride.   Maintenance   of the child's pride may require the parent to pursue

cooperative bargaining.     In the cooperative game modeled here the parent and

child know 1) that they are going to meet and try to work out a transfer

                                                                   end up
arrangement and 2) that if they don't reach an agreement they will

consuming what they brought into the meeting.            The issue of pride may not onl


require that they meet, it may also enforce the post—meeting threat;
                                                                     i.e. ,                th

threat, if the meeting breaks down to consume only what one brought into the

                                     loss in pride associated with giving in
meeting, may be credible if there is

after threatening not to give in.

     A usual argument favoring cooperative rules (i.e.          ,   that   binding

                                                    Pareto improvements over
agreements are possible) is the objective of making

non—optimal outcomes.     In the model presented here, however, the

noncooperativeequilibria happen to be Pareto optimal, so Pareto improvementE

do not justify the cooperative solution.           However, extensions of the model

lead to cases in which the noncooperative          equilibrium is not Pareto optimal.

As an example, take the case in which the parent has two children each of wh

cares about the parent, but who are not altruistic           toward each other.      Also

                                                   toward the children.       In this case
suppose that the parent is not altruistic

the noncooperative     equilibrium,   if   it involves   both children transferring to

the parent, will not be Pareto optimal (see Nerlove, Razin, Sadka, 1984).                  I

                                                             external benefi
uaking thair transfers to the parent, each child ignores the

to the other.    As a consequence, the noncooperative equilibrium involves too

little being transferred to the parent.
                                          —12-—




      One way to test empirically the cooperative model against the

noncooperativemodel is to determine whether the distribution of consumption

among family members who are partiea to net transfers depends on the

distribution of initial resources among these members,                  For example, suppose

one              of parents each transferring to his child, According to the
      had a sample

cooperative model presented here, the distribution of endowments batween the
parent and child will affect the distribution of consumption tatween the

parent and child.      Such is not the case      in the noncooparative nodal.


V,    Ideas for Future Reaearth and Cnuctusior.

      This article demonstrates that Ricardian tc;chzaienca does not necassa

hold in models with altruistic transfers once one takes into account the

strategic behavior of recipients      as 'coil        boncas.     The model we have oath

make thispoint is, however, static and           ;oioitlv   stylized.     It does not take

into account that parents and chilbzeo can bargain over many perioda and that

their bargaining positions may depati       cc.   their life expectancies.         It also

takes a particular view of both      ho   bargainingprocess and the strategies

available   to the players    (althoooh acre realistic alternatives            are not

obvious).    Finally, it does not consider how the bargaining nutcome is

affected by the presence of more than one child and/or mora than one parent.

       Specifying    alternative noncooperative      and cooperative strategic—altruism

models in finer detail may represent a fruitful line of research.                  We suspect

that for the most part such models will not, however, satisfy Ricardian

Equivalence because,      as in the cooperative model of this paper, interior

transfers can result fromnon—interior strategic postures and because non—
                                    —13—




interior strategies (e.g., accepting nothing) are likely to be aspects of

equilibria.

2 Abel (1987) and Kimball (1987) rule out the refusal of gifts a priori.    In
their analyses of "two way" altruism they develop conditions on preferences
that will, in part, ensure that transfers are never tofusad in a
noncooperative game in which each player chooses transfers taking the
