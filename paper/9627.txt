Scientific research has come to dominate many American universities. Even with growing external
support, increasingly the costs of scientific research are being funded out of internal university

funds. Our paper explains why this is occuring, presents estimates of the magnitudes of start-up cost
packages being provided to scientists and engineers and then uses panel data to estimate the impact
of the growing cost of science on student/faculty ratios, faculty salaries and undergraduate

tuition.We find that universities whose own expenditures on research are growing the most rapidly,
ceteris paribus, have had the greatest increase in student faculty ratios and, in the private sector,
higher tuition increases. Thus, undergraduate students bear part of the cost of increased institutional
expenditures on research.

   I.      Introduction

   Scientific research has come to dominate many American university campuses. The

growing importance of science has been accompanied by a growing flow of funds to

universities to support research from federal and state government, corporate and

foundation sources. What is not well known, however, is that an increasing share of the

costs of the research at universities is being funded out of internal university funds. So it

is natural for us to ask who bears the growing cost of the internal funds spent on research

at universities?

        We begin in the next section by sketching the reason for the growing cost of

scientific research at universities and the reasons for the growing share of universities’

research costs that are funded out of internal university resources. The latter include

changes in federal indirect reimbursement cost policies and the growing cost of start-up

funds for new faculty. We present evidence on the magnitude of start-up costs that

universities face for new researchers in science and engineering fields from a survey that

we undertook during the summer of 2002 of department chairs, deans and vice presidents

of research at over 200 public and private research universities.

        Our paper then turns to an estimation of who bears the costs of internal research

expenditures. Using panel data for a 21 year period for 228 research universities, we

estimate in the next section the impact of growing internal university expenditures on

research on student/faculty ratios and the substitution of lecturers for tenure track faculty,

on average faculty salaries and on tuition levels. Perhaps our most important findings are

that universities whose research expenditures per faculty member have been growing the

most rapidly in absolute terms, other factors held constant, exhibit the greatest increase in




                                              1
student/faculty ratios and, in the private sector, the largest increases in tuition levels. So

while undergraduate students may benefit from being in close proximity to great

researchers, they also bear part of the growing costs of research in the form of larger class

sizes, fewer full-time professorial rank faculty members and higher tuition levels.

However, the magnitudes of these effects are quite small.

            Finally, in the brief concluding section, we speculate on future directions that

research on the impact of the growing cost of science on academic institutions might take

and also about whether the growing efforts by universities to commercialize their faculty

members’ research may yield sufficient revenues to begin to offset the universities’

increasing costs of scientific research.



      II.      The Growing Importance and Costs of Science

      Scientific research has come to dominate many American university campuses and

this is reflected in the way universities are ranked. U.S News & World Report’s annual

ranking of national universities as undergraduate institutions places heavy weight on the

institutions’ expenditures per student and research expenditures are included in this total.1

      The 1994 Carnegie Foundation classification of PhD granting institutions into

Research I, Research II, Doctoral I and Doctoral II institutions was heavily based on the

institutions’ volumes of external research funding and institutions strove mightily to

increase their funding to receive a higher classification in the next Carnegie classification

revision.2 Concerned that universities were placing too much weight on the volume of

their faculty members’ external research funding and not enough on the quality of their

                                                   2
graduate programs, Carnegie collapsed its four PhD institution categories into two in

2000 and based a university’s classification solely on the number of PhDs that the

institution produced each year.3 Over 150 institutions are now included in the category

doctoral extensive, which includes those institutions that produce the greatest number of

doctoral degrees per year. This total is up from the 87 institutions that were classified as

Research I in Carnegie’s 1994 classification.

     As a result of this change, the 2000 classification “watered down” the prestige that

universities received from being included among the institutions in Carnegie’s “top”

university category. Not surprisingly, major research universities increasingly turned to

their membership in the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU), an

association of 63 major research universities, to stress their prestige and research

universities that were not currently members of the AAU increasingly sought to be

admitted.4 While the specific criteria for being considered for membership in the AAU

are not public, an institution’s volume of external research funding is clearly important.

    Viewed in terms of 1998 dollars, the weighted (by faculty size) average volume of

total research and development expenditures per faculty member across 228 American

research and doctoral universities increased from about $70,000 per faculty member in

1970-1971 to about $142,340 per faculty member in 1999-2000.5 This growth in

scientific research, which was fueled by the availability of funding from government,

corporate and foundation sources, did not derive primarily from the various ranking and

  For example, on the page of its World Wide Web Site titled “Claims to Fame”, Stony Brook University
declares, “As one of the only two universities invited this year to join the Association of American
Universities (AAU), Stony Brook becomes one of 63 members that includes such institutions as Harvard,
Yale, Johns Hopkins, Princeton and Stanford.” (http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/claims)

  The figures that follow are all computed from the NSF WEBCASPAR system (http://caspar.nsf.gov).

classification schemes, but rather from the major advances being made in science and the

importance of these advances to our society.

      To take but one example, recent advances in decoding the human genome, in

advanced materials and in information sciences promise major advances in health care

treatment in the years ahead. Any university worth its salt wants to be a leader in these

fields so that it can attract top faculty, undergraduate and graduate students, increase its

research funding for its programs and potentially achieve financial returns by

commercializing its faculty members research (a point we return to below). To illustrate

the attention that institutions are paying to promoting the value of their faculty members’

research to society, table 1 summarizes the titles of some of the press releases issued by

our own university during the first 9 months of 2002 that deal with faculty research in the

health and nutrition area.

      What is not well recognized, however, is that in spite of generous external support for

research, increasingly the costs of research are being borne by the universities

themselves. During the 1970-1971 to 1999-2000 period, the weighted average

institutional expenditure on research per faculty member at the 228 universities more than

tripled. As a result, the weighted average percentage of total research expenditures per

faculty member being financed out of institutional funds rose from 11.2 percent to 20.7

percent during the period (figure 1). Increasingly the academic institutions themselves are

bearing a greater share of the ever-increasing costs of scientific research.

      There are a number of forces that have led to the costs of research borne by

universities to soar over the past three decades.6 Theoretical scientists, who in a previous

generation required only desks and pencils and paper, now often require supercomputers.
6
    These forces are discussed in more detail in Ehrenberg (2000, chapter 6) and Ehrenberg (2003).


                                                      4
Experimental scientists increasingly rely on sophisticated laboratory facilities that are

increasingly expensive to build and operate. Research administration now includes strict

monitoring of financial records and environmental safety, as well as the detailed review

and monitoring of experiments involving human subjects.

    Historically the federal government and other external funders, through the provision

of indirect cost recoveries, have funded much of the research infrastructure that

universities operate, as well as their research administration costs. Each institution was

allowed to mark-up the direct costs that its faculty members requested from external

funders for research support by a multiple called the indirect cost rate and the indirect

cost revenues received on successful grant applications went to support the institution’s

research administration and infrastructure costs. However, after a well-publicized case

involving Stanford University in the early 1990s, government auditors began to take a

much harder look at universities’ requests for indirect cost recoveries and put caps on the

expenses that universities could claim for expenses in a number of areas. As a result, the

average indirect cost rate at private research and doctoral universities, which was over 60

percent in 1983, fell to about 55% in 1997 and has remained near that level ever since

then.7 On average, for any given level of direct cost research funding which their faculty

members received, these private universities received 8.3% less funds from the federal

government to support their research infrastructure and administrative costs in 1997 and

thereafter than they did in 1983.



7
  Indirect cost rates at the public research and doctoral universities were lower at the start of the period and
actually rose slightly during the period. The lower initial rates were due to many publics not having to
return funds to their state that the state had spent constructing new research facilities. The increase came
about because declining state support for operating budgets of public higher education made it more
important for the public universities to try to tap all available potential sources of revenue (Ehrenberg
(2000, 2003).


                                                       5
   What is the likely response of an institution faced with such a reduction in external

support for research infrastructure and administration? On the one hand, it might try to

reduce its expenditures in these areas to match the decline in the external support for

research that it was receiving. But such a strategy would alienate its faculty who would

view the institution’s commitment to research as declining. In addition, if the reductions

were made in areas in which the institution was not spending more than the maximum

that the federal auditors would allow it to recover, the auditors would further respond by

lowering its indirect cost rate in the following year. So invariably private university

administrators made up for the reduction in external funding for research administration

and infrastructure by increasing their own institutional commitments.

   In recent years the federal government has also placed increasing pressure on all

universities to provide “matching” institutional funds for any research proposals that they

submit. While universities try to provide matching funds out of funds that they would

have spent for research even in the absence of a new external grant, they can not always

get away with doing this, especially for large center grant proposals. Put another way, to

compete for external funding, increasingly institutions have had to bear an increasing

share of the direct costs of their faculty members’ research out of their own pockets.

   Finally, as scientists’ equipment became more expensive and the competition for top-

quality scientists intensified, the start-up funding that universities needed to provide to

attract young scientists increased. Universities typically cannot recover these expenses in

their indirect cost revenues billings, because the new scientists rarely have external

funding when they first arrive at the university. During the late 1990s, it was often

alleged, although no systematic data existed to support this claim, that universities were




                                              6
providing young scientists in the range of $250,000 to $500,000 to set up their labs. The

start up costs of attracting distinguished senior scientists was often alleged to be much

greater and even if these senior faculty members had federally funded research grants,

these costs too were often not recoverable in indirect cost recovery pools because the

institutions faced caps on their recoveries in a number of categories.

   Because no systematic data on start up costs has previously been collected, the

Cornell Higher Education Research Institute conducted a “Survey of Start Up Costs and

Laboratory Space Allocation Rules” at research and doctoral universities during the

summer of 2002. We surveyed the chairs of 3 to 6 narrowly defined science and

engineering departments at each institution, the deans of the colleges in which each of

these departments were located and the vice president or vice provosts for research in

each university. In total 1031 department chairs, 408 deans, and 206 vice presidents or

vice provosts received survey questionnaires.

    These questionnaires began by describing things that are generally included as start

up costs (such as construction or renovation of labs, materials and equipment, support for

laboratory staff, graduate assistants or postdoctoral fellows, summer salaries for the

faculty member, reduced teaching loads, travel money, unrestricted research funding) and

then asked respondents to provide information on the average and/or range of start up

costs that they incur for new assistant professors and senior faculty members in their

field, on the most expensive sub field in their discipline, on the sources of funding for

start up costs, and on the types of laboratory space allocation rules that their units used.

   Full results from this survey are available on the Cornell Higher Education Research

Institute World Wide Web page (www.ilr.cornell.edu/cheri ). Table 2 summarizes some




                                              7
of the information from the responses of the 572 department chairs (representing a

response rate of 55.0 percent) that we received. The department are grouped her into four

broad areas – physics/astronomy, biology, chemistry and engineering – and data are

reported separately for private Research I, private other, public Research I and public

other universities.

    Chairs were asked to report either the average start up costs for faculty, or the range

of costs for faculty, that they had experienced in the last year or two. Some reported both

measures. Table 2 presents the average mean start up costs that the chairs reported for

new assistant professors and senior faculty, as well as the average of the high end costs

that they reported; in each case the numbers in parentheses are the number of reporting

departments in the category.8

    Table 2 suggests that, with few exceptions, at the new assistant professor level

Research I universities provide larger start up packages than other universities and private

universities provide larger start up packages than public universities. Average start up

costs for assistant professors at private Research I universities in the four fields varied

between $390,237 and $489,000.9 Estimate of the average high-end (most expensive)

assistant professor start up cost package at the private Research I universities varied

across fields between $416,875 and $580,000.

    Start up cost packages for senior faculty members are considerably larger. For

example, for the private Research I universities, the average start up costs varied across

fields from a low of about $700,000 in physics to a high of about $1,442,000 in

engineering. While in general the same pattern of results holds that holds for new

 When only a range was reported, we used the midpoint of the range for the average.

 Due to the large variability of the size of start up cost packages across institutions in a given field, the
differences that we observe between fields (here and below) are not statistically significant.

assistant professors, namely that packages at Research I universities are larger than

packages at non-Research I universities and packages at privates are larger than packages

at publics, sometimes at the senior level start up costs are larger at Research I publics

than at Research I privates. This may reflect efforts by some publics to move to a higher

level by bringing in a few key senior faculty members. In any event, start up costs are

clearly a major expense faced by American universities.



       III.    Who Pays for the Growing Importance and Cost of Science?

      How have universities responded to the growing importance and costs of science? One

might expect that the growing importance of science has provided an incentive for

universities to allocate a greater share of their faculty positions or faculty salary dollars,

to scientists. However, using data from a set of arts and sciences colleges at leading

private research universities, prior work by one of us concluded that over a 20-year

period neither the share of faculty positions nor the share of the faculty salary budget

devoted to scientists had increased at these colleges.10 Controlling for the growth of

enrollments in the various disciplines or for whether overall faculty size was increasing

or decreasing at each college, did not alter these conclusions.

      Of course it may well be that the increasing cost of science is felt throughout a

university’s budget. Colleges of Arts and Sciences may receive a declining share of their

university’s total faculty positions, even if enrollment changes do not warrant this loss, as

more positions are allocated to science intensive engineering and medical colleges. This

particular hypothesis is difficult to test because some faculty in the latter two types of



10
     Ehrenberg and Epifantseva (2001)


                                                9
colleges, especially in medical colleges, are funded on soft money that they raise

themselves.

     More generally, to the extent that the other sources of income that a university

receives, such as state appropriations, annual giving, and endowment income are directed

toward supporting an increasingly large scientific infrastructure, this may put upward

pressure on undergraduate tuition or cause the university to cut back its expenditures on

other areas. Inasmuch as the faculty salary bill represents a large chunk of institutional

costs, it is possible that the increasing costs of science are distributed throughout the

university in the form of slower rates of increase in faculty salaries and/or in the form of

an increase in the student/faculty ratio above the level that would otherwise prevail, all

other factors held constant. It is to tests of these hypotheses that we now turn.11

     A. Does the Increasing Cost of Science Cause a Cutback in Full-time Faculty?

     Table 3 uses data from a panel of 228 research and doctoral universities during the

1976-77 to 1997-98 period to explain why an institution’s ratio of full-time equivalent

undergraduate and graduate students to its full-time professorial ranked faculty varies

over time.12 The explanatory variables, all measured in 1998 dollars, are the institution’s

research expenditures per professorial ranked faculty out of its own internal funds, the

share of its enrollments that are in PhD and nonprofessional masters programs, the level

of contributions that it received during the year from all sources per student, its

endowment per student, and its state appropriation per student. Undergraduate tuition and

12
   Professorial ranked faculty members include assistant, associate and full professors.


                                                    10
fees levels are omitted as an explanatory variable because they are treated as an

endogenous outcome in our work.

     All equations also include institutional fixed effects and, as a result, our estimates

indicate the impacts of changes over time in the explanatory variables on student/faculty

ratios. Separate estimates are provided for private and for public universities and, for

each sample, we estimate models without and with year fixed effects. The inclusion of

year fixed effects allows for the possibilities that there are omitted macro level variables

that influence student/faculty ratios and our other outcomes and we view these estimates

as our preferred estimates.13

     Our key finding is found in the first row of the table. Other factors held constant,

universities whose research expenditures are increasing the fastest in absolute terms are

also the ones whose student/faculty ratios are increasing the fastest. The magnitude of the

relationship is greater in the specification that includes year fixed effects for private

universities than it is for publics and we cannot reject the hypothesis for the former that

each $10,000 increase in internal research expenditures per faculty member is associated

with an increase in the student/faculty ratio of close to 0.5 . During the period the

weighted average real institutional research expenditure per faculty member at the private

universities in the sample increased from about $7.7 to $17.5 thousand dollars. So on

average, the increase in internal research expenditures per faculty member at the privates

has caused an increase in student/faculty ratios at them of close to 0.5 during the period,




13
  For example, increases in the unemployment rate may increase students’ financial need, which in turn
will put pressure on institution’s financial aid budgets and influences the salaries that it can afford to pay its
faculty and its student/faculty ratio.


                                                       11
as compared to what the student/faculty ratios would have been if the increase in internal

research expenditures had not taken place.14

     The magnitude of the relationship is somewhat lower for the public university

sample, .130 in the specification that includes year fixed effects. However, the growth in

absolute terms of real research expenditures per faculty member out of internal university

funds has been larger for the public universities; the weighted average for public

universities in the sample rose from about $7.6 to $31.3 during the period. Hence the

impact of the increase in public universities expenditures on research out of their own

funds on student/faculty ratios has probably been somewhat smaller, increasing, other

factors held constant, by about 0.3 during the period.

     Our estimates of the impact of changing internal expenditures on research on the

student/faculty ratio prove to be robust to a number of specification changes. Including

full-time equivalent student enrollments on the right hand side of the equation did not

alter the finding. When we used five-year averages for each institution to capture longer-

run changes we found larger student/faculty ratio effects, although they tended to be less

statistically significant because of the reduction in our sample sizes.

     When we repeated the analyses, using total full-time faculty (including lecturers and

instructors) in the denominator of the student/faculty ratio rather than professorial ranked

faculty, similar positive coefficients on the research expenditure per faculty member

variable were obtained. However, the magnitudes of these coefficients were somewhat

smaller than the coefficients in the first row of table 3 in most of the specifications.

Hence while the data suggest that an increase in research expenditures per ranked faculty


14
   Appendix figure 1 indicates that during the sample period, student faculty ratios actually only rose
slightly at private Research I universities and fell at other private universities in our sample.


                                                     12
member probably does lead to some substitution of full-time lecturers and instructors for

professorial ranked faculty, the ratio of students to all faculty (including the lecturers and

instructors) also increases when institutional expenditures on research per ranked faculty

member increases.

   Briefly mentioning other findings from table 3, in the main year-to-year changes in

total giving per student do not appear to significantly alter an institution’s student/faculty

ratio. Increases in endowment per student are associated with increases in student/faculty

ratios for the private research universities but decreases in student/faculty ratios for the

public research universities. Increases in the levels of state appropriations per student are

similarly associated with decreases in student/faculty ratios for the public universities.

   What is striking is the impact of changing the share of the total student body enrolled

in PhD and nonprofessional masters programs. In the private institutions, growing the

share of these programs is associated, other factors held constant, with a higher

student/faculty ratio, while in the public institutions it is associated with a lower

student/faculty ratio. The private result is intuitive; growing PhD programs may require

more money for graduate assistantships and the substitution of graduate assistants for

full-time faculty. The public finding is less intuitive. A number of states provide more

resources per student to public universities for graduate students than undergraduate

students and this might lead to a lower student/faculty ratio. However, we have already

controlled for state appropriations per student in our model, so this cannot be the

explanation for this finding.




                                              13
    B. Does the Increasing Cost of Science Cause a Slow Down in Faculty Salary

        Increases?

    Table 4 provides estimates of equations similarly specified to those found in table 3,

save that the dependent variable is now the real weighted (across ranks) average faculty

salary at the institution. Focusing on the specifications with year fixed effects, for both

types of institutions we find evidence that increasing an institution's internal research

expenditures per faculty member leads, other factors equal, to higher (not lower) faculty

salaries. This may reflect reverse causality – high paid faculty members with strong

research records being recruited and requiring (see the previous section) considerable

funding for start up costs.

    Increases in giving levels per student and endowment per student are associated for

privates with greater increases in faculty salaries. Similarly increases in state

appropriations per student are associated in public universities with increases in average

faculty salaries. An increase in the share of students that are in PhD or nonprofessional

masters programs is associated with higher average salaries in both sectors; this may

again reflect the university’s need to hire better and more highly paid faculty with larger

PhD programs.

    C. Does the Increasing Cost of Science Cause Increases in Tuition Levels?

    Table 5 provides similarly specified equations, save that now the dependent variable

is the institution’s real tuition level. The results suggest that private universities that

increase their expenditures per faculty member out of their own funds on research, other

factors held constant also increase their tuition levels at higher rates. However, the

magnitude of the relationship differs substantially in the models with and without year




                                               14
fixed effects. Treating the two coefficients as upper and lower bounds to the true

relationship, given that the weighted average internal expenditures on research at private

universities in the sample increased by about $10,000 per faculty member over the

period, our estimates suggest that undergraduate tuition levels at these institution were

between $165 and $945 higher in real terms in 1998 than they otherwise would have

been. While we view the lower bound estimate, the one coming from the model that

included year fixed effects, as the preferred one, even the larger estimate is small

compared to the average tuition and fee level of over $20,000 that prevailed at selective

private research universities in that year.

     All the models suggest that as the share of PhD and nonprofessional masters’

students’ increases at these universities that tuition levels also increase, other factors held

constant. During the period, these shares rose, on average, from .240 to .306 at the private

research universities and from .145 to .178 at the public research universities. Our

estimates thus imply that tuition levels at the private research universities were between

$336 (model with year fixed effects) and $2049 (model without year fixed effects), and

those at the public research universities between $50 (model with year fixed effects) and

$299 (model without year fixed effects) higher at the end of the period, in real terms, than

would otherwise have been the case.

     Hence, other factors held constant, undergraduate students bear some of the cost of

increased size PhD programs in the form of higher tuitions.15 We place greater weight on

the lower bound estimates that are based on models that include year fixed effects,


15
  We should stress, in keeping with the views of Gordon Winston (1999), that we are not saying that
undergraduate students are subsidizing Ph.D. students. Rather, all students attending the research
universities receive subsidies and growing the relative size of Ph.D. programs simply reduces the size of
the monetary subsidy that undergraduate students receive.


                                                    15
because omitted macro level variables, such as family income, influence students’

financial need and ability to afford to attend college, and thus likely influence tuition.

Hence the costs that the undergraduate students bear are probably not very large. In

addition, if growing PhD programs attract better faculty to universities, undergraduate

students may also benefit from increases in the relative size of these programs.

     Increased annual giving per student and increased endowment per student are both

statistically significantly associated with higher levels of tuition per student. Higher

levels of endowment and annual giving provide increased subsidies for students, increase

the attractiveness of the university to students and hence should increase the tuition levels

that students are willing to pay to attend the university.16 Results for the increase in state

appropriations per student are more mixed, without the inclusion of year fixed effects

state appropriations per student are positively associated with tuition increases in the

public sector, but in the preferred specification, when the year effects are included, the

relationship becomes negative. 17

     D. Some Sensitivity Analyses

     Tables 6, 7 and 8 provide two different types of sensitivity analysis for the impact of

changes in institutional expenditures on research per faculty member on student/faculty

ratios, average faculty salaries and tuition levels, respectively. First, we test whether the

relationship differs across Research I and other universities in the sample. Second, we see

16
   Again see Gordon Winston’s (1999). Empirical evidence that in-state and out-of-state tuition levels are
positively associated with levels of endowment per student at public university is also found in Rizzo and
Ehrenberg (forthcoming).
17
   Of the 23 private research universities receiving state appropriations, 14 were in New York State and
under the Bundy Aid program these institutions received grants for each New York State resident who
received a degree from them. During the sample period, the real value of the Bundy aid per graduate
declined, as did the share of their graduates coming from New York State. Thus, the negative coefficient of
the state aid variable in the private tuition equation may simply reflect the increased need for tuition
revenue that they faced as this source of revenue was falling. Once we control for year specific effects, this
negative coefficient becomes statistically insignificant for private institutions.


                                                     16
how the estimated relationships differ when we estimate a more complex model in which

changes in annual giving, research per faculty member out of external funds and state

appropriations are treated as endogenous.

       Our changes in external research per faculty member equation allows these changes

to depend upon changes that the institution makes in institutional research expenditures

per faculty member (through the route of start-up costs, matching funds and more general

research infrastructure support), changes in the national research budgets that different

government agencies are receiving, and the shares of external research funding in the

prior year that an institution received from the various agencies. So, for example, holding

the change in institutional research funding constant, institutions that derive a greater

share of their external research budget from NIH should see greater increases in their

external research funding than institutions that derive a greater share of their research

funding from NSF, when the NIH research budget rises relative to the NSF research

budget.

       Previous research has shown that at private research universities higher levels of total

research spending per faculty member are associated with higher levels of annual

giving.18 So we also estimate a change in annual giving equation that allows this change

to depend upon the change in total research expenditures per faculty member at the

institution. Finally, some states explicitly or implicitly reward institutions for increasing

their volumes of external research funding and so we estimate changes in state

appropriations per student equations that are specified to depend upon institutions’

changes in external research volume per faculty member.

   In the context of this more complex model, a change in internal research expenditures

per faculty member will directly affect each of our three outcomes and indirectly affect

them through its effect on the change in external research expenditures, which in turn

may affect state appropriations per student and (along with the change in institutional

research expenditures per student) annual giving per student.

   Table 6 presents estimates of the coefficient of the internal research expenditures per

faculty member variable in the student/faculty equation for various models. The top row

of the first two columns (under “baseline”), reports the coefficient estimates from table 3.

The next two rows report similar coefficients when the data are stratified into to Research

I and other institutions. Statistically significant effects on the student/faculty ratio appear

primarily for the Research I universities.

   The next four columns display the estimated coefficients of the internal research

expenditure per faculty member variable when first giving and external research

expenditures and then these two variables plus state appropriations are treated as

endogenous in the model. The coefficients of the internal research expenditure variables

are remarkably robust to the two sets of endogenity assumptions.

   Table 7 presents the similar coefficient estimates from the faculty salary equation.

Changes in internal research expenditures per faculty member are positively associated

with changes in faculty salaries primarily at public institutions, with the magnitude of the

effects being largest at the Non Research I institutions, the ones that probably need to

offer higher salaries to attract more research oriented faculty. Again, treating changes in

annual giving, external research expenditures and state appropriations as endogenous,

does not substantially alter any of these coefficients.




                                              18
   Finally, table 8 presents the coefficient of the internal research expenditure per

faculty member variable in the tuition equation. The major finding here is that it is the

non Research I private institutions at which the largest impacts on tuition is observed.

Again treating the changes in annual giving, external research expenditures and state

appropriations as endogenous does not substantially alter any of the coefficients.

   To compute the total impact of changes in institutional research expenditures on each

outcome requires us to know the impact of changes in internal research expenditures on

external research expenditures, changes in external research expenditures on state

appropriations and changes in total research expenditures on annual giving per students.

Appendix table 1 summarizes the key coefficients that we obtained. For example, at the

private research universities giving per student increases by about $395 in response to

each $10,000 per faculty member increase in total research volume and external research

expenditures per faculty member increase by about $17,300 for each $10,000 increase in

institutional research expenditures per faculty member, all other variables held constant.

We find, however, no evidence that increases in external research volume per faculty

member is statistically significantly related to state appropriations per student.

   One can then use these coefficients, as well as the coefficients from the outcome

models that were previously reported to compute the total effect of changes in internal

research expenditures per faculty members on each of the outcomes. These are the direct

effects that operate through the coefficient of this variable in each equation, as well as the

indirect effects that operate through the effects of changes in institutional expenditures on

research per faculty member on the other variables that we treated as endogenous.




                                             19
   Table 9 summarizes our findings. The row titled “basic model” summarizes the

effects that we obtained from the baseline models that were presented in tables 6, 7 and 8.

The following rows summarize the direct effects, the indirect effects and the total effects

from the model that allows for the endogenity of external research per faculty member,

annual giving and state appropriations. The magnitudes of the effects in the total effects

row are very similar to the magnitudes of the effects in the basic model row. On balance,

treating these other variables as endogenous does not alter any of our main findings.

   IV.     Concluding Remarks

   Our research suggests that undergraduate students bear at least part of the increased

costs that American universities are undertaking for their faculty members’ scientific

research in the forms of higher student-faculty ratios, some substitution of lecturers for

professorial rank faculty and, in private universities, higher tuition levels. However, the

magnitudes of these effects are surprisingly (to us) small. Whether these costs are more

than offset by the benefits the students receive from being educated in proximity to

scientific researchers who are at the cutting edge of their disciplines is an open question

that deserves serious study.

   Our research also suggests that as the share of PhD students and nonprofessional

masters’ students increases at both the public and private research universities that

undergraduate tuition also increases at these universities, other factors held constant.

While Gordon Winston’s (1999) work indicates that no undergraduate student at a major

university bears the full cost of his or her education, our results suggest the

undergraduates bear a part of the cost of graduate education, in the sense that the average

subsidy (in Winston’s terms) that they receive from attending the university is lower




                                              20
because of the presence of more graduate students. Again whether these costs are more

than offset by the benefits that the students receive from being educated close to (and

sometimes by) graduate students is an open question deserving of serious study.

     Our study has only begun to touch on the impact on the university that institutions’

growing cost of science has had. The relatively small impacts that we observed on

student/faculty ratios may mask decreases in scientists teaching loads that have taken

place, which in turn may have led to larger class sizes. The growth of science may have

crowded out other things. For example, increased institutional support for teaching or

research assistants for scientists and for stipends for graduate students in the sciences

may have led to decreased availability of funds to support teaching assistants or graduate

students on fellowships for humanists and social scientists, or slower rates of growth of

graduate student stipends in these fields.19 Or to take another example, increased

institutional support for scientific research facilities and start-up costs for scientists may

have reduced the funding that otherwise would have been available for travel and other

“perks” in the humanities and social sciences.

     It is possible, of course, that the increasing costs of research that are borne by

universities may be eventually at least partially offset by revenues that the universities

receive from increased commercialization of their faculty members’ research. The

Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) reported in their fiscal year

2000 survey of their members that American colleges and universities received more than

$1 billion dollars in licensing income and other forms of royalties relating to patents that

year. While this figure seems large, it was concentrated in a few large “winners”; 90% of

19
   It is not surprising that the leaders of the growing movement to union graduate assistants on private
university campuses tend to be graduate students from the humanities and soft social sciences (Ehrenberg
et. al forthcoming).


                                                   21
the universities in their sample received less than $2 million and almost half received less

than $1 million.20

     Licensing income received in one year depends upon the flow of investments in

research that universities have made in the past. If we ignore this and the fact that the

return on any particular research project may occur for a number of years in the future, a

simple way of looking at the commercial returns that universities receive from their

faculty members’ research is to ask how the licensing income received by a university in

one year relates to its own expenditures on research in that year. Licensing income

received in fiscal year 2000 averaged 3.23% of total research expenditures in the year

across the institutions in the AUTM sample. As we have noted, universities fund about

20% of their research expenditures out of their own resources, which suggests that

licensing income averaged about 16% of institutions’ research expenditures out of

internal university funds in the year.

     At first glance this seems like a significant return but this calculation is misleading for

at least three reasons. First, the licensing income that universities receive is divided

between the university and the researchers. So only a share of the revenue actually comes

to the university itself. Second, focusing on the average ratio ignores the skewness in the

distribution of research returns. The median institution in the sample licensing income

was 0.83% of its total research revenue, which is about 4.2% of its internal volume of

research expenditures. Third, given the volume of a university’s research, licensing

income and other forms of revenue from patents that are related to this research do not

simply fall off trees. Rather, they must be “harvested”. Considerable efforts must be

  See Blumenstyk (2002a). Some of these large winners were universities that cashed in equity positions
that they had taken in companies, in lieu of receiving licensing income.

made by universities and their faculty members to decide if faculty members’ discoveries

have potential commercial value, to patent the discoveries, to then develop or seek

partners to develop commercial potential, to negotiate licenses or equity positions, and to

enforce patents.21 All of these activities take resources. Indeed, the cost of trying to

enforce patents alone can prove very expensive.22

     While no comprehensive source of data on the costs that universities occur in trying

to generate licensing income is currently available, summary information from the

AUTM licensing survey permits us to make some back of the envelope calculations.

During fiscal year 2000, the 142 U.S universities in the AUTM sample employed a total

of 479.95 “licensing” full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) and 494.53 other FTEs in

their technology transfer offices. They also incurred $117,927,842 in legal fees, of which

third parties reimbursed only $53,685,716.23 Hence these universities’ net legal fees for

technology transfer activities were roughly $64 million and they employed a total of

about 975 employees. These employees include patent attorneys, other professionals and

support staff. If we assume that the fully loaded costs of each employee (salaries,

benefits, office space etc.) averaged $100,000 that year, the total expenses of technology

transfer activities for these institutions were in the range of $161.5 million dollars, or an

average of about $1.15 million per university.

     Maintaining the assumption that the average fully loaded cost of each employee was

$100,000, the AUTM survey responses allow us to compute an estimate of the net

licensing income (income after expenses) for 138 of the universities in the sample. The

mean net licensing income in this sample was $6,554,200, but the median was only

$343,952. By our calculations 51 of the 138 institutions actually lost income that year on

their commercialization activities and we estimate that the median net licensing income

for the 87 that made money was $1,309,828. When one remembers that the licensing

income received by universities is split between them and the faculty members whose

patents have generated the income, it seems clear that commercialization of research has

yet to provide most universities with large amounts of net income to support the

universities’ scientific research activities.
