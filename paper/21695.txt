                                             ABSTRACT

Using an incentivized measure of test for competition, this paper investigates whether this taste explains
subsequent gender differences in earnings and industry choice in a sample of high-ability MBA graduates.
We find that “competitive” individuals earn 9% more than their less competitive counterparts do. Moreover,
gender differences in taste for competition explain around 10% of the overall gender gap. We also
find that competitive individuals are more likely to work in high-paying industries nine years later,
which suggests that the relation between taste for competition and earnings persists in the long run.
Lastly, we find that the effect of taste for competition emerges over time when MBAs and firms interact
with each other.

1. Introduction
There exist important differences in the choices and resulting labor market outcomes of men and

women (Bertrand, 2011). Particularly prominent are the gender differences in compensation and
representation in the highest paid jobs (e.g., Azmat, Güell, and Manning, 2004; Arulampalam, Booth,
and Bryan, 2007). At the top of the corporate ladder, for example, women represented only 6.5% of

the best-paid CEOs in 2014 and were paid 9.9% less than their male counterparts (Equilar, 2015). 1
While our understanding of such gender differences has improved substantially, sizeable
differences remain unaccounted for (Black et al., 2008; Blau, 2012). A promising explanation for

these residual differences is the well-documented gender difference in taste for competition: men
are too willing to compete while women shy away from competition (Niederle and Vesterlund,
2011). In this paper, we test this conjecture by evaluating whether the laboratory measure of taste
for competition introduced by Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) helps explain future gender
differences in earnings and labor market choices in a sample of high-ability business professionals.
      The participants of our study consist of individuals who obtained a master’s degree in business
administration (MBA) from one of the top business schools in the United States—the Booth School
of Business of the University of Chicago. This is an interesting group of people to study because top
business positions is precisely one of the areas where noticeable gender differences persist, a fact
that is often reported by the national media and our subjects are likely candidates for such
positions in the future.
      We collected data about our sample of MBAs from four different sources: (i) a laboratory
experiment and survey questionnaire, which we use to obtain an incentivized measure taste for
competition as well as measures of other important psychological traits; (ii) admissions data from
the business school, which contains a rich set of demographic characteristics as well as standard
measures of academic achievement; (iii) data from the business school’s career services office,
which includes the participants’ earnings in their first job after graduation, the industry
participants choose to work in, and various variables concerning the participants’ job search; and


1   Similarly, Bertrand and Hallock (2001) report that only 2.5% of the highest paid executives in S&P 500 firms are women
and Wolfers (2006) shows that, from 1992 to 2004, the CEO of an S&P 1500 firm was a woman only 1.3% of the time.



                                                                                                                        1
(iv) data obtained by tracking participants seven years after they graduated to observe their career
progression.
      Our data on labor market outcomes displays two important gender differences. First, we find a
meaningful gender gap in earnings at graduation: compared to male MBAs, on average, female
MBAs earn 15% less (around $26k less per year). This gap persists almost unchanged (13%) even
when we control for the industry the MBAs chose to work in. Second, we find that men and women
self-select into different industries and this difference persists several years after graduation. More
specifically, female MBAs are 8% more likely to work in low-paying industries at graduation and
12% more likely to work in such industries seven years later. We focus on two effects throughout
the paper. First, we investigate the relationship between taste for competition, earnings, and
industry selection. Second, we evaluate whether taste for competition helps us explain the observed
gender differences in earnings and industry selection.
      To measure taste for competition, we use the experimental design of Niederle and Vesterlund
(2007). It consists of giving participants the opportunity to earn money by answering simple
arithmetic problems under two different incentive schemes: piece-rate and tournament. 2 Under the
piece-rate condition, participants do not compete with others and simply earn $4 per correct
answer. Under the tournament condition, participants compete with three other randomly chosen
participants and earn $16 per correct answer if they have the highest performance in their group.
The participants’ willingness to compete is assessed by letting them choose between performing
under piece-rate or under tournament. When they make their choice, participants have no

information concerning the performance of others. Like many in the literature, we find that men are
twice as likely as women to choose the tournament (see Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011). The
participants’ mathematical ability, their beliefs about relative performance, and their risk


2   Since we study a setting (business) that is stereotypically male, we elicit taste for competition using a task in an area
(math) that is typically associated with men (Reuben, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2014). Experiments using this task in
various subject pools have consistently found that men choose the tournament more often than women (e.g., Niederle and
Vesterlund, 2007; Cason, Masters, and Sheremeta, 2010; Healy and Pate, 2011; Balafoutas and Sutter, 2012; Niederle,
Segal, and Vesterlund, 2013). That being said, gender differences in taste for competition are sometimes diminished when
measured with stereotypically female tasks (e.g., Kamas and Preston 2010; Dreber, von Essen, and Ranehill, 2014;
Wozniak, Harbaugh, and Mayr, 2014).



                                                                                                                           2
preferences explains some but not all of the gender difference in choosing the tournament. As
Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek (2014) and Reuben, Wiswall, and Zafar (2015), we use the decision
to perform under the tournament controlling for ability, beliefs, and risk preferences as a measure
of taste for competition.
   We obtain our first results by regressing the participants’ earnings at graduation on their
gender, taste for competition, and a large set of control variables. We find that individuals who
were classified as competitive in a laboratory experiment two years before earn 9 log points more
than their less competitive counterparts (around $15k more per year), a sizeable effect comparable
in magnitude to the effect of gender. In addition, we find that the gender difference in taste for
competition accounts for around 10% of the gender difference in earnings. To put this result in
perspective, the sole measure of taste for competition explains half as much of the gender gap in
earnings as a rich set of variables that include demographic characteristics, academic performance,
and experimental and survey measures of important psychological attributes. Importantly, the
experimental measure of taste for competition is not strongly correlated with the large set of
control variables, and therefore, it accounts for variance in earnings and in the gender gap that
would otherwise remain unexplained.
   Our second set of results relate to the relationship between taste for competition and the

industry participants work in. This is an important relationship because industry has been shown
to be a strong determinant of earnings and of the gender gap among business professionals in the
long run (Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz, 2010). Even though there is no relation between taste for
competition and industry before participants started their MBA, we find that taste for competition
is a good predictor of the industry participants’ work in at graduation, and remarkably, it remains a
significant predictor of industry several years later. Specifically, we find that competitive

individuals are more likely to start and keep working in consulting and to a lesser extent finance
instead of other lower-paying industries. This finding suggests that the relation between taste for
competition and earnings that we observe at the beginning of the participants’ business careers
persists in the long run.
   An advantage of our dataset is that we obtained information regarding the recruitment process,
and therefore, we can observe the stages of the job market in which taste for competition plays a



                                                                                                   3
role. In particular, we have information that captures the employers’ interests (who they invite for
interviews), the job candidates’ interests (to which firms they bid for interviews), and the success of
job candidates in obtaining internships and transforming them into permanent jobs.
   We find that taste for competition predicts industry selection when securing and converting
internships into permanent jobs but not during the interview process. In other words, it appears
that meaningful contact between participants and firms is crucial for the emergence of the taste for
competition effect in industry selection. By contrast, we find that the gender gap in industry
participation emerges early in the recruitment process and it is driven both by employers’ demand
by employees’ supply.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide an overview of the related
literature. In Section 3, we describe the various sources from which we collect our data. In section 4
we present descriptive statistics of our sample, and then, in section 5, we test whether there are
gender differences in taste for competition. In sections 6 and 7, we present our main results. Section
6 evaluates the link between taste for competition and earnings while section 7 analyses the
relation between taste for competition and selection into different industries. We further discuss
our findings and conclude in section 8.


2. Literature review
This paper contributes to the growing literature on gender differences in taste for competition (for
a review see Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011) and more specifically to studies relating incentivized
measures of taste for competition to gender differences in labor market outcomes. Below, we

briefly summarize the few studies that fit this description.
   The most prominent study in this area is that of Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek (2014). In this
study, the authors use the same measure of taste for competition we use to predict the educational

choices of high school students in the Netherlands. They find that competitive individuals have are
around 20% more likely to select the most prestigious study track, which contains mostly math and
science classes, over the least prestigious track, which consists mostly of humanities classes.

Moreover, they find that controlling for taste for competition reduces the gender gap in track choice
by around 20%. Hence, we extend the findings of Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek (2014) by



                                                                                                     4
demonstrating that taste for competition predicts actual labor market outcomes in a considerably
different sample of participants (our sample is older, better educated, more diverse, and specialized
in business). In addition, our finding that competitive individuals gravitate more towards
consulting than finance supports Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek (2014)’s conjecture that taste for
competition is not simply a measure of interest in mathematically-intense fields.
   Kamas and Preston (2015) and Reuben, Wiswall, and Zafar (2015) follow-up on Buser, Niederle,
and Oosterbeek (2014)’s work and study whether competitive individuals major in different fields
when they complete their undergraduate education in private universities in the United States. A
drawback of their evidence, however, is that taste for competition was measured after students
chose their major and therefore the causal interpretation of the results is more problematic.
Reuben, Wiswall, and Zafar (2015) do not find a relationship between taste for competition and
major choice while Kamas and Preston (2015) find that competitive individuals are more likely to
major in engineering, natural sciences, and business as opposed to majoring in social sciences or
the humanities. In addition to major choice, Kamas and Preston (2015) and Reuben, Wiswall, and
Zafar (2015) analyze the relation between taste for competition and self-reported earnings.
Reuben, Wiswall, and Zafar (2015) find that taste for competition and confidence measures
positively relate with the compensation students expect to earn ten years after graduation.

Moreover, they also find that taste for competition helps explain around 18% of the gender gap in
expected earnings. Kamas and Preston (2015) survey their students a couple of years after
graduation to ask them to self-report their current earnings. As Reuben, Wiswall, and Zafar (2015),
they find a strong positive relation between earnings, taste for competition, and confidence to the
point that the gender gap in reported earnings disappears for women that are both competitive and
confident. Compared to these studies, our study has two clear advantages. The first advantage is

that our earnings data is not self-reported. It is given to us by business school, which corroborates
the veracity of the data with the employers. This is an important difference since it is plausible that
competitive and overconfident individuals are simply overstating their earnings. The second
advantage is that, in addition to earnings, we also observe how participants sort themselves into
different industries over a period of nine years. This allows us to establish whether taste for




                                                                                                     5
competition predicts labor market outcomes in the long run and to observe the stages in the
participants’ career where taste for competition plays an important role.
   Two other studies investigate the relation between taste for competition and labor market
outcomes. However, they do so in settings where men and women make similar choices, and
therefore, they do not inform us on the relation between gender differences in taste for competition
and gender gaps in the labor market. Zhang (2013) finds that taste for competition predicts
whether middle school students in rural China take a highly demanding high school entrance exam.
Berge et al. (2015) study small-scale entrepreneurs in Tanzania. They find that competitive
entrepreneurs self-report investing more in their business and hiring more employees.
   A last advantage of our study compared to the studies reviewed in this section is that we
implemented a clever control treatment of the Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) design. Namely, we
gave participants a second choice between tournament and piece-rate in a setting with the same
monetary incentives and information conditions as their initial choice but without the need to
perform under competitive conditions. Like Niederle and Vesterlund (2007), we find that women
do not shy away from tournaments that do not involve competition. More importantly, we find a
much weaker relation between earnings and choosing the tournament in the absence of
competition, which lends support to the interpretation of taste for competition as the driver of our

results.


3. Study design
The data we use in this paper come from MBA graduates from of the 2008 cohort of University of

Chicago Booth School of Business. More specifically, we use data from four sources: an experiment
and survey, the admissions office of University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the career
services office of the same school, and publicly available profiles from LinkedIn.

3.1. Survey and experiment

As part of a required core class, all the MBA students of the 2008 cohort completed a survey and
participated in an experiment designed to measure several individual-specific characteristics. Both
the survey and the experiment were conducted in the fall of 2006, during their first month in the
business school. Participants completed the survey online before they took part in the experiment.


                                                                                                  6
The survey took approximately one hour to complete while the experiment lasted an hour and a
half. A detailed description of the procedures used to conduct the survey and experiment are
provided in the supplementary materials.
      The survey includes questions on demographic characteristics as well as standard
questionnaires of personality traits. In this paper, we concentrate on three variables that are
potentially important determinants of gender differences in labor market outcomes. 3 The first
variable is the participants’ score in a four-question version of the cognitive reflection test (CRT)
proposed by Frederik (2005). High scores in the CRT are associated with high IQ and better

decision-making skills in various domains (Frederik, 2005; Toplak, West, and Stanovich, 2011) such
as expertise in the finance sector (Thoma et al., 2015). Moreover, as reported by Frederik (2005),
on average, men score better than women. The second variable is the participants’ score in the
“reading the mind in the eyes” test of Baron-Cohen et al. (2001), which consists of correctly
recognizing the emotions of various individuals by looking at pictures of their eyes. High scores in
this test are associated with a higher ability to empathize, which is arguably an important skill in
leadership positions (Goleman and Boyatzis, 2008). As reported by Baron-Cohen (2002), on
average, women score better than men in this test. The third variable corresponds to the measure
of self-efficacy proposed by Sherer et al. (1982). Self-efficacy has been found to be strongly
associated with work and academic performance (Lent and Hackett, 1987; Stajkovic and Luthans,
1998) as well as career choice (Eccles, 1994). Women tend to report lower self-efficacy than men
(Lent and Hackett, 1987; Eccles, 1994; Schwarzer et al., 1997). Lastly, we also include the
participants’ self-reported religiosity as part of their demographic characteristics, which were
mostly obtained from the admissions office.
      The experiment consisted of eight distinct parts. The instructions for each part were given
before the start of the respective part and participants received no feedback concerning the
outcome or behavior of others until the experiment had concluded. As compensation, participants
received a $20 show-up fee and their earnings in a randomly selected part. On average, participants

earned $99.


3   The precise wording of the survey questions is available in the supplementary materials. All other survey questions are
available in Reuben, Sapienza, and Zingales (2008).



                                                                                                                         7
     Next, we describe the five parts of the experiment that were designed to measure individual
characteristics, 4 more specifically: risk preferences, time preferences, willingness to trust and

reciprocate, willingness to cooperate, and taste for competition. Given the focus of this paper, we
first provide a brief description of the first four parts and subsequently a detailed description of the
part used to measure taste for competition. Detailed descriptions of the first four parts are available

in the supplementary materials.
     To measure risk preferences, we gave participants 15 choices between a lottery with an
expected value of $100 and certain amount that ranged from $50 to $120. As is common in the

literature, we then use these choices to determine each participant’s risk aversion coefficient
assuming a CRRA utility function (see Holt and Laury. 2002). Similarly, to measure time
preferences, we elicited individual discount rates by giving each participant 13 choices between

receiving their experimental earnings immediately and receiving an amount that ranged from 0%
more to 12% more two weeks later. We use these choices to calculate each participant’s two-week
discount rate. We measured trust and reciprocity by having participants play a variation of the

well-known trust game (Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe, 1995). We had participants play the game
twice, once as the trustor and once as the trustee. We use the fraction of the $50 endowment that
participants send as trustors as a measure of their willingness to trust and the fraction of the
amount received that they return as trustees (conditional on receiving $150) as a measure of their
willingness to reciprocate. Finally, we measure the participants’ willingness to cooperate by having
them play a linear public good game in groups of eight (Isaac, Walker, and Thomas, 1984). We use

the participants’ contribution decision (either $0 or $50) as a measure of their willingness to
cooperate.
     To measure taste for competition, we use a variation of the design used by Niederle and

Vesterlund (2007). Participants first performed an adding task under both a tournament payment
scheme and a piece-rate payment scheme. Subsequently, they performed the task once again under




4   The three parts not used in this study correspond to an asset market game, a chocolate auction, and a lottery. These
parts were included to keep the students engaged throughout the experiment. They are described in Reuben, Sapienza,
and Zingales (2008).



                                                                                                                      8
a payment scheme of their choice. Their payment-scheme choice serves as the basis for their taste
for competition.
   The task consisted of computing sums of four two-digit numbers for 150 seconds. The two-digit
numbers are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution with a support of 11 to 99. Calculators
were not allowed. After each answer, a new set of numbers appeared on the computer screen along
with a message indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect. Importantly, although
participants knew what their own performance was, they did not receive any information about the
performance or choices of others during the experiment.
   Participants were informed that this part of the experiment consists of four periods, one of
which will be randomly chosen to determine their earnings. They were also informed that they
were randomly assigned to groups of four. Participants read the instructions for each period just
before the start of the respective period. In the first two periods, participants performed the
addition task once under a piece-rate payment scheme and once under a tournament payment
scheme. With piece-rate, participants earned $4 for every correct answer. With the tournament,
participants earned $16 for every correct answer if they had the highest number of correct answers
in their group (ties were broken randomly) and earned $0 otherwise. Half the participants
performed the addition task first under piece-rate and then under the tournament while the other

half performed the tasks in the reverse order.
   In the third period, participants were informed that they would perform the addition task once
again and were asked to choose one of the two payment schemes to apply in that period. If they
chose piece-rate, they earned $4 per correct answer. If they chose tournament, they earned $16 per
correct answer if they had more correct answers than their other group members had when they
performed the task under the tournament in the first or second period. Competing against their

group members’ previous performance has the advantage that the participants’ choice in the third
period is not affected by their beliefs about the taste for competition of others. Moreover, it
prevents participants from selecting piece-rate in order to avoid imposing a negative externality on
others.
   In the fourth period, participants did not perform the adding task. This period simply consisted
of choosing whether they wished to be paid for their previous performance according to the piece-



                                                                                                  9
rate or tournament payment schemes. Specifically, for their performance under the uncompetitive
payment scheme in the first or second period. Thus, the participants’ choice in the fourth period
resembled their choice in the third period except that participants who chose the tournament did
not perform under the stress (or thrill) one might experience in a competitive environment.
      After the fourth period, we elicited the participants’ beliefs concerning their relative
performance by asking them to guess how they ranked within their group in each of the first three
periods. Participants submitted ranks between 1st and 4th and received $2 for each correct guess. 5
The instructions given to the participants are provided in the supplementary materials.

3.2. Administrative data

The admissions office of the business school supplied us with various variables collected when the
participants applied for admission to the school. These variables include demographic

characteristics such as age, race, marital status, and whether participants are residents of the
United States. It also includes the participants’ GMAT percentile scores (broken down into the
quantitative, verbal, and analytic components), their work experience (in months), and the name of
the employer they worked for before they joined the MBA program. We used two-digit NAICS
industry codes to classify each participant’s pre-MBA employer into three broad industry
categories: finance (two-digit NAICS code 52), professional services, which we refer to as
“consulting” (two-digit NAICS code 54), and “other” (the remaining two-digit codes). Lastly, upon
graduation, we also received from the school administration each participant’s GPA in the MBA
program.

3.3. Job data

The career services office of the business school provided us with information regarding the job
participants accepted upon graduation. The information was initially reported by the participants
but the career services office subsequently double-checked it with the respective employers to
ensure its accuracy. The information included data on financial earnings, which includes salaries as
well as yearly and one-time bonuses (e.g., sign-on and relocation bonuses). Based on this


5   In case of a tie, participants were paid the $2 if their guess corresponded to a rank they could have received when the tie
was randomly resolved.



                                                                                                                            10
information we calculated the participants’ total earnings in their first year after graduation. The
information also included the employers’ names, which we used to classify them into the three
industry categories: finance, consulting, or other.
   Also from the career services office, we received self-reported information from a survey
completed by the participants. It included the following information: whether participants
successfully negotiated their job offer, whether their job was obtained through the school’s
recruitment events or through personal contacts, and whether they obtained competing job offers
and if so, the financial compensation of those offers.
   Finally, we also obtained information regarding the recruitment process in the business school.
To obtain a job, MBAs go through a two-step process. In the first year, MBA students obtain an
internship in a firm in which they are potentially interested. In the second year, MBA students
decide whether to stay at the firm for which they interned (if they are offered a job) or seek
employment in another firm. Interviewing for internships and jobs occurs mostly within the school
premises at various points throughout the MBA program. In other words, the school serves as a
centralized two-sided market for job candidates and employers. This gives us access to information
about the demand and supply sides of the market. On the demand side, employers report to the
school which participants they would like to interview. On the supply side, participants get an

allocation of points from the school to subsequently bid for interviews with particular employers.

3.4. LinkedIn data

In September 2015, we followed up on the study’s participants by looking for their profile in

LinkedIn, a business-oriented social networking service where individuals list, among other things,
their employment history. We used the participant’s listed employer to classify them once again
into the three industry categories.


4. Descriptive statistics
Although participation in some parts of the study was mandatory, participants had the option to opt
out of the study by not consenting to the use of some or all of their data. Out of the 550 students in
the cohort, 409 (74%) consented to the analysis of the survey, experiment, administrative, and job
placement data. Throughout the paper, we concentrate on these participants. However, it is


                                                                                                     11
important to understand whether this sample differs systematically from the rest of the cohort. For
this reason, in the supplementary materials we conduct a thorough comparison between the 409
participants in the sample and 129 participants for whom we can analyze data sources other than
their job placement data. 6 By and large, we do not find differences between these two populations.
Crucially for this paper, neither the fraction of women nor the fraction of participants who chose
the tournament is significantly different (χ2 tests, p > 0.388). 7




6   Of these 129 participants, we have compensation data for 62 participants. Of these participants, 26 did not consent to
the use of their compensation data and 36 had job offers that were not reviewed by the school’s career services office.
7   It is also the case that neither the fraction of men nor the fraction of women who chose the tournament significantly
differ between the two populations (χ2 tests, p > 0.704). Using a threshold of 10% and adjusting p-values to account for
multiple comparisons, we find that only one of the variables in Table 1 displays a significant difference between the two
populations: participants who are in the sample have 4.6% higher GPA scores than those who are not.

   Next, we provide descriptive statistics for participants in our sample and evaluate whether there
are gender differences in the experimental, survey, and administrative data. Table 2 presents the
mean and standard deviation for variables derived from these data sources for both the 286 men
and 123 women in the sample. For each variable, the table also displays p-values from tests of




                                                                                                                       13
equality of distributions between men and women based on t-tests for ordinal variables and χ2 tests
for categorical variables. 8

      As can be seen in the table, there are various differences between men and women. Compared to
men, women are just over one year younger, have lower GMAT quantitative scores, are half as likely
to be married, had almost one year less of work experience at the start of the MBA, and graduate

with a lower GPA. In the experiment and survey, we replicate many of the gender differences
reported in the literature. Namely, we find that, relative to men, women in our sample are more risk
averse (Croson and Gneezy, 2009), have lower CRT scores (Frederik, 2005), and higher

empathizing scores (Baron-Cohen, 2002). 9 Also consistent with the mixed results in the literature,
we do not find a significant difference between men and women in their willingness to cooperate,
reciprocate, or trust (see Croson and Gneezy, 2009). Next, we focus on taste for competition and
evaluate whether male MBAs are more competitive than female MBAs.


5. Gender differences in taste for competition
Consistent with the literature on taste for competition, we can see in Table 1 that 60.1% of men
choose the tournament payment scheme compared to 33.3% of women. 10 However, on its own, the
higher incidence of men choosing the tournament is not enough to conclude that men are more
competitive. In particular, Table 1 also reveals that men in our sample outperform women in the
adding tasks. 11 For example, the average probability of being ranked first in a randomly selected

8   All tests in the paper are two-sided.
9    Adjusting p-values with the Benjamini-Hochberg method to account for multiple comparisons does not affect these
conclusions.
10   For example, a gender difference in the choice of the tournament has been found in Niederle and Vesterlund (2007),
Cason, Masters, and Sheremeta (2010), Healy and Pate (2011), Balafoutas and Sutter (2012), Reuben et al. (2012), and
Niederle, Segal, and Vesterlund (2013), in addition to experiments that vary the design in important ways like Gneezy,
Leonard, and List (2009), Dohmen and Falk (2011), Booth and Nolen (2012), Andersen et al. (2013), and Gupta, Poulsen,
and Villeval (2013).
11   Most papers using the design of Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) find no gender difference in performance. However,
the higher performance of men in our sample is in line with men having higher average quantitative GMAT scores. That
being said, there is considerable overlap in the two distributions. For instance, the median woman beats 45.3% of all men.
We do not find that either men or women perform differently depending on the type of payment scheme (t-tests, p >
0.280), but they do improve from the first to the second period (t-tests, p ≤ 0.001).

group of four is around 28% for men and 18% for women (the difference is statistically significant
under both tournament and piece-rate pay). 12 Consistent with their higher performance, on

average, men expect to be better ranked than women (2.136 vs. 2.545). 13 These differences,
combined with the fact that women are more risk averse, could explain why men choose the
tournament more often than women do.
      Are male MBAs more competitive than female MBAs after controlling for their ability, beliefs,
and risk preferences? To answer this question we follow Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) and
Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek (2014) and run a series of regressions with the participants’ choice


12   On average per period, men got 7.549 correct answers while women get 6.569 correct answers. However, throughout
the paper, we concentrate on the probability of ranking first because it is the more relevant statistic for the participants’
choice between tournament and piece-rate pay. We calculate these probabilities through simulation. We use the
participants’ number of correct answers in each of the first two periods and randomly assign participants to groups of
four 10,000 times. Like in the experiment, in each period, participants were matched with those under the same payment
scheme. We then calculate the fraction of times participants are ranked first in their group (ties are broken randomly). All
results are robust to using the number of correct answers instead.
13   We concentrate on the participants’ expected rank when they perform under the tournament since this expectation is
arguably more relevant for their payment scheme choice. All results are robust to using their expected rank under piece-
rate instead.



                                                                                                                            15
of the tournament as the dependent variable. To facilitate the interpretation of the coefficients, we
standardize the ordinal independent variables to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of
one. The results are reported in Table 2. In column I, the only independent variable is the
participants’ gender. Without any controls, the gender gap in choosing the tournament equals
26.8%. In column II, we control for the participants’ ability by including their probability of ranking
first in the first two periods (included as their probability of ranking first under the tournament and
the difference between this probability and their probability of ranking first in the piece-rate
condition). Controlling for ability, the gender gap in choosing the tournament drops by 6.9
percentage points to 19.9%. In column III, we further control for the participants’ beliefs (their
expected rank under the tournament condition) and risk preferences (their risk aversion
coefficient). As we can see, ability, beliefs, and risk preferences are all significant determinants of
the decision to compete. However, controlling for these variables still leaves a statistically
significant gender gap in the choice of tournaments of 13.3%.
   In summary, MBAs in our sample display a gender gap in choosing the tournament similar to
those reported in other populations (see Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011). Controlling for their
ability, beliefs, and risk preferences accounts for roughly half of the gender difference in choice of
tournaments. As Niederle and Vesterlund (2007), we interpret the remaining gender gap as being

driven by gender differences in taste for competition.
   A question that naturally arises is whether taste for competition describes variation in individual
characteristics that is not captured by other observables. To answer this question, we run one more
regression to which we add all the remaining variables in Table 1. As we can see in column IV, the
inclusion of all these control variables has only a small effect on the magnitude of the gender gap in
choosing the tournament: it shrinks by 2.5 percentage points to 10.8%. In addition, we cannot

reject the null hypothesis that the additional control variables are jointly significant (p = 0.207).
This is compelling evidence that taste for competition captures individual variation that would
otherwise remain unobserved.

6. Gender differences in earnings
In this section, we analyze the participants’ total earnings in their first job after graduation. 14 We
focus on gender differences in earnings, the relationship between earnings and taste for
competition, and the extent to which gender differences in earnings are explained by the observed
gender differences in taste for competition.
      Figure 1A shows the mean earnings of men and women. On average, male MBAs earned (salary
plus bonus) $175k in their first year after graduation whereas females MBAs earned $149k. A t-test
indicates that the gender difference in means is statistically significant (p < 0.001). Figure 1B
depicts the cumulative distributions of first-year earnings. We can see that the difference between
men and women appears at all income levels, albeit it is larger for the top earners: at the 10th
percentile men out-earn women by $15k while at the 90th percentile this difference has grown to

$25k.



14   As is common in the literature, to prevent a few outliers from unduly affecting our results, we winsorized the
participants’ earnings at the 1st and 99th percentiles (at $75k and $750k respectively). In the supplementary materials, we
redo the regressions presented in this section with the non-winsorized values. All the regression results hold and in some
cases become stronger with the non-winsorized values.

     Figure 2 – Total yearly earnings in the first job after graduation by payment scheme choice


6.1. Taste for competition and the gender gap

As seen in Figure 2A, choosing the tournament in a laboratory experiment at the beginning of their
MBA is associated with higher earnings two years later in the participants’ first job. On average,
participants who chose the tournament ended up earning $21k more than participants who chose
piece-rate (t-test, p = 0.008). As with gender, the difference in earnings is larger for the top earners
(see Figure 2B).
   Does this difference in taste for competition persist once we control for other determinants of
choosing the tournament? To answer this question, we run a series of linear regressions with the
log of the participants’ first-year earnings as the dependent variable. In all specifications, we control
for the other determinants of choosing the tournament (i.e., the variables in column III of Table 2)
so that we capture the effect of taste for competition when we include choosing the tournament as
an independent variable. Table 3 reports the coefficients for the two variables of interest: gender
and taste for competition. The coefficients for all other independent variables are available in the
supplementary materials.
   The regression in column I includes gender as an independent variable (woman). The estimated
coefficient simply confirms that women earn significantly less than men do (12.2 log points less). In
column II, we add a dummy variable indicating whether participants chose the tournament over


                                                                                                             18
piece-rate in the experiment (competitive). We are interested in two things: the size and
significance of the competitive coefficient, and the change it produces on the gender coefficient,
which can be interpreted as the part of the gender difference in earnings that is accounted for by
the gender difference in taste for competition.
      We find that competitive participants earned significantly more than non-competitive ones.
Specifically, they earned 9.1 log points more, which is around $15k: a large effect, comparable in
size to the effect of gender. 15 In addition, including a dummy variable for the choice of tournament
significantly reduces the gender gap in earnings by 9.9% (the gender coefficient changes from –
0.122 to –0.110, p = 0.012 bootstrapped as in Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek, 2014), which in
dollar terms is approximately $2k.
      How important is the role of taste for competition in accounting for the gender gap in earnings?
One way to answer this question is to compare the impact of taste for competition on the gender
coefficient to the impact of other control variables on the same coefficient. This can be done by
looking at column III, which includes all the variables in Table 1 except for the choice of
tournament. Including these control variables noticeability reduces the gender gap by 20.7% (the
gender coefficient changes from–0.122 to –0.097). This result puts the effect of taste for
competition in perspective. Namely, the single experimental measure of taste for competition
explains around half as much of the gender gap in earnings as a rich set of variables that include
demographic characteristics, academic performance, and experimental and survey measures of
important psychological attributes. 16

      Lastly, we evaluate the effects of taste for competition whilst controlling for the other variables
in Table 1. The effects can be seen in column IV, which includes both the tournament dummy and
the control variables from Table 1. By comparing column II and column IV, we can see that the

competitive coefficient is unaffected by the inclusion of all these control variables and remains a


15   The effect of taste for competition is similar for both genders. The interaction of being competitive and gender is not
statistically significant irrespective of whether we include the additional controls or not (p > 0.420).
16   An alternative comparison is to look at the impact on the gender coefficient of including each variable in Table 1
separately. If we do this, the variables that significantly decrease the gender coefficient are the participants’ CRT score,
GMAT quantitative percentile, marital status, and GPA. The effects of these variables are comparable in size, taste for
competition being the second-strongest effect after marital status.



                                                                                                                         19

sizable 8.8 log points. By comparing column III and column IV, we can see that the inclusion of the
tournament further reduces the gender gap by roughly the same amount as before (the gender
coefficient changes from –0.097 to –0.087, p = 0.040). In other words and consistent the little
explanatory power of the control variables on the choice of tournament (see Table 2), the
experimental measure of taste for competition accounts for an important part of the gender gap in
earnings that is not captured by standard explanatory variables.

6.2. Additional analysis

In the supplementary materials, we provide additional results and robustness checks concerning
the association between taste for competition and earnings. In particular, we present evidence that
supports the interpretation of the association between earnings and choosing the tournament as an
association between earnings and taste for competition. In addition, we analyze the effect of
competing job offers on the participants’ final earnings. We briefly discuss these two analyzes
below. For interested readers, in the supplementary materials, we also consider the role of
negotiation and social contacts as potential drivers of gender differences in earnings. Moreover, we
also demonstrate that the results of this section are robust to the following alternative




                                                                                                                  20
specifications: (i) the exclusion of first-year bonuses (e.g., relocation, signing, and year-end
bonuses) from the participants’ earnings, (ii) the use of non-winsorized earnings, and (iii) the use of
earnings in dollars instead of logs.

Taste for competition and the choice of tournament

A clever feature of the experimental design of Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) is that participants

make two choices between tournament and piece-rate. In one case, participants perform under the
chosen payment scheme while in the other case the payment scheme is simply applied to their past
performance (see section 3.1). We will refer to the choice of the tournament in the latter case as

“uncompetitive tournament choice.” Because it does not include performing in a competitive
environment, Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) argue that the choice between piece-rate and
uncompetitive tournament is unaffected by the participants’ attitudes towards competition. If this
is the case and the association between earnings and choosing the tournament is driven by taste for
competition, then we should observe a weaker relation between earnings and uncompetitive
tournament. 17

      To evaluate whether choosing uncompetitive tournament is associated with earnings, we run
regressions like the ones reported in columns II and IV of Table 3. In some regressions, we simply
substitute tournament with uncompetitive tournament. We find that the coefficients for
uncompetitive tournament are positive, but they are not statistically significant and they are half as
large as the comparable coefficient in Table 3. In addition, the change in the gender coefficient due
to the inclusion of uncompetitive tournament is much smaller and is not statistically significant. In

other regressions, we include both tournament and uncompetitive tournament. We find that the
coefficient for tournament is both economically and statistically significant whereas the coefficient
for uncompetitive tournament is close to zero and far from statistical significance. These results

provide compelling evidence that the association between tournament and earnings is indeed




17   Like with the tournament, men chose uncompetitive the tournament significantly more often than women (47.2% of
men vs. 25.2% of women, p < 0.001 with a χ2 test). However, unlike for the tournament, this gender difference is no longer
statistically significant once we control for the participants’ ability, beliefs, risk preferences, demographic characteristics,
and psychological traits (p = 0.240).



                                                                                                                             21
driven by the participants’ attitudes towards competition and is not related to the choice of a
tournament per se.

Competing job offers

Competing job offers are a potential contributing factor to earnings differences. As mentioned in
section 3.3, the career services office asks participants to report whether they had competing job
offers and their respective compensation. On average, participants receive 0.416 competing offers
with the average competing offer paying $168k in total earnings. Importantly, obtaining a
competing job offer is strongly associated with significantly higher earnings. Regressing total
earnings on a dummy variable indicating whether a participant has at least one competing job offer
and the compensation of the best competing offer (as well as the controls from Table 1), reveals
that a participant with a competing job offer of $168k earns $16k more than a participant with the
same characteristics but without a competing offer.
      Are competitive participants more likely to obtain a competing offer and if so, do they receive
offers with higher compensation? The answer to the first part of this question is no. On average,
participants who chose the tournament obtained 0.394 competing offers while those who chose
piece-rate obtained 0.439 competing offers. 18 By contrast, the answer to the second part of the
question is yes. Among participants who obtained at least one competing job offer, those who chose

the tournament obtained competing offers that paid, on average, $28k more than the competing
offers of those who chose piece-rate pay. A regression of the log of earnings of competing job offers
on the tournament and the control variables in column III of Table 2 confirms that the competing

job offers obtained by competitive participants are significantly better paid (p = 0.041).
      Consistent with the effect of taste for competition on earnings being channeled through
competing job offers, the inclusion of these variables in the regressions of Table 3 weakens the
coefficient of taste for competition from 8.8 to 6.3 log points. In other words, competitive
participants are able to obtain job offers with higher earnings both from the firm they end up
working at and from competing firms. It is not clear from our data, however, whether competitive



18   Moreover, regressing the number of competing offers on the tournament and the control variables in column III of
Table 2 results in a small and non-significant coefficient.



                                                                                                                  22
participants use their better-paid offers to improve their final earnings or whether they obtain
higher earnings from different firms independently. 19


7. Gender differences in selection into industries
In the previous section, we found a strong association between the MBAs’ attitudes towards
competition and their earnings at graduation. In this section, we investigate whether taste for
competition has a long-term effect on earnings. In a previous study with the same population,
Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010) show that the industry MBAs work in is a strong determinant of
their earnings over a period of ten years. Moreover, they also demonstrate that industry selection is
an important contributing factor to the gender gap in earnings. Hence, by looking at the relations
between taste for competition and the participants’ industry over time, we gain insights about the
long-term effect of taste for competition on earnings and the gender gap.
     As mentioned in section 3, we used two-digit NAICS industry codes to classify the participants’
employers into three broad categories: finance, consulting, and other industries. From the
information we obtained from the business school, we know the participants’ employers when they
applied to their MBA and at graduation. From LinkedIn, we know their current employer. As one
would expect, not all the study’s participants have an updated profile in LinkedIn. Fortunately, we
were able to get employment information from 390 participants (95% of the sample).
     Figure 3A shows the fraction of men and women in each of the three industry categories. There
is a significant gender difference in the participants’ industry (χ2 tests, p < 0.006). At graduation, a
higher fraction of men work in finance while a higher fraction of women work in consulting and

other industries. This gender difference persists over time even though both men and woman shift
towards other industries as their career progresses. From the point of view of predicting future


19   The inclusion of competing offers also reduces the magnitude of the gender coefficient. Interestingly, the effect of
competing job offers differs by gender. The increase in the earnings of men due to a competing job offer is about twice as
large as the increase in the earnings of women. These findings are consistent with the literature on gender differences in
the willingness and ability to bargain for higher wages (e.g., Babcock and Laschever, 2003; Small et al., 2007; Exley,
Niederle, and Vesterlund, 2015; Leibbrandt and List, 2015). That being said, with our data we cannot test whether the
association between earnings and competing job offers is driven by an improved bargaining position or by qualities of the
job candidates that are not captured by the other control variables.

earnings, the more important gender difference is the higher fraction of women working for
employers in other industries, which tend to have lower earnings than those in finance and
consulting (Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz, 2010). For example, in our sample, the average earnings at
graduation was $177k in finance, $167k in consulting, and $151k in other industries. 20 Bertrand,

Goldin, and Katz (2010) find that these industry differences grow over time.

7.1 Taste for competition and selection into industries

We can see from Figure 3B that participants who chose the tournament in the experiment self-
select into different industries than participants who chose piece-rate (χ2 tests, p < 0.026). In



20   Using t-tests, we find a significant difference in earnings between other industries and finance (p = 0.010) as well as
other industries and consulting (p = 0.046) but not between finance and consulting (p = 0.202).

particular, both at graduation and in the present day, participants who chose the tournament are
more likely to work in consulting and finance and are less likely to work in other industries.
      To test whether these differences endure once we control for other variables, we run a
multinomial probit regression with the participants’ industry as the dependent variable. As
independent variables, we include gender (woman), a dummy variable indicating whether
participants chose tournament over piece-rate (competitive), other determinants of choosing the
tournament (see column III of Table 2), and all the remaining control variables from Table 1, which
include the industry of the participants’ employer before they began their MBA. 21
      We run a regression for the participants’ industry at graduation and another one for their
present day industry. The results for gender and taste for competition are reported in Table 4 as
conditional marginal effects for each industry category. We also report the marginal effects of the
participants’ risk preferences since they are often cited as one of the important factors explaining
gender differences in career choice (see Cramer, et al., 2002; Hartog et al., 2002; Saks and Shore,




21   As in previous regressions, we standardized all ordinal variables to facilitate the interpretation of the results.



                                                                                                                                  25
2005; Zafar, 2013). The marginal effects for the other independent variables are available in the
supplementary materials.
      We find that competiveness is a significant predictor of the participants’ industry. At graduation,
a competitive participant is 7.1% more likely to work in consulting, 4.3% more likely to work in
finance, and 11.5% less likely to work in another industry. Risk aversion also has a noticeable effect.
A one standard deviation increase in risk aversion decreases the likelihood of working in finance by
7.3% and increases the likelihood of working in consulting by 4.7% and other industries by 2.6%.
We observe the same pattern for the participants’ industry in the present day, although, the effect is
somewhat weaker for both variables. 22 These findings suggest that taste for competition has an
important long-run effect on earnings since competitive individuals are less frequent in lower-
paying industries. By contrast, the effect of risk aversion is more ambiguous since it predominantly
predicts a shift between finance to consulting. 23 Lastly, it is worth noting that, even after controlling
for taste for competition, risk aversion, and the other individual characteristics in Table 1, gender is
still a very strong predictor of the participants’ industry.
      Next, we complement the above analysis by looking in more detail at how participants change
the industry they work in from graduation to the present day. In particular, we investigate the
effect of gender and taste for competition on the notable increase in the number of people working
in other industries (see Figure 3). In Table 5, we can observe the pattern of how participants
transition between industries depending on gender (above) and the participants’ choice between
tournament and piece-rate (below). Overall, only around 12% of participants who work in other

industries at graduation subsequently transition to finance or consulting. By contrast, around 30%

22   Doing pairwise tests gives the following results. For taste for competition: the difference between consulting and other
industries is significant in both regressions (p < 0.024); the difference between finance and other industries is weakly
significant at graduation (p = 0.064) but not in the present day (p = 0.584); and the difference between consulting and
finance is not significant at graduation (p = 0.456) and is weakly significant in the present day (p = 0.095). For risk
aversion: the difference between consulting and other industries is not significant in either regression (p > 0.303); the
difference between finance and other industries is weakly significant at graduation (p = 0.065) but not in the present day
(p = 0.236); and the difference between consulting and finance is significant at graduation (p = 0.006) and weakly
significant in the present day (p = 0. 055).
23   The coefficient for risk aversion in the regressions of the participants’ earnings is negative, but it is small in magnitude
and far from being statistically significant (p = 0.934 in the specification of column IV in Table 3).

of those who work in finance and 55% of those who work in consulting transition to another
industry. In all cases, conditional on changing industries, the vast majority of transitions occur
towards other industries. That being said, there are interesting differences between men and
woman as well as between competitive and uncompetitive individuals. We test whether these
differences in industry transitions are statistically significant by running a multinomial probit
regression with the participants’ industry in the present day as the dependent variable. As
independent variables, we use dummy variables to indicate the participants’ industry at graduation,
which we interact with the participants’ gender, choice of the tournament, and risk aversion
coefficient. In addition, we include all the control variables in Table 1.
      We find two interesting statistically significant effects. First, women who start their careers in
finance are significantly more likely to move to other industries than men (37.1% of women who
work in finance switch compared to 25.7% of men, p = 0.025). Second, individuals who started their
career in consulting are significantly more likely to transition to finance and less likely to transition
to other industries if they chose the tournament compared to individuals who chose piece-rate (p =
0.016). 24

24   An additional significant effect exists: individuals who started their career in finance are significantly more likely to
transition to consulting if they chose the tournament compared to individuals who chose piece-rate (p = 0.025). Risk
aversion had no significant effect on industry transitions.

        Figure 4 – Fraction of participants in the three industry categories before starting their MBA

      In summary, we find that the measures of taste for competition and risk aversion are good
predictors of the industry participants’ work in after graduation. Competitive individuals shy away

from lower-paying jobs in other industries in favor of jobs in consulting and to a lesser extent
finance. Risk averse individuals avoid job in finance in favor of jobs in consulting. The effect of taste
for competition persists seven years later in spite of a noticeable shift towards jobs in other
industries because competitive individuals from consulting are less likely to move to other
industries and more likely to move into finance. 25

7.2. The emergence of the gender and taste for competition gaps in industry selection

In this last section, we use the data we collected from the job-matching process to study the
observed gender differences in selection into industries. Based on their jobs before the start of their
MBA, Figure 4 shows the fraction of participants in each of the three industry categories depending
on their gender (A) and payment scheme choice in the experiment (B). Even though we observe
some of the same patterns as in the distribution of industries after graduation (e.g., women and
individuals who chose piece-rate are more frequent in other industries, see Figure 3), it is clear that


25   In addition to industry, Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010) find that the fraction of finance classes taken during their
MBA is a strong predictor of earnings in the long run. Interestingly, taste for competition is positively and significantly
associated with the fraction of finance classes taken by our participants. In particular, a regression of the fraction of
finance classes on the participants’ gender, taste for competition, the control variables from Table 2, and their industry at
graduation results in a negative coefficient for gender (p < 0.001), a positive one for taste for competition (p = 0.026), and
a nonsignificant coefficient for risk aversion (p = 0.649).



                                                                                                                           28
these patterns are much less pronounced before participants started their MBA. In fact, neither
gender nor choosing the tournament are significant predictors of the participants’ industry before
they obtained an MBA degree (χ2 tests, p = 0.602 and p = 0.188 respectively). 26 The advantage of
our data is that we can observe the stages in the MBAs’ job market in which gender and taste for
competition emerge as significant determinants of industry selection.

      Before they got a job in the second year of the MBA, participants obtained and completed a
summer internship (see section 3.3). Interviews for internships are arranged through the business
school’s job market. On the demand side, employers signal their interest to participants by inviting

them to an interview. On the supply side, participants signal their interest to employers by biding
for interviews. After observing the bids, employers decide on a final pool of candidates to interview.
Subsequently, employers make offers and participants decide which internship to accept. On
average, participants received 6.377 invitations, sent a bid to 7.027 firms, and took part in 8.242
interviews.
      After the summer internships conclude, employers decide whether to extend a job offer to their
interns, which then decide whether to accept the offer or look for another job. Overall, 61.6% of our
participants received an offer from their internship firm and 49.6% accepted it. For participants
who did not continue with their internship firm, the entire process repeats itself: firms extend
invitations, participants send bids, a new round of interviews ensues, and final offers are made and
accepted. On average, the 206 participants who did not continue with their internship firm received
5.083 invitations, sent a bid to 4.684 firms, and took part in 6.903 interviews. 27

      Are there differences in the aggregate job-market statistics depending on the participants’
gender and competiveness? In the supplementary materials, we show that, for both internships and
jobs, male and female participants received a similar number of invitations, sent bids to a similar

number of firms, and took part in a similar number of interviews. They are also equally likely to


26   If we run a multinomial probit regression to estimate the effect of gender and taste for competition controlling for other
variables (like the regressions in Table 4), we confirm that neither gender nor taste for competition are significant
predictors of the participants’ industry before their MBA (pairwise tests, p > 0.158 and p > 0.422 respectively).
27   Participants who received an offer from their internship firm could still take part in the job market if they postponed
their acceptance. Some of them do so in a limited way. On average, the 203 participants who continued with their
internship firm received 1.049 invitations, sent a bid to 0.734 firms, and took part in 1.241 interviews.



                                                                                                                            29
receive or accept an offer from their internship firm. Likewise, we do not observe important
differences between participants who chose the tournament and those who chose piece-rate
payment system. These results allows us to focus instead on the effect of gender and taste for
competition on the industry from which participants received invitations, sent bids, and obtained
interviews.

   Table 6 presents distributions of the three industry categories depending on the participants’
gender and whether they chose the tournament or the piece-rate payment system. Specifically, for
internships and jobs, the table displays the fraction of participants working in each industry. For
invitations and interviews, the table displays the average fraction of invitations/interviews that
participants receive from firms in each industry. Finally, for bids, the table displays the average




                                                                                                                         31
fraction of bids that participants sent to firms in each industry. Fractions of invitations, bids, and
interviews for internships are based on all 409 participants while those for jobs are based on the
206 participants who did not accept a job at the firm for which they interned.
   A gender gap in selection into industries emerges at the very beginning of the MBAs’ job market.
Compared to men, women receive a smaller fraction of invitations for internships by firms in
finance and a larger fraction from firms in consulting and other industries. In a similar vein, women
send a smaller fraction of their bids for internships to firms in finance and a larger fraction to firms
in consulting and other industries. These differences, particularly the higher fraction of women in
other industries, narrow down in latter stages of the job market but remain substantial. The gap
between participants who chose the tournament and those who chose piece-rate emerges more
slowly. In particular, the difference in the fraction of participants in other industries between those
who chose tournament and piece-rate grows as the job-market progresses.
   To observe a taste for competition industry gap accurately, however, we need to control for
other determinants of choosing the tournament. We do this by running a series of regressions. In all
regressions, we include as independent variables gender, choosing tournament over piece-rate, the
other determinants of choosing the tournament (see column III of Table 2), and all the remaining
control variables from Table 1. We ran regressions for each stage of the job market. For internships

and jobs, we estimated a multinomial probit regression with the industry in which each participant
worked in as the dependent variable. For invitations, bids, and interviews, we estimated a system of
seemingly unrelated regressions with each participant’s fraction of invitations/bids/interviews per
industry as the dependent variables. As in Table 6, regressions of invitations, bids, and interviews
for internships are based on all 409 participants while those for jobs are based on the 206
participants who did not accept a job at their internship firm.

   We depict the marginal effect of being female and being competitive on the fraction of
participants in each industry in Figure 4. We also show the marginal effect of a one-standard
deviation increase in the risk aversion coefficient. It is interesting to compare the emergence of risk
aversion and taste for competition as predictors of the participants’ industry since both are
unobservable individual characteristics that exhibit important gender differences.

                participants in each industry at various stages in the MBA’s job market

 Note: Marginal effects are estimated from multinomial probit regressions for categorical variables (internships and
 jobs) and seemingly unrelated linear regressions for ordinal variables (fractions of invitations, bids, and interviews).
 All regressions include the variables in column III of Table 2 as determinants of choosing the tournament that are
 unrelated to taste for competition as well as the remaining variables from Table 1. The dashed horizontal lines indicate
 that the marginal effects of the respective independent variable are jointly statistically significant at 0.10.




   As seen in the top row of Figure 4, once we control for other variables, women are 3.0% less
likely to work in finance in the job before their MBA, 5.5% less likely to work in consulting, and


                                                                                                                             33
8.6% more likely to work in other industries. As soon as the search for internships begins, however,
we see that women receive 21.8% fewer invitations from firms in finance, 5.3% more invitations
from firms in consulting, and 16.5% more invitations from firms in other industries. Similarly,
women send 29.9% fewer bids to firms in finance, 14.0% more bids to firms in consulting, and
15.9% more bids to firms in other industries. These large differences in industry sorting are
sustained throughout the internship process and in the jobs taken by participants after graduation.
In other words, even after we control for numerous individual characteristics, many of which
exhibit gender differences, there is a large gender difference in industry selection that remains
unaccounted for. 28
     In contrast to gender, the gap in selection into industries due to taste for competition
materializes more gradually. In particular, we do not observe significant differences in the fraction
of invitations, bids, or interviews for internships depending on whether participants are
competitive or not. The first stage at which taste for competition predicts the choice of industry is
once participants decide in which firm to intern. Compared to non-competitive participants,
competitive participants are 8.4% more likely to intern in consulting and 8.5% less likely to intern
in other industries. Thereafter, the gap between consulting and other industries grows as firms
decide whom to make a job offer to and participants decide whether to continue working at their
internship firm. The effect of taste for competition wanes once again when participants who do not
continue with their internship firm receive invitations, send bids, and obtain interviews only to
reemerge once the job market clears and participants have accepted a final job offer.
     In summary, the differences in industry sorting that correlate with taste for competition appear
to be smaller in stages of the job market where there is less interaction between firms and
participants. This pattern suggests that firms are either not interested in selecting based on how
competitive individuals are or taste for competition is not a trait that can be identified through the


28   The fact that gender differences at stages where firms are selecting (i.e., when giving invitations, interviews, and
making offers to interns) are about the same size as those in stages where participants are selecting (i.e., bidding for
interviews and accepting internships) suggests that firms are not using gender to discriminate between candidates.
However, we cannot reject the possibility that gender differences emerge because participants anticipate discrimination
by firms in the different industries and limit their applications to industries where they expect no or even positive
discrimination.



                                                                                                                      34
information firms have when they extend invitations and decide who to interview. Similarly, the
fact that taste for competition does not predict the participants’ bids suggests that attributes that
make jobs more or less desirable to competitive and non-competitive participants are not
discernable at the applications stage. In other words, information exchanged through the interview
process and subsequently while working as interns seems to be crucial for the taste for competition
gap in the industry selection to emerge. Interestingly, a similar pattern is observed for the
emergence of risk aversion as a predictor of selection into different industries, which suggests that
this pattern might be generally present for psychological traits that are typically unobservable.


8. Discussion
In this paper, we study whether individuals who like competition, as measured by a laboratory
experiment, achieve different labor market outcomes than their less competitive-seeking

counterparts. We find that, among MBA graduates from a prestigious business school, competitive
individuals obtain higher earnings at graduation. Importantly, differences in taste for competition
account for a significant share of the gender gap in earnings. We also find that not only are
competitive individuals more likely to work in higher-paying industries at graduation, but they are
also more likely to remain in these industries several years later. Finally, we find that the gender
gap in industry participation arises both from a demand of employees and from a supply of
employers.
   This paper is related to the growing literature relating attitudes towards competition to gender
differences in labor market outcomes (e.g., Zhang, 2013; Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek, 2014;

Flory, Leibbrandt, and List, 2014; Berge et al., 2015; Kamas and Preston, 2015; Reuben, Wiswall,
and Zafar, 2015) and more generally with studies linking traits measured in laboratory settings
with actual behavior in the field (e.g., Karlan, 2005; Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin, 2006; Benz and Meier,

2008; Fehr and Leibbrandt, 2011). These studies establish the external validity of the taste for
competition traits measured developed by Niederle and Vesterlund (2007), but more importantly,
they demonstrate that relevance of taste for competition as a determinant of labor market

outcomes. Crucially, the weak correlation between the experimental measure of taste for
competition and traditional explanatory variables such as test scores and demographic



                                                                                                    35
characteristics indicates that measures of taste for competition provide real added understanding
to the analysis of labor markets.
      A potential concern with any study that correlates measures of a particular trait with labor
market outcomes is that of reverse causality. For example, if a taste for competition is acquired by
working in consulting, then interpretation of the estimates in Tables 3 and 4 is more ambiguous. In
this paper, however, we think this is less of a concern for two reasons. First, we measured taste for
competition at the beginning of the MBA program, more than one year before participants accepted
job offers. Hence, the measure of taste for competition is unaffected by the participants’ experiences
during their MBA such as exposure to different courses or internships. Second, we find no evidence
that taste for competition and the participants’ characteristics at the admissions stage are highly
correlated, suggesting that differences in taste for competition were not caused by differing
experiences before the MBA.
      Demonstrating the significance of taste for competition for earnings does open up the question,
why do competitive individuals earn more? The most straightforward explanation is that
competitive individuals are simply better at the tasks demanded by better-paid jobs. We do not find
that taste for competition is correlated with the participants’ GPA and GMAT scores, 29 but it is
possible for taste for competition to proxy differences in ability that are not captured by

conventional measures. Therefore, a fruitful line of future research would be to study the link
between taste for competition and performance in different jobs. Another potential explanation is
that competitive individuals might be more likely to negotiate their earnings. In the supplementary
materials, we show that there is little support for this explanation in our sample as competitive
individuals are equally likely to report that their earnings were the outcome of a successful
negotiation. A third explanation is one of tastes. If a majority of people find that working under
competitive conditions is inherently distasteful, then there can be a compensating wage differential
to work in firms or industries with competitive corporate cultures. 30 This explanation is consistent

29   Regressing GPA or GMAT scores on choosing the tournament and the control variables in column III of Table 2 results
in a positive but not statistically significant coefficient for the tournament (p = 0.202 and p = 0.411 respectively).
30   It is also possible for there to be an interaction between productivity and the environment. Competitive individuals
might not be generally more productive, but they might perform better in competitive environments. In fact, a differential
response by men and women to tournament incentives and acute stress is often found (e.g., Gneezy, Niederle, and



                                                                                                                         36
with competitive individuals being more common in finance and consulting, as these two industries
are known for their highly competitive environments (Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz, 2010). In this
respect, it would be interesting to identify the specific characteristics of competitive industries that
individuals who are classified as competitive find less distasteful. For instance, competitive
individuals might be better as managing stress or they might cope better with long and inflexible
working hours.
      An interesting finding in our study is that differences in industries due to taste for competition
appear only in some stages of the job market. 31 In particular, we see a smaller impact of taste for

competition in stages of the job market where there is limited contact between participants and
firms. On one hand, this empirical pattern suggests that it is difficult for firms to identify
competitive individuals based on the information available to them when they extend interviews
and for competitive individuals to identify the specific jobs in which their attitude towards
competition gives them a comparative advantage. On the other hand, it raises the question, why
does taste for competition predict selection into different industries once participants interact
more meaningfully with employers (i.e., after interviewing and working for them)? One possibility
is that competitive individuals are more productive in industry-specific tasks but their higher
productivity is not evident to employers until they get to talk to them or observe them at work.

Another possibility is that participants need first-hand experience with specific firms to evaluate
whether they with feel comfortable with the degree of taste for competition in a given firm. In
either case, our findings suggest that the matching process in the job market could be improved if

firms providing accurate information about their views on competition.
      Lastly, we would like to highlight that our sample consists of MBA graduates from one of the top
business schools in the country. We think that this is one of the paper’s strengths as top business
positions is precisely one of the areas where large gender differences persist. Hence, our paper is
directly relevant to a population of interest. That being said, our sample is clearly not

Rustichini, 2003; Angelucci and Córdova. 2014). To our knowledge, this gender difference has yet to be linked to the
measure of taste for competition of Niederle and Vesterlund (2007).
31   Differing effects of taste for competition at different points in the career of individuals’ is consistent with the literature.
For instance, Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek (2014) find that taste for competition predicts high-school track choices
while Reuben, Wiswall, and Zafar (2015) find no relation between taste for competition and major choice in college.



                                                                                                                                 37
representative of the general population or even of the average individual in business. Hence, one
must be careful when generalizing our findings to other populations. On one hand, gender
differences in taste for competition might be population specific. For instance, using a
representative sample from Norway, Almas et al. (2015) find that gender differences in taste for
competition are more pronounced in populations with high socioeconomic status. On the other
hand, it is reasonable to presume that taste for competition could have a different effect on earnings
in non-business careers. Hence, an important subject matter for future research is to explore the
relationship between taste for competition and earnings in other samples.
