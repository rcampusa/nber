     This   paper assesses the contribution of federal antidiscrimination policy

to the dramatic improvement of black economic status in manufacturing           that

occurred in South Carolina in the znid-1960's. Using a unique data source on

wages and employment by race, sex and industry' for South Carolina we evaluate

competing   explanations.   Human capital stories, supply shift stories and tight

labor market stories do not account for the black breakthrough.            Our study

documents a significant contribution of federal antidiscrimination           programs.


     Two decades of research have failed to produce professional consensus on

the contribution of federal government         civil rights activity to the economic

progress of black Americans.        There are several reasons why this is so.      In part

it is due to the lack of convincingmeasures of federal civil rights activity.

In part it is due to the reliance of much of the literature            on notoriously

fragile macro time series in which numerous plausible explanations compete for

scarce degrees of freedom.      Highly aggregated time series or cross section
studies do not isolate well defined labor markets in which supply and demand

factors can be meaningfully separated,         although it is the separation of these

factors that is essential to the resolution of the debate on federal impact.

Much valuable institutional detail may be lost in the process of data

aggregation or in the fitting of "general purpose" wage equations which

constrain equality in coefficient estimates across diverse sectors.

     This paper takes a new look at this old question using a unique body of

data on employment and wages by race and sex for the manufacturing sector of

South Carolina.    Some of the data are available at the disaggregated         county

level affording useful cross sectional variation,                 By focusing attention on well

defined labor markets, it is easier to separate out supply and demand side

impacts on black status.            Unlike most previous studies of the topic that focus

exclusively on black wages, our study analyzes both black wages and employment.

        Trends in black economic progress in South Carolina are typical of trends

for the South as a whole,               As noted by Richard Butler, James Smith and Finis

Welch and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a                sizeable   component of the post-

1960 U.S. aggregate relative wage and occupational improvement for blacks arises

frcm improvements in the South. Thus a study of black economic progress in the

South is likely to illwsinate the sources of Southern and hence U.S. black

                          A                                                              is of
economic progress.            study of black progress in Southern manufacturing

particular interest. Butler shows that a substantial portion of the gain in
black economic status in the South (one half) arises from the movement of blacks

from traditional sectors into operative end craftsmen jobs concentrated in

manufacturing.

        Three major   -   and not necessarily mutually exclusive           .
                                                                               explanations have
been advanced to explain the growth in aggregate black male relative (to white

male) earnings found in the post-1964 data.               (1)   Some authors, seizing on the

coincidence in timing between the passage of Title VII and other related federal

antidiscrimination        activity and the relative improvement in black wages, assign

a central role to federal antidiscrimination              activity.    (Richard Freeman (1973),

(1981), Wayne Vroman and Charles Brown).                Other scholars deny this claim (see,

g.,,g   Smith and Welch)      .   (2)   Welch, Smith, and Smith and Welch assign a central,

but not necessarily exclusive, role to human capital formation and the

importance of previous state government discrimination                 in the provision of

schooling.     (3) Still others (James Tobin, William Wilson, Milton Friedman)

markets associated with industrialization,      the emergence of competitive markets

or demand management policies.

     Few scholars dispute the importance of schooling in raising black incomes.

Most acknowledge that tight labor markets favor employment of blacks although

there is considerable controversy surrounding the effect of tight labor markets

on racial wage differentials. Most of the disagreement in the literature centers

on the contribution of federal antidiscrimination activity      -   the   focus of this


paper.

     We address this question by using empirical proof by elimination.          Using a

variety of data sources and measures of federal activity and eliminating other

plausible explanations, we conclude that federal policy benefited black economic

status in South Carolina.

     Ours is a tale of two sectors.       The strongest evidence of federal impact is

found in the traditional manufacturing sectors of the state that were already

thriving when Jim Crow laws formalized racial segregation in employment          in 1915.

Human capital stories cannot explain the timing of black improvement in these

sectors.

     There is little evidence of federal impact on black status in the more

modern sectors of the state that emerged after 1945.       Somewhat surprisingly, we

also find no evidence of employment discrimination      in state, local or federal

government hiring after accounting for individual qualifications.         The growth in

black employment and wages in these sectors appears to be market or supply side

driven.                               -




     Our analysis establishes the value of more disaggregated industrial and

institutional analyses in assessing the contribution of federal activity to

black status. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for the relevant

economic and institutional histories of industries in understanding black


                                            3
economic progress. Our evidence confirms the wisdom of Gavin Wright's emphasis

on the role of institutions in explaining Southern economic history.          Our

analysis also provides evidence against the widely held belief espoused by

Charles Murray and other conservatives that federal government policy has not

contributed to the elevation of black economic status.

        We develop our argument in the following way. In section   1,   we present

salient features of the South Carolina labor market experience of blacks.            Five

striking graphs suggest that the federal government may have played an important

role in improving black status. Although we sound cautionary notes against first

impressions, in the remainder of the paper we demonstrate that they are correct.

        Section II establishes that trends in South Carolina are like those in the

U.S. South.     Thus our analysis of South Carolina data contains important lessons

for understanding the progress of blacks in the South and hence their progress

in the U.S. as a whole.

        Section III states and Section IV evaluates competing arguments using

detailed analyses of the data.      The paper concludes with a summary of the

evidence


               I. The Black Breakthrough in South Carolina Manufacturing

        Figures one and two plot South Carolina industrial data on employment and

wages by race and sex for the period 1940-1980.      The data are from the      Annual

Reports of the South Carolina Department of Labor.      Below, and in a companion

paper    (the authors and Butler), we establish the validity of this self-reported

data collected from firms.

        Black employment   is a stable fraction of total employment between 1940 and

1965. (Fig. 1). Suddenly, in 1965, the proportion of black employment begins to

grow at a time when total manufacturing employment is growing.          The relative




                                           4
wage series for black workers shows an upturn at the same time although it is

less dramatic.    (Fig. 2).

     Textiles are the major industry in the state employing 80 percent of all

manufacturing    employment in 1940 and a still sizeable 40 percent in 1980.      Most

of the breakthrough in black employment occurs in this industry and the related

apparel industry. There is much less evidence of any dramatic breakthrough in

the non-textile non-apparel sector of manufacturing although there is visible

growth in the share of black female employment after 1965 (see Fig. 3) but the

rise in relative wages for black females starts long before 1965 (see Fig. 4).

The decline in the black male share in this sector and the rise in the female

share for both races is largely due to the entry on a large scale of the female

intensive electrical machinery     into the state in 1964 and the entry into the

food industry of new firms employing women of both races in equal proportions.

(See the authors and Butler for further evidence on this point).

     Figure five presents employment shares by race and sex in textiles between
                  1
1910 and 1977.        It confirms the impression conveyed by Figure one.   Through

two World Wars, the Creat Depression and the booms of the 50's and 20's the

share of blacks in textile employment remains constant at a low level despite

growth in the quality and quantity of black schooling and despite economic

scarcity resulting     from tight labor markets.   Suddenly in 1965 the black share

in employment begins to improve when Title VII legislation becomes effective and

the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission begins to press textile firms to

employ blacks and when Executive Order 11246 forbids discrimination by

government contractors at the risk of forfeit of government business.      Textiles

sold a significant proportion of their output to the federal government      in

1965.2   The improvement in black employment and wages occurs at a time and in an

industry that suggests a major role for government activity.

     This evidence supporting   government impact is reinforced by some additional

been an ideal example of Kenneth Arrow's model of discrimination.   Initial racial

exclusion ratified by a 1915 Jim Crow law may have been perpetuated by fixed

costs of employment coupled with fellow employee tastes for discrimination. The

costs to marginal experimentation   in hiring blacks may well have been raised by

the geographical   isolation of mills from existing supplies of black labor which

required residental integration to effect industrial integration.    Southern

textiles was one of the few industries found by Bunting to have monopsony power

because of its geographical isolation from other employers.

     Title VII and related aritidiscriminatlon activity seems likely to have had

its most visible effect in industries like South Carolina textiles in which

exclusion of blacks was so blatant.   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

                                                  on employment discrininatlon
targeted Southern textiles and conducted hearings

in that industry in late 1966 and early 1967.     These hearings were widely

publicized.   (See Richard Rowan). More than 140 charges of wage and employment

discrimination were filed against textile firms in North and South Carolina in

1965. (See Alice Kidder, Sidney Evans, Michael Simmons and Dupont Smith).       Any

rational theory of government bureaucracy would make South Carolina textiles an

inviting target for equal rights intervention.     The Defense Department, which

was in charge of monitoring textile affirmative action programs, was known to be

relatively vigorous in pursuit of equal opportunity. Three large textile

     Before any conclusion about the efficacy of federal policy is embraced,

however, it is important to raise some cautionary questions,    the answers to

which constitute   the remainder of this paper.

    The first argument against the obvious is that the data are suspect.

                                                                   one through

five they may have lied about the growth in black employment

federal intervention and they may have lied about the level of black employment

before 1965 to avoid state intervention on behalf of Jim Crow laws.

      In Table   1,   we compare the South Carolina Department of Labor (SCDOL) data

on demographic employuient in textiles to that reported in the U.S. Census of
                                                 The SCDOL data and the Census data

are not expected to be the same in any year since the Census includes all

                                                     workers.           In addition, the
employees, whereas the SCDOL includes only production

Census interviews workers and the SCDOL interviews firms.       Finally, the Census

includes part-time workers.       For these reasons we expect the Census figures to

be larger except perhaps in 1970. SCDOL includes chemical industry workers with
                                                                            the
textile workers. The chemical industry expanded rapidly in the State during

l960s, although it is a much smaller employer than textiles.        Despite these

numerical discrepancies,      the same pattern of dramatic black improvement is found

in both data sources. In a companion paper (the authors and Butler), we

      The second argument against the obvious is harder to refute.         The South

textile labor coupled with a dramatic contraction in the traditional

white labor supply due to       the secular decline in South Carolina agriculture may

have created unusual pressure for integration of the industry as a means of
keeping down labor costs.    Federal antidiscrimination   activity may have simply

facilitated the inevitable by giving employers an excuse for doing what they

wanted to do anyway.    Most economists who have analyzed the desegregation of

Southern textiles claim that the primary source of black improvement was the

tight labor market.    (Rowan and Donald Osborne).3

     Other arguments can also be advanced against the obvious explanation.         The

first is a supply shift argument that focuses on the decline in South Carolina

(and Southern) agriculture as a source of growth in black industrial employment.

The second argument is the 'human capital" ergument. One version of this

argument mirrors Smith's explanation of black aggregate relative wage growth in

the 60's and claims that growth in the quality and quantity of black schooling

may have accounted for the black breakthrough in textiles and related

industries.

     We address these arguments in the remainder of the paper.      We first

document that trends in the status of blacks in South Carolina are typical of

those in the South.


                             II. South Carolina in Context

     Butler establishes that for the period 1960-1970 two thirds of the growth

in the aggregate occupational index of black males relative to white males is

due to improvement in relative wages or occupational      standing in the South. He

goes on to note that much of this improvement comes in the operative and

craftsman categories that are concentrated in manufacturing.      Scholars at the

U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (Table 8.1) document that the rate of

                                                                       terms was
convergence of black male wages to white male wages in percentage

almost cwice,as fast in the South as in the non-South over the period 1960-1980

for males age 25-54.     Since roughly half of the black population lives in the




                                          8
South, these estimstes    imply that two thirds of the growth in relative black

status over the period is attributable

be established that trends in black relative status in South Carolina resemble

those in the rest of the South, our study of that state acquires a more general

character.

     The dramatic breakthrough     in black employment in South Carolina textiles

was also experienced in other major Southern textile states. Table 2 documents

                                                                 for these
this claim using U.S. Census data. Annual data are not available

                                        to compare the exact timing of the black
contiguous states so it is not possible

breakthroughs.   But we can be sure that the breakthrough in all states occurred

in the same decade.      It is likely that lessons learned about South Carolina

textiles apply to these states as well.

     South Carolina is not a microcosm of the South but the state and the region

                                                                           1940
share many common trends. The proportionof the population that is black in

is higher in South Carolina (44%) than for the South as a whole (26%). The black
                                                                       Carolina
proportion declines in both geographic entities until 1970. Both South

and the South experienced a substantial decline in agricultural employment

between 1940 and 1980 and a substantial growth in manufacturing       employment. Due

to the presence of the textile industry in the state, the fraction of the work
                                                                              as
force employed in manufacturing is higher in South Carolina than in the South

a whole. The breakout of blacks from traditional sectors was similar in the

South and in South Carolina.      Tables 3 and   4 reveal that trends in employment

                                                                    distribution
by race and sex are also similar. The convergence of the industrial

of black employment to that of white employment is similar in both.        Employment

 in domestic service (personal services) and agriculture declines for black women

 and employment in manufacturing    and professional services increases in South
                                                                   is the same in
 Carolina and in the South. The pattern of educational improvement

     Trends in Southern labor markets are undeniably reflected in the labor

market of South Carolina.    Lessons learned about black progress in South

Carolina seem likely to apply to the South as a whole.

     Various   demand side and supply side explanations have been offered as

causes of the black breakthrough   in manufacturing   in South Carolina.      On the

supply side, one explanation relates to the decline of agricultural employment

in the South which was a consequence of technology and government policy and

which led to shifts in the supply of blacks available to manufacturing.         In South

Carolina, black employment in agriculture declined by about 98,000 workers

between 1950 and 1970.    Over the same decades, black employment in manufacturing

increased by about 40,000 workers. The timing of these changes suggests a

possible causal role with the decline of agriculture releasing supplies of black

labor to the manufacturing   sector.

      A   second supply side explanation relates to the increasing quantity and

quality of black education during the forties and fifties that made blacks

better qualified to compete with whites in the labor market.      In South Carolina,

there is considerable evidence of black educational gains relative to whites

during the years leading up to 1965. Figure 7 shows the average highest grade

completed by 5 year birth cohorts from 1900 to   l954.     The figure shows steady


convergence over the period.    As documented by Welch one year of schooling for a

black student was not equivalent to one year of schooling for a white student in

the system of segregated schools that existed in the South and in South Carolina

      In this section, we examine the evidence in support of each of the major

changes by sex demonstrate that black males accounted for most of

in agricultural employment (28,000), but for less than half of the       increase in

black manufacturing   employment    (10,000).   Most of the increase in black

                                                                 whereas black
manufacturing   employment was accounted for by females (22,000)

female agricultural employment declined by only 10,000. In a companion paper



                                           11
(the authors and Butler) we document that only a tiny fraction of black entrants

into industry came from agriculture.     A simple supply shift argument cannot

account for the growth in black manufacturing    employment during the sixties or

the fifties.


                          B. SchoolinE Quality and Quantity

        We next consider the schooling quality and quantity hypothesis.   Table 6

gives the average education, by five year age cohort, of white males and white

females employed in the textile industry in 1960.    These averages are indicative

of the education required for employment in the textile industry in 1960. Since

the quality of black schooling is lower than that of    whites, Table 6 also

reports quality corrected or adjusted years of    education.   The adjusted figures

are formed by adding two years to the white average and rounding to the nearest

complete year or 12, whichever is greater. The purpose of this admittedly ad hoc

adjustment    is to correct for the difference in schooling quality by race to see

if blacks are qualified to work in textiles on the basis of their educational

attainment.

     In Table 7 we show the percentage of black males and females in South

Carolina with years of schooling completed greater than or equal to the white

male and female adjusted averages given in Table 6 above. Already by 1960, over

25% of all blacks in South Carolina between the ages of 21 and 30 had sufficient

education to be employed in textiles as measured by skill levels presented       in

Table   6.   In the older cohorts, about 20% of black females and 15% of black

males had sufficient education. Yet less than 1% of employed black females and

less than 5% of employed black males between the ages of 21 and 65 worked in the

textile industry in 1960.     About 25% of all employed whites in the same age

                                                                              of

         One implication of a pure form of the educational improvements hypothesis

is that controlling for education and other individual characteristics, blacks

should not be under-represented       in the textile industry in 1960 relative to

1970. Table 8 gives the coefficients on a race dummy variable from a series of

linear probability regression models for males. The sample of all employed

persons is broken down by sex and five year cohorts.5 The left hand side

variable is equal to one if the individual is employed in a given industry and

zero otherwise.        The right hand side variables        include an intercept, years of

                                                                 one for blacks
schooling, years of schooling squared, and a race dummy equal to

and zero for whites. The regressions are performed for each Census year from

1940 to 1980.6 A full report of these regressions is given in Heckman, Payner

and Butler.     The industry categories, based on SIC codes, are:

    1.     Agriculture,    forestry, and fisheries

    2.     Mining and construction

    A    non-zero coefficient on the race dummy may be interpreted as arising from

dscrim1nat1on on the demand side. Controlling for individual characteristics,

the coefficient on the dummy       variable       indicates whether blacks are more or leSs

males are not under-represented          in these industries.

        For black females compared to white female the story is quite similar. (See

the authors and Butler)! Besides being under-represented                   in textiles, black

females are also under-represented            in the closely allied apparel industry. Also,


                                                      14
in 1960 black females are over-represented      in most industries, including non-

traditional manufacturing,    chemicals,   government, services and trade.

    The 1970 regressions shows little change from 1960 for black males except

in textiles.     In the younger cohorts of textile workers, blacks are no longer

under-represented    and in the older cohorts, they are much less so than in 1960.

     In a companion paper (the authors and Butler) we examine the effect of

                                                       on our analysis.        We run

obtained without adjusting for quality of education.




                                           15
      As a final test, we ask the question:       what happens to the   probability of

finding a black employed in the textile industry as the average level of black

education rises from its 1960 to its 1970 level?       The results for black males

are shown in Table 9 for selected industries using the 1970 linear probability

model regression coefficients]       For black males in most industries, including

non-traditional   manufacturing,   chemicals, different levels of government,

financial and business services and wholesale      and retail trade, the effect of

increasing education   is to increase the probability of employment.      In textiles,

as well as agriculture,    the effect is to actually decrease the probability of

employment. Textiles   is a low skill industry.     Increasing education has the

effect of decreasing the probability of employment      in low skill industries.

     Although blacks had already made gains in education relative to whites in
the years leading up to 1965, the evidence presented here does not support the

claim that educational improvements led to increased black employment and wages

in the textile industry.     First, the gains in schooling measured by years

completed and expenditure per student per year came gradually.      Second, by 1960,

between one-fifth and one-fourth of the adult blacks in South Carolina had

sufficient education to work in the textile industry.       However, black females

were practically excluded and black males were employed in very small numbers in

textiles.   Third, even controlling for education, blacks were found to be

severely under-represented    in textiles in 1960, but much less so in 1970. Also,

in all other industries with the exception of apparel, blacks were not found to

be under-represented when educational background is taken into account.

Finally, if years of schooling of blacks are increased, the probability of

blacks being employed in textiles actually decreases.

     The evidence presented here confirms the powerful role of education in

elevating black employment in other sectors of the economy, especially

government and the emerging new industrial sector of the state that apparently


                                          16
never discriminated    against blacks (or at least black qualifications)     on a

statistically   or numerically significant scale. As black skills improved, so did

their representation    in these sectors.


                         C. The Titbt Labor Market Hynothesis

      With statewide aggregate data, the tight labor market hypothesis is not

testable.   The black breakthrough in textiles is an event that occurs only once.

Many other events that occur contemporaneously with the black breakthrough are

equally plausible   candidates for being the cause.      Without more variation in the

data one cannot discriminate among the possibilities.        Although we do not have

evidence from other comparably tight labor market episodes in South Carolina, we

do have a time series of cross sections on the black breakthrough as it occurs

in different counties of South Carolina.         Even with these att, the labor market

hypothesis is not testable if one believes that South Carolina is a single labor

market or that all counties are identical. In that case, a tight labor market

could cause simultaneous effects across counties just as uniformly applied

government policy could.     However, if the counties of South Carolina do not form

iiiñjt&TIbor market,      the two hypotheses can be differentiated.      A tight labor

market would affect the various counties differently, whereas uniformly applied

government policy would plausibly affect all counties simultaneously.         We argue

that the counties of South Carolina     are different labor markets and that the

simultaneous breakthrough of blacks in textiles across those counties is

evidence against the labor market hypothesis and in favor of the government

                                                     eleven South Carolina
activity hypothesis. We begin by examining data from

counties for which we can form a consistent time series on textile employment by

race and sex for the period 1910-197?. Most of the 11 counties are in the

Piedmont region in the northeast portion of the state.        However,   the south

central and central portions of the state are also represented.



                                            17
     Table 10 shows population levels and shares respectively by race and sex

for these eleven counties in 1960. The counties vary greatly in racial

composition. They also vary greatly in size of the population.

     Table 11 shows total employment and employment      in selected industries in

1960. The county population employed varies from 34 percent to 41 percent. The

proportionof the employed working in manufacturing varies from 55 percent to 20

percent. The counties vary substantially      in the size of the manufacturing

workforce.   To the extent that regional labor markets exist, we expect the effect

of changing labor market conditions to be different across counties.        Anthony

Tang documents sharp differences among contiguous Piedmont counties in South

Carolina in many indicators of economic development.

     Figures 8 to 18 show employment shares by race and sex in the textile

industry for these eleven counties from 1910 to 1977.       Tn seven of the eleven

counties,    the textile breakthrough for black females occurs in the fiscal year

1965. The textile industry data are collected on a fiscal year basis.        Therefore

fiscal 1966 covers July 1965 through June 1966. Tn the four remaining counties,

the black female breakthrough    in textiles occurs in fiscal year 1966. Since

these are fiscal years, we cannot rule out the possibility       that the breakthrough

occurs in calendar year 1965 in all counties.

     After 55 years of near total exclusion from the industry, black females

became employed in significant     numbers for the first time in the mid-sixties      in

                                                                  in the industry
each county.     Similarly, after constant but low utilization

prior to the mid-sixties, black malea significently increase their employment in

textiles in fiscal years 1965 or 1966 in each county.       Tf the state of South

Carolina was a single homogeneous labor market with no mobility costs for

                                                                          of
workers, a tight labor market might produce the simultaneous breakthrough

black employment of the type exhibited here.       However, given significant

                                                                      across
differences in employment, industrialization, and racial demographics


                                         18
counties, we conclude that South Carolina is not a single labor market.

Therefore, we do not expect changing labor market conditions        alone to have the

same impact on black textile employment simultaneously        across all counties.


                          The   Covernaent Activity Bvothesis
     Evidence supporting    the government activity hypothesis     comes from the time

series on statewide textile employment and wages by demographic group presented

above.     Black textile employment was virtually unaffectedby events that

occurred from 1910 to 1965.      This is especially true for black female

employment.     Under the tight labor market hypothesis we might expect some black

employment changes in the upswings of the numerous business cycles that occur

prior to 1965.     The government   activity hypothesis   predicts that significant

changes in black employment and wages would occur after the 1964 Civil Rights

Acts but has no prediction about black improvement in previous periods. The

simultaneous breakthroughof blacks in counties varying in size, racial

composition and industrial composition is consistent with uniformly applied

government policy.

         The fact that white male textile employment begins decreasing at about the

same time as black employment increases is also consistent with the government

activity hypothesis.    See Fig. 19.8   On the demand side, fins complying with

governnent policy would likely employ fewer whites per unit output expansion as

their demand for blacks increased. Evidence documenting that this occurred is

given below.     Examination of the wage data gives a supply side explanation for

the decrease in white male textile employment that occurred after 1965.        After

increasing from 1959 through 1965 white male real wages were practically

unchanged from 1966 to 1971 despite growth in employment        and output in the

industry. See Fig. 20.     Real wages for blacks increased through the end of the



                                           19
sixties.       If textile fins were discriminating against blacks before 1965, but
                                                                   white wages
not in later years, then under the government activity hypothesis,

would stop rising as a large pool of black labor became available to textiles

for the first time. Black        would continue to rise over time as blacks
                                   wages

become employed in higher paying occupations.

       White male real wages stop growing in textiles after 1966.                            As their wages

in textiles declined relative to those in other industries, white males left

textiles for other industries.              The slowing of wage growth for white males does

not occur in all industries.           Figure 21 shows real wages in non-textile

manufacturing.       For white males,           real wages continue to grow after 1965 at a

rate similar to that experienced prior to 1965.                             Wages for other demographic

                                                            sixties.                             Thus there
groups in these industries also grew throughout most of the
                                                                  the government

     The explanatory variables used in our analysis are, with one exception,

taken from the Annual Reports of the South Carolina Department       of Labor:

    Textile Output        — Real textile output in millions

                            of dollars.

    New Establishments    — Number of    establishments which entered the

                            county after 1957.

    Old Establishments    — Number of    establishments which entered the

                            county before 1958.

    Non-textile Output    — Real non-textile manufacturing

     Industry demand is proxied by county textile output. Higher levels of

output would be expected to lead to greater employment of workers.          The number

of new establishments and the number of old establishments are introduced as

separate variables to test a version of the industrialization hypothesis          that

                                                               to discriminate

establishments   were Northern owned and it is possible that their owners had

rather than        as the dependent variable. The main inferences from using

linear        are preserved in the Box-Cot regressions but the latter Lit the

data betsr.        is estimated along with the other coefficients of the model

using nonlinear least squares. Both log and linear versions of X         produce the

same inference. To simplify the presentationof these results, we report only

the linear X version of these estimates in Table 12. The slope coefficients are

for the stated dependent variable. The sign of the estimated effect on

the same as the sign of the coefficient reported in the Table. Durbin-Watson

statistics for each county (reported in a companion paper by the authors and

Butler) indicate few problems with serial correlation in the estimated county

residuals. Corrections for heteroscedasticity      using Halbert White's method do

not overturn any inference obtained using least squares standard errors.           For

the sake of brevity we only report the results of tests based on the

conventional least squares standard errors.

     There is evidence of statistically significant positive effects of defense

contracts on black employment and statistically       significant negative effects of

this variable on white male employment.        Increased textile output raises

     In the model without interactions there is a clear effect of establishment

size on employment by race.         Smaller establishments     (measured by output per

establishment)    tend to hire more blacks. Larger establishments         tend to hire more

white females while the estimated scale effect for white males is ambiguous. The

only pronounced new establishment        -   old   establishment effect is for black

females.     There is evidence that new establishments hire more black women and

fewer whites than do old establishments. The interactive specifications            reveal

that new establishments tend to hire more blacks and fewer white males.

     The estimated models show a steady increase in estimated year effects for

black workers in the post-1964 period. (These estimates are reported in our

companion paper with Butler). Further evidence of structural shift in the labor
market is revealed by simulating the best fitting models over the crucial period

1965-1970.    Such simulations allow examination of the change in employment

attributable to changes in each X variable and the change not explained by the

regression. The results of such a simulation are presented in Table 13 which

presents results for both the interactive and the noninteractive models.

     The most striking feature of the Table is the failure of each fitted model

to account for most of the observed employment change.             Much of the improvement

in black status is accounted for by unexplained post-1964 year effects. The

                                                   the operation of unmeasured
importance of such year effects is consistent with


                                               24

is statistically    significant, the contribution of defense contracts to black
                                  ll
employment is numerically weak.        If all post-1964 interaction effects are

attributed to government policy, between 70 to 80 percent of the predicted

change in black employment is attributable to this source.            In any case,

unmeasured coulponents account for most of the observed change. Such dramatic

structural shift seems inconsistent with pure forms of the tight labor market or

industrialization   hypotheses.   Government    activity   -
                                                               residually defined    -   seems

to be the most plausible source of this change.


                              V. Summary and Conclusions

     This paper examines the sources of black economic progress in South

Carolina.     Lessons from that state are of general interest because trends in

black progress in South Carolina resemble trends in the South           a   a whole and

black improvement in the South accounts for a substantial component of aggregate

U.S. black improvement over the period 1960-1980.          We focus on the manufacturing

sector.     Butler documents that much of the Southern black progress comes through

entry of black workers into craftsmen and operative occupations and improvement

in relative black wages in those occupations.

     Using a unique body of time series-cross section data on employment and

wages by race and sex supplemented by a variety of U.S. government sources, we

examine a number of competing explanations for the breakthrough             in black

                                                                     1964.                 We
employment and wages in the manufacturing sector that occurred after

demonstrate    the value of disaggregating the data and establish that different

factors account for black progress in different sectors.

     The principal manufacturing employer in the state is the textile industry.

This industry was already a substantial employer by 1915 when Jim Crow laws



                                           25
formalizeda preexisting exclusion of blacks from the main operative and

craftsman occupations of that industry.      We document that over the period 1910-

1964, the share of black employment was low and stable despite a variety of

economic circumstances in the state.    Suddenly, in 1965, blacks of both sexes

become employed on a large scale. That year witnessed the implementation of

Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which forbade employment discrimination.

Executive Order 11246 was also issued in that year.        The Order forbade

discriminationby government contractors and required the establishment of

affirmative action programs.    The South Carolina textile industry sold 5 percent

of its output to the U.S. Government in 1965. The Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission targeted Southern textiles and held hearings on the industry in 1966.

The improvement in black status after 1964 is uniform across geographically

diverse local labor markets. Regression   analyses of black employment      reveal a

structural   shift in employment equations that cannot be accounted for by

conventional measures of output or the growth in alternative opportunities.

There is some evidence of greater black employment in counties that sold more

goods to the U.S. Government. Both the timing evidence and the regression

evidence suggest that government   activity played an important role in

integrating textiles. As a large new supply of black workers became available to

the industry, the real wages of white workers     -   which had been   rising for six

consecutive years before 1965-suddenly flattened.      A   similar but less well

documented story can be told for black female progress in the closely related

apparel industry.

     Alternative explanations of the black breakthrough        in textiles appear to be

                    A                                                        to the
much less cogent.       supply shift story attributing the black improvement

decline in agriculture cannot account for the timing of the black breakthrouzh

in textiles.    The human capital story of improvement in black skill also cannot


                                        26
account for the timing. Increases in black human capital between 1960 and 1970

should have reduced black employment because textiles is a low skill industry.

By 1960, there were plenty of blacks with skill levels adequate to perform

textile jobs.

     The only viable alternative to the story of government as the agent of

change in textiles is the story that assigns a central role to the tightness of

the labor market.   By the mid-1960's, South Carolina had a booming economy. New

industries entered the state and the traditional reservoir of white farm labor

had disappeared. Real wages in textiles increased making competition with low

wage foreign firms more difficult.      The incentives to draw on a new source of

low wage labor were greatJ2

     What cannot be dismissed and indeed seems quite plausible is that in 1965

entrepreneurs   seized on the new federal legislation and decrees to do what they

wanted to do anyway. One could argue that the federal antidiscrimination and

affirmative action laws came into existence in 1964 precisely because the U.S.

labor market was tight to an unprecedented degree and discrimination      was

becoming costly. This study cannot reject the hypothesis that it was the

confluence of tight labor markets and new laws that made integration in textiles

occur so rapidly.   Separating these factors requires information from another

episode in which comparable laws are put in place in a slack labor market.

     We do not claim that federal activity accounts for black progress in other

sectors of the state.   A   major finding of our analysis is that once skill levels

are accounted for blacks were not excluded from other sectors even in 1960.

Newer industries entering the state long after the institution of Jim Crow laws

tended to be color blind in their employment practices.       Surprisingly,   so were

state and local governments by 1960.      Blacks were underrepresented   in these

sectors only because they lacked skills.       As their skill levels expanded, so did


                                          27
their employment   in those sectors.

     We have combined data   front U.S.   government sources with data published by

the state of South Carolina.    Three types of data were combined to form the

South Carolina data base: annual county level data annual state level data and

Census year data. For the period 1910-1935, the data come     front Revorts   and

Reso1utjonof South Caroling to     the General Assembly of the State of South

Carolina.   For the period 1936-1971, the data come from the Annual Report of The

Departmencpf Labor to the State of South Carolina. In addition to the South

Carolina data we collected U.S. Population Census data for the Census South and

selected Southern states.

     We obtain the following data, by county for each fiscal year (July 1 to

June 30).

For the textile industry, the variables are:

Georgia and Virginia from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census of Population: Vol

2, for those states.

        U.S. Census public use microdata   computer taples are another source of

data.     The 1940, 1950 and 1960 tapes each contain a one percent sample, the 1970

tapes contains a two percent sample, and the 1980 tape contains a five percent

sample.       We use the following variables from each Census tape for South

Carolina.

        occupation

        industry

        race

        sex

        age

        annual wage income (dollars) last year

        hours worked last week

        weeks worked last year

        highest grade completed

        labor force status (civilian, employed, unemployed, out of labor force)


From the U.S. Bureau of the Census Public Use Samples we also obtain data for

the Census South.       We use one percent samples for 1940 and 1950, one percent

samples for 1960 and 1970 and a 0.5 percent for 1980.       Data on race, sex and

industry were obtained for each Census year.

        For certain analyses, we form the following five categories of

manufacturing      industries: textiles, chemicals, apparel, non-traditional

manufacturing and traditional manufacturing. Chemicals and apparel were isolated

because of their similarity to textiles.        The other two categories were formed




                                           31
on the basis of a ranking of the percentage change in employment from 1960 to

1970 in the remaining manufacturing industries.     The five non-traditional   high

growth industries are: transportation   equipment, electrical machinery,   non-

electrical machinery, metal working and founderies and machine shops. The six

traditional low growth industries are: food products, paper and pulp, stone and

clay, lumber and furniture, printing and publishing and miscellaneous

manufacturing   -




     The data from the South Carolina reports are available for the fiscal year

beginning July 1.    The Census and Department   of Defense data are available for

the calendar year.   We chose the following convention for matching data from the

various sources. The fiscal year is defined to correspond to the calendar year

in which the fiscal year ends.

     A   copy of the South Carolina data is available from ICPSR at the University

of Michigan.

 2About 5 percent-120 million-1965 dollars.

 3An exception is Kidder who assigns a central role to changes in community

 mores.

 4These figures were calculated using the 1950 Public Use Sample for the cohorts

 born between 1900 and 1924 and the 1980 Public Use Sample for the cohorts born

 between 1925 and 1954.

 5The regressions were also run using civilian labor force and total population


                                         38
as the sample       instead of   employed persons.   The results described in the text

are unaffectedby these changes in the sample.

6Selected regreasions were repeated using a probit specification            to correct for


heteoskedasticity. The results were qualitatively similar to those reported

here.

7This analysis was repeated using the 1960 regressioncoefficients with

qualitatively      similar results.

8This decline occurs in the eleven counties anElyzed in the preceding            section

and for the state as a whole.

9Defense contracts data by establishment were available after 1965. The

Department of Defense gave us data on Prime Contract Awards over $10,000 by

county for South Carolina over the period 1966-1971.             Cumulative contracts were

used because a contract award received in one year wai not necessarily only for

that year alone.        For instance, some firms had negative values for defense

contracts       in years when previous contracts was cancelled. A similar variable,

cumulative EEOC expenditures, was Used by Freeman (1973).

10Froni   the   1970 Public Use Sample, we calculate that of all textile workers in

1965, about 90 percent were employed in a manufacturing            industry in 1970.

There      are conditions under which we underestiniate the contribution of defense

contracts       to the increase in black eployinent. The contract data refer to work

done in the county but firms were required to comply with Executive Order 11246

in all plants, even those not producing goods for sale to the government. There

are many textile firms with plants in different counties and different States.

County textile defense expenditure is thus an error- ridden measure of the

appropriate variable.       In a   siniple demographic model   of demand which regresses

employment solely on the measured contract variable,            the estimated contract

effect is downward biased if the variable indicating whether the                  has a


                                              39
contract is independent of the disturbance   term   in the equation. If the

demographic demand equation contains additional explanatory variables which are
corelated with the indicator variable, the si&n of the bias is ambiguous.

12However it should be noted that many employers feared that blacks were more

likely to join unions. (Rovan) In the nonunionized textile labor market this

would be a serious negative consideration.
