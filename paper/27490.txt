                                          ABSTRACT

We study a unique all-payer data set spanning 38 states to examine the differences in inpatient
reimbursement rates paid by traditional Medicare (TM), Medicare Advantage (MA), Medicaid,
and private (under-65) insurers, and the differences in negotiated rates across the 60 largest
private insurers. After controlling for enrollee and hospital mix, we find that private insurers pay
37 percent more than TM, and MA pays 10 percent more than TM for the five most common
inpatient diagnoses. The correlation in risk-adjusted payments by private insurers and by TM at
the same hospital for the same diagnosis is only 0.10. There is significant variation in negotiated
prices within and across private payers. Among the five largest US insurers, the most expensive
insurer negotiates prices that are 5-26 percent higher than the mean price for the 20 most common
inpatient diagnoses. Additionally, we find a 10 percent increase in insurer market share
corresponds to a 7 percent decrease in inpatient negotiated prices and a 10 percent decrease in the
standard deviation of prices. This finding suggests that increased insurer market power allows
payers to negotiate prospective payment contracts ­ rather than the more common fee-for-service
payments ­ thereby offloading financial risk to providers.

                                                    Abstract
       We study a unique all-payer data set spanning 38 U.S. states to examine the differences in
       inpatient reimbursement rates paid by traditional Medicare (TM), Medicare Advantage (MA),
       Medicaid, and private (under 65) insurers, and the differences in negotiated rates across the
       60 largest private insurers. After controlling for enrollee and hospital mix, we find that private
       insurers pay 37 percent more than TM, and MA pays 10 percent more than TM for the five most
       common inpatient diagnoses. National MA insurers reimburse hospitals at rates similar to TM,
       but smaller, regional MA insurers pay more than TM. The correlation in mean risk-adjusted
       payments by private insurers and by TM at the same hospital for the same diagnosis is only 0.10.
       There is also significant variation in negotiated prices within and across private payers. For the
       five largest U.S. insurers, the least expensive insurer negotiates prices that are 6-27 percent lower
       on average than the mean price and the most expensive insurer negotiates prices that are 5-26
       percent higher than the mean price for the 20 most common inpatient diagnoses. Additionally,
       we find that a 10 percent increase in insurer market share corresponds to a 7 percent decrease
       in inpatient negotiated prices. Furthermore, a 10 percent increase in insurer market share is
       associated with a 10 percent decrease in the standard deviation of inpatient prices paid by the
       insurer at a given hospital for a specific diagnosis. This finding suggests that increased insurer
       market power allows payers to negotiate prospective payment contracts--rather than the more
       common fee-for-service payments--thereby offloading financial risk to providers. (JEL: G22,

1      Introduction
The prices hospitals negotiate with insurers are shrouded in secrecy. Recently, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) introduced regulations compelling hospitals to publish the
reimbursement rates they negotiate with private insurers (CMS 2019). The rule is slated to go into
effect at the beginning of 2021, but hospitals are appealing the court's decision to uphold the rule,
arguing that price transparency violates the First Amendment and may lead to insurer collusion
(AHA 2020). Given hospitals' aversion to revealing the secret payer-specific reimbursement rates,
there have been little data to date available to the consumers and researchers on the discounts

resulting from hospital-insurer bargaining. In the past few years, researchers (e.g., Cooper et al.
2019) have taken advantage of new nationwide data on negotiated prices, though these data do not
include a representative panel of payers.
       In this paper, we analyze newly accessible data--the American Hospital Utilization Database
(AHUD)--on the universe of patients from 474 hospitals across 38 U.S. states from 2009 to 2016,
accounting for $1.8 trillion in hospital charges. This novel data set has a number of unique advan-
tages over previously available data for studying health care prices. Most importantly, the data
contain the actual transaction prices and the discounts negotiated by insurers off the hospital's
charges.1 Additionally, this all-payer database does not obscure the names of private insurers, al-
lowing for an examination of the variation in the negotiated prices for the 60 largest private insurers
in the 38 states in the data. To our knowledge, there has been no prior study examining variation
in negotiated prices across private insurers with data with a scope greater than the state-level.
Lastly, the data set is large, encompassing more than 300 million patient encounters over eight
years. Given that much remains unknown about private insurers' negotiated prices, we present
descriptive statistics about the variation in negotiated prices across private insurers and compare
prices negotiated by private firms to those paid by Medicare and Medicaid. The analysis in this
paper is organized into three areas of inquiry.
       First, we describe the variation in risk-adjusted inpatient prices across common types of insur-
ance coverage (traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and private insurance).2 We
find that, on average, Medicare Advantage (MA) pays 10 percent more than traditional Medicare
(TM) for the five most common Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs),3 after
controlling for enrollee and provider mix. The disparity in reimbursement rates varies significantly
depending on the diagnosis and treatment. Further, for national insurers, MA prices are similar
to TM prices, but for smaller, regional insurers, MA prices tend to be higher than TM prices. For
instance, for inpatient psychoses cases, the five largest MA insurers pay 6 percent less than TM,
while the remaining insurers in the data pay 17 percent more than TM on average.
       Private (under 65) plans consistently pay substantially more than both TM and MA for the
same services. Private (under 65) insurers pay 37 percent more than TM and 25 percent more
than MA on average for the five most common MS-DRGs. The distribution of private payments
features high variance, driven by large outlier payments. This is consistent with the fact that many
private insurers negotiate prices based on a percentage of hospital charges, rather than negotiating
prospective payment contracts, in which insurers pay a fixed amount for each diagnosis. The
distribution of Medicare Advantage negotiated prices, however, does not exhibit a similarly long
   1
     Payers rarely pay the standard charges billed by hospitals; nearly always, payers will negotiate their own reim-
bursement rates with hospitals.
   2
     In this paper, private insurance will refer to insurance covering enrollees under the age of 65 with group or
individual coverage.
   3
     MS-DRG codes are a system for classifying inpatient hospital claims based on diagnoses, procedures, and/or
treatment; severity; and comorbidities. They are used for Medicare's prospective payment system as the main
method of reimbursing inpatient care.

right tail. This suggests that private insurers tend to negotiate the structure of MA contracts with
hospitals as a percentage of Medicare reimbursements (a prospective payment system), partially
offloading the risk of outlier payments onto the provider. The correlation in mean risk-adjusted
prices for private (under 65) and MA across hospitals ranges from 0.60 to 0.67 for the five most
common MS-DRGs, after controlling for patient severity. For TM and Medicaid, the correlation
ranges from -0.11 to 0.34 for different diagnoses.
      Second, we examine the between-payer price variation for the 60 largest private insurers.4 For
the five largest U.S. insurers, the least expensive insurer negotiates prices that are 6-27 percent
lower on average than the mean price and the most expensive insurer negotiates prices that are
5-26 percent higher than the mean price for the 20 most common MS-DRGs. We find there exists
high variation in negotiated prices across insurers within the same hospital. For instance, for
vaginal deliveries, the bivariate correlations between each of the five largest private U.S. insurance
companies within the same hospital range from -0.57 to 0.70. For hip and knee replacements, these
correlations range from 0.04 to 0.82. For the 60 largest insurers and for the 20 most common MS-
DRGs, the between-payer coefficient of variation ranges from 8 percent to 24 percent. Further, we
find that within-hospital variation in prices is sizable for both inpatient and outpatient care. For
inpatient care, within-hospital variation is primarily explained by differences in negotiated prices
across insurers. For outpatient care, however, insurer contracts do not explain much of the within-
hospital variation. These findings imply that contracts between insurers and providers are more
prospective for inpatient care than for outpatient care.
      Third, we add to the literature on the determinants of negotiated health care prices by investi-
gating the relationship between insurer market share and negotiated reimbursement rates. While
there has been ample research on other determinants of health care prices (including hospital mar-
ket concentration), lack of accessible data has constrained research on the relationship between
insurer market concentration and negotiated prices. We find that a 10 percent increase in insurer
market share is associated with a 6-7 percent decrease in negotiated prices. In addition, we explore
the relationship between insurer market share and the extent to which hospitals and insurers bear
risk in their negotiated price contracts. There is an inverse relationship between insurer market
share and the variance in payments for services treating a given diagnosis. This finding implies that,
when insurers hold greater market power, they are more likely to be able to negotiate prospective
payment contracts, paying providers based on the diagnosis rather than the actual treatments the
patient receives.
      The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the existing literature on
health care prices. In Section 3, we describe the data, variable construction, sample selection, and
provide descriptive statistics. In Section 4, we compare the price of care received by the privately-
insured and publicly-insured and examine the variation in prices negotiated by different private
payers. In Section 5, we examine the association between insurer market share and negotiated

prices. Section 6 concludes.


2        Background
2.1        Comparisons of Public and Private Payer Prices
Public and private payers reimburse providers for their services using different methods of payments.
Traditional Medicare's inpatient payments are set administratively by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS), and are organized according to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related
Groups (MS-DRGs). Some adjustments to MS-DRG reimbursement rates are made based on
geographic marketplace and hospital type, with additional outlier payments reimbursing providers
for especially costly patients. In contrast, Medicaid payment structures vary widely across states,
with most Medicaid programs using fee-for-service or prospective payments to reimburse providers.
Private prices are primarily market-driven and are set based on complex contract negotiations
between each provider-insurer pair. The negotiated prices may be set based on a share of a hospital's
chargemaster price, or prospectively as a percentage of Medicare reimbursements. These contract
structures, and the actual private negotiated prices, have historically remained highly confidential
and are considered trade secrets.
        Surprisingly little is known about the variation in prices across types of insurance coverage.
The Congressional Budget Office reports that MA plans pay slightly more than TM plans (CBO
2013). Recently, using data from three national insurers provided by the Health Care Cost Institute
(HCCI),5 researchers have been able to compare inpatient prices for MA and TM nationwide. Baker
et al. (2016), Maeda and Nelson (2018), Pelech (2018), and Curto et al. (2019) all use the HCCI
data to compare prices, utilization, or spending differences between TM and MA. Baker et al. find
that, from 2009 to 2012, MA plans paid 5.6 percent less for hospital services than TM plans. Maeda
and Nelson estimate that MA and TM prices are roughly equal for hospital services and Pelech finds
that this is also true for physician service payments. Similarly, Curto et al. find that MA plans
pay only about 1 percent more than TM on average. These findings run counter to conventional
wisdom, which suggests that MA would pay significantly higher prices than TM given the ability
of the public sector's monopsony power to constrain prices.
        In a survey of senior hospital and health plan executives, Berenson et al. (2015) find that
commercial plans pay significantly more than MA plans, which, in turn, tend to pay 100-105
percent of TM rates. Pelech (2018) and White and Whaley (2019) also find that average commercial
prices are substantially higher than traditional Medicare prices for physician and hospital services,
respectively. Using the IBM MarketScan data, Romley et al. (2015) find that a 10 percent lower
commercial price is associated with 3 percent higher Medicare spending per member. Using a large
administrative change in TM reimbursement rates for surgical versus medical care, Clemens and

Gottlieb (2017) find that, for BCBS of Texas, private negotiated prices tend to be tied to TM
reimbursements, although Clemens, Gottlieb, and Moln´
                                                    ar (2017) show that these prices deviate
when there is significant value at stake.

2.2   Variation in Private Payer Prices
Recent literature has focused on the variation in health care prices for the privately-insured across
geographic markets and across providers (e.g., Cooper et al. 2019). However, there has been
little examination of between-payer price variation. The HCCI data on private prices does not
differentiate between insurers and therefore does not allow for cross-payer comparisons. The prices
negotiated by private payers have a significant effect on consumer welfare and thus are of immense
importance to employers and consumers. Save for the few states that have established all-payer
databases, however, these negotiated prices cannot be observed by outsiders. Even in states with
all-payer databases, these data are unlikely to be decipherable to the average consumer. Higher
negotiated prices may be passed on to consumers in the form of out-of-pocket costs and, potentially,
higher premiums. Given the rise of high-deductible plans and increased cost-sharing via coinsur-
ance, the prices negotiated by insurers are especially relevant to customers. Ceteris paribus, in the
presence of perfect information on prices, consumers would prefer to be insured by insurance firms
negotiating lower prices with providers.
   A significant portion of the variation in prices can be attributed to market dynamics based on
hospital monopoly power and insurer monopsony power. The past two decades have been character-
ized by increasing consolidation on both sides of this market. There is strong evidence documenting
the positive relationship between provider market power and negotiated prices (e.g., Brooks, Dor,
and Wong 1997; Town and Vistnes 2001; Ginsburg 2010; Robinson 2011) and the inverse rela-
tionship between insurer market power and negotiated prices (e.g., Wu 2009; Moriya, Vogt, and
Gaynor 2010; Melnick, Shen, and Wu 2011; McKellar et al. 2013; Scheffler and Arnold 2017). An
insurer's ability to control the flow of patients to specific providers also tends to result in lower
negotiated prices (Staten, Umbeck, and Dunkelberg 1987, 1988; Pauly 1998; Cutler, McClellan,
and Newhouse 2000; Sorenson 2003). Cooper et al. (2019) find that, even within hospitals, there
is significant variation in payments for a given procedure, and hypothesize that this can be primar-
ily attributed to differences in negotiated prices across insurers. Using Massachusetts's All-Payer
Claims Database, Craig, Ericson, and Starc (2018) provide the first picture of variation in prices
across private payers, focusing on Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA, Tufts Health Plan, and Harvard
Pilgrim. Their study finds substantial variation in prices paid by different payers to the same
hospitals for the same service in Massachusetts. Further, they present a model of provider-insurer
negotiations in which consumer response to negotiated provider prices is a crucial determinant of
payers' negotiation efforts.

2.3   New Contributions
This paper leverages a novel proprietary data set that allows researchers to lift the veil of secrecy
surrounding provider-insurer negotiations. Building off the recent HCCI findings, we expand the
scope of private insurers studied from UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Humana (insurers in the HCCI
studies) to 60 of the largest U.S. insurers. The findings presented here differ in some notable ways
from the HCCI findings, especially since these three national insurers are not representative of the
private insurance market as a whole, as we show in Subsection 4.2. Other than the HCCI and
MarketScan data, no data has previously allowed for a comparative analysis of MA and private
(under 65) negotiated prices across the U.S. The analysis of the data in this paper allows for a
descriptive study of prices negotiated by private insurers that captures the universe of insurers at
a given provider. Additionally, this paper provides a look at between-payer variation for private
negotiated prices across the country. To our knowledge, between-payer variation has only been
examined in Massachusetts. Understanding of variation in prices across private payers is important
in the context of the federal government's proposed health care price transparency laws. Lastly,
the paper contributes to a growing literature on the determinants of private prices by examining
the relationship between insurer market power and hospital-insurer negotiations.


3     Data and Variables
3.1   American Hospital Utilization Database
The data for this study come from the American Hospital Utilization Database (AHUD), which
consists of electronic medical record (EMR) data provided by a large healthcare services company.
This paper is the first analysis of the AHUD data examining health care pricing. The data come
from 474 providers in 38 U.S. states using this service. Included in the data are encounter-level
claims for inpatient and outpatient services. The proprietary data span 2009 to 2016 (inclusive)
and document over 300 million patient encounters with providers from over 80 million individual
patients. 278 million of the encounters are outpatient visits and 25 million are inpatient visits.
These encounters come from patients of all insurance types (i.e., traditional Medicare, Medicare
Advantage, Medicaid, CHIP, private, no insurance). The mix of hospitals consists of large and
small facilities in both urban (87 percent) and rural (13 percent) locations. Roughly 98 percent of
providers submit both inpatient and outpatient data. The vast majority of facilities in the data
are hospitals but the data also includes skilled nursing facilities, home health, and clinics.
    The unique aspect of the AHUD data is the inclusion of the actual reimbursement paid by the
insurer and patient, the provider's billed charges for the encounter, and the negotiated discount and
contractual adjustments for the insurer. The data also include the estimated cost for the encounter
based on the cost-to-charge ratio for that hospital from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) hospital cost reports. Some providers report the amount of the payment that is


                                                  6
the patient's responsibility, including the patient's copay and deductible amounts.

                                 Figure 1: States in the AHUD Data




      To our knowledge, there are only two other alternative data sources available to researchers
that are larger than the state level and include prices negotiated by private insurers. One is
the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI) data.6 HCCI provides claims-level data for employer-
sponsored insurance from UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Humana (masking the individual insurers)
and contains 42 to 46 million lives per year (Cooper et al. 2019). The other alternative data source
is the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database. The MarketScan data come primarily from large
employers, but also contain some data from mid-size and smaller employers as well as health
plans. It contains several million individuals, encompassing employees and their dependents who
are covered by employer-sponsored private insurance. Unlike the HCCI and MarketScan data, the
AHUD data are sourced from the providers rather than employers or health plans. This allows
for one distinct advantage over the other two data sources. Namely, the AHUD data contain
people with all types of insurance (public and private) and with no insurance, rather than strictly
employer-sponsored insurance. Within private claims, HCCI and MarketScan only have data on a
handful of insurers and obscure any connection between a specific payer and a claim, while AHUD
contains claims-level data for hundreds of insurers and identifies the payer for each claim.
      To de-identify the data, all protected health information (PHI) elements are removed except
for the admission and discharge dates, which are reported on a monthly, rather than daily, basis.
Furthermore, patient zip codes are truncated to three digits and reported only if the population
  6
      https://healthcostinstitute.org/data


                                                 7
of the three-digit zip code was greater than 20,000 as reported in the 2010 Census. Ages greater
than 89 are truncated to 90 for reporting purposes. Patient characteristics included in the data are
age, gender, and employment status. For each patient encounter, the AHUD data include a list
of primary and secondary diagnoses from ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes; procedures, treatments, and
prescriptions from ICD, CPT, and HCPCS codes; length of stay; and whether or not the patient
died during hospitalization. In addition, the data contain information submitted in UB92/UB04
billing forms, including admission source, admission type, and discharge status. For inpatient visits,
we also include CMS Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs).
      For the analysis comparing public and private prices, we classify payers as traditional Medi-
care, Medicare Advantage, private (under 65), and Medicaid and CHIP. For more information on
the classification of payers, consult Appendix C and Appendix D. Within the private (under 65)
category, we identify claims from the 60 largest private insurance firms and their subsidiaries. A
list of the private insurance firms we study with the AHUD data is provided in Appendix Table 17.

3.2      Sample Selection
We include only patient encounters for which there are data on the actual price received by the
hospital for the encounter. Unless otherwise specified, we include only inpatient admissions. For
the analysis of private and Medicare Advantage prices, we restrict the sample to encounters covered
by the 60 largest insurers in the data. In the analysis comparing prices by public and private payers,
we restrict the sample to the five most common MS-DRGs that are not related to births, so as to
include data from the elderly population for MA and TM. For the examination of private (under
65) prices, we restrict the analysis to the 20 most common MS-DRGs for patients between 18 and
65 years old.

3.3      Limitations of Data
The data are not nationally representative of hospitals. Hospitals in the AHUD data tend to
be larger and in more populated areas. According to the American Hospital Association's 2017
Annual Survey, 64 percent of U.S. hospitals are in urban locations. In the AHUD data, 83 percent
of hospitals are in urban locations. In addition, 44 percent of U.S. hospitals have 100 or more beds,
while in the AHUD data, 78 percent of hospitals have 100 or more beds. Hospitals in the South are
overrepresented in the AHUD data. The data also only include providers using an EMR system.
Further, there may be selection bias in providers that employ the healthcare services company
from which the data are sourced (e.g., hospitals in wealthier areas). However, overall demographic
information including the distribution of patient ages and gender and pricing data including average
charges and average costs are nearly identical to nationally representative data.7
  7
      We compare the AHUD inpatient data to the HCUP National Inpatient Sample in Appendix B.




                                                      8
      While AHUD has information on the payer for a patient's encounter with a provider, it does
not provide any further information about the type of plan the patient has (e.g., HMO, PPO, or
PFFS). Additionally, patient and hospital location data is not fine-grain. The location of a patient's
residence is only provided at the three-digit zip code level, which is a relatively broad geographic
area.8 While distinct hospitals are identifiable in the data, they can not be linked to more detailed
external hospital data. Therefore, only rough approximations of a hospital's local market share
can be estimated with these data. While other data sets include both claims and denominator
populations (eligible enrollees), the denominator population is not available in the AHUD data.
Lastly, five of the 38 states in the data only have data from one provider. Thus, we avoid any
state-level analysis and comparisons in prices between states.

3.4      Constructing Risk- and Hospital-Adjusted Prices
Differences in reimbursement rates across payers may indicate differences in the enrollee mix (e.g.,
MA beneficiaries may be more healthy on average compared to TM beneficiaries). Further, dif-
ferences in reimbursement rates could be driven by differences in the geographic locations and the
hospitals at which the payer covers patients. Thus, we control for these differences across payers by
constructing hospital- and risk-adjusted prices that remove variation due to patient characteristics
and comorbidities as well as any year- and hospital-specific variation.
      We estimate the hospital- and risk-adjusted prices paid by each payer for a number of high-
volume MS-DRGs. Each of MS-DRG is defined by a particular set of patient attributes, including
principal diagnosis, specific secondary diagnoses, procedures, sex, and discharge status. MS-DRGs
are used to code the payment of inpatient services for Medicare beneficiaries.
      We construct the adjusted price estimate in two stages. First, we estimate the following equation
separately for each MS-DRG:
                                             pi,j,h,t = Xi  + h,t +      i,j,h,t                               (1)

where pi,j,h,t is price paid for patient encounter i covered by payer j at hospital h in year t. Xi is a
vector of patient-specific characteristics: age, an indicator for male, length of stay, and indicators
for the 17 comorbid conditions defining the Charlson comorbidity index. h,t is a vector of year-
specific hospital fixed effects. Lastly,        i,j,h,t   is a vector of the residuals accounting for all variation
in pi,j,h,t not explained by Xi and h,t .
      From equation (1), we obtain the vector of residuals from the model, ^i,j,h,t . These residuals
can be interpreted as the variation in price not explained by age, gender, comorbidities, year, or
the hospital which the patient visited. A positive residual means the payment for the encounter
was higher than expected, conditional on these covariates.

   We then obtain hospital- and risk-adjusted prices, p
                                                      ~i,j,h,t :

                                          ~i,j,h,t = p + ^i,j,h,t
                                          p                                                           (2)

where p is simply a constant across all observations and scales the residual to match the mean of
the data for the given MS-DRG. The only term that differentially affects p
                                                                         ~i,j,h,t is ^i,j,h,t . The mean
                                                                                  N
hospital- and risk-adjusted price for each payer is then given by p
                                                                  ~j = 1/N        i=1 p
                                                                                      ~i,h,t   where N is
the number of enrollees in plans by payer j . This price measure allows for an analysis of prices paid
by different payers after controlling for observable differences in enrollee mix, encounter severity,
and hospital-specific differences.
   For certain analyses, such as those presented in Table 4 and Table 6, we also construct measures
of risk-adjusted prices using the method described above that do not control for differences across
providers ( is now a vector of year fixed effects, rather than year-specific hospital fixed effects).
This allows for a comparison of risk-adjusted prices paid by payers within the same hospital.
   The interpretation of this adjusted price relies on the assumption that there are no unobservable
differences in the average patient severity or level of treatment for each payer. Unlike some other
DRG classifications, MS-DRGs indicate the presence and severity of comorbidities and complica-
tions. Thus, the stratification across MS-DRGs further controls for differences in patient severity.
   We estimate several different versions of risk-adjusted and hospital- and risk-adjusted prices.
For the analysis in Subsection 4.1, j indexes the type of coverage a patient receives (TM, MA,
Medicaid and CHIP, and private). For the analysis in Subsection 4.2, we first subset the data to
only the encounters covered by the largest 60 private insurers for patients under 65 years of age.
In this analysis, the prices are constructed such that j indexes the private insurers (e.g., Anthem).
Further, we also construct risk-adjusted and hospital- and risk-adjusted discounts for payers, as
measured by the percent discount off the chargemaster price for the encounter. The adjusted prices
and adjusted percent discounts track each other closely. To further evaluate the adjusted price
measures, we run versions of equations (1) and (2) where the outcome variable is the hospital's
billed charges, rather than the price. With this outcome measure, we observe little variation across
private payers, implying that the adjusted price measures are likely not biased by any unobserved
differences in patient severity or level of care across payers.

3.5   Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 displays summary statistics for the hospitals in the data. Table 2 presents summary statis-
tics describing patient characteristics. We also compare the AHUD data to the Healthcare Cost
and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative sample, in
Appendix B. The levels and trends in inpatient charges and costs are similar between the AHUD
and HCUP data. Further, the distribution of patient ages is nearly identical for the AHUD and
HCUP data. The AHUD has 9 percent more hospitals in the South Atlantic region and 8 percent


                                                    10

4     Variation in Hospital-Insurer Negotiated Prices
4.1   Variation Across Public and Private Plans
In this section, we examine the variation in prices paid to providers by traditional Medicare, Med-
icaid and CHIP, Medicare Advantage insurers, and private (under 65) insurers. For the analysis
of prices across public and private insurers, we first compare the mean hospital- and risk-adjusted
price for each of the five most common MS-DRGs. We present the results in Table 3. Private
(under 65) insurers pay significantly more than all other types of coverage, MA pays slightly more
than TM, and Medicaid and CHIP pay significantly less than TM. The average discount off the
chargemaster price negotiated by private insurers ranges from 52 to 62 percent. Figure 2 presents
prices as a percent of traditional Medicare's reimbursement for the five most common MS-DRGs.
Medicaid pays 21.1 percent less than TM on average. In contrast, private (under 65) insurers pay
37.4 percent more than TM and 24.5 percent more than MA on average.
    Medicare Advantage (MA) pays 10.4 percent more than traditional Medicare (TM) on average
for the five most common Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs), after control-
ling for enrollee and provider mix. However, the disparity in reimbursement rates varies significantly
depending on the diagnosis and treatment. For cases with diagnoses of psychoses, MA payers only
pay 6.9 percent more than TM. For hip and knee replacements, MA payers pay 15.2 percent more
than TM.
    The finding that MA pays more than TM stands differs from the findings analyzing HCCI data
(Baker et al. 2016; Maeda and Nelson 2018; Pelech 2018; Curto et al. 2019), which all find that
MA pays providers similar or lower rates on average relative to TM. These HCCI studies examine
data from UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Humana--three of the five largest insurers in the U.S--
whereas we examine data from the 60 largest insurers. Indeed, when we consider only these three
large insurers with the AHUD data, the results are largely consistent with the HCCI studies. On
average across the five most common MS-DRGs, the HCCI insurers pay only 2.1 percent more for
MA than TM, while the remaining 57 non-HCCI insurers pay 17.5 percent more than TM (see
Appendix Figure 8 and Appendix Figure 9). These findings suggest that the HCCI data is not
representative of the insurance market as a whole. It is possible that these three national insurers
are able to extract significantly higher discounts relative to smaller, regional insurers. In fact, the
five largest U.S. insurers (Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare) pay only 5.6
percent more for MA than TM on average, while the remaining 55 insurers in the data pay 15.5
percent more than TM (see Appendix Figure 10 and Appendix Figure 11).

   Figure 3 shows that the high mean prices negotiated by private payers and the high variation
in prices exhibited in Table 3 are driven primarily by large outlier payments. This is expected
given that commercial plans tend to pay providers a share of the billed charges. Interestingly, the
distribution of MA prices does not have the long right tail present for the private (under 65) prices.
This suggests that MA plans tend to not make payments as a share of charges, but instead they
pay prospectively based on diagnosis, following TM.
   As shown in Table 3, the coefficient of variation for private prices is substantially larger relative
to that of traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. However, the coefficient of variation for the
percent discount off the chargemaster price is smaller in all cases than that of traditional Medicare.
Medicare's prospective payment system reimburses providers independently of the providers' billed
charges. In contrast, private payers tend to pay providers a share of the billed charge. Thus, for
many MS-DRG-payer-provider combinations, the percent discount is relatively constant, explaining
the smaller variation relative to Medicare. Medicaid's reimbursement methodology and rates vary
by state, explaining why Medicaid tends to exhibit the highest coefficient of variation of all types
of insurance coverage.
   Lastly, we compare payments by MA, TM, Medicaid, and private (under 65) insurers at the
same provider with the same MS-DRG to examine the correlation between payments across these
types of insurance coverage within a provider. The unit of analysis for this analysis is the mean
risk-adjusted payment for admissions covered by a type of insurance at a specific hospital for a
specific MS-DRG. Table 4 presents the bivariate correlations in mean inpatient risk-adjusted price

residuals between MA, TM, Medicaid, and private insurers. Note that here we use the price
residuals obtained from equation (1) rather than the residuals linearly-transformed by the mean
price for each MS-DRG from (2), allowing for the correlations to be unaffected by differences in the
average price level of each of the MS-DRGs. We find a low correlation (0.10) between the prices
paid by private insurers and traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage is similarly correlated with
private plans (0.55) and traditional Medicare (0.53). Risk-adjusted prices for Medicaid are, perhaps
surprisingly, more correlated with private and MA plans than with TM. The correlation between
TM and Medicaid prices for the same MS-DRG at the same hospital is only 0.12. Notably, for hip
and knee replacements, the correlation between TM and Medicaid prices across hospitals is -0.11.
The correlation matrices for specific MS-DRGs are presented in Appendix Table 23.

                      residuals are obtained by equation (1), which removes variation in prices
                      due to differences in observable patient severity and year-specific hospital
                      effects. Includes the five most common MS-DRGs.


4.2   Variation Across Private Payers
As both prior studies and the descriptive analysis in Subsection 4.1 have shown, prices paid to hos-
pitals by private health care plans vary widely. While it is well documented that, across hospitals,
private insurers pay drastically different prices, little is known about the differences in prices paid
by different private payers within the same hospital. In this section, we help to fill this gap in the
literature by describing the variation in health care prices across private payers and decomposing
the variation in negotiated prices.

           Notes: The unit of analysis is an inpatient admission. Prices and percent discounts are adjusted
           using equations (1) and (2) to control for differences in patient severity and year-specific hospital
           effects. Insurers A-E mask the names of the five largest U.S. private insurers (Aetna, Anthem,
           Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare). The data use agreement enabling our access to the
           AHUP data does not permit us to uniquely identify insurers by name.


   Table 5 presents statistics on the negotiated price and discounts by Aetna, Anthem, Cigna,
Humana, and UnitedHealthcare for the five most common MS-DRGs for patients between ages 18
and 65. The names of the insurers are masked randomly as Insurers A-E. These prices are adjusted
by equations (1) and (2), which control enrollee mix and year-specific hospital fixed effects. For the
five major U.S. insurers, the least expensive insurer negotiates prices that are 6-27 percent lower on
average than the mean price and the most expensive insurer negotiates prices that are 5-26 percent
higher than the mean price for the 20 most common MS-DRGs. It is clear that certain insurers
are able to consistently negotiate lower reimbursement rates across MS-DRGs. In four of the five
diagnoses presented in Table 5, Cigna has the highest negotiated prices. For the most common
MS-DRG, vaginal delivery without complicating diagnoses, the discounts range from 51.66 to 56.99
percent off the chargemaster price on average. For a diagnosis of psychoses, the percent discount
ranges from 48.69 percent to 64.05 percent. The adjusted prices and adjusted discounts track each
other closely. The discount measure is more robust to unobserved differences across insurers that
are not captured by the risk- and hospital-adjustments. However, the high correlation between
discount and price suggests that the adjusted prices are not meaningfully biased by unobserved
differences across insurers.
   For the corresponding tables for the five most common MS-DRGs with all 60 insurers in the data,
consult Appendix E.1. As is evident in these extended tables, the variation in prices negotiated
by the five largest national insurers does not capture the extent of the variation in prices across
all insurers. For instance, for a hip or knee replacement without major complicating conditions,

Notes: Unit of analysis is a payer-provider. Price residuals are obtained by equation (1), which removes variation in
              prices due to differences in observable patient severity and year-specific hospital effects.



WellCare negotiates a price of $11,766 (73 percent discount) on average while Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care negotiates an average price of $27,786 (39 percent discount). Figure 4 presents a
histogram of the mean risk- and hospital-adjusted price residuals for all insurers in the data for
the 10 most common MS-DRGs. Here, it is clear that, when comparing all 60 insurers, there is
relatively large variation in average negotiated price across insurers. For the 20 most common

                         payer. Price residuals are obtained by equation (1), which re-
                         moves variation in prices due to differences in observable patient
                         severity and year-specific hospital effects. Insurers A-E mask the
                         names of the five largest U.S. private insurers (Aetna, Anthem,
                         Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare). Includes the 20 most
                         common MS-DRGs.


MS-DRGs, the between-payer coefficient of variation ranges from 5 percent to 17 percent, after
controlling for enrollee and provider mix, for the five largest insurers. For all 60 insurers studied,
the between-payer coefficient of variation ranges from 8 percent to 24 percent. For comparison, the
between-provider coefficient of variation ranges from 24 percent to 48 percent.
   Overall, Table 5 suggests that the prices negotiated by national insurers tend to be relatively
similar on average, after controlling for hospital and enrollee mix (although this is not the case for
regional insurers). However, this does not necessarily imply that these large insurers are getting
similar discounts at each hospital, only that the discounts on average are relatively similar. To
examine the within-hospital variation in payments across insurers, we compare insurers' mean
risk-adjusted prices at the hospital level.
   Table 6 presents the bivariate correlations between the mean risk-adjusted prices negotiated by
the five largest national insurers--Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare--for a
specific MS-DRG at a given provider. Included are the 20 most common MS-DRGs for privately-
insured patients between ages 18 and 65. Note again that here we use the price residuals obtained
from equation (1) rather than the residuals linearly-transformed by the mean price for each MS-
DRG from (2), allowing for the correlations to not be affected by differences in the mean price level of
each of the MS-DRGs. The correlations in risk-adjusted price residuals for the bivariate comparisons
between the five largest insurers range from 0.01 to 0.60. These results are also presented for specific
MS-DRGs in Appendix Table 24. The correlation in risk-adjusted prices varies significantly across
insurers and across MS-DRGs. For vaginal deliveries without complicating diagnoses, the bivariate
correlations between each of the five largest private U.S. insurers range from -0.57 to 0.70. For hip
and knee replacements, these correlations range from 0.04 to 0.82. This evidence suggests that,
while large insurers tend to negotiate similar prices on average, the prices different large insurers
negotiate at any given hospital tend to vary considerably.

4.2.1   Decomposition of Variation in Private Prices

Recently, researchers have found that within-hospital variation in private negotiated prices is high,
and speculated that the differences in prices must be driven in no small part by significant dif-
ferences in insurer-hospital contracts across insurers. However, the extent to which differences in
insurer-hospital negotiations explains the variation in within-hospital prices has not previously been
measured due to lack of data.
   To further investigate the extent to which the variation in prices is explained by variation across
private payers at a hospital, we extend the method Cooper et al. (2019) employ to decompose the
variation within-markets and within-hospitals. We decompose the variation further to the within-
hospital-payer level. To examine the variation explained at different levels, we iteratively add
various combinations of control variables, and observe the subsequent changes to the R2 . The
outcome variable is pi,j,h,t , the price of a procedure for patient encounter i, covered by payer j , at
hospital h, in year t. Table 7 presents the R2 from five regressions, each with an additional control
included. In column 1, only patient age, an indicator for male, and year-month fixed effects are
included. In column 2, we add encounter-specific controls including dummies for each comorbid
condition defining the Charlson comorbidity index, length of stay, and a dummy if the MS-DRG
indicates a diagnosis with complications or comorbidities (for inpatient procedures only). Column
3 adds year-month-specific provider fixed effects and column 4 adds year-month-specific payer-
provider fixed effects. Lastly, in column 5, we include the total charges that the hospital billed for
the encounter to further control for the patient-specific amount of care provided at the encounter.
   One potential criticism of the analysis thus far is that it examines differences in prices across
MS-DRG codes, rather than specific procedures. There may be multiple different services provided
within an MS-DRG. For instance, the MS-DRG code 471 includes both hip and knee joint re-
placements. Thus, here we look at specific high-volume procedures as defined by ICD-9 procedure
and diagnosis codes. This restricts the sample to only encounters occurring prior to October 1,
2015 to avoid differences in coding resulting from the switch to ICD-10 codes. Using ICD-9 codes
also allows for an analysis of both inpatient and outpatient prices, whereas MS-DRGs only classify
inpatient visits.
   As shown in column 1 of Table 7, we find that patient characteristics explain very little of the
differences in prices for each procedure. Adding the encounter-specific controls for length of stay,
comorbidities, and complications has varying effects on R2 across procedures. For colonoscopies,
adding these controls results in an R2 of 0.519, while for knee replacements, the R2 only rises to
0.074. For outpatient procedures, as one would expect, these controls explain very little variation.
The addition of month-specific provider fixed effects raises the R2 to between 0.492 (cesarean
section) and 0.770 (colonoscopy) for inpatient procedures and to between 0.304 (routine medical
examination) and 0.444 (screening mammogram) for outpatient procedures.

      Notes: Columns 1-5 report the R2 of OLS regressions in which the outcome variable is an insurer's negotiated price and the independent
      variables are specified in the lower rows. A unit of observation is a patient encounter. All regressions include month-year dummies.
      Patient characteristics include age and gender. Encounter controls include dummies for each Charlson comorbid condition, length of
      stay, and a dummy if the MS-DRG indicates CC or MCC (for inpatient procedures only) to further adjust for any complications or
      comorbidities. Column 6 = 1 ­ column 5. Column 8 presents the within-payer-provider-month coefficient of variation, averaged across
      payer-provider-months.
    At the within-hospital level, Cooper et al. (2019) find overall lower variation than we find here.
For instance, for a knee replacement, they find 27 percent of variation is unexplained. In contrast,
we find that, at the within-hospital level, 40 percent of price variation is still unexplained. There
are two potential differences in our analyses that could explain this discrepancy. First, Cooper et
al. also include a control for plan type (HMO, PPO, etc.), which is not observable in the AHUD
data. However, this explanation is unlikely as Cooper et al. find that plan type only accounts
for around 3 percent of variation in prices. Second, Cooper et al. use the HCCI data, which
includes claims from three large, national insurers: UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Humana. In
contrast, we study 60 insurers, many of which are regional or statewide insurance firms. Thus, the
most plausible explanation for the discrepancy between our findings and those of Cooper et al. is
the differences in insurers. Indeed, we found above that smaller payers exhibit significantly more
variation in negotiated prices. When we restrict our analysis to only include UnitedHealthcare,
Aetna, and Humana, our results for the within-hospital level are similar to Cooper et al. When we
observe encounters covered by all 60 insurers, the percent of within-hospital variation unexplained
increases from roughly 17-36 percent (for only the HCCI insurers) to 23-51 percent for the seven
inpatient procedures studied. Thus, Cooper et al.'s estimates report within-hospital variation for
three large insurers. The variation for a broader set of insurers at the hospital level is substantially
higher than they estimate.
    The addition of the month-specific provider-payer fixed effects in column 4 is the novel com-
ponent of this analysis. Prior studies could not decompose to this level as the data did not allow
for identification of individual payers. Decomposing to the provider-payer-month level leaves very
little unexplained variation for most inpatient procedures. For hip replacements, only 8 percent
of the variation in prices at this level is left unexplained. However, for cesarean sections and
manually-assisted deliveries, 27 percent and 29 percent of variation remain unexplained within a
payer-provider-month, respectively, after controlling for patient characteristics and patient sever-
ity. For outpatient procedures, even more variation is left unexplained at the payer-provider-month
level.
    Overall, this finding confirms anecdotal reports that the majority of within-hospital variation
in prices can be attributed to differences in prices across insurers. For some procedures, there
still remains a relatively large amount of variation unexplained within a payer-provider-month.
This variation could potentially be explained by measurement error, contract negotiations that are
updated in the middle of a month, or by fee-for-service or outlier payments that are not based on
observable patient severity.
    In column 5, we add total charges as a control variable, which leaves 8 to 29 percent of variation
unexplained for inpatient procedures and 27 to 30 percent of variation unexplained for outpatient
procedures. The minimal effect of the addition of total charges underscores the lack of correlation
between billed charges and the transaction price that insurers pay for inpatient care. For outpatient
care, however, including the charges as an independent variable has a sizable influence on the R2 .


                                                  22
This suggests that outpatient visits are more likely to be reimbursed as a share of charges for any
services rendered during the visit.


5        Monopsony Power and Hospital-Insurer Bargaining
The sizable cross-payer variation in prices at the same hospital for the same procedure may be at-
tributable to differences in leverage in hospital-insurer negotiations. In this section, we examine the
relationship between insurer market power and the contracts that insurers negotiate with providers.
There are two plausible effects of market power on hospital-insurer negotiations: increased insurer
market share may lead to (1) lower negotiated prices and (2) different payment systems that are
favorable to insurers. To examine the relationship between insurer market share and negotiated
prices, we employ the following specification:

                            ln(pi,d,j,h,t ) = sharej,h,t + Xi  + d + h + t +       i,d,j,h,t          (3)

where pi,d,j,h,t is the negotiated inpatient price for patient encounter i, with MS-DRG d, insured by
payer j , at hospital h, in year t. The market share of insurer j at hospital h in year t is measured
by sharej,h,t , and  is the coefficient of interest. Xi is a vector of patient-encounter characteristics
including age, an indicator for male, length of stay, and indicators for the 17 comorbidities defining
the Charlson comorbidity index. d , h , and t are MS-DRG, hospital, and year fixed effects,
respectively. The sample for this analysis includes all privately-insured patient encounters for the
20 most common MS-DRGs for patients between 18 and 65 years old. The results from this main
regression are presented in column 4 of Table 8 Panel A. In addition, as a sensitivity analysis, we
also run a version of the regression where the outcome is the risk-adjusted price, as estimated in
Section 4. In this specification, Xi is omitted from the equation, given it is controlled for in the
risk-adjustment. The results for this specification are presented in column 4 of Table 8 Panel B.
One potential criticism of this approach is that it does not capture the actual procedures being
provided, only the diagnosis as defined by the MS-DRG. Thus, we also run the aforementioned
specifications with the inclusion of ICD-9/10 code fixed effects rather than MS-DRG fixed effects.9
The results for these regressions are presented in Appendix Table 25.
        Given the lack of transparency surrounding negotiated prices, it is difficult to know what type of
reimbursements payers are negotiating with providers. The second effect of increased market share
may be that insurers are able to adopt prospective payment systems, similar to that of Medicare,
rather than paying a percentage of the hospital's charges. Under a prospective payment contract
structure, insurers reimburse based on the expected costs for clinically defined episodes of care,
typically some form of a DRG classification system for inpatient claims. When an insurer pays a
share of hospital charges, all of the risks of the varying level of intensity of care fall on the insurer.
    9
        There are 3,191 ICD 9/10 codes corresponding to the 20 MS-DRGs used in the analysis.



                                                         23
In contrast, under prospective payment, insurers share the risk with providers by agreeing to pay
a predetermined payment for a given diagnosis, regardless of the intensity of care. Thus, while
risk-averse insurers may prefer prospective payments, hospitals may prefer fee-for-service and only
agree to prospective payments when the insurers have significant leverage.
      The extent to which private insurers use prospective payment systems has long remained a
mystery, given the lack of available data. Recently, with the availability of new data sources, such
as the HCCI data, researchers have begun studying the structure of private insurer payments. Burns
and Pauly (2018) find a low prevalence of prospective payment models, and Baker et al. (2019) find
that commercial insurance payments are less prospective than Medicare payments. Clemens and
Gottlieb (2017) and Clemens, Gottlieb, and Moln´
                                               ar (2017) find that BCBS of Texas uses Medicare
fee-for-services prices for physician services for simplicity but abandons it when sufficient value is
at stake.
      To examine the association between insurer market share and type of inpatient payment con-
tract, we estimate the following regression:

                                ln(sp
                                    d,j,h,t ) = sharej,h,t + d + h + t +   d,j,h,t                (4)

where sp
       d,j,h,t is the standard deviation of prices for MS-DRG d paid by private insurer j at hospital
h in year t. All other variables and parameters retain their meanings from equation (3). The results
of this main specification--as well as one where the outcome variable measures sp rather than its
natural logarithm--are presented in Table 8 Panel C.
      In Table 8, we find a strong inverse relationship between insurer market share and negotiated
inpatient prices. When the outcome variable is log negotiated price, a 10 percent increase in market
share is associated with a 6 (= 10 · 100[e0.006 - 1]) percent decrease in negotiated prices. When
the outcome variable is log risk-adjusted negotiated price, a 10 percent increase in market share
is associated with a 7 percent decrease in price. Both of these point estimates are statistically
significant at the 1 percent level. Additionally, Panel C shows that a 10 percent increase in insurer
market share is associated with a 10 percent decrease in the standard deviation of prices paid by
the insurer. This finding is also significant at the 1 percent level. This suggests that, when an
insurer has more bargaining power, they are able to offload some of their financial risk to hospitals
for inpatient care.
      The findings presented here on the relationship between insurer market share and prices are
consistent with prior studies examining single-state all-payer databases. There is a relatively large
body of research that finds larger insurers are able to negotiate greater discounts from hospitals.10
However, the only other paper to study the association between insurer market share and the type
of payment contract is Cooper et al. (2019), which uses the collective share of Aetna, United-
Healthcare, and Humana as a measure of insurer market share, rather than the market shares of
 10

individual insurers. Our findings are consistent with Cooper et al. and show that the association
does not exist only for the three large insurers and for employer-sponsored insurance, but also
across private plans from many insurers.
    On the other side of the market, there is more evidence that provider market share is associated
with higher prices and more contracts in which prices are paid as a share of charges. Town, Feldman,
and Kralewski (2011) examine physician groups that were in the network for one of Minnesota
Blue Cross's plans and find that the share of revenue from capitation is positively associated with
physicians' self-reported assessments of their market power. Using the HCCI data, Baker et al.
(2019) find that differences in prospective payment across hospitals are positively associated with
the extent of hospital competition.
    An important limitation of this analysis is that it does not control for differences in the makeup
and competitiveness of the other side of the hospital-insurer market. Unfortunately, since the
AHUD data cannot be linked to external data on hospitals, there is no way to include more
information on providers (e.g., hospital market share or metrics of hospital quality). However, the
inclusion of provider fixed effects, as in equations (3) and (4), should control for any differences
across hospitals, including hospital market share.
    The link between insurer market share and negotiated prices presented here is a correlation;
nevertheless the results suggest that insurers may be able to leverage higher market consolidation
to improve their position in hospital-insurer bargaining.


6    Conclusion
In this paper, we document the variation in payments across public and private payers. For all
MS-DRGs studied, on average, private (under 65) payers pay significantly more than Medicare
Advantage payers and traditional Medicare, which both pay substantially more than Medicaid.
Large, national MA insurers reimburse at a rate similar to TM, while smaller, regional MA insurers
tend to pay more than TM. Both private and Medicaid prices vary much more than MA and
TM prices for a given diagnosis. The distribution of Medicare Advantage payments mirrors that of
traditional Medicare, though Medicare Advantage plans tend to pay more on average. Most notably,
this paper provides, for the first time, a look at variation in negotiated prices across private payers
at the national level. Average negotiated prices paid by the largest national insurers do not vary
much, but average negotiated prices paid by smaller, regional insurers vary substantially. Further,
while average prices for large insurers are similar, within a given hospital, the prices paid by these
large insurers vary considerably. For vaginal deliveries, the bivariate correlations between each
of the five largest private U.S. insurance companies range from -0.57 to 0.70. For hip and knee
replacements, these correlations range from 0.04 to 0.82. Lastly, we find an inverse relationship
between insurer market share and negotiated prices. A 10 percent increase in insurer market share
is associated with a 7 percent decrease in negotiated prices. Additionally, a 10 percent increase in


                                                  26
insurer market share is associated with a 10 percent decrease in the standard deviation of negotiated
prices at a provider. This suggests that insurers with greater market share are able to negotiate
favorable payment structures that offload financial risk to the providers.

B     Comparison of AHUD Data to Nationally Representative Data
We compare AHUD inpatient data used in this paper to weighted national estimates from the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample, provided by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The HCUP NIS has roughly 7 million inpatient
hospital stays each year, while AHUD has roughly 2-4 million inpatient stays each year. Weighted,
the NIS estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally.

            Figure 5: Trends in Inpatient Charges and Costs in AHUD and HCUP Data




Notes: Costs are an estimate of the actual costs of providing care. They are estimated by multiplying the charge
by cost-to-charge ratios from CMS hospital cost reports. Charges are what the hospital bills for its services, before
adjusting for negotiated discounts and other contractual adjustments. The HCUP data do not contain information
on actual payments hospitals receive after these discounts so there is no way to compare the actual price data from
the AHUD data set.

  * For the AHUD data, our method of classifying payers (see Appendix D)
  leaves 24 percent of inpatient admissions unclassified. This explains the
  discrepancy between HCUP and AHUD for this metric.

C        Variable Construction
In the data, information on payers and insurance plan descriptions is as entered by providers. This
entry procedure is not standardized across providers and often is not standardized within providers
(e.g., "BCBSMA" and "Mass. BlueCross BlueShield" are both used to describe the same insurer).
Below we discuss how we classify public and private payers.
       Classifying public payers --Only plans that contained the name "Medicare" or some variant
(e.g,. "MCARE") were classified as Medicare plans. Similarly, Medicaid plans were identified from
plan names that contained the name "Medicaid" or some variant (e.g., "MCD"). However, the
classification of Medicaid plans was more involved than that of Medicare given that most states
have their own names for their respective Medicaid and CHIP programs (e.g., the SoonerCare is
Oklahoma's Medicaid plan and PeachCare for Kids is Georgia's CHIP plan). We include Medicaid
and CHIP plan names for all 38 states in the AHUD data, based on information from the U.S.
Department of Health & Human Services (2009), the American Council of Aging (2017), the U.S.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (2020), and from our review of state Medicaid websites.
For a list of all Medicaid and CHIP names by state included in the classification see Appendix
Table 16.
       Classifying private payers --For this analysis, we classify only a subset of the largest health
insurance companies. In order to determine the largest private payers, we used data on the market
share of insurers in each state from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). The selection mechanism
is as follows: insurers with a market share of over 10 percent in either the large-group market or
the individual market in each state in the AHUD data which were one of the three largest insurers
in that state in 2011. In addition, we include all relevant subsidiaries for each of these insurers
(e.g., UniCare, RightCHOICE, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, Blue Cross of California, Blue Cross
Blue Shield of Georgia, Comp-Care, and CareMore are all subsidiaries of Anthem).11 Furthermore,
we include any other BCBS affiliated company (e.g., BCBS's Federal Employee Program). This
resulted in a total of 60 insurance firms. For a complete list of private insurers and their subsidiaries
included in the analysis, see Appendix Table 17. The distinction between Medicare Advantage plans
and other private plans is made by simply classifying private plans as Medicare Advantage if the
patient's age at the time of the encounter is 65 or older and as a standard private plan otherwise.
This procedure introduces a misclassificaiton error that will tend to reduce measured differences
between private and public plans. For more information on the procedure of classifying private
insurers, see Appendix D.
       Charlson comorbidity index --To classify comorbidities, we rely on the methodology described in
Quan et al. (2005). Quan et al. define an "Enhanced ICD-9" coding scheme for deriving Charlson
comorbidities from ICD-9 billing codes. We implement the computation of both Enhanced ICD-9
  11
    Relevant subsidiaries are defined as subsidiaries that sold health insurance in the states present in the AHUD
data and that were wholly owned by the company between 2009 and 2016 according to U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Form 10-K filings.


                                                       36
codes (for all diagnoses prior to October 1, 2015) and ICD-10 codes (for all diagnoses starting on
October 1, 2015).


D     Details on Construction of Payer Variables
In order to classify the payer for each patient encounter, we account for a certain degree of human
error or other variation in the hospital's identification of the insurance plan names. To do so, we
include multiple variations of an insurer's name. As an example, let us consider the insurance
firm GuideWell and its subsidiary, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida (also operating under
the name Florida Blue). We classify any patient encounter as being covered by GuideWell if the
insurance plan name or payer name entered by the hospital contains any of the following phrases:
"GUIDEWELL"; "GUIDE WELL"; "GUIDE-WELL"; ("FLORIDA" or "FL") and ("BLUE",
"BCBS", "BC BS", or "BC AND BS"). Note that the classification of insurance firms is case
insensitive.
