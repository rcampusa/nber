                               Introduction


      Economists, even those who are deeply interested in government and

politics have not examined critically the idea of a nonpolitical, or

"independent," judiciary)-/ Most economists would doubtless agree with

Professor Buchanan that the judiciary is, and should remain, a thing

apart from the political process. The basic structure of constitutional

democracy, in his words,

           invo'ves a conceptual separation between (1) the con-

           stitution,   which defines the rights of persons and
           groups to do things and defines the rules under which
           collective decisions are to be made, (2) the institutions
          of   "the law," which adjudicate the conflicting claims

          made within this set of rights and rules, and (3) the

          collective decision-making process of the ordinary

           legislative variety, which presumably.promotes "public

           good," but again within the rules laid down in the con-

          stitution.

This conception of the law in general, and the Supreme Court in con-

stitutional adjudication in particular, as standing apart from and
                                                                 2.




limiting the scope and intrusiveness of the political process has

been shared by most legal commentators     since at least the time

of Alexander Hamilton.     A quite different conception has been

proposed by political scientists writing in the tradition of interest—

group analysis, notably Martin Shapiro.     He argues that, like other

organs of government, the Supreme Court is the agent of interest groups--

in Shapiro's view, interest groups not represented adequately by

other governmental organs. We are not convinced by Shapiro's effort

to transform the Court into a political body. In particular, his con-

ception leaves unexplained why it is that the Supreme Court, viewed

as a political organ1should be systematically responsive to the least

politically influential segments of the society.

      We believe that economic analysis may hold the key to reconciling

the notion of a independent judiciary with a conception of the poli-

tical-governmental process that emphasizes the importance of interest

groups in the formation of public policy. The reconciliation that we

propose may seem at first paradoxical, for we grant that the judiciary

is in an important sense independent of and dissimilar to the political

branches of the. government yet at the same time maintain that it is a

necessary element in the successful functioning even of a government

of interests and powers, as distinguished from a government that seeks

to maximize some general notion of welfare or the public interest.

      Article III of the U.S. Constitution provides for the appointment

(rather than election) of federal judges, provides that they are to

have life tenure, and forbids Congress to reduce their salaries while
                                                                3.




they are in office. These provisions, while they are as we shall see

not airtight, were designed and have operated in practice to endow the

federal judiciary with a substantial measure of independence from the

wishes of Congress and the President. To a lesser degree, the same

thing may be said of state and municipal judges, of judges in many

other countries, and, for that matter, of judges at all levels, in

America and elsewhere, long before Article III was conceived.

      The existence of an independent judiciary seems inconsistent

with--in fact profoundly threatening to-—a political system in which

public policy emerges from the struggle of interest groups to redis-

tribute the wealth of the society in their favor, the view of the

political process that underlies much of the recent economic work,

as well as an older political-science literature, on the political

system. The outcomes of the struggle can readily be nullified by

unsympathetic judges--and why should judges be sympathetic to a process

that simply ratifies political power rather than expresses principle?

The Supreme Court's policy toward economic legislation during a period

of roughly 50 years ending in the late 1930's     illustrates the power

and proclivity of an independent judiciary to nullify the legislative

results of interest-group politics.

      We believe, however, that at a deeper level the independent

judiciary is not only consistent with, but essential to, the interest—

group theory of government. Part I of this paper explains our theory

of the independent judiciary. Part II discusses several implications

of the theory, relating to administrative regulation, the form of

interest-group legislation, the tenure of judges, and constitutional
                                                                   4.




adjudication. The appendix to this paper presents an empirical analysis

of judicial independence using data on Acts of Congress that have been

held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

             I. An Economic Theory of the Independent Judiciary

A. Legislative "Deals" and Judicial Independence

      In the economists' version of the interest-group theory of govern-

ment, legislation is supplied to groups or coalitions that outbid rival

seekers of favorable legislation. i-"   The price that the winning group

bids is 4etermined both by the value of   legislative   protection to the

group's members and the groups ability to overcome the free-rider prob-

lems that plague coalitions. Payment takes the form of campaign contri-

butions, votes, implicit promises of future favors, and sometimes out-

right bribes. In short, legislation is "sold" by the legislature and

"bought" by the.beneficiaries of the legislation.

      Private sales, and other private contracts, carry legal sanctions

for nonperformance. Where the performances of the buyer and seller are

not simultaneous, and tharties are not constrained to act in good

faith by a desire to obtain similar business in the future, the legal

sanctions are likely to be an important factor in the decision to enter

into the transaction. But there are no legal sanctions for the failure

of a legislature to carry out its "bargain" withan interest group.

Suppose the airline industry obtains from Congress (as it did in 1938)

legislation designed to foster monopoly pricing while preventing the

entry of new competitors that such pricing would ordinarily attract.

There is no legal mechanism analogous to a binding long-term contract
                                                                5.




by which the enacting Congress can prevent a subsequent Congress from

amending the legislation in a,way unfavorable to the airlines, or

indeed from repealing it altogether. Yet both the enacting Congress

and the airlines, in procuring the legislation, may have incurred sub-

stantial expenses that would not prove worthwhile if the legislation

were to be altered unfavorably or repealed within a few months or years.

To be sure, congressional bad faith of this sort would reduce the

present value of legislative protection to interest groups in the future,

and hence the enacting Congressmen's welfare. Such a manifestation of

congressional bad faith would, by reducing the value of legislative

protection to interest groups, impose costs on the faithless Congressmen:

the "price" they could demand for enacting such legislation would be

lower. For many individual Congressmen, however, especially those who

did not expect to remain in Congress for long, the benefits from re-

pudiating a previous Congress' "deal" might outweigh the costs. And

even if the good faith of the majority of Congressmen were assured, it

would be insufficient to guarantee legislative stability in any case

where the initial vote enacting the legislation was not one-sided. If

the vote was close, the defection of only a few Congressmen, as a result

of retirement or defeat at the polls, from the winning coalition might

lead to a repeal in the next session of Congress, since the newly elected

Congressmen would have no comitments to honor the "deals" of their

predecessors. §1

      The element of stability or continuity necessary to enable

interest—group politics to operate in the legislative arena is supplied,
                                                                   6.




in the first instance, bytheprocedural rules of the legislature, and

in the second instance by the existence of an independent judiciary.

The most significant of the procedural rules is the requirement that

legislation (including amending or repealing legislation) must be

enacted by a majority of the legislators voting. This requirement

makes legislative enactment a difficult and time—consuming process

because of the transaction costs involved in getting agreement among

a larger number of individuals. -"   Consequently, once a statute is
passed, it is unlikely, given the press of other legislative business,

to be substantially altered or repealed in the immediate future.

Other characteristics of the legislative process also create resistance

to both the speedy enactrient of new laws and the repeal of old ones:

bicameralism, the committee system, and fillibusters are important

examples. Consider the tradition (now beginning to erode)of appointing

committee chairmen on the basis of seniority. The use of seniority

tends to channel chairmanships to holders of safe" congressional seats——

Congressmen whose tenure can be expected to be long and who are therefore

more likely to honor the commitments made by Congress.

      The impediments to legislation have the effect of endowing legisla-

tion, once it is enacted, with a measure of durability. The result is

to increase the value of and hence the demand for legislation. But there

is an offsetting effect: by increasing negotiation costs and uncertainty

the impediments reduce the productivity of expenditures on obtaining

legislation in the first place. However, under plausible assumptions

the increase in the value of legislation will exceed the increase in its
                                                                7.




cost, since a modest increase in the cost of enacting legislation

could multiply many—fold the length of the period in which the legis-

lation was expected to remain in force.

      Legislation is not self-enforcing, however.   If the people subject

to a law refuse to obey it, recourse to the courts is necessary to

enforce the law. A judiciary that was subservient to the current

membership of the legislature could nullify legislation enacted in a

previous session of the legislature. Suppose that Congress in year one

sells" the diary industry a heavy tax on margarine, but the next year

the producers of marciarine offer Congress generour inducements to remove

the tax. Congress is unlikely to respond to this demand by enacting

repealing legislation, due to the impediments to swift legislative action

that we have discussed. But if the judges are the perfect agents of

the current Congress, they will refuse to enforce the margarine tax,

and the effect will be the same as legislative repeal. Although outright

refusal to enforce a law is an extreme example, the limits of human

foresight, the ambiguities of language, and the high cost of legislative

deliberation combine to assure that most legislation will be enacted in

a seriously incomplete form, with many areas of uncertainty left to be

resolved by the courts. Insofar as judges are merely agents of the

current legislature, they will utilize their considerable interpretive

leeway to rewrite the legislation in conformity with the views of the

current rather than the enacting legislature and they will thereby impair

the "contract" between the enacting legislature and the group that

procured the legislation.
                                                                    8.




      If we assume that an independent judiciary would, in contrast,

interpret and apply legislation in accordance with the original legis-

lative understanding   3__!'
                               (an assumption examined shortly) it follows
that an independent judiciary facilitates rather than, as conventionally

believed, limits the practice of interest-group politics. To be sure,

like the constitutive rules of the legislative process, the independent

judiciary increases the cost of enacting legislation in the first place.

Being independent, the judges may (directly or indirectly) refuse to

enforce legislation that they do not like and this possibility reduces

the value of legislation to the group seeking it. But that is a neces-

sary price to pay for a system in which interest groups will have incen-

tives to invest in legislation that yields them benefits over an

extended period of time.

B. A Formal Model

      Before examining certain objections to the analysis, it will be

helpful to present a more formal version of it. Let d0d1 in Figure I

represent the demand curve of various groups for special-interest

legislation (such as protective tariffs, import quotas, or minimum rate

regulation) under the assumption that the benefits from such legislation

will be limited to a single period, namely the term of the enacting

legislature. The demand curve is negatively sloped because some

groups will obtain greater benefits from protective legislation and

accordingly will offer a higher price.        S0S1 is the marginal cost

curve of the legislature, viewed as the seller of special-interest

legislation. The legislature's costs include the costs of drafting

legislation (primarily the opportunity costs of the time spent by
                                                                   9.




legislators in attending committee meetings, roll calls, etc.) and

other expenses. 1?_," The market for special—interest legislation

will clear at point E0 in Figure I, where L0 units of legislation are

produced. At E0 all the gains from trade between interest groups and

legislators will be fully exploited under the (restrictive) assumption

that legislation is sold only for a single period. The dollar benefits

after   deducting the costs of writing the legislation will equal the
area d0E0S0, and are distributed between legislators and groups obtaining
legislation,   the simplest assumption being that the benefits received

by legislators are proportional to the area dØE0S0.

                   [Insert   Figure I about here]

        Now let the gains from special-interest legislation extend beyond

the period of the enacting legislature. To simplify, assume that the

legislation will never be repealed and that the group benefited by its

expects to obtain constant profits per period from the legislation.

Then the maximum price the group will pay to obtain the legislation will

equal the present value of those profits. In terms of Figure I, the

relevant demand curve is now D0d1, which is a vertical multiple of the

single—period demand curve.          Assuming for the moment that it costs

no more to enact permanent than single-period legislation and that

legislative hldealsu can be permanently enforced at zero cost, the new

equilibrium position will be at E2. This differs from the single-period

model in two important respects. First, there is more special-interest

legislation (L2 compared to L0), since some legislation that was not pro-

fitable to enact when the return was received for only one period is

now profitable.      (Indeed, if dcd were everywhere below the marginal

cost curve, there would have been no special-interest legislation at

all in the single-period model.) Second, since the discounted benefits

of the legislation as measured by the area D0E2S0 exceed the single-

period benefits, the "take" of the enacting legislature, which we

assume to be proportional to the benefits of the legislation to the

group procuring it, increases when legislation extends beyond one

period.

      Thus, the legislature has powerful incentives to devise methods

                                               --"   As we have seen,
of increasing the permanency of legislation.

there are two complementary methods of doing this. The first involves

establishing procedures for the enactment of legislation that increase

the cost of repealing it; the second, the creation of an independent

judiciary to enforce legislation in accordance with the intentions of

the enacting legislature. In terms of Figure I, the effect of the

internal procedures is to shift the marginal cost curve upwards to

S2S3 while at the same time shifting the dmeand curve to the right of

d0d1. Internal procedures will presumably be added until the additional

benefits of the legislature from increasing the demand for legislation

are just equal to the additional costs of the procedures.

      If, however, the judges served at the pleasure of the legislators,

their decisions would presumably be in perfect harmony with the current

legislature's wishes, and we would be back to the single-period model

with demand curve d0d1 no matter how cumbersome were the internal

procedures of the legislature. It is no answer that interest groups

would simply pay for legislation on the installment plan--a sum each
                                                                  11.


period in exchange for the continuation of the original "deal." The
enacting legislature would still have an incentive to produce only
     units of legislation since it would not be compensated for additional
L0
units. As noted earlier, the legislature might find it unprofitable

to "sell" any legislation at all unless the future benefits of the

legislation could be capitalized and received by the enacting legislature.

Finally, even if the costs of producing the legislation were zero, so

that the number of "deals' was independent of whether or not the

enacting legislature could appropriate future benefits, the legisla-

ture would still have a strong incentive to build durability into its

legislation in order to capture some of those future benefits.

        If the judiciary is independent, 'it can be expected) for reasons

explained in the next subpart, to enforce existing statutes in accordance

with the intent.of the enacting legislature. But while the combination

of high legislative costs of repeal and an independent judiciary thus

turns out to be an ingenious device for promoting the sale of long-term

special-interest legislation, independence is not without its costs.

The judiciary may decide not to enforce the deal worked out by the

legislature. It may declare the law unconstitutional or interpret it

in a manner that reduces the gains from the law to the group intended

to benefit from it, since most sitting judges, hving been apppointed

in an earlier period, will "owe" nothing to the enacting legislature.

        The cost of independence is shown in Figure I by the demand curve

        which is lower than D0d1.   The difference between the two curves

is due to the positive probability in each future period that the

                                                                             .
                                                                  12.




returns from the special-interest legislation will not be forthcoming

because of adverse judicial rulings. These expectations will be

incorporated into the maximum price that groups are willing to pay

for favorable legislation. Since judicial nullification of legislation

has in fact been relatively infrequent,         it seems reasonable to

assume that D1d1 will lie substantially above d0d1, the single-period

demand curve. This is illustrated in Table 1, which shows the ratio

of the multi-period to the single—period maximum price for several

                  [Insert Table 1 about here]

hypotheti-cal values of the probability of judicial nullification, the

number of time periods, and the interest rate. We assume that the
                                                    the single-period
single-period returns occur with certainty (since in /    model, it will
be recalled, the judiciary is assumed to be the perfect agent of the

enacting legislature), while the multi-period returns are subject to

the risk of nullification in each period.      If, for example, a 10
                             20 per cent
per cent interest rate and a / probability of nullification per period

are assumed, the present value of the legislative returns (and hence

the maximum price the interest group is willing to pay for favorable

legislation) is between 2.8 and 2.9 times greater in the multi—period

(10 or more periods) than in the single—period model. Overall, the

multi—period to single—period ratios range from 1.7 to 9.0 in Table 1,

the ratio being greater the lower the probability of nullification,

the lower the interest rate, and the greater the number of time periods.

These calculations indicate that there are substantially higher benefits

from multi-period deals even when the probabilities of nullification are
                                                                      13.




themselves substantial. In fact, in order for the single-period price

to equal the multi-period price and thus for d0d1 to equal D1d1 in

Figure I, the probability of nullification would have to be between

.45 and .5Oin each period.

        The equilibrium sale of legislation, which incorporates both the

costs of the self-imposed rules on the legislative process and the

expected utaxhi    resulting   from the independence of the judiciary, occurs

at E1 in Figure I, where L1 units of legislation are produced, yielding

benefits equal to D1E1S2 which are divided between the interest groups

and the legislature. Even assuming that these benefits are greater

than the area d0E0S0, this solution is a second-best one. The benefits

would be greater if the long-term commitments of the current legislature

could be enforced at zero cost. With this possibility excluded, the

independent judiciary serves the function of permitting some capitaliza-        S
tion   of future returns into the pockets of the current legislature.

C. A Closer Look at the Concept of Judicial "Independence"

        The reader may be troubled by the assumption that the "independent1'

judiciary is really independent of interest-group political pressures,

by   our failure to present an explicit theory of judicial behavior, and
by the existence of alternative theories of the independence of the
judiciary.
        It   is of course unrealistic to suppose the judiciary wholly

independent of the current desires of the political branches. The

legislature could refuse to appropriate funds to pay the judges'

salaries;     the executive could refuse to enforce judicial decrees.
Short   of outright confrontation, there are various methods by which
                                                                    14.




the political branches can impose costs on the judiciary, such as

budgetary harassment,          tinkering with the courts' jurisdiction,

and altering the composition of the judiciary by the creation of many

new judgeships. Yet such devices have been resorted to infrequently,

even in periods of intense hostility to judicial rulings. The reason,

we conjecture, is the high costs of the available methods of harassment

in relation to the benefits sought. The current legislature may want

judicial interpretations that gut some existing laws, but if it tries

to procure them by forms of coercion that impair the functioning of

the judiciary across the board, it will impose costs on all who use

the courts, including various politically effective groups and indeed

the beneficiaries of whatever legislation the current legislature has

enacted.

       At   the same time, the fact that the legislative and executive
branches do have means of coercing the judiciary helps to explain why
the self—interest of independent judges      is promoted by enforcing

legislation    according to its original tenor. If courts are not valued
highly,    the imposition   by the current legislature of coercive measures
that   impair the courts' effective functioning will not be perceived as

highly costly, and such measures will therefore be imposed more often.

The value (both social and private) of courts is a function in major

part of the predictability of their decisions and decision according

to   the original meaning of a statute rather than according to the ever-
shifting preferences of successive legislatures is probably an important
source of that predictability, in part because such a decision is based
                                                                   15.




on materials (for example, the congessional debates) available to
                                                                            .
all to study and base predictions of judicial behavior on. In short,

the ability of courts to maintain their independence from the political

branches may depend at least in part on their willingness to enforce

the "contracts" of earlier legislatures according to the original

understanding of the "contract."

        There is, to be sure, the possibility that although the judiciary

is independent of the political branches, interest groups will intervene

directly ,with judges to undo the results of an earlier legislative

process. However, the methods of imparting independence from the

political branches of government also serve to reduce the possibility

of   direct or   indirect bribery of the judges by interest groups. Life

tenure--in   circumstances where the job holder intends to remain in the
job for the remainder of his active life--' reduces the likelihood
of   an important £because difficult to detect) form of bribery that
consists of dangling prospects of future employment before the bribe-
taker. Life tenure also increases the expected penalty for bribery,
assuming dismissal is a major sanction for bribery.         Other rules
of the judicial process also operate to reduce the operation of
interest groups in the judicial arena, notably the rules limiting ex
parte   contacts with judges and denying legal standing to groups, as

distinct from the individuals or firms immediately affected in a

narrow legal sense, by the legislation in question.

        Not only is the assumption of independence plausible, but the

judiciary in fact commonly behaves as if it were independent of the         —

wishes of the current legislature. —
                                                                    16.




        To be sure, this leaves open the question, what does determine

the outcome of judicial decisions? As mentioned, there are constraints,

imposed by the legislative and executive branches, that set the outer

limits on judicial autonomy but they leave a broad area on which

judicial behavior cannot be explained by reference to those constraints.

Within   this area, the development of an economic throry of judicial
behavior is hampered by the studied efforts of society to divorce
judicial    rewards from the outcome of judicial decisions. A possibility

is that judicial decision-making should be viewed as a consumption

activity from the judg&s standpoint. He decides in a certain way

not because it will get him something else but because he derives

personal satisfaction from preferring one party to the lawsuit over

the    other or one policy over another, a form of satisfaction that
individuals routinely seek in a variety   of areas. However, to develop

this   or any other theory of judicial behavior would carry us far beyond
the scope of this paper, and is we    believe unnecessary to it.

         It remains to consider alternative explanations for   the existence
of    the independent judiciary to the one proposed here. The commonest

explanation is that an independent judiciary is necessary to enforce

the    Constitution against the legislative and executive branches of
government. This is unconvincing. The English      judiciary is also

independent but English judges may not have-—and certainly do not exer-

cise——the power to invalidate acts of Parliament. In most other

societies as well, the judiciary has considerable independence (save

in politically very sensitive areas, mainly involving internal security)

yet no power to invalidate legislative action.
                                                                     17.


      Another possible explanation is that an independent judiciary

minimizes the costs of legal procedure. Life tenure reduces turn-

over and thereby imparts greater predictability to judicial decision-

making. The longer a judge is on the bench, the easier it becomes

to predict his decisions in many different kinds of cases. Also,

long tenure imparts valuable experience to a judge and thereby

increases his efficiency. Finally, as just mentioned, long tenure

reduces the danger of bribery--a danger that exists quite independently

of the existence of interest groups. What these points overlook, how-

ever, is'that while long judicial service may be socially desirable,

granting life tenure and a guaranteed salary is not an efficient method

of optimizing the length of judicial service. (Observe that legislators

are not employed on any such basis, though most of the arguments just

noted   also apply to them.) A more efficient method would be to pay
high salaries contingent on satisfactory performance. This would avoid
the disincentive effects of divorcing tenure and compensation from
performance and would be clearly preferable to the life-tenure system--
were it not for the exigencies of     an interest-group system of government.

II.     Positive Implications of the Ecoflopij.cTheQ.ry of the Independent Judiciary

A. Administrative Regulation
    Administrative agencies such      as the Interstate Commerce Commission

and the Civil Aeronautics Board are examples of what we may call the
t1dependent" judiciary.      Congress, lacking the time to regulate railroad
rates in detail,    establishes an Interstate Commerce Commission to do so.

The   Commission has some indicia of independence but many fewer than the
federal    courts; in particular, its members serve for limited terms and
                                                                18.




turnover is in fact quite rapid. Furthermore, the fact that it has

a much more specialized jurisdiction than the federal courts facilitates

congressional surveillance and direction through the appropriations

process in a way that would be infeasible with respect to the courts.

      The analysis in Part I of this paper suggests three propositions

concerning administrative regulation which seem consistent with at

least casual observation:

      1. Administrative agencies will be established most frequently

when the probability of de facto judicial nullification of legislation

is high (for example, during the New Deal, when the courts were hostile

to federal economic regulations --"). This is because the ability of

courts to nullify legislation, especially by adverse factfinding in

enforcement proceedings, can be curtailed by consigning the factfinding

function to an administrative agency, which will tend to be more sub-

servient to the legislature.

      2. The legislature will, however, preserve judicial review of

administrative determinations       in order to assure that the agency,

in its eagerness to serve the current legislature, will not stray too

far from the terms of the legislative "deal" establishing the regulatory

program that the agency administers.

      3. Since, however, judicial review cannot be expected to be wholly

effective, we expect—-and find-—that administrative adjudication is far

less consistent over time than judicial. (A related point is that

precedent plays a smaller role in administrative than in judicial

decision-making.) This follows directly from the relatively dependent

character of administrative judging.
                                                                         19.



B. The Form of Interest Group Leislation

      We have thus far treated the legislative act as complete at the

time of enactment——all of the benefits of the legislation are assumed

to flow without subsequent legislative action. Yet some legislation

is ineffective without substantial annual appropriations by the legis-

lature, either to pay a periodic subsidy or to defray the expenses of

a public agency charged with enforcing the statute. Legislation

incomplete in this sense at the time of enactment is much less valuable

to its     beneficiaries than legislation that is   complete when enacted;

in   the   first case, the beneficiaries may have to, "buy" the legislation

anew every year. In terms of our formal model, we are in effect back

at the single-period demand curve in Figure 1.        In order to enable the

enacting legislature to appropriate part of the future benefits, we

would expect-—and we find-—that interest-group legislation is

typically cast in a form that avoids the necessity for substantial

annual appropriations. Legislation setting up regulatory agencies that

use power over rates and entry to redistribute wealth is an important

example: the annual budgets of these agencies are very small in rela—
                                                    27/
tion to the redistributions that they effect. —           Not only   is regula-

tion used much more often than direct subsidization to benefit interest

groups, but when direct subsidies are used their funding is often made

independent of further legislative action by the device of the earmarked

tax, as in the interstate-highway and social-security programs.

      The problem of legislation that requires substantial annual appropria-

tions to maintain its effectiveness is forcefully illustrated by the

experience with Prohibition. The supporters of Prohibition were able to
                                                                 20,.



obtain a constitutional arnendrn2nt, normally as we shall see

particularly durable form of interest—group legislation. However,

unlike many other forms of regulation, prohibiting the sale of

alcoholic beverages required a massive law-enforcement effort.

This is strikingly illustrated in Table 2, which shows how Prohibition

cases came to dominate the dockets of the federal courts. Of course




subsequent Congresses could have appropriated the sums necessary to

increase the number of federal judges, prosecutors, customs inspectors,

etc. to levels at which Prohibition would have been effectively enforced,

but they were unwilling to do so. The result was that the constitutional

amendment was effectively nullified, and it was repealed in 1933 after

having been in effect for only 13 years. Constitutional amendments
 that   do not require substantial annual appropriations to enforce
                                                                   21.
                                                                              .
 (e.g., the First Amendment) have proved a good deal more durable.'

        An alternative to both annual subsidies and regulatory legislation

would be the payment of a single lump sum to the interest group in

the first period, a sum equal to the discounted present value of the

annual subsidies or regulatory protection. Here, it would seem, the

transaction would be complete in the first period and there would be

no need to. have any enforcement mechanism. However, if legislative

enactment iere a cheap and speedy process or the judges were the

agents of the legislators, the interest group that had obtained the

lump-sum payment would have no protection against the legislature's

taxing away the entire payment in the second period, either by the

levying of a special tax or by the courts' interpreting existing tax

laws unequally.

C. The Determinants of-dicial Tenure

        The value of judicia' independence is a function of the number of

periods over which the returns from special-interest legislation accrue.

Since an independent judiciary is, as we have seen, a source of costs

as well as benefits to the legislature, we would expect the judiciary

to be less independent   the shorter the expected duration of special-
interest legislation.     This may explain certainJifferences that one
observes   in the selection and tenure of judges at the federal,
                                                                   state
and local levels of government. As we progress down this ladder,      we

find in general shorter terms for judges and greater reliance on election
rather than appointment as the method of selecting judges. This diminishing
                                                                             4




                                                                22.




judicial independence is consistent with the fact that, the more

confined or local is the jurisdiction of a legislature, the less

scope it will have for enacting protective legislation.       There

is more competition for residents among cities and towns than among

states, and among states than among countries, because from the

resident's standpoint different cities are better substitutes for

one another than different states, and different states better sub-

stitutes than different countries. Citizen mobility limits the effect-

iveness to schemes of redistributing wealth from one group to another

at the state and local levels. Also, the regulation of a product or

service is less effective the more limited the jurisdiction of the

regulatory   authority, because the providers are more mobile within
a more limited area.
       Thus it i hardly surprising that many federal   regulatory schemes,

such   as railroadregulation, arose from the debris of state regulatory
attempts and that much state regulation came about as a result of
failures of regulation at the municipal   level. But this means that the

importance   of an independent judiciary to the practice of interest-
group politics declines as we move from   regulation that is less local

to regulation that is more local. The interest groups will not seek

durable compacts from state and local legislatures anyway, so why

should the political branches pay the price of an independent judiciary?

        Another situation in which the independent judiciary will be

less valuable to the political system is where legislators, despite

having to stand for reelection every few years, in fact enjoy a long
                                                                      23.



                                                                                 .
enough tenure in office for interest groups to be willing to accept
long-term commitments from them. In this situation, an independent

judiciary may not be very attractive to the legislature; its value

as an enforcement agency will be slight and may well be outweighed

by its costs in potential nullification of legislative compacts.

Short   of eliminating the independence 0f   the judiciary, the political

branches   can limit the consequences of that independence either (1)
by expanding the size of the judiciary so as to be able to appoint a
substanti'al number of new judges whose policy views will be compatible
with    those of the current legislature, or (2) by filling vacancies as

they arise with older judges, whose expected terms of office will be

short (shorter, perhaps, than those of the legislators). If this

analysis is correct, one would expect an inverse relationship between

legislative tenure and judicial tenture. That is, the longer the

tenure    of the leislatorVs, the greater will be judicial turnover,
persumably brought about by election of judges or by appointment of
older    people to the bench.

0.     The Constitution and the Independent Judiciary
         Earlier   we rejected the suggestion that the existence   of an

independent judiciary is best explained in terms of its      role in
enforcing    the Constitution. Nonetheless, the role of the courts in

enforcing    constitutional provisions is an important one on which        the

analysis    in this paper casts some light. We have argued that the
 existence of an independent judiciary and the constitutive rules of
 legislative bodies (such as the requirement of a majority vote to
                                                                24.




enact legislation) are methods of imparting durability to an initial

legislative judgment protecting some group. A constitutional right

is simply another device for doing the same thing. Since such a

right is much more difficult to retract than a statutory right--the

procedures for constitutional amendment being so costly and time-

consuming-—a constitutional provision confers more durable protection

than is possible by ordinary legislative action. But enforcement by

an independent judiciary remains necessary. Otherwise the constitutional

provisions would be continuously reinterpreted to accord with the pre-

ferences of the current legislators.

      In the view proposed here, the Constitution has two purposes.

One is to establish the ground rules for a system of interest-group

politics; Article III is to be understood in this light. The second

is to confer protective legislation of a peculiarly durable kind on

those specially Qffective interest groups that are able and willing

to incur the costs necessary to obtain a constititional provision in

their favor.

      Such a view has important implications for a number of constitu-

tional controversies; we shall mention three here.

      1.   It is sometimes suggested that the protection of freedom of

speech and of the press by the First Amendment should be limited to

political expression, on the theory that the purpose of the First

Amendment is to protect the electoral process by which members of

Congress and the President are selected.       However, a broader view

of the scope of the First Amendment may be quite consistent with the
                                                                      25.




approach taken here, for it would be congenial to that approach to          S
view the First Amendment as a form of protective legislation extracted

by an interest group consisting of publishers, journalists, pamphieteers,

and others who derive pecuniary and nonpecuniary income from publica-

tion and advocacy of various sorts.

       2. The question has sometimes been raised whether it is not a

perversion of consti tuti onal pri nci pie to invoke a consti tuti onal

provision   on behalf of a majority rather than a minority group, as in
cases challenging reverse" discrimination (for example, preferring
blacks to whites) or--a more clear—cut example--cases challenging
schemes   of legislative malapportionment that have been adopted by
popular referendum. From the standpoint of interest group analysis
adopted in this paper, it is a detail whether the group comprises

more or less than half of the voting population. Indeed, because a

large group will often be politically less effective than a small one,

due   to the higher costs of collective action to the large group, such
a group may benefit substantially from obtaining constitutional
protection against legislative regulation--though by the same token
it may find it difficult to obtain such protection in the first place.
       More broadly, our interest-group analysis casts doubt on the

conventional view of constitutional lawyers that the Constitution is

designed to protect the powerless, unrepresented elements of society.

In a view of the governmental process as one in which the courts and

Constitution play an integral role in a system of interest-group

politics, the Constitution can more accurately be described as


                                                                            .
                                                                  26.



designed to protect groups sufficiently powerful to obtain constitu-
tional protection for their interests.          This of course does not

explain why the "Warren Court" interpreted the Constitution as con-

ferring   extraordinary rights on the comon criminal. There is con-
siderable doubt   whether these rights were intended by the framers

of the Constitution and its amendments and perhaps this episode is

best understood as an example of judicial independence. But we do

not pretend to have developed a complete theory of the Supreme

Court's behavior.

     3.    There is a long-standing debate over the question whether
the Supreme Court should use the due process and equal protection
clauses of the Constitution to strike down legislation     that, even

though    it does not infringe upon a specific constitutional right
such as freedom of speech, is unreasonable     as judged by some general

criterion of social welfare or public interest. It should not, and

would not to the extent that the view suggested here--that the Court's

role is to enforce the specific interests protected by the Constitution

rather than to act as a general brake on legislation promoting

"factions" --"     (special   interest)--is correct. And, in general,

the Court has not acted as a general brake on special-interest legis-

lation, as the growth of the welfare state attests. The view that

the Court's function is to promote or assure the consistency of the

legislative product with the public interest,         besides placing an

enormous cloud over legislative activity in general, implies that the

Court and the Constitution are outside of the structure of interest-

group politics, whereas we have tried to show that they are integral

elements of that structure.
                                                                       27.




                              Conclusion


     This paper has sketched an approach to the question of the

independent judiciary that enables a seeming anomaly in the older

political—science and newer economic theory of the political process

as a struggle among interest groups to be incorporated as an essential

element of that theory. Our analysis has certain positive implications

with respect to the structure of government that seem consistent with

observed reality. It also has, as we have just seen, normative

implications with respect to constitutional interpretation.

     A    striking element of our   approach is that although we view the

independent judiciary as an essential component in a system of

interest-group politics, we do not view the judiciary as itself "political"

in the sense suggested by Martin Shapiro              and   other debunkers of
the idea of a genuinely independent judiciary. Our view of how the
courts operate is closer to that of the legal commentators who extol

the courts as "above" politics.           Where   we differ from these com-
mentators is in not venerating the courts as repositories of some
special   wisdom, integrity, morality, or commitment to principle. In

our view the courts do not enforce the moral law or ideals of neutrality,

justice, or fairness; they enforce the "deals" made by effective

interest groups with earlier legislatures.             Of course, since

the judges are independent, an appeal to principles may be effective

courtroom or law-review advocacy.

                          Appendix

           Some Empirical Tests of Judicial Independence

    We have argued in this paper that an independent judiciary
imposes expected costs on the sale of legislation. The possibility
that the judiciary will not enforce the deals worked out by the

legislature reduces the expected value of legislation, which in turn

reduces the benefits to the groups procuring the legislation and

the payments to the enacting legislators. Thus, the degree to which

the courts overturn legislative deals is of critical importance in

evaluati'ng the usefulness of the hypothesis that independent judiciary

fosters interest group politics. If the courts were sufficiently

unreliable, the expected benefits from the sale of multi-period

legislation, made possible by judicial independence, would not offset

the costs of the legislative deals that were frustrated by the courts.
              p
And if this were the case, one would have to search further for an

explanation of $udicial independence.

     The question of judicial unreliability or the costs of inde-

pendence is amenable to empirical analysis although what follows

must be viewed as a crude and preliminary attempt. We focus on a

single measure of unreliability--the number of acts of Congress that

have been held unconsititional by the Surpeme Court. Nullification

is an extreme example of judicial unreliability, and for this reason

is likely to be deficient as an overall measure of the costs of

judicial independence.      Nevertheless, it is the only measure that
                                                                    2.



is   readily available, and the development of a more suitable measure

is beyond the scope of this paper.

       Ninety-seven   acts of Congress were held   unconstitutional in

whole   or   in part in the period 1789-1972, or an average of about

one per term of Congress.          Figure II indicates, however, that

there has been a great deal of variability over time in the number

of Supreme Court nullifications per term of Congress. Only two acts

were nullified in the 1789-1864 period while 11 were nullified in

the next) 15 years. Three peaks in nullification activity are observable:

1920-1924 (11 nullifications in the 66th-68th Congresses); 1935—1936

(10 nullifications in the 74th Congress); and 1963-1972 (25 nullifica-

tions in the 88th-92nd Congresses). Between the latter two peaks, the

number of nullifications diminished sharply (5 nullifications in the

1937-1962 perid).

        What are the overall costs imposed by nullifications on the

political process whereby legislation is bought and sold? Two

 inferences from the data lead us to believe that these costs are

minimal. First, in comparison to the total number of public bills

 enacted by Congress, the number of nullifications is insignificant:

 97 nullifications out of a total of more than 38,000 acts suggests

 an average probability of nullification per actof about .0026. Even

 in the peak nullification period, 1935-1936, only nine out of the

 1,526 statutes enacted between 1933 and 1936 were declared unconstitu-

 tional.          Probabilities of such a small magnitude would seem unlikely

 to deter significantly the enactment of special-interest legislation0

Second, the nullification data take no account of the time span

between passage of a statute and its nullification. A Supreme

Court that in 1970 nullified a provision of a statute passed 61

years earlier would not be imposing substantial costs (discounted

back to 1909) on the groups that originally procured the statute.---"

Legislation that lasts 61 years is of sufficient durability to allow

the full benefits of the deal to have been captured by the groups

involved. So long a lag between passage and nullification is atypical,

however. Thirty-eight acts were nullified within four years of their

enactment, 58 within eight years, and 76 within 12 years. Only seven

acts were more than 25 years old at the time of their nullification.

However, even an act that lasts eight or ten years has sufficient

durability to enable the bulk of the present value of its benefits

to be appropriated.   --—"   If we   restrict the sample to acts nullified

within eight years of passage (because these are likely to have imposed

the largest costs on the groups procuring the acts), not only does
the number of nullifications     fall by 40   per cent (from 97   to   58) but
the   time pattern of nullification changes in one interesting respect.

The recent period, 1963-1973, is no longer a period of peak nullifica-

tion activity (see Figure [I). Of the 27 nullificatioris in this period,

only nine took place within eight years of enactment.

       Multiple regression analysis can be used to estimate the influence

that various factors have had on the frequency of Supreme Court nullifi-

cations and on the time lag between enactment and nullification of an

act. The variables included in the regression analysis are as follows:

    Multiple regression equations were estimated on the three

dependent variables, Nt8, Nt16. and Nt, over the period 1789-1972.

The specification of the 8 regression is of the following form:

          Nt8 = cx+iAGEt +   2TENt
                                     +

The Nt16 and Nt specifications are identical to (1) except that

BILLt16 replaces BILLt8. The model of legal decision making that

underlies the above equation is basically a variant of the economist's

theoremthat when the costs rise from engaging in certain behavior

or the gains fall, the frequency of such behavior declines.

Accrodingly,AGE is expected to have a positive effect on the rate

of nullifications0 Older judges, with fewer active years ahead,

will be less susceptible to legislative or executive "bribery" in

the form of promotions to higher office and are more likely to view

their present position as a terminal one. Hence older judges will

exercise their greater "independence" by nullifying more acts. The

effect of the TEN variable is less certain than AGE. We expect that

recently appointed judges will be more indebted to the current legis-

lature and executive, and hence will be less likely to nullify the

acts of their benefactors, but on the other hand, judges with less

tenure will be less indebted to more distant Congresses0 Hence TEN

should have a positive effect on nullifications only if the nullifica-

tion variable is restricted to acts that have been nullified within,

for example, eight years of passage.             PAR is included in the

regression analysis to test the hypothesis that the court is less

likely to demonstrate independence and hence nullify laws the less

                                                                            .
                                                                   6.




conflict there is between the executive and Congress. A crude mea-

sure of this conflict is whether the President's party is the same

as the majority party of Congress. Thus we expect a negative sign

on the PAR variable. Since the dependent variable is the number of

nullifications while the model generates hypotheses on nullification

propensities, we have included the number of bills passed (BILL1) as

an independent variable in the regression. Thus, holding BILL1 con-

stant implies that variations in nullifications reflect differences

in the nullification propensities of the Court.

     Table 3 presents the regression results on three nullification

variables--Nt8 (acts 8 years old or less), Nt16 (acts 16 years old

or less), and Nt (all acts). Equations 2.1 —     2.3   are for the period

1789-1972, --' and equations 2.4 -   2.6   are for a narrower set of

observations, the 39th-92nd Congresses.

     Overalithe regression results are inconclusive. The age

variable behaves as predicted but is statistically significant only

in the equations that include the full set of observations. In con-

trast, the tenure variable is insignificant when all observations

are included but significant in the 16 and Nt regressions that

are estimated on the 39th-92nd terms. And the positive and significant

effect of tenure in equations 2.5 and 2.6 compared to its insignificant

effect in 2.4 is contrary to the prediction that the strongest positive

impact of tenure should be observed in the Nt8 regressions.

     One difficulty in estimating the separate effects of AGE and TEN

in the same regression is that the two variables are highly correlated.
                                                                            7.




This is particularly true in the regressions limited to the 39th-

92nd Congressional terms where the correlation between AGE and TEN

is .70. When TEN is excluded from equations 2.4-2.6, the AGE variable

becomes highly significant. And similarly, when AGE is excluded from

2.4-2.6, the significance of TEN improves.
                                                    --"   Of the two remaining

variables in the regression analysis, PAR is insignificant in all six

regressions while BILL1 is significant in two of the six. In sum,

except for the AGE variables the results of the regression analysis

yield little support for a theory of legal decision-making that hypo-

thesizes that the observed degree of judicial independence is a function

of the costs and benefits to the judiciary of exercising independence.

It would be premature, however, to abandon the theory since our measures

of costs and benefits (age, tenure, political party of executive and

Congress) and our measure of independence (nullifications) are highly

imperfect.

     Our second empirical test is an analysis of the determinants of

the time lag (LAG) between the passage of a bill and its nullification.

Here each of the 95 acts nullified.between 1789 and 1972 is an observa-

tion in the regression analysis. The regression specification is

                                                           +           +         +        + u

where the LAG variable is in logarithmic form._' Based on the theory

outlined earlier, we would expect both AGE and TEN to have negative

effects on the LAG variable. Since the nullification of older acts

is less costly to long-term legislative deals (because most of the

present value of benefits are still being received by groups procuring

                                                                                                      O

the act), the younger the judges are, the more susceptible they will

be to legislative and executive "bribery and pressure and the less

likely they will be to nullify recent congressional acts. Similarly,

as average tenure diminishes the Court will be more indebted to recent

Congresses and less to past Congresses, making the Court less likely

to nullify acts of the former and more likely to nullify acts of the

latter. We expect PAR to have a positive effect on LAG because the

greater the conflect between the executive and legislature, as measured

by PAR, the less effective the two branches will be in bringing joint

pressure on the Court not to nullify recent acts. We have no strong

a priori predictions on the three remaining variables, DIS, t and N,

in equation (2). N tests whether there is a systematic effect on

the time lag when more acts are nullified per term; t tests whether

there has beena trend over time in the age of acts nullified; and

DIS tests whether the degree of conflict within the Court (as measured

by the number of dissenting votes) varies with the age of the act

nullified.

     Equation 2.7 of Table 3 presents the LAG regression. AGE behaves

as predicted--younger judges are less likely to nullify more recent

acts——though its effect is only marginally significant. TEN is signi—

ficant but its effect is contrary to our prediction. PAR and DIS are

not significant. Both the t and N variables are highly significant.

Here we find that the more recent the Congress, the greater the average

age of the acts nullified; and the more acts nullified per term, the

less is the average age of the acts nullified.

     that had obtained favorable legislation from their predecessors.

     But this is simply an example of having to pay twice for a single

     good. We consider later the alternative possibility of paying

     for favorable legislation on an installment basis.

10. At the beginning of the 93rd Congress (January 1973) the average

         Senate Comittee chairman had been a member of Congress for

         20 (continuous) years. The corresponding figure for the House

         of Representatives was 26.4. A partially offsetting factor is

         that when seniority is the basis of selection, chairmanships

         tend to be awarded to older members, who may not have a long

         period of continued service ahead of them. Thus, two of the

         17 Senate committees in 1973 (and six of the 21 House committees)

         had new chairmen. The chairmen of the remaining 15 Senate corn-

         mittees had been chairmen an average of 6.1 (continuous) years;

         the average was the same for the House chairmen. Note that the

         maximum tenure of a chairman in 1973 would have been 18 continuous

         years since there had been a democratic majority in Congress since

         1955. The source of these statistics is 3 Congressional Quarterly

11. This does not imply literal-minded or otherwise inflexible inter-

         pretation of the legislation. On the contrary, judicial inter-
     •
         pretations that enable a law to survive the vicissitudes of

         unforeseen technical or economic changes that might effectively

         nullify the law were it not interpreted flexibly are perfectly

         consistent with the idea of an independent judiciary.
                                                                   4.




12. The analysis does not depend on the shape of the marginal cost

    curve (assumed in Figure I to be horizontal) or on the assump-

    tion that there are positive costs of selling legislation.



13. Our assumption that the market clears when gains from trade

    are fully exploited rules out a monopoly output, which would

    be less than L0. But it does not imply that legislators are

     perfectly discriminating monopolists (in which event they

    would cover their costs and receive in addition the entire

     area dE0S); a competitive market in the sale of legislation

     is possible. Such a market would also clear at E0 but the

     area IE0S would be received by purchasers, contrary to our

     assumption that legislators receive part of dE0S0. (If marginal

     costs in Figure I were rising, legislators would receive an

     amount in excess of their costs even in the purely competitive

     case.) An additional question is whether the benefits in

     Figure I will be competed away by expenditures to obtain legis-

     lative seats or expenditures on lawyers, lobbyists, etc.

         Since   the results we obtain in this paper are unaffected
     by which assumption we make (that is, monopoly, perfect price
     discrimination,   competition with and without rents, gross

     benefits versus net benefits), we do not pursue these questions

     any further.
                                                                  5.




14. When legislation lasts for more than one period, the demand

    curve faced by the current (enacting) legislature will also

    depend on the amount of legislation sold earlier. Previous

    legislatures will have already exploited many attractive

    opportunities that the current legislature cannot resell

    again. Thus D0d1 in Figure I will be a vertical multiple

    of a single-period curve that is lower than d0d1 since the

    latter was constructed on the assumption that legislation

    lasted only a single period (implying that the current legis-

     lature was not encumbered by past deals). In the subsequent

    analysis, which compared D0d1 to d0d1, we assume (contrary

    to the initial exposition )   that   both demand curves are con-

    structed on the assumption that multi-period deals were pos-

    sible in the past and that some of these deals extend into

    the term of the current legislature.



15. This conclusion depends critically on the modification in the

    model (see supra note 14) whereby d0d1 allows for multi-period

     deals in the past. If d0d1 did not, then it is possible that

     the current legislature would face a multi-period demand curve

     that was lower than d0d1, causing the multi-period quantity of

     legislation to fall short of the single-period quantity. In

     the limit, if all profitable deals had been exploited by the

     time the current legislature was elected, and technological

     and demand changes did not yield new opportunities, the current

     legislature would not be able to make any multi-period (or for

     that matter single-period) deals. In comparison, if past and
                                                                 6.




15 continued

     present deals are limited to a single period, the current

     legislature might find many profitable single-period deals

     available. Even if D0d1 were lower than d0d1 (as originally

     derived), the total stock of special-interest legislation

     existing at a moment in time would still be greater if multi-

     period deals were permitted. The time distribution of these

     deals would differ, however, as most would have been arranged

     by earlier legislatures with few deals remaining for the cur-

     rent legislature to make.    In this event, the main beneficiaries

     of multi-period deals would be past legislators.

        Thus,   our model provides an explanation for the original
     formation of an independent judiciary since early legislatures,
     not encumbered by past deals, would favor an institution--the
     independent judiciary--that fostered the making of long-term

     contracts. It is also consistent with the current legislature's

     favoring an independent judiciary; provided that one takes past

     legislative deals as given and generally beyond the reach of

     current legislatures, the current legislature would also benefit

     from being able to make multi-period deals compared to being

     restricted to single-period ones.


 16. We consider in Part IIB,     infra, the question why optimum special-

      interest legislation does not take the form of a single lump

      sum that is paid to the interest group by the legislature in

      the first period.

18. For example, between 1789 and 1972 the Supreme Court held only

    97 acts of Congress unconstitutional. This figure provides, of

    course, only a crude measure of judicial nullification and

    hence the "unreliability" of the federal courts, since they

    exclude   both unfavorable interpretations (which may be made
    by the lower courts as well as by the Supreme Court) that stop
    shqrt of declaring a statute unconstitutional and statutes that
    are never enacted in the first place because prior judicial
    rulings   indicate a high probability that they will be invalidated.

    See the appendix to this article for a further discussion of,

    and attempt to measure, the effect of the Court's power to

    nullify 1gislation or the costs of an independent judiciary.

      future returns will not be forthcoming since Pt (where t=l, . . .

      T)—-the present probability that the returns will be received in
      any future period t--is a decreasing function of t. The assump-

      tion that p is constant is probably incorrect. The importance of

      precedent in judicial decision-making is likely to produce prob-

      abilities (p) in periods 2, . .   .,T   that are close to one

      the    overwhelming majority of Supreme Court Justices. Of the 94
      former Justices, 55 died in office or within one year of leaving
      office, and 24 more died within 10 years of leaving office after
      having    retired at an average age of 71. The remaining 15, several
      of whom are still living, left the Court   at an average age of 61.

      (See 1975 World Almanac and Book of Facts 770.) We have also

      compiled data on the turnover rate every two years since 1885

      of all federal court judges. Turnover data can be used to

      estimate average tenure on the job, provided that a period is

      selected in which the number of judges remains approximately

      constant. Unfortunately, the latter condition is rarely met

      as the number of federal court judges (including retired but

      still sitting judges) has risen from 74 in 1885 to 635 in 1975.

      However, the increase was relatively modes (297 to 348) from

      1949 to 1965, and the average two-year turnover rate in the

      period was .0787 which converts into an average tenure on the

      bench per judge of 25.4 years (21.0787). Moreover, most of the

      turnover has come from deaths (particularly of retired but still

      sitting judges) rather than from resignations. Therefore, our

      assumption that a federal judicial appointment is generally a

      terminal job is consistent with the evidence on Supreme Court

      and other federal court judges.

     Act forbade resale price maintenance. Powerful pressures for

     exempting resale price maintenance from the Act eventuated in

     the passage of the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937 and the McGuire

     Act of 1952 which created such an exemption for states enacting

     Fair Trade laws. The enactment of the Miller-Tydings and

     McGuire Acts would have been unnecessary if the Court had responded

     to the rising political pressure for resale price maintenance

     by reinterpreting the Sherman Act to permit the practice.

     The Court's steadfastness in interpreting the Act in accordance

     with what it believed (correctly or not) to be the original

     understanding of the framers rather than the desires of the

     current legislators is a good, but not a rare, example of

     judicial independence.

        Other examples from the trade-regulation field are the enact-

     ment of the original Clayton Act; the Robinson-Patman Amendments

     thereto; the 1938 Wheeler-Lea amendments to the Federal Trade

     Commission Act; the Celler-Kefauver Antimerger Act; and the

     Bank Merger Act of 1966. All resulted from congressional dis-

     satisfaction with judicial interpretation of previously enacted

     statutes. Numerous examples from other federal statutory fields

     could also be cited.



25. See, for example, United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1 (1936);

     Schechter Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935); Hopkins

     Savings Ass'n v. Cleary, 296 U.S. 315 (1935).

      judicial review of administrative factfindings, see Richard A.

      Posner, An Economic Approach to Legal Procedure and Judicial

      Administration, 2 J. Leg. Studies 399, 416-17 (1973).



27. Some sense of the disproportion can be obtained by comparing

      the agency budgets listed in Geroge J. Stigler, The Process of

      Economic Regulation, 17 Antitrust Bull. 207 (1972), with the

      estjmates (admittedly rather crude) of the transfers involved

      in regulation presented in Richard A. Posner, The Social Costs

      of Monopoly and Regulation, 83 J. Pal. Econ. 807, 810 (1975).

      of the Fifth Amendment, which to be effective requires a sub-

      stantial   annnual appropriation by Congress to defray the expense
      of the government's eminent-domain proceedings.

31. Older judges have an additional advantage from the legislators'

      standpoint: their views are likely to be better known, and

      hence their behavior as judges is likely to be more predictable.

      On the other hand, older judges will be less susceptible to

      legislative or executive "bribery" in the form of promotion to

      higher office.



32. We 'do not, however, suggest that the protected groups are neces-

      sarily those urged by Charles A. Beard in his controversial book,

      An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United

      States (1913). The details of Beard's analysis have been

      sharply criticized. See Robert E. Brown, Charles Beard and

      the Constitution (1956).

34. It may seem paradoxical to view as protectionist legislation

      that forbids regulation rather than limits entry. But whether

      a group will seek regulation or freedom from regulation depends

      on   whether it   anticipates friendly or unfriendly regulation.

      The   "gun lobby" is another example of an interest group
      agressively seeking nonregulation.


35. Of course, as just mentioned, a group that feels vulnerable          to

      legislative   politics may on   that account have a greater demand

      for   constitutional protection.

40.   This is not to say that all legislation is inconsistent with

      efficiency or some other general welfare norm. Our point

      is rather that the judicial attitude implied by our analysis

      is one of indifference to the ethical content of the legisla-

      tive or constitutional provisions that the court is being

      asked to enforce.



41. These deficiencies include the following: (1) Nullification

      fails to account for judicial interpretations of statutes that

      stop short of nullification but nevertheless significantly reduce

      the value of the legislative deals. Further, if lower-court

                                                                          .
                                                                        14.



41 continued

     rulings gut the law in question, a Supreme Court bent on nullifi-

     cation may accomplish this purpose simply by not granting

     certiorari. Thus, observed nullifications may be an alternative

     to unfavorable lower-court rulings, and present a biased picture

     of overall judicial unreliability.      (2)   If nullification of a

     particular law can be anticipated, legislators and groups are

     likely to be deterred from enacting that law in the first place,

     threby saving the costs of enactment. Observed nullifications,

     therefore, will fail to account for the number of laws that are

     not enacted because of anticipated nullification.       (3)   If

     nullification merely delays for a short period of time the

     passage of a similar law that is acceptable to the Court (whose

     compositiion may change in the interval), the costs of observed

     nullificatjons may   actually   be less than the costs of continuous

     unfavorable interpretations that stop short of nullification.



42. See The Constitution of the U.S. of America, Analysis and

     Interpretation 1597-1619, at Sl25-S126.       We have excluded one

     act from our enumeration, involving legal-tender clauses, that

    was   declared unconstitutional in 1870 in a case overruled in 1871.


43. The one additional nullification during 1935-1936 was of a
     statute enacted in 1926.
                                                                      15.




44. We emphasize that this inference is limited by the absence of

      data on unfavorable judicial interpretations of statutes which

      may be positively correlated with nullifications and vastly

      greater than the number of nullifications in any period.



45. Act of Feb. 9, 1909, §2, 35 Stat. 614, as amended.



46. The frequency distribution of the time between passage and

      nullification for the 97 acts is as follows:

                                       Time (years)

47. See Table 1          supra.


                p

48.   Sixteen of the remaining 18 nullifictions in this period were
                    .1


      of   acts passed between 1946 and 1956, with an average lag

      between enactment and nullification of 15.7 years. The two

      other nullifications, which took place in 1970 and 1973, were

      of 1909 and 1960 acts respectively.



49. Since shorter tenure may have a positive effect on nullification

      of older laws (for example, laws that are more than eight years

      old at the time of nullification), the effect of TEN on all

      nullifications per term (Nt) is uncertain.




                                                                            .
                                                                   16.




50. The period 1789-1972 spans the lst-92nd Congresses. However,

    the first observation in equation 2.1 is the 5th Congress

    (to allow for the passage of bills over the preceding eight

    years) and hence 2.1 contains 88 observations. Similary, in

    equation 2.2 the first observation is the 9th Congress, and the

    regression contains 84 observations. When all nullifications

    is the dependent variable, the BILL variable is computed for

    bills passed over the last 16 years, and thus the first obser-

    vation in 2.3 is also the 9th Congress.



51. Since there were only two nullifications during the first 38

    Congresses, the narrower sample excludes at least 36 observa-

    tions (depending on whether Nt8, Nt16, or Nt is the dependent

    variable).where the dependent variable takes a zero value.

    The larger number     of   zero-valued dependent variables, particularly

     in   the   regressions that include the early Congresses, suggests

    that ordinary least squares is not the most appropriate

    statistical technique. We have not, however, nde use of an

    alternative procedure (for example, tobit analysis).



52. An additional implication of the analysis is that the likelihood

    of nullification of older acts will decline with increase in

     tenure. This can be tested directly by employing Nt_Nt8 as the

     dependent variable. The regression coefficients and t-values of

     TEN are .074 (2.237) for the 9th-92nd terms and .218 (2.556) for

     the 39th-92nd terms, which is contrary to our expectation. Note
                                                                  17.



52 continued
    that our definition of holder" acts (nine years or older) is
    arbitrary. Nevertheless, sinilar results are observed if
    13 years is the cut-off point for older acts.


53. The regression coefficients and Ct-values) of AGE and TEN
    when the other is excluded from equations 2.4-2.6   are as follows:
                           AGE              TEN

               N8          .180             .235
                         (2.910)          (2.527)

               N16         .234             .398
                         (3.263)          (3.890)

               N           .285             .461
                         (3.788           (4.275)

    We observed that AGE was insignificant in equations 2.4-2.6 when

    TEN was also entered but here the t-value on AGE always exceeds

    2.91 when TEN is excluded. TEN, which was insignificant in 2.4

    when AGE was entered, is also highly significant in the above

    table. The effects of deleting either AGE or TEN in equations

    2.1-2.3 are less dramatic because the correlation coefficient

    between the two variables drops to .41 on   the full set of
    observations (lst-92nd Congressional terms). Nevertheless,
    TEN becomes significant in the N16 and N 'egressions when AGE

     is deleted.




                                                                          .
                                                                 18.




54. The following example illustrates how the data for each

    observation are constructed. During the term of the 57th

    Congress (1901-1902) one act was nullified (1901). The act

    was 3 years old and there were 4 dissenting votes on the

     Court. Hence LAG equals 3 and DIS equals 4. The values of

     AGE, TEN, PAR, and N of this observation are their values

     at the end of the 57th Congress. Note that if more than one

     act is nullified during a given Congressional term, then each

     of 4these acts is a separate observation in the regression.

     The LAG and DIS values would be act specific while the values

     assigned to the remaining variables, which are Congress

     specific, would be identical.



55. The t and'N results, however, do not appear very robust. Ten

     acts were pullified during the term of the 74th Congress (1935-

     1936) and the average age of each act was 2.3 years. This

     compares to an average age of 10.8 years for the other 85 acts

     nullified. If we add a dumy variable to equation 2.7 (which

     takes the value 1 if the observation is from the 74th Congress

     and 0 otherwise), then both t and N become insignificant though

     their signs are unchanged.

                                                  equations 2.1 - 2.6 we would not reject the null hypothesis
    at the .95 confidence level that the error terms are
                                                         serially independent. The null hypothesis, however
    is accepted only in equations 2.1, 2.4 and 2.5.
