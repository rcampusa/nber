                                              ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether the religious identity of state legislators in India influences development
outcomes, both for citizens of their religious group and for the population as a whole. To allow for
politician identity to be correlated with constituency level voter preferences or characteristics that
make religion salient, we use quasi-random variation in legislator identity generated by close elections
between Muslim and non-Muslim candidates. We find that increasing the political representation of
Muslims improves health and education outcomes in the district from which the legislator is elected.
We find no evidence of religious favoritism: Muslim children do not benefit more from Muslim political
representation than children from other religious groups.

1.      Introduction
        In first past the post electoral systems where the “winner takes all”, minority social groups
may be disadvantaged by policy choices made by democratically elected leaders. It is therefore
pertinent to consider whether increasing the political representation of minority groups improves
their outcomes. Theoretical models of democracy admit this possibility (Osborne and Slivinski 1996,
Besley and Coate 1997) and quotas for minority groups are motivated by the assumption that it does
but, as we discuss below, the evidence is still scarce.1 We examine this question by looking at the
impact of Muslim representation in India’s state legislatures on development outcomes for Muslims
relative to others. This study is of topical relevance given the increasing politicization of religion in
India and the frequency of Hindu-Muslim violence.
        Muslims are, on many fronts, as disadvantaged a minority group in India as the lower caste
population. Yet while political quotas for the lower castes have been in place since the writing of the
Indian constitution, there are no quotas for Muslims and no systematic data on their political
representation. We create representative nationwide data on Muslim political participation, inferring
religion from name. These data show that Muslims are under-represented in state government
relative to their population share. To identify causal impacts of politician identity when electoral
outcomes may in general be correlated with constituency level voter preferences or events that make
religion salient, we exploit close elections between Muslim and non-Muslim (primarily Hindu)
politicians. This allows us to examine the effects of politician identity while holding voter identity
constant. We isolate the policy consequences of the religion of legislators from their political party
affiliation by controlling for party affiliation.
        We find that raising the share of Muslims elected from a district to the state legislature leads
to improved health and education outcomes in the district. An increase in Muslim representation by
1 percentage point results in a statistically significant decline in infant mortality of 0.148 percentage
points on average, which is 1.8% of the sample mean, and a more imprecisely determined increase
of 0.09 years of primary schooling, which is approximately 2.5% of the sample mean. So as to put a
1 percentage point change in perspective, note that the mean of Muslim legislator share at the
district level is 6.4% and the mean of Muslim population share is 12.9%.2 Our estimates therefore


1 Quotas introduce distortions, for instance by lowering candidate quality, so the impact of quotas will in

general not be the same as the impact of competitively determined representation. However, evidence of the
impact of minority groups in government in the absence of quotas is relevant to motivating quotas.
2 The median district in the sample has nine seats so, on average, less than one in nine seats is held by a

Muslim. There is considerable geographic variation in the number of seats (constituencies) per district, the

                                                     2
imply that Muslim representation proportional to population share will have large beneficial impacts
on child development outcomes.
        Importantly, we find no significant difference in the impact of Muslim political
representation on Muslim compared with non-Muslim households. Indeed, the estimated
coefficients indicate smaller beneficial impacts for Muslim children. There is thus no evidence of
religious favoritism. The fact that our estimates for health and education use different data sources
and a different set of cohorts but line up on both results adds credence to the findings.
        Our findings contribute to a recent literature on the relationship between religion and
development. While cross-country comparisons indicate that religious beliefs are a significant
determinant of economic growth, and that Muslim countries have lower growth rates controlling for
their religiosity (Barro and McCleary 2006), two recent studies show that Islamist parties perform
better than non-Islamist parties. Meyersson (2013) shows that women’s education improves in
municipalities led by Islamist as opposed to secular parties in Turkey, and Henderson and Kuncoro
(2011) find that Islamist parties commit less corruption in Indonesia than other parties.3 An
important difference between our approach and that of prior studies is that we focus on the
personal religious identity of legislators and control for the religious composition of the population
and the party affiliation of legislators.
        This paper also contributes to the literature on politician identity. If parties could fully
control the behaviour of elected candidates, candidate identity would be irrelevant to the policy
process but the evidence tends to reject this tenet. The evidence so far pertains to the relevance of
the ethnicity and gender of politicians, and we provide the first evidence for religion. A number of
studies show that raising the share of women in government influences policy choices, with a
tendency for policy choices to more closely reflect the interests of women (Chattopadhyay and
Duflo 2004, Washington 2008, Clots-Figueras 2011, Clots-Figueras 2012, Bhalotra and Clots-
Figueras 2013, Brollo and Troiano 2012, Iyer et. al. 2012). However women are not a numerical
minority. This makes it easier to associate the impact of politician gender with preferences, while the
behaviour of politicians from minority groups may in addition reflect strategic electoral
considerations. The results on ethnic identity of politicians are more ambiguous. Using data from
Kenya, Burgess et al. (2011) find that politicians (cabinet members) allocate road building efforts in

share of Muslim legislators and Muslim population share. The figures presented here are for the estimation
sample and exclude the only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.
3 In work in progress we investigate whether Muslim political representation exacerbates or narrows gender

differentials in education and survival (Bhalotra, Cassan, Clots-Figueras and Iyer 2013).

                                                    3
favour of their own ethnic group but this ethnic favoritism dissipates upon the transition to
democracy. In this way, their results are consistent with our findings from (democratic) India. Pande
(2003) finds that political quotas for low caste populations in India’s state assemblies are associated
with increased transfers to their group alongside reduced overall spending and reduced spending on
education.4 These results contrast with ours, possibly because quotas depress any incentive for the
low caste (Hindu) population to serve the interests of other social groups. Kramon and Posner
(2012) find that co-ethnics of the President and the Minister of Education in Kenya see an increase
in education but not in health. Similarly, Kudamatsu (2009) is unable to identify any impact of the
ethnic identity of the President of Guinea on ethnic differences in infant mortality. Again, our
results contrast with these studies because we find similar effects on both health and education
outcomes.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the political setting in India,
the political status of Muslims and their relative status on human development indicators. Sections 3
and 4 describe the data and the empirical strategy. Section 5 presents and discusses the results and
Section 6 concludes.


2.      Religion, Politics and Development in India
        India is a country of considerable religious diversity and the constitution enshrines
secularism. Muslims, constituting 13.4% of the population in the 2001 census, form the single largest
religious minority in India. With 138 million Muslims in 2001, India had the third largest Muslim
population in the world. Muslims in India are more likely to live in urban areas (36% compared to
28%), and their population share varies substantially across the states and within states across
districts. They are, on average, poorer than Hindus: 31% of Muslims were below the poverty line in
2004-05, much higher than the figure of 21% for upper-caste Hindus and comparable to the figure
of 35% for lower castes (Government of India 2006). Yet, while India has political quotas for low
caste representation in state assemblies and local governments, there are no quotas for Muslims.5
Using newly coded data, described below, we find that Muslims comprised only 9% of the members
of state assemblies over the period 1977-1998, substantially lower than their population share.



4 Similarly, Besley, Pande and Rao (2012) find evidence from Indian villages that sharing the village head’s
group identity is beneficial for access to public goods but only for low spillover public goods.
5 See Jensenius (2013) for a discussion of the historical reasons underlying the lack of electoral quotas for

Muslims.

                                                     4
      India is a federal country in which the constitution grants substantial policy autonomy to the 28
states. Elections to state legislatures are held every five years on a first-past-the-post basis in single-
member constituencies. There are very few “Muslim-only” parties, but some parties appeal more to
Muslims than others. Indian states largely determine their own health and education budgets,
although they receive supplementary funds from federal programs.
      Overall health and education outcomes are poor in India, largely a function of weak provision of
public services in these sectors. In our household survey data from 1977-1998, 22% of respondents
were illiterate and 8.2% of children did not survive beyond the first year of life (Table 1). Consistent
with their greater poverty rates, Muslims lagged behind on education outcomes, with 27% of
Muslims being recorded as illiterate compared to 21% of non-Muslims. Yet, Muslim children exhibit
a substantial survival advantage (infant mortality rates of 6.86% compared to 8.42% for non-
Muslims), a bit of a puzzle given that Muslims are, on average, less educated, poorer and have larger
families (Bhalotra, Valente and van Soest 2010). Muslim households also faced discrimination in
obtaining government loans and pensions (Government of India 2006), and in access to
infrastructure, health and transport facilities (Das, Kar and Kayal 2011). Violence between Hindus
and Muslims occurs frequently and there is some evidence that an increase in Muslim incomes
relative to Hindu incomes often triggers such violence (Mitra and Ray 2013).


3.       Data
3.1      The Religious Identity of Candidates for State Legislative Assemblies
         We construct a unique data base on the religious identity of candidates for state legislators.
We obtained data on state legislative elections from the Election Commission of India that contain
information on the name, party affiliation and votes obtained by every candidate in every state
election held in India since Independence. We infer religious identity from candidate names. To
minimize measurement error, we had two independent teams conduct the classification of legislator
names. The first used software called Nam Pehchan (which translates as Name Recognition) which was
able to classify about 72% of the names, and it manually classified the rest. The second (India-based)
team performed the entire classification manually using their judgment gained from prior work with
Election Commission files. The two teams agreed on more than 95% of the names, and
disagreements between the two teams’ classification were resolved by the authors on a case-by-case
basis. In the final dataset, we remained doubtful of the religious identity of less than 0.5% of names
and these were assigned a “non-Muslim” classification.

                                                    5
        The political data are available at the candidate and constituency level, but in the surveys that
record individual level health and educational outcomes we can only identify the district, not the
constituency, in which they live. We therefore aggregate the political data to the district level using
administrative district boundaries as of 1991. The number of electoral constituencies per
administrative district varies, but the median district has 9 constituencies and 95% of districts have
17 or fewer constituencies. We use data from the 16 largest states in India (excluding Jammu and
Kashmir), during the period 1977-1998. The rationale for starting the analysis in 1977 and not earlier
is twofold. First, during this period, state constituency boundaries remained fixed while before 1977
the number of constituencies increased over time due to periodic redistricting. This could affect our
identification strategy because the fraction of Muslim legislators in a district could depend on factors
other than whether they won elections, such as population changes or religion-biased redistricting.
Second, the set of political parties was very different in the 1960s and 1970s, in particular, the Hindu
nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), did not exist before 1980. In any case, we show
that our results are robust to extending the data back in time to include cohorts from 1961 onwards.
The availability of health and educational data with clear district identifiers limits us from extending
the analysis beyond 1998. The only Muslim-majority state of Jammu & Kashmir is excluded from
our main regression specification, but we show that our results are robust to its inclusion. District
means of the electoral variables are in Table 1, Panel C. In the estimation sample excluding Jammu
and Kashmir, 6.4% of legislators were coded as Muslim, and 64% of district-year observations had
no Muslim legislators.


3.2     Health Indicators
        Health indicators at the mother and child level are drawn from the National Family Health
Survey of India (NFHS), a nationally representative survey conducted in 1998-1999. Mothers aged
15-49 years at the time of the survey are asked to record their birth histories and any child deaths.
This allows us to construct individual level childhood mortality risk indicators that vary over time
and can be matched to changes in Muslim representation over time. We focus on neonatal and
infant mortality, defined as dummies for whether the child died in the first month and the first year
of life respectively. Infant mortality is widely used as an indicator of population health. Since infant
and neonatal mortality respond primarily to policies effective in the year before birth, we match
these individual outcomes to the share of Muslim politicians in the year before birth in the district of
birth. Since the data record district of residence rather than district of birth, we restrict the sample to

                                                    6
children who were conceived in their current location.6 The neonatal mortality in the sample is 5.3%,
the infant mortality rate is 8.2% and 14% of births in the sample take place in a Muslim household
(Table 1, Panel A).


3.3     Education Indicators
        These data are drawn from the 55th round of the nationally representative National Sample
Survey (NSS), collected during 1999-2000. We restrict attention to individuals aged 14 and older, to
be sure that they are old enough to have completed primary education, and the oldest individual in
the education sample is 26. We create two dependent variables to indicate whether the individual is
illiterate and the number of years of primary education completed. The data contain information on
whether the individual has completed primary or has dropped out before finishing primary
education. As in Hnatkovska et al (2012), we create the “years of primary education” variable by
assigning the value 0 to illiterate individuals, 2 to those who started but did not complete primary
education, and 5 to those who completed primary.7 On average, 22% of individuals in the sample are
illiterate and average years of primary education are 3.67.
        Only politicians in power before the child completed primary education can affect the
likelihood of completing it. Since individuals vary in the age at which they start school, we matched
individuals to legislator identity in the three years leading up to their primary school participation.
We investigate this and implement a placebo using timing. Although cross-district migration in India
is small, we drop from the sample individuals who migrated from another district after they were six
years old as they will have studied in districts in which other politicians were in power.


4.      Empirical Strategy
To investigate the effect of the religious identity of politicians on health and educational outcomes,
we would like to estimate the parameters of the relationship:


        Yidst= a +b Mdst +eidst


6 Approximately 16% of the survey respondents moved to their current area of residence after the child was
conceived.
7 Given the timing of elections (post-1980) and the duration of secondary education, we do not have enough

cohorts in the 1999 survey to examine secondary education. We focus therefore upon primary education
which, for the cohorts in the sample, is far from universal, see Table 1.


                                                    7
where Yidst is the health or education outcome for individual i born in district d in state s in year t,
and Mdst is the fraction of constituencies in the district held by Muslim politicians in the year before
birth for survival outcomes and in the three years before the individual turned six for the education
outcomes. The identification challenge is to estimate a causal relationship by separating this from
any effects of omitted variables that may drive health/education and religious political
representation.
        We address this challenge by using close elections between non-Muslim and Muslim
candidates, that is, elections in which the difference in votes between the winner and the runner-up
(the vote margin) is small. The outcome of elections in which the vote difference between the two
candidates is small is regarded as quasi-random because the vote margin that determines the winner
will tend to be determined by chance elements, such as marginal changes in turnout associated for
instance with the weather on the day the election take place. This ensures that Muslim candidates
who barely win an election against non-Muslims do so in constituencies where there is no clear
underlying preference for Muslim politicians since the non-Muslim politician is just as likely to have
won. On this basis we instrument the fraction of all seats in a district won by Muslim politicians with
the fraction of seats in the district won by Muslim politicians in a close election against a non-
Muslim politician. We define close elections as elections in which the winner won by a margin of
less than 2% of votes, and we investigate robustness of the results to using a 3% margin instead.
        Even if the outcome of close elections can be considered essentially random, the existence
of close elections between Muslims and non-Muslims in a given district and year is unlikely to be
random, and is likely to be depend upon the share of Muslims in the population, their relative status
and the extent to which religion is politicized in the region. We therefore control for the fraction of
seats in the district that were contested in close elections between Muslim and non-Muslim
candidates. This also controls for any direct effects of having close elections, such as greater political
mobilization by parties or greater salience generated by the “excitement” of a close contest.
        At the constituency level, close elections can be exploited to implement a regression
discontinuity design. Since the share of Muslim legislators is defined at the district level (in order to
match the electoral data to health and education outcomes), we effectively aggregate over the
constituency-specific discontinuities in treatment assignment within district, in the spirit of a fuzzy
regression discontinuity. The estimated equations control for a polynomial in the victory margin
(positive or negative) in every election between a Muslim and a non-Muslim candidate in the district.

                                                    8
The model is estimated using two-stage least squares. Here, equation (1) is the second stage and
equation (2) is the first stage:


(1)         Yidst= θds+ ψt+ πst +β Mdst+λTCdst+ΣNj=1 α1j Ijdst*G(mjdst)+ ΣNj=1 α2j Ijdst +Xidst η + εidst


(2)       Mdst = θds+ ψt+ πst +κ MCdst+μTCdst+ ΣNj=1ϑ1j Ijdst*G(mjdst)+ ΣNj=1 ϑ2j Ijdst +Xidst σ + uidt


        The fraction of constituencies in the district that were won by Muslim politicians in a given
election year, Mdst, is instrumented with the fraction of constituencies in the district won by Muslims
in close elections against non-Muslim in the same year, MCdst. The fraction of constituencies in the
district in which there were close elections between Muslims and non-Muslims, TCdst, is controlled
for in equation (1) and partialled out of the instrument in equation (2). The margin of victory or
defeat of every Muslim candidate who contested against a non-Muslim in election j in the district is
denoted mjdst. We use third order polynomials in these margins, denoted G(mjdst). The polynomials are
interacted with Ijdst, which is an indicator for whether there was an inter-religious election in the
district. To allow observations in a district to be correlated across families in the district and across
time, the standard errors are clustered at the district level.
        Our baseline specification uses district fixed effects θds which account for sluggish
demographic characteristics (including the share of the district population that is Muslim), the slowly
moving component of the public goods infrastructure and time-invariant voter preferences. Cohort
fixed effects ψt afford a flexible representation of aggregate shocks or nationwide policies that
through changes in income or in religious identification, for instance, may have influenced both
public services and the religion mix of politicians. We also include state*cohort dummies, πst, which
account for relevant state-level and election-specific shocks or policies. Xidst is a vector of individual-
level control variables including dummies for individual religion, gender, rural vs urban residence
and whether the individual belongs to a scheduled caste or tribe (which we loosely refer to as “low
caste”) or to the “Other Backward Castes”. Given that Muslim winners in close elections are more
likely to belong to the Indian National Congress (INC) party than non-Muslim winners and less
likely to belong to the BJP party (Table A4), we control for the fraction of seats in the district won
by INC and the BJP.
        Regression discontinuity has been previously used in the context of elections by Lee (2002)
who studies incumbency advantage, by Pettersson-Lidbom (2008) who looks at the effect of party

                                                         9
control on fiscal policies and by Lee, Moretti and Butler (2004) who estimate the effect of the degree
of electoral strength on legislators' voting behavior. Our approach of using an IV strategy
approximating a fuzzy regression discontinuity has antecedents in the work of Angrist and Lavy
(1999) who estimated the effect of class size on educational achievements and the work of Rehavi
(2007), Clots-Figueras (2011 and 2012) and Bhalotra and Clots-Figueras (2013), who estimate related
specifications to investigate the policy impact of the gender of elected politicians.
         To investigate whether Muslims in particular gain from a rise in the share of Muslim
politicians, we interact Mdst (Muslim legislator share) with an indicator for whether the individual
child is Muslim. To implement the IV procedure, we also interact the instrument with the Muslim
dummy. The second stage regression is then:


(3)      Yidst= θds+ ψt+ πst +β Mdst+γ Mdst*muslimidst +ξ muslimidst +λTCdst+ΣNj=1 α1j Ijdst*G(mjdst)+ ΣNj=1 α2j Ijdst
+Xidst η + εidst


The coefficient γ indicates the differential between Muslim and non-Muslim children while the
coefficient β captures the effect for non-Muslims.


5. Muslim Political Representation and Development Outcomes
5.1 Validity of the Instrumental Variable Strategy
      The share of Muslims winning close elections against non-Muslims is a strong and significant
predictor of the overall fraction of Muslim legislators in a district (Table A2). The F-statistics from
the first stage regressions shown in Table A2 are large for regressions run at the individual and
district levels, so we can rule out a weak instruments problem (the district results are available upon
request). Figure 1 provides a graphical illustration of the first stage. It plots the overall fraction of
Muslim legislators against the average vote margin across districts. The victory margin is defined as
the difference in vote share between Muslim and non-Muslim candidates, so that margin>0 denotes
a Muslim electoral victory and margin<0 denotes a non-Muslim victory. We show that, at the zero
margin, there is a dramatic jump in the district share of Muslim legislators. In other words, if a
Muslim wins a close election, the overall fraction of Muslim legislators rises significantly.
      As discussed earlier, our instrumental variables strategy is based on the assumption that the
results of close elections are quasi-random. A potential violation of this assumption would arise if
there were vote manipulation that biased the outcome of a close election. To check against this

                                                         10
possibility, we verify that the distribution of the vote margin is continuous around the
neighbourhood of zero, the threshold which separates Muslim victory from non-Muslim victory
(Figure 2a). We tested this formally by estimating the difference in the densities on either side of the
zero point (McCrary 2008). The estimated difference is -0.065, which is statistically insignificant
(Figure 2b).
    Another possible threat to our identification strategy arises if Muslim legislators who win in
close elections against non-Muslims are significantly different from non-Muslims along dimensions
other than religion because we might then mistakenly attribute the effects of other characteristics to
religious identity. We therefore examine available characteristics of Muslim and non-Muslim winners
in close elections (Table A4). Muslim winners are significantly less likely to belong to the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP), the party espousing a pro-Hindu ideology, and more likely to belong to the
Indian National Congress (INC). Since we want to capture the effects of religious identity rather
than party ideology, we control for the overall fraction of BJP and INC legislators in the district.
Membership of other parties (Left parties, other regional parties, independents) is not significantly
different by candidate religion. Muslim legislators are less likely to be female than non-Muslim
legislators (2% compared to 5.4%), but the difference is not statistically significant. We also verify
that election characteristics, such as the total number of candidates and the total number of voters,
do not differ significantly across places where Muslims win vs lose close elections against non-
Muslims.


5.2 Estimating the Impact of Muslim Legislators on Development Outcomes
    We find that raising the share of Muslim legislators in the district leads to a large and statistically
significant decline in infant and neonatal mortality rates. Table 2 shows the results of estimating
equation (1), with increasing number of controls (columns 1-3, 4-6). In the preferred specification
(column 3), which includes third degree polynomials in constituency vote margins and controls for
party composition, we estimate that increasing the share of Muslim legislators by 1 percentage point
results in a decline in infant mortality of 0.148 percentage points, which is roughly 1.8% of the mean
rate.8 The corresponding decline in the neo-natal mortality rate is 0.11 percentage points, nearly



8 There are 9 legislators in the median district and the mean share of Muslim legislators in the sample is 6.4%
(s.d. 13%). To put the 1% point changes in perspective note that increasing the share of Muslim legislators by
10% points is roughly equivalent to adding one Muslim legislator to the median district, and not dissimilar to
an increase of one standard deviation.

                                                      11
2.1% of the mean. These estimates suggest substantial “economic” returns to improving the political
representation of minority religious groups.
    Our second major finding is that these gains in child mortality are concentrated among non-
Muslim households. The reduction in infant mortality associated with a 1% point increase in Muslim
representation is 1.16 percentage points among Muslim families compared to 1.58 percentage points
among non-Muslims (column 4), but the difference between the two groups is statistically
insignificant. The corresponding values for neo-natal mortality are 0.55% for Muslims and 1.27% for
non-Muslims (column 8). There is thus no evidence that Muslim legislators are targeting public
services towards Muslim families.
    A potential explanation of this result is that Muslims have stronger preferences over child health
(see Bhalotra, Valente and Van Soest 2010) so they prioritise it and the apparently large benefits
accruing to non-Muslims represent a process of convergence, since the baseline child survival rates
of Muslims are higher. However, we find a similar pattern of results when we examine education
outcomes, in which Muslims lag behind non-Muslims (Table 1). Muslim political representation
results in a decline in the share of the population which is illiterate and an increase in years of
primary school education (Table 3). While the average coefficients are imprecisely estimated, we find
significant effects once we allow heterogeneity by religion. Among non-Muslims, the illiteracy rate
declines by 0.25 percentage points for a 1 percentage point increase in Muslim political
representation (column 4) and years of primary education increase by 0.01 years (column 8). The
corresponding effects of Muslim political representation on the educational attainment of Muslims
are smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero.
    Taken together, the health and education results show a consistent pattern whereby raising the
share of Muslims in India’s state assemblies improves developmental outcomes for children, with no
evidence of differential benefits flowing to Muslim children.


5.3 Robustness Checks
    The results reported above stand up to a number of specification checks, presented in Tables 4
(health) and 5 (education). The estimates are robust to expanding the definition of close elections to
include elections with a vote margin of up to 3% (column 1). Narrowing to a vote margin of 1% or
less results in similar sized coefficients but we lose precision and the estimates are no longer
statistically significant (column 2). The estimates are similar if we control for state-specific trends
instead of state*year fixed effects (column 3). The coefficients are also stable in a specification that

                                                   12
controls for district-specific trends. The relevant variation is at the district level, but this is a much
more demanding specification and the standard errors increase, making the overall coefficient
statistically insignificant (column 4). Including the Muslim-majority state of Jammu & Kashmir raises
the estimated main effect (column 5). This limits the weight of mechanisms that rest upon Muslims
being a minority population group. Extending the sample back to include cohorts from 1961
onwards (column 6) also increases the estimated positive impact of Muslim legislators which is
interesting since the politicization of religion was greater in the 1980s and the 1990s. To allow for
the possibility that one year may be too soon for a legislator to be effective in changing health
outcomes, we replace the presence of a Muslim legislator in the year prior to birth with a variable
measuring the average share of Muslim legislators in the three years prior to the birth of the
individual child. The coefficient is similar to that in the baseline specification (column 7). In all of
these specifications, there continues to be no evidence that Muslim households benefit
disproportionately from the presence of a Muslim legislator.
    We conducted a “placebo” exercise to verify that it is indeed the presence of Muslim legislators
prior to birth which matters for child health outcomes, rather than unobserved area or household
characteristics which might be correlated with both child health outcomes and the share of Muslim
legislators. We examine whether exposure to Muslim legislators after the first year of life is correlated
with child health outcomes. As there is no plausible mechanism to support such a correlation,
evidence of it would signal mis-specification. Since legislators typically have a five year term, Muslim
representation in the year after birth is likely to be correlated with Muslim representation in the year
before birth. We therefore look at Muslim representation five years after birth, during which at least
one election would have occurred. The coefficient on Muslim legislator share is much smaller in
magnitude and this and the interaction coefficient are both statistically insignificant. The placebo
results satisfy us that omitted variables are not driving the main findings (column 8).
    The same battery of robustness checks was conducted for the education outcomes and the
results are robust to the range of checks (Table 5). The one exception is a reduction in coefficient
size when we replace the share of Muslim legislators in the 3 years prior to primary school age with
the share of Muslim legislators in the one year prior to joining school (column 7), consistent with
legislators needing to be in power longer in order to affect educational outcomes. The “placebo” for
education is specified to examine whether the presence of Muslim legislators matters for children
who are exposed after the age of completion of primary schooling (Table 5, column 8). The
estimated coefficient is much smaller and statistically insignificant.

                                                    13
6. Conclusions
    We use unique data on the religious identity of politicians, and an instrumental variables strategy
based on the discontinuity in treatment assignment in close elections to estimate the causal effect of
electing Muslims to state legislatures. We find that raising Muslim representation in India’s state
legislatures leads to large and significant improvements in child survival rates and improvements in
educational attainment. We find no evidence of religious favouritism, if at all, Muslim households
benefit less from Muslim politicians than non-Muslim households. The estimates are robust to a
number of specification checks, including different sample windows and different margins for
defining close elections, and do not appear to be driven by omitted district and time varying
unobservables.
        Why are Muslim leaders more effective than other (primarily Hindu) leaders at delivering
improvements in child health and education? One plausible explanation is that Muslims have
stronger preferences over publicly provided services essentially because they are, on average, poorer
and so more reliant upon them. However, we might then have expected to see larger gains to
Muslim households. So, the preference hypothesis needs to be combined with barriers to targeting
benefits to Muslim households in order to explain our results. Perhaps Muslims are not sufficiently
residentially segregated for targeting to be feasible, or perhaps there are political incentives for
Muslim politicians to avoid showing favor for members of their own group. Muslim leaders may act
strategically to attract votes from the non-Muslim community, who constitute the numerical
majority in most constituencies. A different possibility, consistent with Muslim leaders representing
the interests of Muslim citizens, is that they prioritise reducing Hindu-Muslim conflict, and equal
provision of public goods is a means to this end.9
