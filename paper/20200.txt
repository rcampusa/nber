Saving Europe?: The Unpleasant Arithmetic of Fiscal Austerity in Integrated Economies

                                             ABSTRACT

What are the macroeconomic effects of tax adjustments in response to large public debt shocks in
highly integrated economies? The answer from standard closed-economy models is deceptive, because
they underestimate the elasticity of capital tax revenues and ignore cross-country spillovers of tax
changes. Instead, we examine this issue using a two-country model that matches the observed elasticity
of the capital tax base by introducing endogenous capacity utilization and a partial depreciation
allowance. Tax hikes have adverse effects on macro aggregates and welfare, and trigger strong cross-
country externalities. Quantitative analysis calibrated to European data shows that unilateral capital
tax increases cannot restore fiscal solvency, because the dynamic Laffer curve peaks below the required
revenue increase. Unilateral labor tax hikes can do it, but have negative output and welfare effects
at home and raise welfare and output abroad. Large spillovers also imply that unilateral capital tax
hikes are much less costly under autarky than under free trade. Allowing for one-shot Nash tax
competition, the model predicts a "race to the bottom" in capital taxes and higher labor taxes. The
cooperative equilibrium is preferable, but capital (labor) taxes are still lower (higher) than initially.
Moreover, autarky can produce higher welfare than both Nash and Cooperative equilibria.

1     Introduction

The world’s advanced economies face a severe public debt crisis. Even before the onset of the

Great Recession in 2008, countries in the eurozone exceeded the public debt ceiling of 60 percent

of GDP, a condition set by the Maastricht Treaty. The slowing of economic activity combined with

increased transfer payments, financial system bailouts, and fiscal stimulus programs resulted in a

ballooning of public debt, as illustrated in Figure 1. In the countries at the center of the European

debt crisis (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, or GIIPS) gross public debt as a share of

GDP rose 30 percentage points between 2008-2011, to a staggering 105 percent of GDP by 2011.

The ten largest remaining eurozone members (EU10) also experienced large debt increases, albeit

not as large as in the GIIPS. Their debt levels increased by nearly 18 percentage points of GDP,

reaching a ratio of 0.79 in 2011, well in excess of the Maastricht condition. Debt ratios of this

magnitude and on such a global scale are rare, and over the previous century occurred in times of

major wars and during the Great Depression.1

    The European debt crisis changed the nature of fiscal policy discussions in Europe. Until

recently, the dominant issue in tax policy discussions was the harmonization of national tax rates

and measures to limit tax competition (Sorensen, 2001; Kellerman and Kammer, 2009).2 Once the

debt crisis started, however, the focus shifted toward the implementation of country-specific fiscal

austerity programs to address fiscal imbalances and bring the debt under control. A number of

countries, including Portugal, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Spain, and to a lesser extent France and

the Netherlands, adopted austerity packages that feature both expenditure cuts and increases in

tax rates.

    While much ink has been spilled in both the financial and academic press on the pros and cons

of austerity measures in response to the debt crisis, there has been surprisingly little discussion of
    1
      Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States have also seen their debts reach very high levels. Over the
entire history of public debt in the United States, the data constructed by Bohn (2007) show that the surge in U.S.
public debt during the Great Recession ranks below only the two World Wars, and is above the Civil War and the
Great Depression.
    2
      Since the 1970s, EU member states have worked to bring value-added taxes into alignment, to remove barriers to
capital and labor movements across borders and to form a common European trade policy. The European Commission
initiated steps to create a common playing field for corporate taxation (the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax
Base), though the policy has not yet been adopted by eurozone Member States.

the constraints imposed on fiscal policy by the fact the eurozone countries are highly integrated.

Estimates of the sustainability of public debt (Abiad and Ostry, 2005; Mendoza and Ostry, 2008),

fiscal space (Ostry, Ghosh, Habermeier, Chamon et al., 2010), and the scope for raising revenue

(Trabandt and Uhlig, 2009, 2012) tend to treat countries as isolated economic units, setting aside

the potential for significant erosion of tax bases across countries due to factor mobility, or for

spillover effects on the budgets and welfare of other member countries.3 Taking these effects into

consideration is critical because the implications of fiscal austerity for macroeconomic aggregates

and social welfare depend both on the particular fiscal policy that countries decide to follow as well

as on the degree of integration of capital and goods markets.

       This paper develops an open-economy macroeconomic framework for studying the international

dimensions of fiscal adjustment and uses it to examine the positive and normative effects of tax

policies targeted to offset shocks to public debt.4 The model captures the classic dynamic efficiency

(or supply-side) effects of distortionary taxes on factor incomes and consumption, as well as the

international externalities of domestic tax adjustments that result from cross-country mobility of

goods and assets.

       Our framework for analysis is similar to the Neoclassical model used in Mendoza and Tesar

(1998, 2005) to study the international implications of domestic tax reforms that produce dynamic

efficiency gains, and the setting proposed by Auray, Eyquem, and Gomme (2013) to study tax

policies in open economies. An important limitation of these studies, and of those based on a wider

class of quantitative Neoclassical and NeoKeynesian dynamic general equilibrium models used to

study tax policy, is that the capital tax revenue has a very low elasticity to changes in tax rates,

which runs contrary to empirical evidence (see Gruber and Rauh, 2007; Dwenger and Steiner, 2012).

As a result, these models tend to overestimate the ability of the government to raise tax revenue

in response to debt shocks.
   3
      Externalities of fiscal policy have been widely discussed in the theoretical literature on international tax compe-
tition, much of which has focused on the EU, and in broader EU policy studies on tax harmonization and capital
income tax competition (see, for example, the survey by Persson and Tabellini (1995), the books by Frenkel, Razin,
and Sadka (1991) and Turnovsky (1997), and the quantitative studies by Klein, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull (2005),
Sorensen (1999), Sorensen (2003) and Eggert (2000)).
    4
      In this paper we limit the analysis to changes in tax rates, leaving the analysis of adjustments in expenditure
policy to future work.




                                                           2
    To address this limitation, we introduce endogenous capital utilization and a limited tax al-

lowance for capital depreciation.5 The two mechanisms interact in an important way. First, en-

dogenous utilization allows agents to make short-run adjustments in the use of installed capital,

and hence capital income, in response to capital tax changes. This weakens the capacity to raise

tax revenue from capital taxes but also makes capital taxes less distorting. Second, the limited

depreciation allowance widens the base of the capital tax, and makes capital taxes more distorting

by increasing the marginal cost of capital utilization.6 The two mechanisms together result in a

dynamic Laffer curve (i.e. a mapping of the present value of the primary fiscal balance as a function

of tax rates) with a standard bell shape and a realistic elasticity of capital tax revenue. In contrast,

without these mechanisms the dynamic Laffer curve for capital taxes is monotonically increasing

for a wide range of tax rates.

    In the model, national tax policies induce cross-country externalities that are driven by three

transmission channels: (1) relative prices, because national tax changes alter the prices of financial

assets (including internationally traded assets and public debt instruments) as well as factor prices

at home and abroad; (2) the world distribution of wealth, because efficiency effects of national tax

changes affect the allocations of capital and net foreign assets across countries; and (3) the erosion

of tax revenues, because via the first two channels national tax policies affect the ability of foreign

governments to raise tax revenue.

    We conduct a quantitative analysis calibrated to eurozone data to study the positive and nor-

mative effects of alternative tax strategies that countries could follow to restore fiscal solvency in

response to debt shocks. We feed the debt shocks observed in the eurozone since 2008 into the

model and compute the short- and long-run effects on equilibrium allocations, prices and welfare

that result from responding to those shocks with capital or labor taxes, assuming first that tax

changes are undertaken unilaterally and then allowing for strategic interaction. The quantitative

results produce important insights into the potential effects of fiscal austerity options facing Europe.
   5
     Ferraro (2010) examined Ramsey optimal tax policy in a closed-economy model with endogenous capital utiliza-
tion and an optimal choice of the depreciation allowance. He found that setting the capital income tax rate and the
depreciation allowance equal is optimal.
   6
     In representative-agent models calibrated to macroeconomic aggregates, setting the allowance to less than 100
percent of depreciation is also consistent with the data, since the allowance can only be claimed on nonresidential
capital and mainly by businesses, rather than individuals.



                                                        3
    The first step in the analysis of unilateral tax adjustments is to construct dynamic Laffer

curves in an experiment calibrated to an average European country. To plot these curves, the

present discounted value of the primary fiscal balance is computed with the sequences of equilibrium

allocations and prices obtained for a set of tax rates. Since we keep government outlays constant,

these curves inherit the standard bell shape of the Laffer curves of tax revenues for distortionary

taxes. Tax adjustment can restore fiscal solvency after the debt shock only if there is a tax rate that

can produce an increase in the present discounted value of the primary fiscal balance of the same

magnitude as the debt shock.7 This is done under relatively conservative assumptions, because the

model assumes that there is no adverse impact of tax increases on long-run growth, and that debt

is priced at a risk-free rate (i.e. there is no default risk).

    Even under these highly favorable conditions, the model predicts that tax adjustments to restore

fiscal solvency in response to the observed debt shocks may not be feasible, have large negative

welfare effects, and yield large cross-country spillovers. These spillovers generate open-economy

dynamic Laffer curves that are shifted down and to the left of the closed-economy curves, and also

below closed-economy estimates of steady-state Laffer curves (e.g. Trabandt and Uhlig, 2010). For

capital tax rates, the shift is so large that its maximum lies below what is needed to restore fiscal

solvency after the debt shock. In contrast, labor tax hikes can restore fiscal solvency, but with

negative effects on home allocations and welfare, and improvements abroad.

    The large spillovers obtained with the unilateral tax adjustments indicate that strategic incen-

tives are strong. This leads us to examine Nash solutions to one-shot tax competition games in

which both regions adjust taxes strategically to offset their observed debt shocks. We first solve a

baseline scenario with symmetric countries (i.e. a common debt shock set to 22 percentage points

of GDP). The Nash game produces a race to the bottom in capital taxes from 0.20 to 0.09. Labor

taxes increase from 0.35 to 0.43. Welfare, using the standard measure of lifetime compensating

variations in consumption, declines relative to the pre-crisis equilibrium by 1.66 percent. Moreover,

in the absence of a cooperative solution or a redistribution of the debt burden (i.e. debt haircuts),

each country attains higher welfare by moving to autarky.
   7
     Hence, to conduct these experiments we solve for the equilibrium transitional dynamics and new steady state that
result from a given set of tax changes, and calculate the equilibrium present discounted value of primary balances.



                                                         4
    When the model is calibrated to reflect the asymmetries between GIIPS and the EU10, three

key findings emerge. First, Nash competition induces both regions to lower capital income taxes

and to significantly raise labor taxes relative to pre-crisis rates. Welfare declines by 1.5 percent in

GIIPS and by 1.1 percent in the EU10. Second, cooperation mitigates the cost of fiscal adjustment,

but the losses remain sizable. Third, GIIPS prefers the autarky outcome, in which international

externalities do not play a role, to even the most favorable cooperative allocation that allocates

to it all of the benefits of coordination. This finding suggests that efforts to maintain trade and

financial integration in Europe must take into account the negative externalities working through

international markets as the countries adjust to the debt crisis.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model, examines the

optimality conditions of households and firms, and defines the competitive equilibrium. Section

3 calibrates the model to eurozone data from before the 2008 crisis. Section 4 discusses the re-

sults of the quantitative analysis, starting with the implications of unilateral tax adjustments and

the construction of dynamic Laffer curves, followed by the analysis of the solutions to Nash and

Cooperative tax competition games. Section 5 provides conclusions.



2    A Two-Country Model with Cross-Country Tax Externalities

We study the fiscal adjustment in response to debt shocks using a two-country dynamic general

equilibrium model. The model shares several of the features of the widely used two-country Neo-

classical model with exogenous long-run balanced growth, except for two important differences:

endogenous capacity utilization of the installed capital stock, and a limited tax allowance for capi-

tal depreciation expenses. The model abstracts from stochastic elements, because the focus of the

analysis is on the transitional dynamics and long-run implications of fiscal adjustment, rather than

on business cycle effects.

    The world consists of two countries or regions: home (H) and foreign (F ). The countries are

perfectly integrated in goods and asset markets. The latter are modeled as one-period discount

bonds, without loss of generality given the absence of uncertainty. Each country is inhabited by an

infinitely-lived representative household. A representative firm in each country produces a single

                                                  5
tradable good using capital and labor as inputs. Physical capital and labor are immobile factors, but

trade in bonds is sufficient for inducing international spillovers of national tax policies, affecting

the global distribution of wealth, the size of the global capital stock and its distribution across

countries. In addition to this wealth reallocation mechanism, national tax policies also trigger

global externalities via relative prices and fiscal revenue spillovers.

       Following King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988), growth is driven by labor-augmenting technological

change that occurs at an exogenous rate γ. Accordingly, all variables (except labor and leisure)

are rendered stationary by dividing by the level of this technological factor.8 In addition, the

stationarity-inducing transformation of the model requires discounting utility flows at the rate

β̃ = β(1 + γ)1−σ , where β is the standard subjective discount factor of time-separable preferences,

and adjusting the laws of motion of physical and financial assets so that date-t + 1 stocks grow by

the balanced-growth factor 1 + γ.

       We present below the structure of preferences, technology and the government sector of the

home country. The same structure applies to the foreign country, and when relevant we distinguish

variables across the two countries using asterisks to identify the foreign country.


2.1      Households

The representative home-country household has standard preferences:

                           ∞
                           X
                                      t (ct (1   − lt )a )1−σ
                                 β̃                           , σ > 1, a > 0, and 0 < β̃ < 1.                  (1)
                                                 1−σ
                           t=0


The period utility function is the standard CRRA function in terms of a CES composite good made

of consumption, ct , and leisure. Since we assume a unit time endowment, leisure is defined as 1 − lt ,
                                            1
where lt is the supply of labor.            σ    is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption,

and a governs the intertemporal elasticity of labor supply for a given value of σ.

       The household takes as given government-determined proportional tax rates on consumption,

labor income and capital income, denoted τC , τL , and τK , respectively, and lump-sum government
   8
     The assumption that growth is exogenous implies that tax policies do not affect long-run economic growth. This
is in line with the empirical and quantitative findings of Mendoza, Milesi-Ferretti, and Asea (1997).



                                                                6
transfer or entitlement payments, denoted by et . The household also takes as given the rental rates

of labor wt and capital services rt , and the prices of domestic government bonds and international-

traded bonds, qtg and qt .

       The household rents out capital and labor inputs to firms and makes the investment and capacity

utilization decisions. Hence, the household rents to firms effective units of capital for production

k̃ = mk, where k is the capital stock and m the rate of utilization. We follow the standard practice

from the literature on endogenous capacity utilization (e.g. Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman,

1988) by modeling the cost of utilization as faster depreciation. The rate of depreciation of the

capital stock increases with m, according to a convex function δ(m) = χ0 mχ1 /χ1 , with χ1 > 1 and

χ0 > 0 so that 0 ≤ δ(m) ≤ 1.

       The price of capital and the price of consumer goods differ because investment incurs quadratic

adjustment costs:

                                                                                       2
                                              η       (1 + γ)kt+1 − (1 − δ(mt ))kt
                       φ(kt+1 , kt , mt ) =                                        −z        kt ,                (2)
                                              2                    kt

where the coefficient η determines the speed of adjustment of the capital stock, while z is equal to

the long-run investment-capital ratio so that at steady state the capital adjustment cost is zero.9

       The household chooses intertemporal sequences of consumption, leisure, investment inclusive

of adjustment costs x, international bonds b, domestic government bonds d, and utilization to

maximize utility in (1) subject to a sequence of period budget constraints given by:


 (1 + τc )ct + xt + (1 + γ)(qt bt+1 + qtg dt+1 ) = (1 − τL )wt lt + (1 − τK )rt mt kt + θτK δ̄kt + bt + dt + et , (3)


and the following law of motion for the capital stock:


                            xt = (1 + γ)kt+1 − (1 − δ(mt ))kt + φ(kt+1 , kt , mt ),                              (4)
   9
    It is well known that open-economy models with frictionless goods and asset markets require some form of capital
adjustment costs in order to reduce the cyclical volatility of investment to observed levels, and to capture the fact
that financial and physical assets cannot be adjusted at the same speed.




                                                             7
for t = 0, ..., ∞, given the initial conditions k0 > 0, b0 , and d0 .

       The left-hand-side of equation (3) measures household expenditures, which include purchases of

consumption goods inclusive of the indirect tax, investment inclusive of capital adjustment costs,

international bonds, and domestic government bonds. The right-hand side shows household after-

tax income. This includes net-of-tax income from labor and effective capital services rented out to

firms, a capital tax allowance for a fraction θ of depreciation costs, payments on holdings of public

and international bonds, and lump-sum entitlement payments from the government, e.

       The formulation of the depreciation allowance as θτK δ̄kt in the above budget constraint is

based on two assumptions about how the allowance is implemented in practice. First, depreciation

allowances are usually set in terms of fixed depreciation rates of the declared value of capital, instead

of the true physical depreciation rate that varies with utilization. To capture this fact, we assume

that the depreciation rate for the capital tax allowance is set in terms of a constant depreciation

rate δ̄. This differs from the actual physical depreciation rate δ(m). The second assumption is

that, in this representative-agent model, the depreciation allowance only applies to a fraction θ of

the capital stock. This reflects the fact that depreciation allowances generally apply to the capital

income of businesses, not individuals, and also do not apply to residential capital.10

       Since the focus of the analysis is on studying the effects of tax adjustments to respond to debt

shocks in countries with a high degree of openness, as is the case in the European Union, we assume

that the two regions in the model have perfectly integrated goods and asset markets. The latter

implies that international bond payments are not taxed. Also in line with other features of tax

systems in industrial countries, including European countries, capital income is taxed according

to the residence principle, but countries are allowed to tax capital income at different tax rates.

These assumptions also imply that we must assume that physical capital is owned entirely by

domestic residents, in order to support a competitive equilibrium with different capital taxes (see
  10
     The standard assumption of a 100 percent depreciation allowance has two unrealistic implications. First, it
renders m independent of the capital income tax in the long run. Second, in the short run the capital tax affects
the utilization decision margin only to the extent that it reduces the marginal benefit of utilization when traded
off against the marginal cost due to changes in the marginal cost of investment. Alternatively, we could assume
that there is a full depreciation allowance but that there are costs other than depreciation associated with capital
utilization for which there is no tax allowance. These two formulations are isomorphic, but we opted for the partial
depreciation allowance to maintain the traditional setup of capacity utilization.




                                                         8
Mendoza and Tesar, 1998; Frenkel, Razin, and Sadka, 1991). Without this assumption, cross-

country arbitrage of returns across capital and bonds at common world prices implies equalization

of pre- and post-tax returns on capital, which therefore requires identical capital income taxes

across countries. Other forms of financial-market segmentation, such as trading costs or short-

selling constraints, could be introduced for the same purpose, but would make the model less

tractable.11

       We impose a standard no-Ponzi-game condition on households. This restriction, along with the

budget constraint in (2), implies that the present value of total household expenditures equals the

present value of after-tax income plus initial asset holdings.


2.2      Firms

Since the household makes the investment and capital utilization decisions, and rents out to firms

effective capital services k̃, the representative firm’s problem reduces to a static optimization prob-

lem. Firms hire labor and effective capital services to maximize profits, given by yt − wt lt − rt k̃t ,

taking factor rental rates as given. The production function is assumed to be Cobb-Douglas:


                                             yt = F (k̃t , lt ) = k̃t1−α ltα                                      (5)


where α is labor’s share of income and 0 < α < 1. Firms behave competitively and thus choose k̃t

and lt so as to equate their marginal products with their corresponding rental rates:


                                             (1 − α)k̃t−α ltα = rt ,                                              (6)

                                                    αk̃t ltα−1 = wt .                                             (7)


Because of the linear homogeneity of the production technology, these factor demand conditions

imply the standard result that the value of output equals total factor payments: yt = wt lt + rt k̃t .
  11
    The assumptions of immobile capital and residence-based taxation could be replaced with source-based taxation
and this would result in similar saving and investment optimality conditions that would support competitive equilibria
with different capital income tax rates across countries. While actual tax codes tend to be source-based, however,
most industrial countries have bilateral tax treaties that render tax systems largely residence-based (see Frenkel,
Razin, and Sadka, 1991).

2.3   Public Sector

Fiscal policy in this economy has three components. The first component is government outlays,

and is composed of pre-determined sequences of government purchases on goods and services, gt ,

and transfer/entitlement payments to households, et , for t = 0, ..., ∞. Government purchases are

unproductive in the sense that they do not enter in household utility or the production function.

Under this assumption, it would follow trivially that the optimal response to a debt shock should

include setting gt = 0. We rule out this possibility because it is unrealistic, and also because if

the model is modified to allow government purchases to provide utility or production benefits, cuts

in these purchases would be distortionary in a way analogous to the taxes we are considering.

Hence, in the quantitative experiments we assume that gt = ḡ, where ḡ is the steady state level of

government purchases that prevailed before the debt shocks. Entitlement payments are treated in

the same way (with ē denoting the steady state level of entitlements before the debt shocks). Note,

however, that since entitlements represent a form of lump-sum transfer payments, they are always

non-distortionary in this representative agent setup. Still, they do impose on the government the

need to raise distorting tax revenue, since we do not allow for lump sum taxation, and hence again

the (trivial) optimal policy of eliminating transfer payments in response to debt shocks is ruled out.

   The second component of fiscal policy is the tax structure. This includes the set of time invariant

tax rates on consumption τC , labor income τL , capital income τK , and the depreciation allowance

limited to a fraction θ of depreciation expenses.

   The third component is government debt, dt . We assume the government is committed to repay

its debt, and thus it must satisfy the following sequence of budget constraints for t = 0, ..., ∞:


                 dt − (1 + γ)qtg dt+1 = τC ct + τL wt lt + τK (rt mt − θδ̄)kt − (gt + et ).          (8)


The right-hand-side of this equation shows the primary fiscal balance (tax revenues net of total

government outlays). This primary balance is financed with the change in debt including debt

service in the left-hand-side of the constraint.

   Since the government is committed to repay, public debt dynamics must satisfy a standard



                                                    10
no-Ponzi-game condition. This condition ensures that the present value of government revenues

net of expenditures equals the initial public debt d0 .12 This is not an innocuous assumption in the

analysis of fiscal adjustment in response to debt shocks, because it implies both that governments

are committed to repay and that sovereign debt markets are working smoothly at all times. The

findings of this paper show that even under these ideal conditions, there are large inefficiencies,

welfare effects, and cross-country externalities involved in tax adjustments to respond to debt

shocks.

       Because we calibrate the model using fiscal data in shares of GDP, it is useful to write the

intertemporal government budget constrain also in shares of GDP. Defining the primary balance

as pbt ≡ τC ct + τL wt lt + τK (rt mt − θδ̄)kt − (gt + et ), the constraint in shares of GDP is:

                                                     ∞
                                                              "t−1        #         !
                                      d0   pb0 X               Y              pbt
                                         =    +                      υi                 ,                      (9)

                                                     t=1       i=0


where υi ≡ (1 + γ)ψi qig and ψi ≡ yi+1 /yi . In this expression, the stream of future primary balances

is discounted to account for long-run growth at rate γ, transitional growth ψi as the economy

converges to the long-run, and the equilibrium price of public debt qig . Since y0 is endogenous (i.e.

it responds to debt shocks and required tax adjustments), it is useful to rewrite the above solvency

condition so that the debt ratio in the left-hand-side is an exogenous initial condition. Multiplying

both sides of the above condition times ψ0 = (y0 /y−1 ) we obtain:

                                                  ∞
                                           "        "t−1 #     !#
                                   d0        pb0 X   Y     pbt
                                      = ψ0      +       υi        .                                           (10)
                                  y−1        y0            yt
                                                       t=1       i=0


       The exogenous debt shocks that are the focus of our quantitative analysis are defined as observed

changes in d0 /y−1 (the debt ratio at the end of t − 1, since d0 is chosen on that date). Hence, the

solvency condition (10) represents a constraint that the new regimes with altered tax policy in
  12
     Note that, as explained in Mendoza and Tesar (1998), public debt in this model is Ricardian in the sense that
the equilibrium dynamics of government debt can be equivalently characterized as a sequence of lump-sum transfers
between government and households (separate from the “explicit” entitlement payments et ), with these transfers set
equal to the primary fiscal balance. We use this to simplify the numerical solution of the model. Once we have the
equilibrium sequence of debt-equivalent transfers, the implied equilibrium dynamics for public debt follows from an
initial condition calibrated to actual debt data and the government budget constraint.




                                                         11
response to a debt shock must satisfy.13 The left-hand-side is an exogenous constant taken from

the data, and the right-hand-side is the present discounted value of the primary balance-GDP ratios

(where pbt , yt and υt are equilibrium outcomes), discounted taking into account exogenous long-run

growth, endogenous transitional growth, and endogenous debt prices.

       Combining the government’s budget constraint with the household’s budget constraint and the

firm’s zero-profit condition, we obtain the economy-wide resource constraint for the home region:


                                F (mt kt , lt ) − ct − gt − xt = (1 + γ)qt bt+1 − bt .                              (11)


2.4      Competitive Equilibrium

A competitive equilibrium for this two-region economy is a sequence of prices {rt , rt∗ , qt , qtg , qtg∗ , wt ,

wt∗ } and allocations {kt+1 , kt+1

such that: (a) households in each region maximize utility subject to their corresponding budget

constraints and no-Ponzi game constraints, taking as given all fiscal policy variables as well as

pre-tax prices and factor rental rates, (b) firms maximize profits subject to the Cobb-Douglas

technology taking as given pre-tax factor rental rates, (c) the government budget constraints hold

for given tax rates and exogenous sequences of government purchases and entitlements, and (d) the

following market-clearing conditions hold in the global markets of goods and bonds:


                           ω (yt − ct − xt − gt ) + (1 − ω) (yt∗ − c∗t − x∗t − gt∗ ) = 0,                           (12)


                                                ωbt + (1 − ω)b∗t = 0,                                               (13)

where ω denotes the relative size of the two regions. This parameter will be calibrated to match

the relative output shares of the two regions before the debt shocks occur.

2.5   Optimality Conditions, Tax Distortions and International Externalities

The optimality conditions of the household and firm problems provide useful intuition for charac-

terizing the model’s tax distortions and their international externalities. Consider first the Euler

equations for capital (excluding adjustment costs for simplicity), international bonds and domestic

government bonds. These conditions imply that the following arbitrage conditions hold:

   (1 + γ)u1 (ct , 1 − lt )                                                                 1    1

    β̃u1 (ct+1 , 1 − lt+1 )                                                                 qt  qt

                             = (1 − τ   )F1 (m    k     , l    )m     + 1 − δ(m     ) + τ   θ δ̄ =    =      . (15)
   β̃u1 (c∗t+1 , 1 − lt+1
                      ∗ )            K        t+1   t+1    t+1    t+1           t+1      K
                                                                                                   qt   qtg∗

The assumption that the regions are fully integrated in financial markets implies that the house-

holds’ intertemporal marginal rates of substitution in consumption are equalized across regions,

and are also equal to the rate of return on international bonds. Since physical capital is not mobile

and capital income taxes are residence based, households in each region face their own region’s dis-

tortionary tax on capital income. As a result, arbitrage equalizes the after-tax returns on capital

across regions, but pre-tax returns differ. Hence, the capital stock and output differ across regions

due to differences in capital taxation. Arbitrage in asset markets also implies that the price of

external bonds and domestic public bonds are equalized. Hence, at equilibrium: qt = qtg = qtg∗ .

   As shown in Mendoza and Tesar (1995), unilateral changes in the capital income tax result in

a permanent reallocation of physical capital, and ultimately a permanent shift in wealth, from the

high-tax to the low-tax region. Thus, even though physical capital is not mobile across countries

directly, perfect mobility of financial capital and arbitrage of asset returns induces international

mobility of physical capital. In the stationary state with balanced growth, however, the global

interest rate R (the inverse of the bond price, R ≡ 1/q) is a function of β, γ and σ:

                                                      (1 + γ)σ
                                                R=             ,                                              (16)
                                                         β

and thus is independent of tax rates. The interest rate does change along the transition path and

alters the paths of consumption, output and international asset holdings. In particular, in the tax


                                                       13
competition games we study later, each country has an incentive to behave strategically by tilting

the path of the world interest rate in its favor to attract more capital. When both countries attempt

such a strategy, the outcome is lower capital taxes but also lower welfare for both (which is the

standard race-to-the-bottom result of the tax competition literature).

   Consider next the optimality condition for labor supply. This condition reflects the standard

distortionary effects of labor and consumption taxes:

                                   u2 (ct , 1 − lt )   1 − τL
                                                     =        F2 (kt , lt )                     (17)
                                   u1 (ct , 1 − lt )   1 + τC

   Taxes on labor and consumption together drive a wedge (1 − τW ) ≡ (1 − τL )/(1 + τC ) between

the leisure-consumption marginal rate of substitution and the pre-tax real wage (which is equal to

the marginal product of labor). Since government purchases are kept constant and the consumption

tax is constant over time and known with certainty, consumption taxation does not distort saving

plans, and hence labor and consumption taxes are equivalent: Any (τC , τL ) pair consistent with

the same τW yields identical allocations, prices and welfare. Since European consumption tax

harmonization agreements limit the scope of national adjustments in consumption taxes, however,

we assume that any adjustments to τW implemented to respond to a debt shock reflect changes in

τL , with τC constant at its pre-debt-shock rate.

   The distortions of capital, labor and consumption taxes discussed in the previous paragraphs

are standard in a wide class of Neoclassical and New Keynesian DSGE models. These models,

however, generally underestimate the elasticities of both investment and capital income tax revenues

to changes in capital taxes, because the capital stock is pre-determined at the beginning of each

period, and changes gradually as it converges to its balanced-growth steady state. In contrast,

in this model the government’s ability to tax capital income is significantly hampered because

capital income taxes not only drive a wedge between intertemporal marginal rates of substitution

in consumption and rates of return on capital, they also distort capacity utilization decisions. In

particular, the optimal choice for capacity utilization implies:

                                                         1 + Φt 0
                                    F1 (mt kt , lt ) =          δ (mt ),                        (18)
                                                         1 − τK

                                               
                   (1+γ)kt+1 −(1−δ(mt ))kt
where Φt = η                 kt              − z is the marginal adjustment cost of investment. The cap-

ital tax creates a wedge between the marginal benefit of utilization on the left-hand-side of this

condition, which is the after-tax marginal product of effective capital already installed, and the

marginal cost of utilization on the right-hand-side, which is the marginal change in the rate of

depreciation caused by changes in utilization.

   It follows from the above expression that an increase in τk , everything else constant, reduces

the utilization rate. This follows from the concavity of the production function and the fact that

δ(mt ) is increasing and convex. Intuitively, a higher capital tax reduces the after-tax marginal

benefit of utilization, and thus reduces the rate of utilization. Note also that the magnitude of this

distortion depends on whether the capital stock is above, below or at its balanced-growth steady

state. This is because the sign of Φt depends on Tobin’s Q, which is given by Qt = 1 + Φt . If Qt

is greater than 1 (Φt > 0), the desired investment rate is higher than the steady-state investment

rate. In this case, Qt > 1 increases the marginal cost of utilization (because higher utilization

means faster depreciation, which makes it harder to attain the higher target capital stock). The

opposite happens when Q is less than 1 (Φt < 0). In this case, the faster depreciation at higher

utilization rates makes it easier to run down the capital stock to reach its lower target level. Thus,

an increase in τk induces a larger decline in the utilization rate when the desired investment rate

is higher than its long-run target (i.e. Φt > 0).

   The interaction of endogenous utilization and the limited depreciation allowance plays an im-

portant role in our analysis. Endogenous utilization means that the government cannot treat the

existing (pre-determined) capital stock as an inelastic source of taxation at any given date, because

effective capital services rented for production decline with the capital tax even when the capital

stock is already installed. This weakens the revenue-generating capacity of capital taxation, but it

also makes capital taxes less distorting, since it gives agent’s an additional margin of adjustment

in response to capital tax hikes. On the other hand, the limited depreciation allowance widens

the base of the capital tax, but it also strengthens the distortionary effect of τk by reducing the

post-tax marginal return on capital (see eq. 14). We will show in the quantitative section that

the two mechanisms together result in a dynamic Laffer curve with the familiar bell shape and


                                                        15
consistent with empirical estimates of the capital tax base elasticity, while removing them results

in a Laffer curve that is nearly linearly increasing for a wide range of capital taxes.

    The cross-country externalities that result from the tax distortions discussed in this subsection

can be summarized as resulting from three distinct transmission channels. First, relative prices,

because national tax changes alter the prices of financial assets (including internationally traded

assets and public debt instruments) as well as the rental prices of effective capital units and labor

in both regions. Second, the distribution of wealth across the regions, because efficiency effects

of tax changes by one region affect the allocations of capital and net foreign assets across regions

(even when physical capital is not directly mobile). Third, the erosion of tax revenues, because via

the first two channels the tax policies of one region affect the ability of the other region to raise tax

revenue. When one region responds to a debt shock by altering its tax rates, it generates external

effects that can harm or benefit the other region via these three channels.



3     Calibration and Pre-Crisis Initial Conditions

This section reviews macroeconomic data to characterize the pre-debt-crisis initial conditions and

discusses the calibration of the model. We use data from the 15 largest countries in the eurozone

(Cyprus and Malta are excluded). In the baseline calibration, we consider fully symmetric regions

calibrated to eurozone-wide aggregates, and we also construct an asymmetric scenario in which we

introduce region heterogeneity in the parameters in which it is empirically significant (public debt

ratios, fiscal policy parameters, trade balances and relative economic size).


3.1   Pre-crisis Initial Conditions in the eurozone

Table 1 shows key statistics for aggregate expenditures and fiscal variables as shares of GDP for

eleven eurozone countries. The last three columns show GDP-weighted averages for the GIIPS

region (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain), the EU10 region (the remaining countries), and

the full 15-country sample, denoted “All EU.” The All EU values will be used as targets for the

baseline calibration, and the GIIPS and EU10 values will be used for the asymmetric calibration.

The GIIPS GDP was about half the size of the EU10 GDP in 2008, so the GIIPS share is about

                                                   16
one-third of the two regions’ aggregate output.

       The first three rows of Table 1 show estimates of effective tax rates on consumption, labor

and capital calculated from revenue and national income accounts statistics using the methodology

introduced by Mendoza, Razin, and Tesar (1994) (MRT). These tax rates have been widely used

in a number of studies including Carey and Tchilinguirian (2000), Sorensen (2001) and recently by

Trabandt and Uhlig (2009, 2012). The MRT methodology uses the wedge between reported pre-tax

and post-tax macro estimates of consumption, labor income and capital income to estimate the

effective tax rate levied on each of the three tax bases. This methodology has two main advantages.

First, it provides a fairly simple approach to estimating effective tax rates at the macro level using

readily available data, despite the complexity of the various credits and deductions of national tax

codes. Second, these tax rates correspond directly to the tax rates in a wide class of representative-

agent models with taxes on consumption and factor incomes, including the model proposed here.

The main drawback of the MRT tax rates is that they are average, not marginal, tax rates, but

because they are intended for use in representative-agent models, this disadvantage is less severe

than it would be in a model with heterogeneous agents. Moreover Mendoza, Razin, and Tesar (1994)

show that existing estimates of aggregate marginal tax rates have a high time-series correlation with

the MRT effective tax rates, and that both have similar cross-country rankings.

       Following Trabandt and Uhlig (2009), we modify the MRT estimates of labor and capital taxes

by adding supplemental wages (i.e. employers’ contributions to social security and private pension

plans) to the tax base for personal income taxes. These data were not available at the time of the

MRT 1994 calculations and, because this adjustment affects the calculation of the personal income

tax rate, which is an initial step for the calculation of labor and capital income tax rates, it alters

the estimates of both. In general, this adjustment makes the labor tax base bigger and therefore

the labor tax rate smaller than the MRT original estimates.14

       Table 1 shows that 2008 tax rates were not very different across EU10 and GIIPS. This reflects

the tax harmonization treaties and directives adopted by the European Union since the 1960s, as
  14
    Trabandt and Uhlig make a further adjustment to the MRT formulae by attributing some of the operating surplus
of corporations and non-incorporated private enterprises to labor, with the argument that this represents a return
to entrepreneurs rather than to capital. We do not make this modification because the data do not provide enough
information to determine what fraction of the operating surplus should be allocated to labor.

well as the effects of competition in corporate income taxation. Consumption and labor tax rates

are slightly higher in EU10 than in GIIPS (0.18 v. 0.14 for consumption and 0.36 v. 0.33 for labor),

and capital taxes are just a notch higher in GIIPS than in EU10 (0.21 v. 0.20).15 This relative

homogeneity of the pre-debt-crisis tax structures is worth noting, because it contrasts with the

sizable difference in the size of the debt shocks across GIIPS and EU10 documented below. Hence,

the quantitative experiments conducted in the next section using the asymmetric calibration focus

on tax adjustments in response to heterogeneous public debt shocks across countries starting from

relatively homogeneous tax systems.

       With regard to aggregate expenditure ratios, the GIIPS region has higher consumption and

investment shares of GDP than EU10 by 4 and 3 percentage points respectively. Their government

expenditure shares (purchases of goods and services, excluding transfers) are about the same, at

one-fifth of GDP. These three expenditure ratios are fairly stable over time, so using 2008 values

or time-series averages for the calibration makes little difference. This is not true, however, for net

exports, which show an average of −0.1 percent for GIIPS over the 1995–2011 period but by 2008

had dropped to −3 percent. In the asymmetric calibration we use this value, and since the model

only has two regions, it imposes a 3 percent pre-crisis steady state trade surplus on the EU10. For

the baseline symmetric calibration, the All EU trade balance was negligible in 2008, so we set it

to zero in the pre-crisis steady state for simplicity. Examining the countries individually, GIIPS

countries tend to have trade deficits with the exception of Ireland, and in EU10 Germany and the

Netherlands have large trade surpluses that influence signficantly the GDP weighted average for

EU10. Note, however, that these trade balances include all external trade of the eurozone countries,

not just trade flows within the eurozone.

       In terms of fiscal flows, Eurostat data on total tax revenues and government outlays (including

both expenditures and transfer payments) show that both revenues and outlays are slightly higher

in EU10 than GIIPS, by 3 and 2 percentage points respectively. The gap between revenues and

expenditures, however, is about the same in both regions.
  15
    In contrast, these tax structures differ sharply from those of non-European industrial countries (see Mendoza,
Razin, and Tesar, 1994; Mendoza, Milesi-Ferretti, and Asea, 1997, for detailed international comparisons of tax
systems across all OECD industrial countries).

       The bottom panel of Table 1 reports government debt to GDP ratios and their change between

end–2007 (beginning of 2008) and end–2011. These changes are our estimate of the “debt shocks”

that each country and region experienced, and hence they are the key exogenous impulse used in

the quantitative experiments of the next Section. The debt ratios correspond to consolidated gross

debt of the general government as reported by Eurostat, which is the measure used to evaluate

compliance with the Maastricht Treaty. Under the Treaty, eurozone governments are to keep this

ratio below 60 percent of GDP. As the table shows, however, debt ratios between end–2007 and

2011 rose sharply. Only five countries were in compliance with the Maastricht limit, and all of the

large European economies in both EU10 and GIIPS had debt ratios significantly higher than 0.6.

The debt shock in EU10 amounts to an increase of 18 percentage points of GDP (reaching a 79

percent debt ratio by 2011), while in GIIPS the ratio increased by 30 percentage points, reaching a

105 percent debt ratio in 2011.16 For All EU, the debt shock measures 22 percentage points, with

the debt ratio rising from 66 to 88 percent.


3.2      Calibration

Table 2 lists the parameter values of the model’s baseline calibration, and the information from the

All EU column of Table 1 or the existing literature that was used to target them. The calibration

is designed to represent the balanced-growth steady state that prevailed before the debt shocks

occurred, using 2008 observations from the data as empirical proxies for the corresponding allo-

cations (as explained earlier, investment and consumption shares for 2008 or time-series averages

since 1970 are not markedly different). The model is calibrated to a quarterly frequency, and the

calibration strategy proceeds as described in the paragraphs below.

       The fiscal policy parameters include the tax rates, the share of government expenditures in

GDP, the public debt ratio and the limit on the depreciation allowance. The tax rates, government

expenditures share and debt ratio are calibrated to the values in the All EU column of Table 1:

τK = 0.2, τL = 0.35, τC = 0.16, g/y = 0.21 and d/y = 0.66. These labor and consumption

tax rates imply a consumption-leisure tax wedge of τW = 0.44. The limit on the depreciation
  16
  GDP fell during this interval, which contributed to the increase in the debt to GDP ratio, but the decline in
GDP is swamped by the large increase in debt, particularly in GIIPS.


                                                      19
allowance, θ, is set to capture the facts that tax allowances for depreciation costs apply only to

capital income taxation levied on businesses, not individuals, and do not apply to residential capital

(which is included in k). Hence, the value of θ is set as θ = (REVKcorp /REVK )(K N R /K), where

(REVKcorp /REVK ) is the ratio of revenue from corporate capital income taxes to total capital income

tax revenue, and (K N R /K) is the ratio of non-residential fixed capital to total fixed capital. Using

2007 data from OECD Revenue Statistics for revenues, and from the European Union’s EU KLEMS

database for capital stocks for the six countries with enough data coverage (Austria, Finland,

Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain), these ratios range from 0.39 to 0.48 for (REVKcorp /REVK )

and from 37 to 46 percent for (K N R /K). Weighting by GDP, the aggregate value of θ is 0.22.

       Consider next the technology parameters. The labor share of income, α, is set to 0.61, following

Trabandt and Uhlig (2009). The quarterly rate of labor-augmenting technological change, γ, is

0.0022, which corresponds to the 0.9 percent annual average growth rate in real GDP per capita

observed in the Euro area between 2000 and 2011 based on Eurostat data. Since the countries are

symmetric in the baseline calibration, relative country size is set to ω = 0.50.

       To calibrate the depreciation rate function, we start by normalizing the long-run capacity uti-

lization rate to m̄ = 1. Given γ = 0.0022 and the investment- and capital-output ratios from the

data, we solve for the long-run depreciation rate from the steady-state law of motion of the capital

stock (x/y = (γ + δ(m̄))k/y). This yields δ(m̄) = 0.0164 per quarter.17 The value of χ0 follows

then from the optimality condition for utilization at steady state, using α = 0.61 and k/y = 2.97,

which yields χ0 = (1 − α)/(k/y) = 0.03. Given this, the value of χ1 follows from evaluating the

depreciation rate function at steady state, which implies χ0 m̄χ1 /χ1 = 0.0164. Solving for χ1 yields

χ1 = 1.58. The constant depreciation rate for claiming the depreciation tax allowance, δ̄, is set

equal to the steady state depreciation rate. Hence, δ̄ = δ(m̄) = 0.0164.

       For preference parameters, we set σ = 2.0 which is the value commonly used in the Macro

literature. The exponent of leisure in utility, a = 2.675 is from Mendoza and Tesar (1998). This

value supports a labor allocation of 18.2 hours, which is in the range of the 1993-1996 averages of
  17
    Investment rates are from the OECD National Income Accounts and capital-output ratios are from the AMECO
database of the European Commission. The 2008 GDP-weighted average investment rate across the GIIPS and EU10
is x/y =0.222 (see also the last column of Table 1), and the 2007 average capital-output ratio is k/y =2.97 (which is
also the average over the 2000-2008 period).



                                                         20
hours worked per person aged 15 to 64 in France (17.5), Germany (19.3) and Italy (16.5) reported

by Prescott (2004).

   The value of β follows from the steady-state Euler equation for capital accumulation, using the

values set above for the other parameters that appear in this equation:

                             γ                         y
                                = 1 + (1 − τK ) (1 − α) − δ (m̄) + τK θδ̄.
                             β̃                        k

This yields β̃ = 0.992, and then since β̃ = β(1 + γ)1−σ it follows that β = 0.9942. The values of

β, γ and σ pin down the steady-state gross real interest rate, R = β −1 (1 + γ)σ = 1.0102. This is

equivalent to a net annual real interest rate of about 4.2 percent.

   Once the interest rate is determined, the economy’s resource constraint pins down the steady-

state ratio of net foreign assets to GDP. Since the data indicates tb/y = 0 for the symmetric

baseline, b/y = (tb/y)/ (1 + γ)R−1 − 1 = 0. In addition, the steady-state government budget
                                      

constraint can be used to solve for the implied ratio of government entitlement payments to GDP

e/y = Rev/y − g/y − (d/y) 1 − (1 + γ)R−1 = 0.163.
                                           

   Under this calibration approach, both b/y and e/y are necessarily obtained as residuals, given

that the values of all the terms in the right-hand-side of the equations that determine them have

already been set. Hence, they generally will not match their empirical counterparts. In particular,

for entitlement payments the model underestimates significantly the 2008 observed ratio of enti-

tlement payments to GDP (0.163 in the model v. 0.26 in the data for All EU). Notice, however,

that when the model is used to evaluate tax policies to restore fiscal solvency in response to debt

shocks, the fact that entitlement payments are lower than in the data strengthens our results. We

find that restoring fiscal solvency implies non-trivial tax adjustments with sizable welfare costs

and cross-country spillovers, all of which would be even larger with higher government revenue

requirements due to higher entitlement payments.

   The value of the investment-adjustment-cost parameter, η, cannot be set using steady-state

conditions, because at steady state adjustment costs wash out from the model by construction.

Hence, we set the value of this parameter so that the model is consistent with the mid-point of the

empirical estimates of the short-run elasticity of the capital tax base to changes in capital tax rates.

                                                  21
The range of empirical estimates is 0.1–0.5, so the target midpoint is 0.3.18 Under the baseline

symmetric calibration, the model matches this short-run elasticity when we set η = 2.0. This value

of η is also in line with estimates in House and Shapiro (2008) of the response of investment in

long-lived capital goods to relatively temporary changes in the cost of capital goods.19

       An alternative calibration strategy would have been to set η directly to the 1–2.5 range indicated

by the estimates of House and Shapiro (2008), and calibrate χ1 , the curvature parameter in the

depreciation rate function, to match the capital tax base elasticity. This would require also a

different approach to calibrate χ0 and δ̄. The value of χ0 would be pinned down by the fact that,

given m̄ = 1, the functional form of δ(m) implies χ0 = χ1 δ(m̄), and the value of δ̄ would then be

solved for using the optimality condition for utilization evaluated at steady state. This calibration

strategy is about equivalent quantitatively to the one we followed, however, because under our

calibration strategy setting η to match the capital tax base elasticity we obtained a value of η well

inside the House-Shapiro range of empirical estimates of this parameter.

       Table 3 reports the 2008 GDP ratios of key macro-aggregates in the data and the model’s

balanced-growth, steady-state allocations for the baseline symmetric calibration and for the GIIPS-

EU10 asymmetric calibration. As noted earlier, the latter captures the observed differences in the

size of the regions, in all their fiscal policy parameters and in their trade balances. The ratios

of the model and the data in the symmetric baseline are nearly identical by design, because the

ratios from the data were used as calibration targets (except the consumption-output ratio). The

small differences in data and model columns for the GIIPS-EU10 scenario suggest that even in the

asymmetric case the model does a good job at capturing the pre-debt-crisis conditions in these

regions as the initial balanced-growth stationary state.
  18
      Gruber and Rauh (2007) obtained a main estimate of 0.2 for the elasticity of the corporate tax base relative to
corporate taxes in the United States, and Dwenger and Steiner (2012) obtained around 0.5 for Germany. Moreover,
Grubler and Rauh also noted the following after surveying the much larger literature estimating the elasticity of
individual tax bases to individual tax rates: “The broad consensus from this literature is that the elasticity of taxable
income with respect to the tax rate is roughly 0.4. Moreover, the elasticity of actual income generation through
labor supply/savings, as opposed to reported income, is much lower. And most of the response of taxable income to
taxation appears to arise from higher income groups.”
   19
      They estimated the elasticity of substitution between capital and consumption goods to be in the range of 6 to
14. In models with the standard Hayashi setup of capital adjustment costs without utilization choice, this elasticity
is equal to 1/(ηδ). Hence, for the value of δ(m̄) = 0.0164 in our model, this would imply values of η in the range
between 1 and 2.5.

4         Quantitative Analysis

We now turn to quantitative experiments that illustrate the macroeconomic implications of changes

in capital and labor tax rates that could be undertaken to restore fiscal solvency (i.e. balance the

intertemporal government budget constraint) in response to shocks to the initial public debt ratio.

As explained earlier, since labor and consumption taxes are equivalent and consumption taxes are

unchanged at the pre-debt shock rates, adjustments in labor taxes correspond to adjustments in

the consumption-leisure tax wedge (τW ). We refer to the home region as H and the foreign region

as F. We conduct two sets of experiments. In the first set, we assume that H implements unilateral

increases in either capital or labor tax rates, and study the effects on equilibrium allocations

and prices as well as social welfare in the H and F regions, and compare also with the effects

obtained in similar experiments in which H implements tax adjustments as a closed economy.

In light of the significant externalities obtained with unilateral tax changes, the second set of

experiments examines tax adjustments that restore fiscal solvency as solutions of cooperative and

non-cooperative tax competition games between H and F.

         The algorithms follow a first-order approximation approach to the model’s equilibrium con-

ditions around the balanced-growth stationary state.20 Since the model consists of two regions

trading freely in goods and asset markets, however, standard perturbation methods widely used in

the Macro literature cannot be applied directly. In particular, trade in bonds implies that, when

the model’s pre-debt-crisis steady state is perturbed by the debt shocks and the tax changes aimed

at restoring fiscal solvency, the equilibrium transition paths of allocations and prices and the new

steady-state equilibrium need to be solved for simultaneously. This is because in models of this

class stationary equilibria depend on initial conditions and thus cannot be determined separately

from the solution of the models’ dynamics. For this reason, Mendoza and Tesar (1998) developed

a solution method that nests a perturbation routine for solving transitional dynamics within a

shooting algorithm. This method iterates on candidate values of the new long-run net foreign asset
    20
    Mendoza and Tesar (1998, 2005) use a similar method. In their exercise, the algorithm solved for competitive
equilibria and Nash and cooperative games in situations in which capital income taxes were removed and the present
value of the revenue is replaced with other taxes. In this paper we solve for changes in capital and labor taxes that
can restore fiscal solvency in response to changes in the initial public debt ratio.

positions to which the model converges after being perturbed by debt and tax changes, until the

candidate values match the positions the model converges to when simulated forward to its new

steady state starting from the calibrated pre-debt-crisis initial conditions (see Mendoza and Tesar,

1998, for details).


4.1    Unilateral Tax Increases and Dynamic Laffer Curves

The first step in the quantitative analysis is to examine how unilateral movements in capital and

labor taxes alter the borrowing ability of the government (i.e. increase the present value of the pri-

mary fiscal balance) in the symmetric baseline calibration. For this purpose, as mentioned earlier,

we construct “Dynamic Laffer Curves” that map values of τK or τL into the present discounted

value of the primary fiscal balance they support at equilibrium. For each value of the tax rates, the

sequence of total tax revenue varies as equilibrium allocations and prices vary, while government

purchases and entitlement payments are kept constant. In addition, the present value computa-

tion captures the effect of changes in the equilibrium sequence of interest rates, which reflect the

government’s borrowing costs. We express the result as a ratio of pre-debt-crisis output y−1 , so

that it corresponds to the term in the right-hand-side of the intertemporal government budget con-

straint (10), and in graphs we plot the result as a change relative to the pre-debt-crisis public debt

ratio. Hence, the values along the vertical axis of the dynamic Laffer curves show the change in

the initial debt ratio that particular values of τK or τL can support at equilibrium.21 These Laffer

curves cross the zero line at the calibrated tax rates of the pre-debt-crisis stationary equilibrium

by construction, and a given tax rate can restore fiscal solvency for a given debt shock only if at

that tax rate the dynamic Laffer curve returns a value at least as large as the debt shock.

    Since the F region is affected by spillovers of the unilateral tax changes in H, there needs be an

adjustment in F so that its intertemporal government budget constraint continues to hold at the

same level (i.e. the same present discounted value of primary fiscal balances). For simplicity, we

refer to this adjustment as maintaining “revenue neutrality” in the F region. This can be done by
  21
     Since gt +et remains constant at the pre-crisis level and equilibrium interest rates display relatively small move-
ments, these Laffer Curves display the same shape as standard dynamic Laffer curves that map taxes into the present
value of tax revenue, instead of the primary fiscal balance.




                                                          24
changing foreign transfers, taxes or government purchases. The difference is that, since government

purchases are unproductive and taxes are distorting, reducing tax rates in response to favorable

tax spillovers from the H region is more desirable than increasing transfer payments. Hence, since

we are also assuming that government purchases remain constant in both regions, we allow F to

maintain revenue neutrality by adjusting τL∗ .

Dynamic Laffer Curves for Capital Taxes

   The solid line in Figure 2 shows the dynamic Laffer curve of the H region for changes in τK ,

together with the corresponding curve assuming H is in autarky (the closed-economy dotted line).

As explained above, at the pre-debt-crisis calibrated value of τK = 0.2, the Laffer curves intersects

the zero line, because the present value of the primary balance does not change relative to the

pre-debt-crisis equilibrium.

   As shown in Table 1, the debt shock for the GDP-weighted average of the eurozone is equal to

an increase of 0.22 in the debt ratio. This is indicated as the “Debt Shock” line in Figure 2. Hence,

0.22 is the amount by which the present value of the primary fiscal balance as share of GDP needs

to increase to restore fiscal solvency in the baseline symmetric calibration. The Figure shows that

there is no value of τK that can restore fiscal solvency in the H region in the open economy. The

maximum point of the dyamic Laffer curve is attained with a tax rate of 0.31, with an associated

maximum value equal to an increase in the present value of the primary balance of 9 percentage

points of GDP, far short of the required 22. The dynamic Laffer curve under autarky is steeper

at the pre-debt-crisis tax rate, and it peaks at a higher tax rate of 40 percent, raising the present

value of the primary balance by more than the required 22. As it happens, the H region can restore

fiscal solvency in autarky at almost the same tax rate corresponding to the maximum point of the

open-economy Laffer curve.

   The fact that H acting unilaterally can generate more revenue as it increases τK if the economy

is closed than open shows that evaluating “fiscal space,” or the capacity to raise revenue, without

taking into account international trade in goods and assets and cross-country tax externalities,

leads to substantial overestimation of the effectiveness of capital tax hikes as a tool to restore fiscal

solvency. It also suggests that, by focusing on unilateral capital tax austerity alone, countries that


                                                   25
have heavier outstanding debt burdens have non-trivial incentives to consider moving to autarky,

imposing capital controls and/or trade barriers, or repudiating their debt.

       Table 4 summarizes the effects that result from an unilateral increase in τK to the maximum

point on the open-economy Laffer curve (31 percent). In this scenario, the implied adjustment in

the labor tax in F to maintain revenue neutrality in response to the positive externalities from

the capital tax hike in H, reduces τL∗ from 0.35 to 0.33. Since H’s capital tax rate increases by

11 percentage points, and this tax is highly distorting, H experiences a large welfare cost of 5.54

percent, while F obtains a welfare gain of 0.85 percent.22

       Comparing the H region outcomes as an open economy (first two columns of Table 4) v. closed

economy (last two columns) under the same 31 percent capital tax rate, we find that H in autarky

experiences an increase in the present value of its primary balance of 22.2 percentage points, more

than twice as large as in the open-economy case. The welfare loss is nearly the same (5.53 percent),

but normalizing by the amount of revenue generated, H is much better off in autarky. Another way

to see this is to consider the value of τK for H as a closed economy that yields the same 9 extra

percentage points of present value of the primary balance that H attains as an open economy with

τK = 0.3. As Figure 2 shows, H under autarky can do this with a 23.5 percent tax rate, which

carries a much smaller welfare cost than the 5.54 percent loss as an open economy. This shows

again that if fiscal austerity focuses on capital taxes, H would be much better off under autarky,

and hence it has strong incentives to move in that direction.

       The impact and long-run effects on key macro-aggregates in both regions are shown in the

bottom of Table 4. The corresponding transition paths as the economies move from the pre-crisis

steady state to the new steady state are illustrated in Figure 3. In the H region, the increase in τK

causes a steady drop in k over time to a level 20.5 percent below the pre-crisis level, while in the

F region k ∗ rises gradually to a level 3 percent higher than in the pre-crisis equilibrium. Capacity

utilization falls sharply initially at home. We show below that this drives the higher elasticity of

the base of capital income taxation. Initially, labor increases in H and falls in F, but this pattern
  22
     Welfare effects are computed as in Lucas (1987), in terms of a percent change in consumption constant across
all periods that equates lifetime utility under a given debt shock and tax policy change with that attained in the
pre-fiscal-crisis steady state. We report the overall effect, which includes transitional dynamics across the pre- and
post-crisis steady states, as well as a comparison across steady states exclusive of transitional dynamics.



                                                         26
reverses during the transition to steady state because of the lower (higher) capital stock in the H

(F) region in the new steady state. As a result of the lower capital and labor, output in H contracts

by 11 percent in the long-run, underscoring efficiency losses due to the capital tax increase and the

costs of the fiscal adjustment.

   The H region increases its net foreign asset position (NFA) by running substantial trade sur-

pluses (tb/y) in the early stages of transition, while F decreases its NFA position by running trade

deficits. Hence, H is saving to smooth out the cost of the efficiency losses, as output follows a

monotonically decreasing path. Still, utility levels are lower than when H implements the same

capital tax under autarky, because of the negative cross-country spillovers.

   The transitional dynamics of fiscal variables are plotted in Figure 4. In the H region, tax

revenue from capital income increases almost immediately to a higher constant level when τk rises,

while the revenues from labor and consumption taxes decline both on impact and in the long

run. Labor and consumption tax rates are not changing, but both tax bases fall on impact and

then decline monotonically to their new, lower steady states. The primary fiscal balance and

total revenue both rise initially but then converge to about the same levels as in the pre-crisis

stationary equilibrium. For the primary balance, this pattern is implied by the pattern of the total

revenue, since government expenditures and entitlements are held constant. For total revenue, the

transitional increase indicates that the rise in capital tax revenue more than offsets the decline in

the revenue from the other taxes in the transition, while in the long-run they almost offset each

other exactly. This is possible because the change in τK to 0.31 is on the increasing side of the

Laffer curve (see Figure 2), and in fact it is the maximum point of the curve. Hence, this capital

tax hike does not reduce capital tax revenues. At higher tax rates the opposite occurs, and total

revenues converge to a steady state lower than the pre-crisis level (e.g. with τK = 0.45 total revenue

falls to a new steady state 7 percent below the pre-crisis level).

   The public debt dynamics in the bottom-right panel of Figure 4 shows that on impact, gov-

ernment debt in the H region responds to the 31 percent tax rate by increasing 9 percentage

points, reflecting the extra initial debt that can be supported at the higher capital tax rate (recall

9 percentage points is also what Figure 2 shows for τK = 0.31). Since the primary fiscal balance



                                                  27
rises on impact and then declines monotonically, the debt ratio also falls monotonically during the

transition, and converges to a ratio that is actually about 3 percentage points below the pre-crisis

level. Hence, the debt shock is completely undone by the capital tax hike in the long-run. If H

implements the same tax hike under autarky, it generates significantly larger revenues and primary

balances, and hence the debt ratio increases more initially and converges to a higher steady state

of 10 percentage points above the pre-crisis level. This is again a reflection of the cross-country

externalities faced by H as an open economy, since equally-sized tax hikes produce significantly

higher revenues under autarky.

   The cross-country externalities are also reflected in the fiscal dynamics of the F region shown

in Figure 4. Maintaining revenue neutrality (in present value) still allows both its revenue and

primary balance to fall initially, while in the long run both converge to very similar levels as in the

pre-crisis steady state. Removing the labor tax adjustment in F that maintains revenue neutrality,

the present value of its primary balance as a share of GDP would increase by 11.4 percentage points

relative to the pre-crisis ratio, and both its revenue and primary balances would be higher than in

the plots shown in Figure 4. The welfare gain, however, would be negligible instead of 0.85 percent

in lifetime consumption.

   This 0.85 percent welfare gain that F obtains because of the positive externalities from the

unilateral capital tax hike in H is largely overlooked in current discussions of fiscal adjustment in

Europe. H can raise more revenue by increasing τK along the upward-sloping region of its dynamic

Laffer curve, but its ability to do so is significantly hampered by the adverse externality it faces due

to the erosion of its tax bases. In F, the same externality indirectly improves government finances,

or reduces the distortions associated with tax collection, and provides it with an unintended welfare

gain.

The Roles of Endogenous Utilization and Limited Tax Allowance

   We stated earlier that a key feature of the model is that it introduces endogenous capital

utilization in order to capture the observed elasticity of the capital tax base to changes in capital

tax rates, in contrast with standard dynamic equilibrium models without utilization in which this

elasticity is unrealistically low. In addition, we noted that the interaction with a limited tax


                                                  28
allowance for depreciation was also critical for this purpose. To demonstrate these arguments, we

compare dynamic Laffer curves for capital taxes under the following three senarios (see Figure 5):

(A) a standard neoclassical case with exogenous utilization and a full depreciation allowance (using

θ = 1 and shown as a dotted line); (B) the same neoclassical model but a limited depreciation

allowance (using θ = 0.22, shown as a dashed line); (B) the baseline symmetric calibration of our

model with both endogenous utilization and a limited depreciation allowance (using again θ = 0.22,

shown as a solid line). All other parameter values are the same across all these cases.

   In case (A), the dynamic Laffer curve is nearly-linearly increasing in the 0.2–0.45 domain of

capital tax rates plotted. Moreover, we verified that this Laffer curve continues to be increasing even

when we extend the capital tax rate to 0.9. This is similar to the results obtained by Trabandt and

Uhlig (2010)) in a closed-economy setting. They found that present-value Laffer curves of capital

tax revenue either become decreasing at very high tax rates (if the interest rate for discounting is

kept constant) or are actually non-decreasing (discounting with equilibrium interest rates). This

behavior of the capital tax Laffer curves follows from the fact that the capital stock is predetermined

at any given date, and has a low elasticity in the short run. This allows the government to raise

substantial revenue over the transition period when increasing the capital tax rate, since the capital

stock declines gradually, and this higher transitional tax revenue dominates the fall in steady-state

tax revenue, resulting in a non-decreasing dynamic Laffer curve.

   Introducing the limited depreciation allowance without endogenizing the utilization choice (Case

B) has two effects. First, it increases the effective rate of taxation on capital income, and thus

weakens the incentive to accumulate capital and lowers the steady-state capital-output ratio and

tax bases. Second, it has a positive impact on revenue by widening the capital tax base. The latter

effect dominates the first when the capital tax rate is small (in the 0.2–0.33 range), resulting in

slightly higher dynamic Laffer curve values than in (A), while the opposite holds when the capital

tax rate is high (above 0.33), resulting in sharply lower dynamic Laffer curve values than in (A).

   In case (C) the tax allowance is again limited but now capacity utilization is an endoegenous

choice. This introduces effects that operate via distortions on efficiency and the ability to raise

revenue. On the side of tax distortions, it is clear from equation (18) that endogenous utilization



                                                  29
adds to the efficiency costs of capital income taxation, by introducing a wedge between the marginal

cost and benefits of capital utilization. On the revenue side, endogenous utilization allows agents

to make adjustments in effective capital, and thus alters the level of taxable capital income (even

though the capital stock is predetermined). Hence, when utilization falls in response to increases in

capital tax rates, it also weakens the government’s ability to raise capital tax revenue. These effects

lead to a bell-shaped dynamic Laffer curve that has more curvature and is significantly below those

in scenarios (A) and (B). Thus, endogenous utilization makes capital taxes more distorting and

weakens significantly the revenue-generating capacity of capital taxes.23

    The effects of endogenous utilization and limited depreciation allowance on dynamic Laffer

curves identified above have significant implications for the elasticity of the capital income tax

base with respect to the capital tax. In particular, the combination of endogenous utilization and

limited depreciation allowance is what allowed us to calibrate the model so as to obtain a short-run

elasticity consistent with empirical estimates. As documented earlier, the empirical literature finds

estimates of the short-run elasticity of the capital tax base in the 0.1–0.5 range. Table 5 reports

the model’s comparable elasticity estimates and the impact effects on output, labor and utilization,

again for scenarios (A), (B) and (C). The neoclassical model with or without limited depreciation

allowance (cases A and B) yields negative short-run elasticities (i.e. the capital tax base rises in the

short run in response to capital tax rate increases). The reason is that labor supply rises on impact

due to a negative income shock from the tax hike. Given that the capital stock is fixed, output

rises on impact, and thus taxable labor and capital income both rise, producing an elasticity of

the opposite sign than that found in the data. In contrast, the model with endogenous utilization

(case C), generates a decline in output on impact due to a substantial drop in the utilization rate,

despite the rise in labor supply. With the calibrated value of η = 0.2, which is also the same used in

cases (A) and (B), the model generates a short-run elasticity of 0.29, which is about the midpoint

of the range of empirical estimates.

    It is worth noting also that with exogenous utilization it is not possible to obtain a capital tax

base elasticity in line with empirical evidence even by re-calibrating the value of η, unless η itself is
  23
     Note that removing the limited depreciation allowance from case (C) still results in a Laffer curve significantly
below those of cases (A) and (B). It is also flatter and increasing for a wider range of capital taxes than case (C).

set unrealistically low. The model-predicted short-run elasticity of the capital tax base is negative

for η > 1, and it becomes positive and higher than 0.1 only for η < 0.1. This is significantly below

the empirically relevant range of 1–2.5 documented in the calibration section. Moreover, at the

value of η = 2 obtained in our baseline calibration, the model without utilization choice yields a

capital tax base elasticity of −0.031.

Dynamic Laffer Curves of Labor Tax Rates

   Figures 6, 7 and 8 and Table 6 show the results for unilateral changes in H’s labor tax rate

analogous to the capital tax rate changes we have examined. The results are more optimistic in

terms of the ability of H to raise revenue and restore fiscal solvency in response to the debt shock.

The open-economy Laffer curve for τL (Figure 6) is considerably steeper than for the capital tax

rate, and it peaks at a tax rate of 0.49 with an increase in the present value of the primary balance

as a share of GDP of about 0.51, well above the 0.22 needed to offset the debt shock. The labor

tax rate that H as an open economy needs to support the 0.88 debt ratio is therefore much lower,

at about 38 percent, and under autarky is just a little lower. This is because the open- and closed-

economy Laffer curves are much closer to each other than in the case of the capital tax experiment,

even though again the closed-economy curve is higher and shifted to the right. This suggests that

international spillovers of tax policies are weaker with labor than with capital taxes, as we confirm

below.

   Table 6 compares steady-state results for an increase in the labor tax that raises H’s present

value of the primary fiscal balance by roughly the same magnitude as in the capital tax experiment

of Table 4 (i.e. 9 percentage points). This is done so as to make the results in the two Tables

comparable. The required increase in τL is only one percentage point, from 35 to 36 percent. This

yields much smaller declines in steady-state output, consumption, capital and the investment rate

than in the capital tax case. The welfare cost is also much smaller at 0.91 percent. Comparing H

as a closed v. open economy, the gap in the increase of the present value of the primary balance is

almost negligible in the labor tax case, in contrast with the wide gap obtained for the capital tax.

   Taken together these findings are consistent with two familiar results from tax analysis in

representative-agent models, which emphasize the efficiency costs of tax distortions. First, the


                                                 31
capital tax rate is the most distorting tax. Second, in open-economy models, taxation of a mobile

factor (i.e. capital) yields less revenue at greater welfare loss than taxation of the immobile factor

(i.e. labor). This is in line with our results showing that the cross-country tax externalities are

strong for capital taxes but weak for labor taxes. With capital taxes, H as an open economy cannot

restore fiscal solvency after a debt shock of 22 percentage points, while under autarky it can do it

with a capital tax of about 31 percent at a welfare cost of 5.53 percent. In contrast, with labor

taxes, H can offset the same debt shock with about a 38 percent labor tax either as an open economy

or under autarky, with a much smaller welfare cost of 2.43 percent. On the other hand, our results

also indicate that it is plausible for cross-country tax externalities to be significant even for labor

taxes. Figure 6 indicates that for debt shocks larger than 40 percentage points and/or pre-debt-

shock labor taxes higher than 40 percent, the cross-country externalities would be nontrivial and

in the same direction as those observed in the capital tax analysis.

Asymmetric Regions: GIIPS, EU10

   Up to this point, we have focused only on experiments that use the symmetric baseline calibra-

tion. Now we study the effects of heterogeneity in region size. Table 7 shows results for tax policy

adjustments for each country in the GIIPS acting unilaterally. In each scenario, we solve the model

resetting the parameter controlling the relative size of the two regions so that H has the size of the

corresponding GIIPS country relative to the eurozone (shown in the second column of the Table).

Intuitively, each country in GIIPS treated in this way becomes much smaller, and the effect of a

domestic tax change on international prices is correspondingly smaller. This in turn means that

the impact on domestic capital outflow is greater, and thus the ability to raise revenue weakens

considerably. This is reflected in the peaks of the Laffer curves listed in the last two columns of

Table 7, which show the maximum increase in the present discounted value of the primary balance

that each GIIPS country can obtain individually using capital or labor taxes.

   The results in the Table also show that none of the GIIPS countries can restore fiscal solvency

with a capital income tax hike (i.e.the peaks of the Laffer curves are smaller than the debt shocks

shown in the third column), and one of the five countries (Ireland) cannot do it even with the labor

tax. Note also that Greece and Ireland experienced debt shocks that are much higher than the


                                                  32
GDP-weighted GIIPS regional average of 0.3.


4.2   Strategic Interaction in Tax Responses to Debt Shocks

The findings from the analysis of unilateral tax changes showed that capital tax changes produce

significant cross-country externalities, suggesting that there is scope for strategic interaction and

potential gains from coordination in considering tax responses to restore fiscal solvency in response

to debt shocks. In particular, when a region raises its capital tax, the externalities move against

that region and make the other region relatively more efficient. The burden of fiscal adjustment in

response to debt shocks is heavier (lighter) for the region with the higher (lower) taxes. But the

governments of both regions are aware of the externalities, and thus have an incentive to engage in

tax competition.

   To analyze strategic interaction, we follow Mendoza and Tesar (2005) and examine the solutions

to one-shot cooperative and non-cooperative games. They focused on tax reform experiments in

which the present value of revenue had to remain constant, whereas here we consider games in

which each region uses capital and labor taxes to respond to their corresponding debt shocks.

These games are solved first using the symmetric baseline calibration in which both regions are

identical, then introducing elements of heterogeneity one at a time, and finally considering two fully

heterogeneous regions, one calibrated to GIIPS and the other to EU10, capturing their differences

in country size, pre-debt-shock fiscal policies and trade balances, and size of debt shocks.

   The formal characterization of the strategy space and the games is as follows. The strategy

space is defined in terms of vectors of possible capital tax rates that the government of each region
                                                            ∗ ) in this strategy space, we solve for

the pair of labor tax rates (τL , τL∗ ) that allows each region to increase the present value of its

primary balance at the corresponding competitive equilibrium as needed to restore solvency after

the debt shocks — 22 percentage points for both regions in the symmetric benchmark case, and 30

for GIIPS and 18 for EU10 in the asymmetric case. The games are played once, but the payoffs

are dynamic, because they take into account the full transitional dynamics from the pre-crisis

competitive equilibrium to the new stationary equilibrium of under a particular set of capital and



                                                 33
labor taxes in both regions.

    Each region chooses its capital tax rate so as to maximize the lifetime utility of its residents tak-

ing as given the other region’s taxes and subject to the constraints that: (i) the implied allocations

and prices for a tax structure given by the pairs (τK , τL ), (τK    L

taxes, are a competitive equilibrium; and (ii) labor taxes in each region adjust so that intertemporal

government budget constraints support increases in the present value of the primary fiscal balances

equal to each region’s debt shock, as shown in equation (10).

    The regions choose capital tax rates from values in discrete grids with M and N nodes for the
                                                                         ∗ = {τ ∗ , τ ∗ , ..., τ ∗ }.

                                                      34
reaction functions have a negative slope because of the positive externalities that one country ex-

periences if the other chooses a higher tax rate. For instance, the higher the capital tax rate in F,

the lower the optimal capital tax choice in H, because it allows H to reduce tax distortions while

still maintaining fiscal solvency. Starting from identical tax rates on capital of 0.20 pre-crisis, Nash

competition results in the familiar “race to the bottom” in capital taxes, to 0.08. Labor taxes

increase from 0.35 to 0.44 and welfare declines relative to the pre-crisis equilibrium by 1.63 percent.

   Note that the welfare effects from the outcome of tax competition in response to debt shocks

involve two opposing effects. The first is that countries must raise revenue in response to the debt

shock. The second is that by competing in tax rates the regions are effectively reforming their tax

systems relative to pre-crisis tax rates (countries are optimally choosing labor and capital taxes to

raise the required revenue at the lowest efficiency cost). In principle it could be possible for the

gains from the latter to outweigh the costs of the former, but in our experiments using debt shocks

of the observed magnitudes this does not happen.

   Consider next the symmetric cooperative equilibrium solutions shown in Figure 9. Because of

symmetry, we focus on the cooperative outcome for equal country weights (see column Cooperative

in Table 8). In the cooperative equilibrium, the capital tax rate is higher than under Nash: 0.12

versus 0.08, and the labor tax rate is lower: 0.42 versus 0.44. Cooperation allows countries to

commit to higher capital taxes relative to Nash and avoid painful increases in labor taxes, which

reduces the welfare cost of tax austerity to respond to the debt shocks from 1.63 to 1.45 percent

(i.e. the welfare gain from cooperation is about 0.18).

   While tax coordination helps prevents welfare-reducing strategic interaction, the welfare costs

of adjusting taxes to offset debt shocks are still quite large in both Nash and cooperative outcomes.

Relative to the pre-crisis tax rates, capital taxes are lower and labor taxes are higher in the Nash

equilibrium after the debt shocks for two reasons. First, capital tax rates are lower because gov-

ernments wish to reduce the tax that is most distorting in terms of welfare cost per unit of revenue

(i.e. the capital tax). Second, in an open economy governments have the incentive to undercut

other countries’ tax rates in an effort to attract foreign capital and thereby increase the tax base.

Since both countries are attempting the same strategy, the outcome is lower capital tax rates and



                                                  35
higher labor tax rates than is optimal under cooperation.

   To highlight the impact of the strategic reaction by the foreign country on the home country,

we conduct two additional experiments. One is the “Autarky” experiment, which shows the effects

of fiscal adjustments to meet the debt shock in a closed economy. Note that under symmetry,

the autarky outcome is identical to the cooperative outcome above by construction. Thus, the

closed economy model will underestimate the welfare loss from the debt shock. The other is the

“Unilateral” experiment, which corresponds to the unilateral Laffer curve experiment illustrated in

Figure 2. As in that Figure, we assume that only H experiences the debt shock, and the foreign

country adjusts its labor tax rate to maintain revenue neutrality but does not behave strategically.

H chooses both capital and labor tax rates lower than those in the Nash equilibrium. Consequently,

the welfare cost of the debt shock for the home country is smaller in the unilateral case than in

the Nash case: 0.67 versus 1.63. This outcome, however, is not sustainable once we relax the

assumption that the foreign country is a passive player and allow it to respond optimally.

   The last column of Table 8 reports the Nash outcome implied by the neoclassical model with

exogenous utilization (θ = 0.22). Relative to the benchmark results in the Nash column, the neo-

classical model underestimates the tax competition effect on capital taxation. When the adjustment

in capital is sluggish, the two countries can rely more heavily on capital taxation. As a consequence,

they also end up with a less efficient tax system and therefore experience larger welfare losses.

   We next move to the asymmetric game in which we introduce the elements of heterogeneity

across the GIIPS and EU10 regions one by one. The results are reported in Table 9. Starting

with country size (the second column of Table 9), tax competition benefits small countries in two

ways. One is that by having a smaller impact on world prices, the small country can play off of

the large country without offsetting price adjustments. Second, the smaller country faces a bigger

supply of foreign capital from which the home country can steal by undercutting the capital tax

rate. Indeed, the benefit of being small leads to an approximate 0.26 relative welfare benefit for

the smaller H region relative to the bigger region. An initial trade surplus (negative NFA position)

is an advantage for EU10. The initial drop in interest rates along the transition path reduces the

cost of servicing external debt. This has a sizable welfare effect, with a relative gain for EU10 of



                                                 36
nearly 2.5 percent. Asymmetries in initial tax rates also matter in the Nash game. Having a higher

capital tax rate but lower labor and consumption taxes benefits GIIPS at the expense of the EU10

in the Nash game (the higher the capital tax rate initially, the more to gain from the race to the

bottom).24 Finally, facing a larger debt shock places GIIPS at a disadvantage in the Nash game.

The impact of the differential debt shock is large: the GIIPS region suffers a welfare loss of 3.5

percent while the EU10 suffers only 0.59 percent. The last column of Table 9 reports the outcome

of putting all of these differential factors altogether. GIIPS undercuts EU10 in capital tax rates:

0.07 versus 0.09, but given its larger debt shock, GIIPS still experiences a substantial welfare loss of

1.55 percent, and EU10 experiences a welfare loss of 1.13 percent, relative to their pre-crisis levels.

         Table 10 reports Nash, cooperative and autarky outcomes for the fully asymmetric game. The

Nash column repeats the results from the final column of Table 9. The important message of Table

10 is the comparison of the Nash equilibrium with the cooperative equilibrium and the autarky exit

option. Two points are worth noting. First, both regions are hurt by tax competition and would

prefer cooperation to Nash. However, in the event cooperation fails, GIIPS prefers to exit while

EU10 prefers tax competition to exit. Even in the case where the lion’s share of the gains from

cooperation are allocated to GIIPS (case 1), GIIPS prefers the autarky outcome. This means that

the international externalities work against GIIPS and tend to favor EU10. Failure to take these

international externalities into account undermines the sustainability of the union.



5         Conclusions

Public debt ratios surged between 2008 and 2011 in many industrial countries, raising serious

questions about fiscal solvency and the need for fiscal adjustment. In the eurozone in particular,

public debt increased by a GDP-weighted average of 30 percentage points in the GIIPS region

and in the EU10 by 18 percentage points. If, in the presence of these large debt shocks, defaults

are to be averted (i.e. fiscal solvency maintained) and the eurozone countries are to remain fully

integrated in goods and asset markets, three key questions arise. First, is tax-driven adjustment

feasible (i.e. can it yield increases in the present value of the primary fiscal balances that match

         The pre-debt-crisis consumption-leisure tax wedges are 0.46 for EU10 v. 0.41 for GIIPS.

the higher debt ratios)? Second, how do different tax-adjustment policies using capital or labor

taxes differ in terms of revenue, macroeconomic dynamics, cross-country externalities, and welfare

costs? Third, what are the implications of strategic interaction, and the benefits of coordination,

in the tax-adjustment response to debt changes in economies that trade freely in goods and assets?

   The workhorse Neoclassical model with exogenous long-run growth widely used for quantifying

the effects of tax policies in the literature is poorly suited to answer these questions, because it

underestimates the elasticity of the capital tax base to changes in capital taxes. This is due to

the fact that the capital stock is pre-determined at any given date, and adjusts slowly over the

long run, and also to the standard assumption of a 100-percent depreciation tax allowance. As a

result, models of this class tend to produce rosy estimates of the effectiveness of capital tax hikes

for raising tax revenues and underestimate the significance of cross-country externalities.

   In contrast, in this paper we answer the above questions using a two-country, dynamic general

equilibrium model that deviates from the workhorse Neoclassical model in two key respects. First,

it allows for endogenous utilization of capital, which allows agents to adjust taxable capital income

much quicker in response to capital tax changes. Second, it introduces a limited depreciation tax

allowance, which is in line with the actual treatment in tax codes that apply this allowance to

taxes levied to business incomes, not capital income accruing to individuals (e.g. dividends, capital

gains), and do not apply it to residential capital. These two features of the model make capital

income taxes more distortionary than in the Neoclassical model, and also lower signficantly the

ability of the government to raise capital income tax revenues. As a result, a reasonable calibration

of the model features a short-run elasticity of the capital tax base around the midpoint of empirical

estimates.

   We calibrate the model to data for eurozone countries and find striking results. Raising capital

taxes unilaterally is not a feasible strategy for restoring fiscal solvency in response to the observed

debt shocks. The dynamic Laffer curve that maps capital taxes into changes in the present value

of the primary fiscal balance peaks far below the required increment. Labor taxes can do it, but

in both cases the tax hikes entail large welfare costs. Moreover, capital tax adjustments induce

large cross-country externalities, which favor the countries with less pressure to raise capital taxes



                                                  38
(i.e.the EU10). In addition, in both scenarios GIIPS can offset the observed debt shocks at lower

tax rates and welfare costs under autarky, which in the model provides them with a strong incentive

to move in that direction or default on their debt obligations.

   Non-cooperative Nash competition, which involves choosing the optimal pairs of capital and

labor taxes to restore fiscal solvency in response to the observed debt shocks, yields the well-known

race to the bottom in capital tax rates. When countries can adjust capital and labor taxes, the

tax structure shifts sharply toward lower capital and higher labor taxation. In representative-

agent models of the class we study this induces efficiency gains, reducing the welfare cost of fiscal

adjustment. The race ends with small positive capital taxes and higher labor taxes relative to pre-

crisis rates, but the former are too low and the latter too high because countries do not internalize

the international externalities of their tax policies. Cooperation internalizes these externalities,

and thus reduces the size of the cut in capital taxes and hike in labor taxes. This makes fiscal

adjustment slightly less costly, but even in this case the welfare cost of the tax adjustments that

restore fiscal solvency remains large.

   The costs of adjusting to the large debt shocks are lower when regions or countries are assumed

to be able to choose the best mix of their own capital and labor taxes acting unilaterally and

assuming the other countries remain passive. These results are not sustainable, however, because

they negate the strong incentives for strategic interaction. Moreover, the costs of implementing the

best mix of capital and labor tax changes to restore fiscal solvency are lower under autarky than

those of the Nash and Cooperative games for the GIIPS region, but higher for the EU10 region.

Hence, the GIIPS region is left with an incentive to move away from full economic integration.

   The analysis of this paper has clear implications for current policy. Despite the fact that

the European nations have closely integrated goods and financial markets, policy discussions have

proceeded largely without taking into account international ramifications of domestic tax policy

adjustments. Economists have pointed out a number of factors that could give highly-indebted

European countries incentives to exit the eurozone; a depreciation of the currency could produce

an export boom and reduce unit labor costs, removal of the Maastricht debt and deficit targets

could enable countries to adopt more expansive monetary and fiscal policies, and default on external



                                                 39
debt could relax (at least temporarily) the country’s budget constraint. This paper identified and

quantified another factor that can undermine incentives to remain in the eurozone significantly: the

fiscal externalities from tax austerity that work against the GIIPS region. These factors deserve

careful consideration in discussions of fiscal austerity and fiscal sustainability.

Note: In the Nash game, the home and foreign countries both have the debt shock of 0.22. We assign equal weights for the
two countries in the cooperative equilibrium. For the unilateral experiment, the foreign country keeps its pre-crisis capital
tax rate and adjusts its labor tax rate to maintain revenue neutrality, while the home country chooses its capital and labor
tax rate which maximizes its welfare subject to the debt requirement. In the neoclassical experiment, capacity utilization is
exogenous and θ is set at 0.22.

Note: In the first six asymmetric experiments, we incorporate only one cross-country difference each time. For the size experiment, we
set ω to match the relative size between GIIPS and EU10. For the NFA experiment, we set the GIIPS pre-crisis current account as a
share of GDP at the observed level of −3%. In each of the three asymmetric tax experiments, we allow the corresponding precrisis tax
rates to vary across the two countries as in the data. Under the “Debt” column, we feed in the observed debt shocks for each country.
Under the “All” column, we incorporate all the above cross-country differences.

Note: For the cooperative equilibrium, Case 1 reports the most favorable allocation to GIIPS within the core; Case
2 reports the results most favorable to EU10 within the core. ’Weights’ report the social weight that the planner
assigns to GIIPS to obtain Pareto improvements over the Nash outcome. The weight assigned to EU10 is ’1-Weights’.
For the unilateral experiment, the foreign country keeps its pre-crisis capital tax rate and adjusts its labor tax rate
to satisfy the revenue neutrality, while the home country chooses its capital and labor tax rate which maximizes its
welfare subject to the debt requirement.
