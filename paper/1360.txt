                    Concepts and Measures of Earnings
                      Replacement During Retirement

                                  ABSTRACT



         This paper compares the well—being of the Retirement History Survey

of the elderly with their own previous levels of income and economic welfare.

Traditional replacement rates are calculated, although a number of shortcomings

of such measures are discussed. Modifications are made by examining career

average rather than peak earnings, by adjusting for the fact that the incomes

of the elderly are taxed more lightly, that the elderly do not have dependent

children, and that Social Security income in retirement is a safer source of

income than earnings earlier in life. The fully adjusted total income measures

are at least as high for almost all classes of households in the survey as their

career average pre—retirement earnings.

1. Introduction

         The current generation of elderly retired persons is wealthier than

any elderly generation preceding it. By some measures, it is quite well off

relative to the current younger generation of workers. For a variety of

reasons, however, we may be interested in how well off elderly retirees are

relative to their standard of living during their own working years. This

interest may stem from a desire to infer the private planning and foresight

capabilities of persons prior to retirement; or to report the economic history

of the entire life cycle of the cohort; or to evaluate the role of public

policy in affecting the well—being of the elderly (for example, by providing

social security benefits).

         Any such comparison is frought with conceptual and measurement

difficulties. The concepts and measures one might employ to examine the

economic well—being of the elderly relative to their own previous economic

well—being certainly presume much about the structure of the economy, not to

mention what makes people economically better or worse off. For example, most

life cycles have age—specific opportunities and expenses, such as those

involved with raising children. One's views about the extent to which capital

markets are sufficiently well—developed to insure against all risks at

actuarially fair rates certainly must color the time period over which well-

being is measured and the method of valuing income streams at different dates

from alternative sources with varying risk properties. Many other such issues

arise, some of which will be discussed in more detail below.


                                      1
                                       2



         Perhaps the most commonly used measure of relative well—being

post and pre—retirement is the so—called replacement rate. Replacement

rates frequently are used in describing, and evaluating, the level of

social security or private pension benefits. They are, simply, a ratio

of some measure of post—retirement income to some, not necessarily similar,

measure of pre—retirement income. Many private pensions report the ratio

of the pension benefits to earnings in the year prior to retirement. A

frequent measure for social security is the ratio of social security benefits

to an average of the highest three of the ten years prior to retirement.

While such measures of relative well—being may be simplistic, and subsume

much about absolute versus relative incomes, the value of leisure, iitcome versus

consumption, ability to draw down theprincipal from accumulated savings, etc.,

they do tend to dominate public policy discussions. For example, recent proposals

to alter the structure of social security benefits were often criticized

because they would have reduced replacement rates, as usually measuréçl,

somewhat. Current replacment rates are due to fall slightly for low, and rise

somewhat for high, income families through time As we shall see, it is

by no means evident that average replacement rates are "low" as the usual

measures seem to imply, either from the standpoint of relative economic

position of pre— and post—retirement or from the standpoint of apparent

planning/foresight ability.

         The purpose of this paper is to begin to examine some of the issues

surrounding potential improvements in concepts and measures of replacement

rates. We are aware that more elaborate information may be useful, but since

much of the discussion undoubtedly will continue to take place in the context

of replacement rates, we seek to point toward some improvements in their
                                       3



 measurement. Some of these (potential) improvements have been suggested,

 explicitly or implicitly, in previous research. Section 2 presents a

 brief literature review focusing on concepts and measures of the economic

well—being of the elderly and/or of comparisons of post and pre—retirement

 incomes, consumption, wealth, etc.

          Section 3 highlights what we consider to be many of the major

 conceptual issues in measuring the well—being of the elderly relative to

 their previous standard of living. Among the issues raised are the

 treatment of taxes, expenses of raising children, health and health care

 costs, income uncertainty, and uncertainty about the date of death.

         Section 4 presents our empirical results, a series of measures of

replacement rates under alternative assumptions/definitions for various

groups in the elderly population. These are estimated from the longitudinal

Retirement History Survey combined with social security earnings records.

The adjustments we tentatively propose as reasonable lead to a quite different

perception about the "adequacy" of replacement rates, both for social security

and for total income, than the traditional measures.   Indeed, they suggest

that earnings are virtually fully replaced for many of the elderly by social

security alone; that for many more, social security replaces a large fraction

of earnings; and that total post—retirement income usually exceeds pre—

retirement income.

         Section 5 discusses potential future research. Included are the

need to go beyond averages to better understand the extent and causes of low

replacement rates among those elderly not very well off and to analyze more

fully the potential role by imperfections in annuities markets combined with
                                      4

rapidly increasing life expectancies for the elderly and difference between

anticipated and unanticipated beneficiaries. This section also offers a

brief summary and conclusion.

         The Appendix details the data and our use of them.

2. A Brief Literature Review

         A variety of previous studies have attempted to explore similar

or related questions to those we pose here. For example, Fox (1982)

calculates social security, pension and total income replacement rates

for 1976 for various population groups based on the first few waves of

the Retirement History Survey. While he makes several comparisons similar

in spirit to some of our adjustments (pre and post—tax; relative to career

average earnings, etc.), his results are comparable only to the earlier

years we report. The continued growth of social security benefits, the

additional benefits as spouses reach eligibility age and several other

factors, render our results noncomparable. Even by 1976, however, he

shows the importance such adjustments might make. However, his career

average earnings are indexed by wage growth and therefore greatly overstate

the average absolute real level of earnings; his career average replacement

rates have a relative income component imbedded in them.

         Schultz, et al. (1974) discuss alternative concepts and measures

of replacement. They report various organizations' notions of appropriate

measures of "full replacement." For example, the AAUP suggests comparing

post—retirement benefits to the last few years of after—tax earnings prior

to retirement, and that two—thirds is the appropriate replacement rate.

        Various cost—of—living comparisons by the Bureau of Labor Statistics

(1968) put the income required of a couple with husband aged 65—74 at 51

percent of that of a couple aged 35—54 with children 15 and six years of age.

Henle (1972) adjusts for differences in expenses and taxes and gets 0.7 and

0.8 as estimates of "full" replacement for high and low wage workers, respectively.
                                      6

        Marilyn Moon (1977), using data from the Survey of Economic

Opportunity of 1966—67, makes a variety of adjustments in the usual money

income measure to get a more comprehensive measure of the "real income" of the

elderly. Among her important adjustments are for in—kind transfers, the

annuitized value of assets (following Hansen and Weisbrod's (1968) approach),

etc. These adjustments substantially increase the incomes of the elderly.

         Boskin and Hurd (1982) establish that the cost—of—living for the

elderly as a group, and also by various five year age cohorts, is quite

close to that of the general population, once a rental equivalence

substitution is made (as is now being done in the CPI) in the historical

CPI figures. Thus, income measures will reflect real purchasing power.

         The most extensive recent treatment of the real income of the elderly

is by Hurd and Shoven (1982). They document the rapid absolute and relative

gains made by the elderly in the 1970s and attribute much of it to the

growth of real social security benefits.

         Hammermesh (1982) attempts to estimate consumption and annuitizable

income for a subsample of the Retirement History Survey. He reports for

1973 and 1975 that consumption exceeds annuitizable income and therefore

argues savings are inadequate to maintain consumption. While direct

examination of consumption is surely an important contribution, several

reasons lead us to be dubious of these conclusions. First, as noted above,

real benefits continued to increase in social security. Nore important, for

many of these families, the value of the spouse's social security benefit

would not be apparent until later on when he/she became eligible (it is

not apparent how Hammermesh treated spouse's and widow's benefits). Also,

at this stage of their lives, the elderly spend substantial amounts on
                                      7

health care, and (apparently) no adjustment is made for medicare. Most

important, the estimated ratio of consumption spending reported in the

Retirement History Survey to true consumption is about 0.6. The inclusion

of non—sustainability is sensitive to any potential measurement error in

the ratio.

         Finally, Kotlikoff, Spivak and Summers (1982) come to exactly the

opposite conclusion as Hammermesh, again examining early years of the

Retirement History Survey. They attempt to estimate two polar cases:

Simulating perfect annuities markets and no annuities markets. They calculate

the ratio of the level consumption paths which could be purchased when

young and old, respectively, based on the present expected value of lifetime

resources and old age resources in the annuities case; and the constant levels

which would be planned assuming no annuities but level consumption until

age 88. They also examine the level of the annuity which could be purchased

in 1969 versus 1971, to examine how the elderly manage their retirement

resources. They conclude that no strong case can be made that savings

are inadequate and that the ratios of old age to lifetime consumption streams

as constructed cluster around one or slightly above one. Their results

are not really comparable to ours, but are complementary in that they

examine consumption possibilities pre—retirement based on eventual realized

social security and pension "wealth"; we examine earnings pre—retirement,

a likely upper bound on actual consumption. Since it is unclear that consumption

plans pre—retirement could be based on expectation of the growth in social

security benefits and coverage which eventually occurred, including the

introduction of Medicare in 1965, an alternative interpretation of Kotlikoff,

et al. (1982) is possible. It may well be that these households did not expect
                                      8



these large windfalls and that their modest pre—retirement consumption

levels were due less to careful retirement planning than to lower

expected wealth.

         In brief summary, other than documenting the rise in real social

security benefits in recent years and the improved absolute and relative

income of the elderly, there is little agreement on whether consumption

can be maintained during retirement given current resources, or on the

proper measurement of consumption, or on what income or consumption—based

replacement rate is "appropriate."

3. Conceptual Issues

         The primary purpose of this paper is to compare the standard of

living of the elderly with their own standard of living in their earlier

work years. This topic raises several research questions. First, is the

observed pattern of consumption by age consistent with the perfect foresight

life cycle model, or is there evidence of sub—optimal saving during work life

resulting in inadequate provision for consumption during retirement? Second,

is there evidence that the large and unexpected windfall gains from social

security received by the Retirement History population (see Hurd and Shoven

(1983)) distorted the age profile of consumption for this group? Third,

what is the distribution of standard of living in retirement relative to

pre—retirement? What are the figures for those with different earnings

histories? Fourth, who in the population has low replacement rates? Who

is at the bottom of the replacement rate distribution, particularly among

the poor? We will not answer all of these questions, but they are our

research agenda.

         The problem we are addressing is not a simple one. There are both

serious methodological and measurement issues. Should the replacement rate

be defined in terms of consumption, income, or utility? While utility is

closest to what we would like, it is the least measureable. Consumption

is better than income, but again, consumption data is notoriously bad in

panel surveys. This leads us to an income based measure which can be

adjusted in several ways to make it more closely correspond with our more

ideal measures.

         The literature on replacement rates has always had unity as the

standard. Certainly for income based measures, however, there is no
                                        10



particular appeal to unity and the life cycle model would predict a

replacement rate below one. Take, for example, the simplest life cycle

model with a fixed lifetime D, fixed retirement age R, fixed labor earnings

between age 0 and R and a rate of time preference equal to the interest

rate.     If utility is time separable, if there is no bequest motive, and

if U" <   0, then the optimal age—consumption profile is flat, as shown in

Figure 1. The point for our purposes is that if we compare post—retirement

income (r W(age)), where r is the interest rate and W accumulated wealth,

with before retirement earnings, we get a ratio far less than unity,

highly dependent on the rate of return on accumulated wealth. For example,

if the interest rate were zero, an income based measure of replacement

rates would be zero, while there would be full replacement of consumption.

In fact, retirement income, in this example, must always be less than

consumption (which must be less than pre—retirement earnings). If it were

not, wealth would continue to accumulate and large bequests would be left.

However, this cannot be optimal since we have assumed U' > 0 and zero

bequest motive.

           While capital income in retirement in Figure 1 falls short of

pre—retirement earnings, the remaining wealth at each retirement year is

sufficient to finance a consumption annuity. If a tax—transfer version of

social security is imposed on the above life cycle model, it would lower

after—tax earnings during the work life and raise income during retirement.

Income based measures of replacement rates would be higher, but the basic

pattern would be similar and the magnitude would still be less than unity

if social secuEity benefits were fully anticipated and there were perfect

capital markets.

        The example above would change if we incorporate an uncertain

date of death. With perfect annuity markets, the analysis would be

identical to that of a certain death date at the life expectancy. However,

with imperfect or no annuity markets, the pattern of planned consumption

is more likely to decline with age. This is due to discounting at the

sum of the pure rate of time preference plus the mortality hazard rate

(which increases with age and which at least eventually exceeds the

interest rate).



A Notation for Discussing Some Important Issues

         We follow the usual convention of writing lifetime well—being as

an additively separable utility function of instantaneous, or annual,

utilities:


                         D
(1)               W =          u(C, Lt, Z)
                         t=l


where C, L, and Z are consumption of goods, leisure and a vector of

other variables at time t,        and D is the (known) date of death. Clearly,
additive separability is quite extreme in discussing lifetimes; for example,

a minimum consumption of food, medical care, etc., is necessary for survival.

We merely use this as a way of discussing issues, not as an estimation device.

         Further simplification divides the lifetime into two periods, working

years (W) and retirement (R). Representative utility in each period is

described by



                  U. =   U.(C.,                        I = W, R
(2)                1      11      L.,
                                   1
                                      Z.)
                                       1
                                          12


   Usually, W will be about twice (or more) as long as R. Let us, however,

   compare a typical or representative year in each period. We then need to

   evaluate



   (3)              uR(cR, LR, ZR)
                    U   (C1%1 Lw, Zw)



Of course, in actuality, income, consumption and other variables fluctuate

during both the work life and the retirement period. Some of this fluctuation

may represent errors in measurement and some imperfect capital markets and

therefore imperfect opportunities for smoothing. Most importantly, opportunities

for income generation are not constant during an individual's work life, These

considerations regarding income and consumption variability imply that there is

a large difference between career average consumption or income and the peaks of

these flows. Our judgment is that retirement resources should be compared with

career average resources as the base case, with other comparisons augmenting

this information.




  Some Conceptual Issues

              The first difficulty in usual replacement rate calculations or

  comparisons of consumption streams is readily apparent: the failure to value

  leisure or nonmarket work time. Obviously, LR >
                                                  Lw on average, as usually
  measured. The interpretation of this phenomenon is, however, quite complicated.

  For the "young" elderly without severe health problems, it is not reasonable

  to ignore the value of the extra nonmarket time available to them relative

  to working years. However, a variety of distortions, selection problems,

  etc., make it difficult to argue that the market wage of "similar" persons
                                    13

continuing to work is the relevant shadow value of the leisure at the margin.

Further, we suspect several institutional rigidities make it difficulty for

all those who wish to do so to move to part—time work (see Fuchs (1984), who

notes a trend to shift to self—employment presumably as one vehicle for

making hours more flexible). Blinder, et al. (1980) note a decline in hourly

earnings as the elderly change jobs. Presumably, valuing the marginal unit

of extra leisure at the corresponding wage of those who work places a lower

bound On the value of the first unit of leisure. But, as leisure (or

household work or volunteer time) becomes "full—time," it is likely that its

marginal value will fall. And the trend to earlier retirement2 at a time

of improved health of the elderly3 surely indicates the voluntary nature

of much of this tileisurell

         At the other extreme, the "old" elderly may contain a substantial

number of persons whose work would seriously impair their health. Others

may suffer severe psychological problems from withdrawal from the labor

force.

         All of these issues, and more, make. it difficult to value "leisure"

for the elderly. We only note the problems here and return to the more

usual meaures.

         The variable Z may include items such as age—specific expenses,

for example, in raising children or on health care. This immediately raises

additional issues. The direct utility function (3) may be rewritten in

indirect form:



                 vR(PR, IR)

                 vW(PW,


where P. is the vector of prices faced by the household in stage oflife i,

and I is income in i. Is gross income the appropriate measure to include
                                     14

in       In addition to netting out taxes (and perhaps pension contributions

and other retirement saving), what about "necessary" expenses? Suppose

K represents spending on children. If expenditure on children is perfectly

inelastic——a basic amount is necessary to "produce and raise" a standard

child, there is no joint consumption and no special utility value of children

early in life (children are a "durable good" providing (net) utility throughout

one's life), then the appropriate income measure is I — K and we should calculate


                     IR)

              Vw(Pw(Iw
                         -   K))

Even worse examples of ignoring expenditures on children exist. Suppose,

for example, one works more or harder and income increases more than

directly observed K when the children come along because of transactions

costs in borrowing. Then the observed extra income and consumption may

not measure increased utility, Of course, not all spending on children

is "necessary." Some is clearly for (attempted) quality improvement, or

discretionary. How should this be netted out?

         Analogous problems arise with health care expenditures. If the

demand for medical services is perfectly inelastic with a given amount

necessary to maintain health and amounts beyond that provide no utility,

then income net of health expenditure is the appropriate measure. If

demand for health care is not completely inelastic, actual health expenditures

are only a proxy for true health needs, and subtracting all expenditures

will understate "net" income. Again, observed income may rise to compensate

for greater medical costs (if he/she is able), further complicating the

story.

         Health expenditures rise substantially as a share of income in old

age. Further, the bulk of the costs are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid.
                                     15

 If we do not include at least the insurance value of Medicare in the

 retirement income, we ought to subtract net health insurance premiums from

 earnings during work years.

          Because the out—of—pocket hospital and physicians expenditures for

 the elderly are small relative to the total, it may well be that adding the

 average Medicare payment to the incomes of the elderly, as is often done,

would overstate the proper adjustment.

        While each of these problems is non—trivial, it is clear that

ignoring the public transfers in the insurance value of Medicare as income

sources for the elderly without netting health care costs for work years

will, on average, lead to an understatement of replacement rates. Thus,

the empirical results presented below probably understate replacement rates.

         Another important conceptual issue in comparing a certain income

stream from social security to an uncertain earnings stream is the discount

for risk in the earnings, or equivalently, the "certainty bonus," for

social security (aside from its annuity value). At one extreme,

capital markets may be so imperfect and informal intrafamily arrangements

nonexistent, that annual fluctuation in earnings may be quite a problem.

Even with perfect capital markets, however, the risk in career earnings

from occupational choice, etc., may be substantial. Define the equivalent

certain income as that which satisfies



               E U(y) =   U(y)

where y denotes a random income and y certain income. If y has mean m and

variance 2, taking a Taylor series expansion of U about m yields


                              2
               y m -      a
                       2 R(m)
                                       16



where R(m) E —       , what   is called the risk—tolerance in the finance

literature, or the reciprocal of the Arrow—Pratt measure of absolute risk

aversion. The difference between the mean and the equivalent certain income

is a tirisk charge." Alternatively, one can "gross—up" the certain income

with a certainty bonus in comparison with risky income flows. We make

such an adjustment below. To our empirical results we now turn.

4. Results

         We have computed replacement rates for the Retirement History Survey

population in a number of different ways, for various years, and for several

subpopulations. Table 1 displays the results for a conventional measure similar

to that frequently reported by the Social Security Administration. Two figures

are given for those retired in the 1971 through 1979 Survey waves;4 first,

the ratio of social security retirement benefits received to the average

of the highest three years of price—indexed earnings in the ten years

prior to retirement and second, the ratio of total income (pensions,

interest, dividends, rental income, earnings, transfers, social security,

etc.) in retirement to the same average high—three earnings figure. The

numbers are calculated separately for widows and for married couples. The

widows in our tables are those whose spouses died since the survey began

in 1969. This permits us to compare retirement benefits with the combined

earnings records of both spouses. These combined earnings histories are

the basis for the denominator for both widows and married couples.

         The social security numbers in Table 1 seem rather modest, ranging

for married couples from 22 percent replacement in 1971 to 37.4 percent in

1979. They are lower for widows by a factor only slightly different than

two—thirds, which is what we anticipated. Our priors were based on the fact

that single earner married couples who wait until 65 years of age to collect

retirement receive 150 percent of their "Primary Insurance Amount", while

the surviving spouse receives 100 percent.5   The average social security

replacement rate for married couples in this population increased by more

than 50 percent from 1971 to 1979. This reflects a number of facts. First,

at the later dates both spouses are more likely to be collecting social

security rather than just one. Second, those who retire at later dates

and ages receive actuarial adjustments in their annuities. Third, as

this population ages, it works less and therefore fewer of the retired

give back their social security benefits via the earnings test. Fourth,

the real level of benefits was increased in 1972 and rose further for

those who worked in the double indexing period of 1973—77. Despite the

rise in the social security replacement rate for married couples, their

total unadjusted replacement rate remained virtually constant at 70 percent.

This may indicate that the population is decumulating private assets in a

way which offsets their increased social security receipts. The significant

difference between the average total replacement rates in Table 1 and

the average social security replacement rates indicates that those who rely

totally on social security have reasonably low resources available to

them in retirement relative to their pre—retirement earnings.

         Table 2 compares retirement income with 1951—74 career average

real earnings where earnings have been indexed using the Personal Consumption

Expenditure deflator of the National Income Accounts. The pattern of the

figures in Table 2 is very similar to those in Table 1, but the level is

increased by roughly 50 percent.6 Interestingly, the average total replacement

rate for married couples is 100 percent by 1979 when the denorninator is career

average indexed earnings. The social security replacement rate with this

basis for comparison is over 50 percent by 1979. The 50 percent increase in
replacement rates of Table 2 versus Table 1 reflects both the issues previously

mentioned: income variability and the extraordinary real wage growth that

members of this generation experienced near the ends of their careers.

        Tables 3 and 4 show social security, social security plus private

pensions, and total replacement rates where the denominator is average

high—three out of the ten years prior to retirement. The figures are

calculated for different income groups, where the income classifying variable

is career average real earnings expressed in 1983 dollars. The figures in

parentheses are sample sizes. The numbers indicate that the poor have by

far the highest social security replacement rates, and even have the

highest total replacement rates. By 1979, the total replacement rate was

100 percent even relative to the average of the high—three earnings years

for those with average career earnings below $7,500. Social security

replacement rates (in 1979) are 57.4 percent for married couples with low

earnings histories, but only 19.4 percent for those whose high earnings

years were between $30,000 and $50,000. We also see that private pensions

are an important component of total retirement income, although less so

for those in the lowest earnings history category.7

         Tables 5 and 6 contain the same information except that the standard

of comparison is the 1951—74 career average indexed earnings. Now the total

replacement rate is 88.2 percent for the middle income ($12,500 to $20,000)

group of married couples in 1979; higher for the lower earnings groups and

lower for the higher earnings groups. The total replacement rate is over

100 percent even for widows in the lowest earnings category. Perhaps a

surprising finding of Tables 3 —   5 is that those in the lowest earnings

category have substantial non—social security income sources, at least

relative to their own pre—retirement earnings histories. We did an investi-

gation of their retirement income sources and found that the largest non-

social security component was earnings. Income composition by earnings class

for married couples in 1979 is shown in Table 7. Those with low career

average earnings are far more likely to work part time in retirement. Those

in the lowest category were still making more than one—third of their pre—

retirement earnings in 1979, while the corresponding figure was less than

a'1nounts in Table 7.

          Tables 8—12 show the effect of making three of the adjustments

we discussed above for married couples with different levels of career

average earnings. The replacement rates are relative to 1951—74 career indexed

average earnings. The three adjustments reflect taxes, the costs of raising

children, and the welfare effects of uncertainty of income and wealth. The

tax adjustments take into account the payroll tax, the mildly progressive

average income tax rates in the United States (Pechman, 1983), and the facts

that social security benefits were untaxed until 1984 and the elderly enjoy

double personal exemptions. The children adjustment is only a rough

approximation of the necessary costs of raising children. While children

presumably generate utility for their parents, it is implausible that a

couple with grown children requires the sameresources in retirement as they

did when raising the children to achieve the same standard or living.

Whether all costs of raising children should be deducted from pre—retirement

resources before making the comparison with post—retirement income is open

to question, but that is roughly what we have done. We have assumed that

the married couples had two children, that child raising costs account for

twenty—eight percent of all consumption in child raising years (for two—child

families, see Lazear and Michael, 1983) and that child raising years are

roughly half of the adult work life, but the first half (and, therefore,

count for more than half in present value). We have made a rough adjustment

by lowering the denomiator (career average earnings) by 20 percent because

of child raising expenses. This reduction is substantially less than

the BLS estimates of expense differences for elderly couples relative

to middle age families with children. The third adlustment is also very

difficult to measure precisely. Certainly younger workers have substantial

uncertainty about both next year's earnings and, more relevant, perhaps,

the value of their human capital. Retired couples, on the other hand,

probably have less uncertainty about the value of their social security

claim. We feel we have made a relatively conservative correction for the

comparative certainty of social security. We have estimated the trend growth

and variation about trend of earnings and taken the one period utility

function to be the natural log of consumption. Many estimates suggest that

households display more risk aversion than this implies. The net effect

of adding the "certainty bonus" is to raise the social security benefits by

roughly ten percent relative to other income sources.9

         Table 8 shows the effect of these adjustments for our category

with the lowest earnings history. The tax adjustment is small for this group.

The replacement rates, after these three adjustments, however, are 50 percent

higher and are, in general, extremely high. By 1979, the social security

replacement rate is in excess of 150 percent and the total rate is 250 percent.

Table 10 shows the same adjustments for those with career average earnings

between $12,500 and $20,000. The total adjusted replacement rate is over

one hundred percent for all years and the social security adjusted replacement

rate alone is over 75 percent. In fact, our adjusted total replacement rates

exceed 100 percent of career average earnings for all income classes in all

years. It should be noted that several of the omitted adjustments would tend
                                     22


to raise replacement rates further. For example, while our tax adjustment

does take into account social security contributions during the working life,

we do not subtract from earnings the contributions to pensions or other

means of retirement asset accumulation. Second, we have not annuitized

wealth at all in the retirement period. Our total replacement includes

capital income, but the principal is left intact as if the household was

planning to live forever. This effect may be offset since inflation may

exaggerate capital income. We have not corrected interest income or dividends

for inflation. Neither have we attributed retained earnings to equityholders.

It is our view that the sum of all the inflation adjustments would leave

our figures little changed. The total evidence of Tables 8 through 12, then,

seems quite conclusive that retirement resources are at least adquate to

finance consumption at the average pre—retirement consumption level.

         Tables 13 and 14 divide the Retirement History population of couples

by year of retirement. Table 13 shows the fully adjusted social security

replacement rates, while Table 14 shows fully adjusted total replacement

rates. The first year after retirement is unusual for a number of reasons.

We do not know the exact timing of retirement, so we may pick up some pre—

retirement earnings and may have less than a full year of social security

benefits. Also, there may be some severance pay or lump sum settlements

of retirement plans. Thus the main diagonal elements are the least dependable

numbers. Table 13 shows that the social security benefits of each wave of

retirees rose in the year following retirement. This is due to the spouse

collecting benefits at a later point in time, the increase in the generosity

of the system in 1972, and the gradual reduction in the effect of the

earnings test. By 1979, the fully adjusted social security replacement

rates were over 80 percent for all vintages of retirees. Table 14 gives

the same picture for total income. The figures are essentially constant

with time since retirement, in contrast to the social security numbers,

and are at least 150 percent for all retirement cohorts.

         Such high replacement rates seem to us most consistent with the

notion that these cohorts of elderly retirees did not fully anticipate their

social security wealth windfalls and hence in an ex post sense, oversaved.

Had they known how large their benefits would become, they may well have

preferred to consume more earlier in life, saving less for retirement and

driving total replacement rates toward unity. Our numbers seem to contradict

Hammermesh's (1982) contention that consumption cannot be maintained in

retirement, but that is with the benefit of several more years worth of data.

Since we find it implausible that the rate of time preference plus the

mortality hazard rate falls short of the interest rate for these households,

we prefer the interpretation that this apparent "oversaving" was unplanned,

not the careful foresight hinted by Kotlikoff, et al. (1982).

5.   Conclusion

Summary

          Our results suggest that by the late 1970s our sample had quite
                                            10
high average replacement rates, as adjusted. The income available to them

usually exceeds that available on average during their working lives.

Indeed, had they anticipated their social security benefit growth, they

probably would have consumed more earlier in their lifetime.

          Traditional measures of replacement rates are quite misleading

today. Just replacing "highthree" average earnings by career average

earnings increases replacement rates by 50 percent. Calculated either way,

social security replacement rates increased about 50 percent from 1971 to 1979.

          Replacement rates are substantially in excess of one by 1979 for

most income classes. Social security alone fully replaces average earnings

for the elderly poor and replaces over half for middle income elderly couples

once adjustments are made for childrearing costs, taxes, and risky earnings.



Further Research

          We hope the previous discussion and analysis prove useful in

reevaluating concepts and measures of earnings replacement. But, we view

the above as the first part of a larger research agenda. Among the important

issues (in addition to improving the current measures) we hope to address

are the following:

          1. The distribution of replacement rates with special emphasis

             on those with low rates in the low earnings categories;

          2. The differences between and implications of anticipated and

             unanticipated social security benefit growth and replacement

             rates for cohorts of different ages;
                            25



3. The relationship of the ratio of the length of the retirement

    period to the working period and replacement rates. Just

    examining the ratio for a typical year is only part of the

    story. The ratio could be high, say two, but if R is only

    a few years and W many, the implications of such ratios are

    quite different.

4. Alternative saving scenarios and public/private retirement

    income substitution assumptions and their implications for

    replacement rates;

5. The annuity value of social security under alternative

   assumptions concerning private annuities markets;

6. Variations in replacement rates by occupation/industry and

   their implications;

7. The cracks in the safety net——who falls through due to lack

   of coverage, marital status, earnings histories, etc. For

   example, widows of uncovered workers may not have adequate

   protection from private insurance/pensions/saving.

                                   APPENDIX


          This appendix briefly describes the Retirement History Survey

data, the criteria used to select our sub—sample, our definition of

replacement rate, the adjustments applied in deriving our improved measures

of replacement rates and our methods for aggregating replacement rates.



1. Data

          The Retirement History study was a ten—year longitudinal survey of

the retirement process conducted for the Social Security Administration.

11,153 persons born between 1905 and 1911 were selected for the survey in

1969. There was substantial attrition (by placement in nursing homes or

loss of contact as well as by death) for each successive biennial survey,

so that 7,352 original respondents or their widows remained to answer the

last survey in 1979.

          Respondents were surveyed in odd—numbered years concerning current

family composition, labor force participation, health, activities, and

assets and wealth and concerning the previous (even—numbered) years' income

and benefits. Replacement rates are calculated here for the years prior to

the survey years.

          The Social Security Administration prepared a matched data set of

its records of the survey respondents' and spouses' covered earnings through

1974. It is this information which was used to determine the earnings histories

which formed the denominator in the calculation of replacement rates.

          Social Security Administration records consider only the earnings

for each year in each job which totalled less than the year's maximum taxable
                                      27



earnings. In cases where reported covered earnings equalled or exceeded

the taxable maximum, the following imputation procedures were used:

          The few cases of covered earnings above the taxable maximum were

taken as given. In these instances the person paid taxes in two or more

jobs. We assumed that earnings in neither job exceeded the taxable maximum.

          In cases where covered earnings equalled the taxable maximum, we

assumed that the taxable maximum was attained in the middle of the last

quarter in which taxes were paid. If, for example, the respondents finished

paying social security taxes in the third quarter, we imputed his year's

wage income to be 8/5 times the taxable maximum. This method should prove

relatively unbiased, if inexact.



2. Selection of Subsample

          Our estimates understate pre—retireinent earnings for workers who

spent a substantial portion of their career in jobs not covered by social

security. To limit this bias, we sought to restrict our subsample to

Retirement History Survey respondents who had spent most of their working

lives in the social security system. This required four categories of

excluded households:


1.   284 households that received federal or military pension income were

     dropped from the sample.

2. We excluded households which never retired. We define retirement as

     occurring in the year before the first Retirement History Survey in

     which the respondent reports being either completely or partly retired

     and the spouse (if any) reports an employment status of "keeping house,"
                                      28


    "retired," "unable to work," or "other" as opposed to "working,"

    "with a job but not at work," or "looking for work." A total of

    2,225 households failed to satisfy these criteria before the Retirement

    History Survey study was completed or the respondent and spouse (if

    any) both died.

3. 715 households were dropped for having paid no social security taxes

    between 1958 and 1974.

4. We eliminated households with unusually high replacement rate values——

    any households with a social security income replacement rate above

    250 percent, a pension income replacement rate above 200 percent or a

    total income replacement rate above 400 percent. These 1,154 excluded

    households typically had low career average earnings. About half had

    career average earnings——as estimated from social security tax payments——

    of less than $1,000 in 1983 dollars, indicating that most had spent a

    substantial fraction of their working lives in sectors of the economy

    not covered by social security.


        Because the "retirement date" is somewhat ambiguous (we do not know

exactly when during the period the person retired), the interpretation of

actual annual earnings and social security benefits is difficult.   To

minimize this problem, we "skip" one survey wave to make certain we are

not confounding retirement with part of a year's work.   Thus, for each year

reported in the tables, the percentage of the sample already retired might

appear low; however, the data refer to those who had retired by the next

(two year) earlier wave; e.g., for 1971, the retirement occurred by 1968,

and does not include those who retired in 1969 and 1970. For example, in

Table 5, about ten percent of the total sample is counted retired in 1971.
                                        29


 Actually, an additional 268 households in our sample retired between 1969

 and 1971, and thus the total actually retired (as opposed to having "clean

 data" for the year) by 1971 was 29 percent.

             Since replacement rates can be most sensibily compared within groups

 of relatively homogeneous composition, we limit our subsamples to (1) married

 couples who remain alive and together for all six surveys from 1969 to

 1979, and (2) widows who lose their husbands between 1969 and 1979 and live

 until 1979. Replacement rates for widows are calculated starting the

 later of the year of retirement and the year of widowhood.

             Finally, households with missing values for social security, pension

or total income were excluded from calculations of the replacement rates using

that type of income in the numerator.


3. Replacement Rate Definitions

         The replacement rate numerators used in this paper were derived

from data on post—retirement income reported in the Retirement History

Surveys. For each Retirement History Survey wave starting with retirement,

we calculated:     (1) social security income, (2) social security plus

pension income, and (3) total income from all sources. Married couples'

figures include the incomes of both husband and wife. Total income was

constructed by summing the households' income from wages, interest and

dividends, rent, annuities, pensions, relatives, disability benefits,

state welfare benefits, workers' compensation, AFDC, unemployment insurance,

SSI and social security (old age, disability, survivor's and black lung

benefits).

         In a typical Retirement History Survey wave, between five and ten

percent of our subsample households report missing values for social security
                                       30

income or social security plus pension income. Because total income is

"missing" if any of its many components is badly reported, about one—third

of the subsample households do not have usable values for total post—

retirement income. However, social security and pension income replacement

rates do not differ significantly between households with valid and invalid

values for total income. Thus, within a given set of replacement rates

for social security income, social security plus pension income and total

income, the three replacement rates may be compared even though they are

averages based on somewhat different samples.

            Like all other dollar figures used in this paper, the Retirement

History Survey post—retirement income data in these numerators were converted

to constant 1983 dollars using the Personal Consumption Expenditure deflator.
            A description of how we netted income taxes out of the numerator

in our replacement rate calculations is presented below.

            The replacement rate denominator attempts to measure a household's

pre—retirernent standard of living. We focus on two basic denominators,

calculated from wage earnings estimated from social security tax payments.

For each year from 1951 to 1974, the respondent's (plus spouse, if any)

wage earnings were inflated to 1983 dollars. Then two averages were

computed. "Career Average Annual Indexed Earnings" is average earnings

over all years from 1951 to the earlier of retirement or 1974. "High—three

Average Annual Indexed Earnings," on the other hand, is the average of the

three highest years' earnings in the ten years before the most receflt year

of positive social security tax payments. This ten year period is 1965 to

1974 at the latest, as 1974 is the last year fOr which we have social security

tax data.

            In all but our unadjusted replacement rates, taxes are netted out

of the numerator and the denominator. Census Bureau data were used to
                                        31


estimate average effective tax rates for our six income classes. We derived

the following average rates for federal income, state income, and social

security taxes for the pre—retirement period 1951 to 1974:


               Income                                 Rate

                   $7,500                             3.89%

               $7,500 — $12,500                       6.22%

               $12,500 — $20,000                     10.49%

               $20,000 — $30,000                     14.74%

               $30,000 — $50,000                     17.44%

               >   $50,000                           25.37%


Our estimated post-retirement average tax rates for federal and state

income taxes for 1968, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1976 and 1978 are:


                     Income                   Rate

                     <   $7,500               0.47%

                     $7,500 — $12,500         2.81%

                     $12,500 — $20,000        7.09%

                     $20,000 — $30,000       11.47%

                     $30,000 — $50,000       15.48%

                     >   $50,000             24.43%


Households were assigned to a pre—retirement tax bracket based on their

career average annual indexed earnings augmented by 14 percent to allow

for unearned income. A household's post—retirement tax bracket depended

on its total Retirement History Survey income, and could vary from survey

to survey. Retirees were allowed an extra personal exemption, further

reducing their effective tax rates.
                                      32


         Replacement rates which include the "children's adjustment" were

based on denominators that were reduced by 20 percent of the pre—tax value

of the denominator. The size of this adjustment is derived from Lazear

and Michael (1983).

         The fully adjusted replacement rate figures reported in this

paper include social security income augmented by a certainty bonus, as

described in the main body of the paper.



4. Aggregation of Replacement Rates

         The replacement rates reported in each cell of our tables are

means of the replacement rates of the households in the relevant cell.

For example, in Table 1 we see that, on average, for married couples who

satisfy all our selection criteria, the (indexed) social security income

reported in the 1979 Retirement History Survey wave replaced 37.4 percent

of high—three average annual indexed earnings.

         In all tables, except Tables 14 and 15, cell averages exclude

households that just became retired or widowed. A household whose status

has just changed tends to have higher replacement rates than a similar

household that became retired or widowed in an earlier survey. Often this

difference is spurious, resulting, for example, from pre—retirement wage

income being reported in the same Retirement History Survey in which

retirement first occurs.

 4. This time period was somewhat unusual for at least two reasons.   First,

     the very substantial growth in real social security benefits from 1969—

     73 was almost certainly not anticipated. Thus, these "windfalls" might

     have a different impact on behavior, e.g., private asset accumulation

     for retirement, than benefit increases which were anticipated enough in

     advance to allow a very different lifetime consumption/saving plan to be

     followed. Future beneficiaries may save a smaller proportion of their

    income and have less capital income in retirement.

        Second, real wages grew at unusually rapid rates in the l960s, and

    thus both the benefits and the "high—three" earnings years may be somewhat

    high relative to a normal wage growth history.

5. The widow's benefit was increased to 100 percent of PIA in 1972.

6. Data from the continuous work history survey indicate the peak earnings

    year was 3—5 years prior to retirement. Thus 'high—thred' in the last ten

    boils down to the peak of the life cycle earnings pattern.

7. We have data on pension income, not the terms of the pension payments.

    Some (unknown) fraction of these payments are not annuities and may

    cease prior to the recipient's date of death.

8. We hope to explore who are, and why, these respondents with low career

   average earnings but high property income in subsequent work.

 9. Of course, other risk—sharing devices exist, such as unemployment

     insurance, AFDC, etc., so variable earnings in many cases have an

     income floor.

10. Recall the provisos noted in fn. 4 about the special nature of our sample

    and time period.
