                                             ABSTRACT

We study the distortions to industrial organization caused by entry regulation. We take advantage

of heterogeneity across industries in their natural barriers and growth opportunities to examine

whether some industries are differentially affected by country-level entry regulation. In industries

with high natural entry barriers, entry regulation has little impact on the quantity and average size

of firms in an industry. By contrast, in industries with low natural entry barriers, countries with high

entry regulation have relatively few, large firms. We find no relation between natural entry barriers

and overall industry share of manufacturing, as a function of entry regulation. Utilizing firm-level

data, we show that operating margins are relatively high in low barrier industries in high entry

regulation countries. Finally, we analyze the ability of industries to take advantage of shocks to

growth opportunities. In countries with high entry regulation, industries respond to growth

opportunities through the expansion of existing firms, while in countries with low entry regulation,

the response is through the creation of new firms; the total sectoral response is invariant to the level

of regulation. Our results suggest that regulation distorts the structure of industry, promoting industry

concentration, but does not have measurable effects on intersectoral allocations.

Economists have presented two contrasting views of government regulation of economic

activity.     Under the Public Choice view (Stigler (1971), regulation is acquired by

industries, and is designed and operated for their benefit, through the increased market

power that regulation allows. By contrast, the Public Interest perspective, as initially

suggested by Pigou (1938), holds that industry will be fraught with inefficiencies

stemming from market failures of all kinds, if left to its own devices. Regulation is

therefore required to achieve socially efficient outcomes. Both perspectives suggest that

entry regulation in particular will have an impact on industrial structure by directly

influencing the costs of starting a new enterprise in a given industry, but differ in their

views on the relative tradeoff between the correction of externalities and the creation of

market power. In order to appropriately assess the extent of this tradeoff requires some

empirical sense of the actual distortions that may be caused by regulatory burdens. That

is the purpose of this paper.

          There exists a nascent empirical literature examining the impact of entry

regulation on economic outcomes. Two recent papers take contrasting approaches on this

issue. Djankov, La Porta, Lopes-de-Silanes, and Shleifer1 (2002) document significant

differences across countries in the ease with which firms may open new businesses.

They go on to examine a number of country-level outcomes and find that, consistent with

the Public Choice view, entry regulation is associated with higher corruption and larger

unofficial economies, but not higher quality of public or private goods. Bertrand and

Kramarz (2002) look more closely at the effects of entry regulation on employment of the

retail sector in France, taking advantage of regional and temporal variation in the

stringency with which entry regulation was applied. They find that entry regulation

decreases retail employment, partly due to the increase in concentration and the ensuing

price upturns.

        In our paper, we take an approach that empirically straddles the two papers

described above. We will take advantage of heterogeneity across industries in their

natural barriers and growth opportunities to examine whether some industries are

differentially affected in countries with high levels of entry regulation. This will allow us

to examine how entry regulation differentially influences industrial structure, as a

function of industry characteristics, and the opportunities available to firms in that

industry. This approach contrasts with DLLS, who examine the impact of regulation only

at the country level – our approach will allow for the inclusion of both country and

industry fixed-effects, which mitigates some concerns of unobserved heterogeneity and

reverse causality. Furthermore, DLLS examine only ultimate (social) outcomes of entry

regulation, rather than the direct impact upon industry structure that would be the primary

consequence of regulations according to the Public Choice view (in its “acquired

regulation” formulation). Also, in contrast to Bertrand and Kramarz, by considering a

range of industries and countries, we are able to study the differential impact of

regulation across industries, and reflect on how it varies across a much broader range of

institutional structures.

        Our methodology is similar to the approach popularized by Rajan and Zingales

(1998), in that we utilize U.S. data at the industry level to proxy for underlying industry

characteristics that have arisen in an economy with relatively few institutional




                                                                                           2
constraints. Also following the approach of Rajan and Zingales, we then examine how

the relation between (underlying) industry characteristics and actual industry structure is

affected by the extent of entry regulation. We report three primary sets of findings; the

intuition behind each is summarized in the following paragraph.

       First, we consider the effect of entry regulation on the (static) structure of

industry. We find that in industries with high natural barriers to entry (and hence little

need for additional barriers through regulation), entry regulation has little impact on the

quantity and average size of firms in an industry. By contrast, in industries with low

natural entry barriers, countries with high entry regulation have few, large firms, relative

to less regulated economies. Surprisingly, there is no relation between natural entry

barriers and overall industry share of manufacturing, as a function of entry regulation.

Second, utilizing firm-level data, we show that operating margins are relatively high in

low barrier industries in high entry regulation countries (relative to high natural barrier

industries). Together, these results suggest that, while entry regulation does not distort

intersectoral allocation, the within-industry organization of production is affected by the

regulation of entry.   We then examine the impact of entry regulation on industry

dynamics, by analyzing the ability of industries to take advantage of shocks to growth

opportunities. These results parallel those on static industry structure: in countries with

high entry regulation, industries respond to growth opportunities through the expansion

of existing firms, while in countries with low entry regulation, the response is primarily

through the creation of new firms. Moreover, we find that the investment response to

growth opportunities is stronger in countries with low entry regulation, when we limit the




                                                                                          3
sample to richer countries.     Once again, we find that the total sectoral response is

invariant to the level of regulation.

       Overall, our results provide a consistent body of evidence suggesting that

regulation distorts the (within) structure of industry, promoting industry concentration,

but does not have measurable effects on intersectoral allocations. It is plausible that there

may be some socially beneficial elements to the entry regulations that we examine.

However, given the distortions that we uncover, combined with the absence of any

measurable benefits, we argue in our discussion that the results collectively favor the

Public Choice view of regulation.

       The rest of the paper will be structured as follows: In Section 1, we further

elaborate on our methodology. Section 2 describes the datasets that we have brought

together for this paper. Our main results and their interpretation are presented in Section

3, and Section 4 contains our conclusions and discussion.



1. Methodology

1.A. Entry Regulation and Industry Structure

Our first approach is based on the assumption that there exist industries that have

‘naturally’ high entry barriers. The underlying sources of these barriers are of secondary

importance to our study, but may include a range of factors, such as capital intensiveness

of production or technological complexity. For our purposes, what is necessary is that

there exists some component of these barriers that is industry specific and invariant




                                                                                           4
across countries, say Ki, where i indexes industry.2 Furthermore, we observe that models

of entry with fixed costs generally predict a convex relationship between the size of fixed

costs and the number of firms in an industry.3 Thus, we may consider the total (fixed)

cost of entry to be Ki + Rc, where Rc is the cost associated with entry regulation in

country c. Since the number of firms, Nic is convex in Ki + Rc, ∂ 2 N ic ∂K i ∂Rc > 0 . For

constant     demand,       it   also        follows            that   for   average   firm   size,   Qic/Nic,

∂ 2 (Q / N ) ic ∂K i ∂Rc < 0 , where Qic is total industry output.                       The intuition is

straightforward: If ‘natural’ industry entry barriers Ki are extremely high (as in, say,

petroleum refineries or tobacco), then the marginal impact of an increase in a (relatively

small) cost of entry, Rc, will be small. However, if industry entry barriers are close to

zero, the marginal impact of Rc may be quite significant.

          A suitable test for this conjecture would examine the interaction between natural

entry barriers and entry regulation. If the presence of natural entry barriers mitigates the

impact of entry regulation on industry structure, we would expect to see this effect

empirically in the interaction of (natural) entry barriers and entry regulation. Our

regressions will thus take the form:



    (1)      Log(No. of firms)ic=       i   +       c   + *(Entry Barrier)i*(Entry Regulation)c +      ic


    (2)      Log(Avg. Firm Size)ic=             i   +    c   + *(Entry Barrier)i*(Entry Regulation)c +      ic




2
  Dunne and Roberts (1991) describe a set of industry characteristics that explain much of inter-industry
variations in turnover rates. Furthermore, they find that the correlation between those industry
characteristics and the industry turnover pattern is stable over time, which they take as an indication these
correlation actually result from differences in technologies across industries. This is confirmed by the
evidence presented by Cable and Schwalbach (1991) on systematic inter-industry figures.
3
  This is true, for example, of a simple Cournot model with free entry, and (fixed) linear demand.


                                                                                                             5
For our main results, we will use firm turnover (defined below as entry + exit) in the

United States, USTurnoveri, as a proxy for industry-specific entry barriers.4                           High

turnover will be taken as a sign of relative ease of entry, i.e., turnover is negatively

correlated with entry barriers.5 This has been suggested by Dunne and Roberts (1991).

They report high inter-industry correlations between entry and exit figures, justifying the

characterization of industries with high natural entry barriers as those exhibiting

relatively high entry and exit barriers. More specifically, they argue that industries can be

characterized by turnover ratios as a function of industry-specific levels of sunk costs.6

That suggests translating (1) and (2) into the following specifications that may be

estimated with available data:



    (3)      Log(No. of firms)ic=       i   +       c   + *USTurnoveri*(Entry Regulation)c +       ic


    (4)      Log(Avg. Firm Size)ic=             i   +    c   + *USTurnoveri*(Entry Regulation)c +       ic




As suggested above, we predict a negative coefficient on the interaction term in (3) and a

positive coefficient on the interaction term in (4).7


4
  As a robustness check, we also used the mean industry-level turnover from a set of seven developed
countries (Belgium, Canada, Germany, U.K., Norway, Portugal and the USA). Our results are robust to this
alternative specification.
5
  One may think of three ‘classes’ of entry barriers: (1) regulatory (2) ‘technical’ exogenous (e.g., capital
intensity) (3) endogenous but consistent across countries (e.g., advertising). Anything else will be
effectively in our error term. Now, our measure of turnover in the U.S. incorporates both (2) and (3), and
we cannot differentiate between a technological need for scale, versus an industry’s affinity for creating
entry barriers through investment. Analyzing these differences would be interesting, since responses may
vary according to different types of barriers; we leave this exercise, however, for future research. From our
perspective, it does not matter why there exist barriers, simply that they exist and that some component of
them is consistent across countries.
6
  An alternative measure of natural entry barriers could be given by considering just the ‘entry’ rate;
however, this measure is more directly influenced by the life cycle of each industry. We include analyses
using this alternative measure of entry barriers in the Appendix.
7
  Note that we also ran specifications that looked at the share of number of firms by industry, and found
results that paralleled those derived from (3). These results are available from the authors.


                                                                                                             6
1.B. Entry Regulation and Industry Margins

It is possible that any effects uncovered by regressions (3) and (4) could be the result of

‘artificial’ firm boundaries. Under this hypothesis, industry structure is identical across

all levels of entry regulation in actual functioning, but there are different demarcations

‘on paper’ simply to avoid regulatory costs. To test whether there is an impact on actual

industry structure, we utilize a measure of operating margins, a dependent variable that

directly reflects the ability of firms to set prices above costs. We supplement (3) and (4)

with a parallel set of regressions on margins, focusing once again on the interaction of

‘natural’ entry barriers and regulation:



    (5)      Marginic=     i   +   c   + * USTurnoveri*(Entry Regulation)c +        ic




Since high entry regulation is expected to have a greater impact on market power

whenever natural barriers are low (i.e., turnover is high), we expect a positive coefficient

in the interaction term in equation (5).



1.C. Entry Regulation and Response to Growth Opportunities

We now consider the dynamic effects of entry regulation. If a growth opportunity arises,

entry regulation may prevent potential entrants from responding to the new opportunity.8

For incumbents, however, the opportunity presents a chance for expansion, protected

from the competitive pressures that would be present in less regulated environments.

8
  If there exists an optimal firm size, from a technological perspective, all adjustment to demand shocks
should take place through changes in the number of firms. The possibility of supply shocks that affect
optimal firm structure precludes any general statement on this point.


                                                                                                       7
That is, high entry regulation will promote the expansion of firm size in response to

growth opportunities, whereas low entry regulation will promote an expansion in the

number of firms where growth opportunities arise. We examine the existence of this

differential response by looking at the interaction terms in the following specifications:



   (6)     Growth(No. of Firms)ic=      i   +   c   +

                             *(Growth Opportunity)i*(Entry Regulation)c +           ic


   (7)     Growth(Avg. Firm Size)ic=        i   +   c   +

                             *(Growth Opportunity)i*(Entry Regulation)c +           ic




Similar to the previous sections, if entry regulation distorts responses to growth

opportunities, we predict   < 0 in (6) and          > 0 in (7). Estimating (6) and (7) requires a

measure of global shocks to growth opportunities. Following Fisman and Love (2003a),

we use actual growth in the United States as a proxy. The rationale is very similar to that

described above: assuming that U.S. firms are in an institutional environment that allows

them to optimally respond to growth opportunities, we may write:



   (8)     USGrowthi = (Global Growth Opportunity)i +             iUS




That is, actual growth in the United States is a measure of global shocks to opportunities,

plus some U.S.-specific shock   iUS.   We may then simply rewrite (6) and (7) as:




                                                                                               8
     (9)      Growth(No. of Firms)ic=       i   +   c   +

                                 *(USGrowth)i*(Entry Regulation)c +            ic


     (10)     Growth(Avg. Firm Size)ic=         i   +   c   +

                                 *(USGrowth)i*(Entry Regulation)c +            ic




2. Data

The data on regulation of entry of start-up firms are from DLLS (2002), which contains

information on the regulations of 77 countries in 1999. Our choice for the measure of

entry regulation includes the entire cost incurred by a prospective firm in order to obtain

legal status to operate, as a fraction of per capita GDP. As described by DLLS, it includes

all identifiable official expenses, together with the monetary value of the entrepreneur’s

time.9 We acknowledge that, although we limit ourselves to manufacturing industries,

there is still very likely within-industry variation in regulation. Unfortunately, we have

not been able to obtain reliable information at the industry level; hence, we use the

country-level measure of entry regulation described above, keeping this caveat in mind.

           As our measure of natural entry barriers, we use firm turnover, as explained in the

previous section. Following the intuition of RZ of interpreting US data as ‘industry

representative’ of an optimal economy, we use US turnover data as our proxy for natural

barriers of entry.10 We obtain these data from Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1988),

which contains firm-level entry and exit data based on U.S. census data; we define


9
 This variable is identified as Cost + time in DLLS.
10
  Alternatively, we used average turnover ratios from a subset of 7 countries: Belgium, Canada, Germany,
Norway, Portugal, UK and USA (as reported by Roberts, 1996). Our results are robust to this specification.


                                                                                                        9
turnover as the simple sum of entry and exit, deflated by the number of firms in the

industry.11

        High-income countries may be expected to have technological characteristics that

are more similar to those of U.S. firms. Hence, U.S. turnover may be a better proxy for

technological barriers to entry primarily for richer countries, and as a result, we may wish

to restrict our analyses to wealthier countries in what follows. We construct an auxiliary

dummy variable called RICH which takes on a value of 1 if the country has per capita

income greater than the median of our sample and zero otherwise. Throughout, we will

present results for both our full sample of countries, as well as the limited sample of

countries with RICH=1.12 The reasons for this are twofold: first, our U.S.-based proxies

for growth opportunities and natural barriers are more applicable to more advanced

economies. Also, since the UNIDO data are based on national industrial censuses, data

from countries with RICH=1 are of higher quality than that of the less developed

countries in the broader sample.13

        Our outcome variables are derived from the United Nations’ UNIDO database,

which provides data on production, value-added, number of employees, number of

establishments and total wages bill, by industry, for a sample of 57 countries. We will use

two country-industry specific outcome variables in our main regressions: average firm

size, defined as the (log of the) ratio of industry value added to industry total number of

establishments; and the (log of the) number of establishments in each industry.14 The use


11
   Dunne and Roberts (1986) provides a full description on the data construction.
12
   Countries that have been classified as RICH can be identified in Table 2.
13
   We also computed results using only OECD countries, which generated results very similar to those with
RICH=1. When the sample is limited to OECD firms with RICH=1, the results are even stronger than
those reported in the text.
14
   These data are available for 52 out of the 57 countries. When merging this data with the regulation data
from 77 countries, only 36 countries survive.


                                                                                                        10
of logs allows for a relatively straightforward interpretation of coefficients as elasticities,

and also attenuates the effect of any outliers. Following Rajan and Zingales (1998)15, we

also include an industry’s share of total manufacturing production as a control, defined as

industry value added generated to total manufacture value added.16 Also to be consistent

with earlier work, we use the industry composition utilized by RZ, which is a

combination of 3- and 4-digit ISIC industries. All of the variables described in this

paragraph are constructed using data from 1990.

        The UNIDO data do not contain information on industry margins; to fill this gap,

we utilize the World Scope Database (WSD), which provides firm-level data on public

companies worldwide, representing over 96% of the world’s market value. We define

margins as the ratio of operating income to total sales, and generate a measure of margins

at the firm level by taking averages over all available years during 1991-97. This is

further collapsed to industry-country medians for some of the analyses that follow.

        Finally, for our analyses on industry-level responses to growth opportunities as a

function of entry regulation, we require a measure of industry-specific growth

opportunities. Once again, we follow the intuition of RZ, using industry-level US sales

growth as a measure of growth opportunities worldwide. As with turnover, we may be

concerned that industry-specific shocks to growth opportunities will be more similar in

countries at similar levels of economic development (see Fisman and Love, 2003b, for a

discussion); hence, we will once again consider our results for both, the entire sample, as

well as the sub sample of countries with RICH = 1. The dependent variables in this

section are also similar to those used by RZ, and are simply the compounded industry-

15
  RZ hereafter.
16
  This variable varies with industry and country, and is therefore not absorbed by the inclusion of country
and industry dummies.


                                                                                                        11
level growth rates of average firm size and number of firms, as well as growth in value

added, as defined above, during 1981-90.17

           There may be some concerns that regulation is endogenous to industrial structure

(entry regulation being a result of high industry concentration). Even though this is not

likely to apply to our focus of analysis on the differential impact of regulation across

different types of industries (see next section for more details), we address these concerns

by undertaking an instrumental variables approach. In particular, we use legal origin,

from La Porta et al (1998); as well, we utilize dummy variables reflecting majoritarian

(versus proportional) and presidential (versus parliamentary) political systems.18

           Finally, we will consider the effect of other regulation on industry structure.

According to the Public Choice theory of government intervention, any regulation may

indeed serve as an entry barrier, and may therefore potentially have a distortionary effect

on industry structure. We use an index of labor regulation as our primary alternative

measure of regulation, derived from Botero et al (2003), which measures the level of

protection of labor and employment laws, taking into account availability of alternative

employment contracts, conditions of employments and job security. As a coarser,

alternative summary measure of regulation, we use an index derived from Holmes,

Johnson, and Kirkpatrick (1997).

           Table 1 provides details on the construction and source for each of our variables,

and Table 2 lists summary statistics, by country and by industry. Panel A reports country-

level statistics; Panel B presents industry-level summary statistics of our main variables.

     The reason for dropping the year 1980 is the amount of missing observation in some of our key variables.

3. Results

Before proceeding to regressions, we present some basic cross-tabulations to illustrate the

patterns in the raw data. In these cross-tabs, we limit observations to countries with

RICH = 1, to control in a limited way for income effects. In Table 3, we start by showing

the data classified in high versus low turnover industries (where turnover is a proxy for

natural entry barriers), and high versus low entry regulation countries. Table 3(a) shows

the total share in the number of firms for high versus low turnover industries. A much

larger number of firms are in high turnover industries, which is implied by the summary

statistics listed in Table 2.   Consistent with our conjecture on the impact of entry

regulation, the differential between high and low turnover firms is much smaller for

countries with high entry regulation. Table 3 (b) shows a similar set of results for

average firm size, where we find that the gap between the size of firms in low versus high

turnover industries is narrower for countries with high entry regulation. Surprisingly,

average firm size is larger overall in low entry regulation countries; in our regressions,

however, all country-specific factors will be absorbed by fixed-effects, which will allow

for a cleaner comparison on the differential effects of entry regulation by industry. These

results are illustrated in the two upper plots of Figure 1. Additionally, Table 3(c) shows

that margins are indeed higher in low turnover industries, and that the gap is narrower in

high regulation countries. This simple cross-tabulation shows that average margins are

lower in high regulation countries, but this will once again be absorbed by country-level

fixed effects.

        Table 3 (d) and (e) show cross tabulations that illustrate the effects of entry

regulation on firms’ responses to growth opportunities, by splitting the sample into high



                                                                                        13
and low growth opportunity industries (as measured by actual growth in the U.S.). In

Table 3 (d), we look at growth in the number of establishments; we observe that in

general, the number of establishments grows more within industries with relatively higher

growth opportunities. However, this differential is much greater in countries where entry

regulation is low. Finally, Table 3 (e) shows the growth rate in average establishment

size, where we observe that industries located in countries with high entry regulation

exhibit relatively higher growth rates in average establishment size in industries with

higher growth opportunities. We plot these results in the lower section of Figure 1.



3.A. Entry Regulation and Industry Structure: Regression Results

Our estimations of equation (3) and (4) are listed in Table 4. In columns (1) and (2) of

Panel A, we show our baseline results, for the full sample and without any additional

controls. The coefficients of interest are of the predicted signs, and are significant at least

at the 5 percent level. Furthermore, the magnitudes are large, and may be illustrated with

the following thought experiment: In moving from Singapore, the country at the 25th

percentile of the distribution of entry barriers, to Peru, the country at the 75th percentile,

the difference between the number of firms in Paper and Allied Products (25th percentile

of USTurnover) and the number of firms in Industrial Machinery and Equipment (75th

percentile of USTurnover) narrows by 11.03 percent ((0.81 – 0.61)*(-0.28 + 0.68))*(-

1.379). Similarly, the difference in average firm size narrows by 4.76 percent ((0.82 –

0.61)*(- 0.28 + 0.68))*(0.595).19




19
   I.e., the slope relating number of firms to USTurnover is less positive in Peru than in Singapore, and the
slope relating average firm size to USTurnover is less negative in Peru than in Singapore.


                                                                                                         14
         We add log(GDP)*USTurnover as a control in columns (3) and (4), and find that

the size of our coefficients are reduced (in absolute values) but their significance

increases to the 1% level. Finally, in columns (5) through (8), we restrict the sample to

countries with RICH = 1, and find that for this subsample the coefficients show a

stronger and more significant effect on average firm size.20

         In Panel B, we repeat the same set of regressions, but with Sector Shareic as the

outcome variable. Interestingly, this does not generate any significant coefficients once

we control for the interaction of turnover with the GDP per capita. Our standard errors in

these regressions are not increased, relative to the preceding set of regressions, suggesting

that the effect of regulation does not distort total intersectoral allocations. Rather, the

regulations affect industry structure through within-industry distortions.



3.B. Entry Regulation and Operating Margins: Regression Results

We present our estimation of equation (5) in Table 5. The coefficient on the interaction

term is positive, suggesting that entry regulation disproportionately generates market

power for firms in high-turnover industries. It is highly significant in all regressions once

we either control for the interaction of GDP per capita and turnover or when the sample is

limited to the subset of “rich” countries. A similar thought experiment to that described

above suggests that in moving from Singapore to Peru, the gap in margins between ‘high’

and ‘low’ regulation industries increases by approximately 0.4 percentage points.



3.C. Entry Regulation and Responses to Growth Opportunities: Regression Results

20
  In order to address a potential concern on the endogeneity of our control variable ‘sector share’, we also
estimate these regressions without including such controls. The coefficients of interest remain significant at
conventional levels in models (2) through (8).


                                                                                                          15
To analyze the dynamic effects of entry regulation, we turn to the empirical tests

described in (9) and (10), and reported in Table 6. The full-sample regressions yield

significant coefficients in the regressions examining growth in the number of

establishments: there is a smaller response to growth opportunities in those countries with

higher barriers to entry. The coefficients in the regressions examining average

establishment size are of the predicted sign, but not significant at conventional levels.

However, when we limit the sample to countries with RICH = 1, both sets of coefficients

are significant and of the predicted sign (see columns (5) and (6)).



3.D. Robustness Checks

Instrumenting for Regulation

There may be some concern that regulation is endogenous to industrial structure. Thus,

for example, countries with high industry concentration may have high entry regulation,

because of lobbying. Under a more benign interpretation, countries that differentially

benefit from industrial concentration may choose high levels of regulation. We begin by

noting that this does not necessarily contaminate our results: we are interested exclusively

in the differential impact of regulation across different types of industries, so that these

interpretations would similarly have to imply differential effects across industries to

account for our results. To try to address these concerns, we consider several variables

that describe a country’s legal and political structure as instruments. In particular, we use

legal origin, as popularized by La Porta et al (1998), as well as dummies that indicate

whether a country has a presidential (versus parliamentary) political system and whether

a country has a majoritarian (versus proportional representation) voting structure.




                                                                                          16
Persson and Tabellini (2003) and others have argued that these variables significantly

impact both the size of government, as well as the extent to which governments intervene

in the economy.

       To be effective instruments, these variables must collectively be predictive of the

extent of entry regulation, i.e., the instruments are significant in the first stage, and the

instruments must only (differentially) affect our outcome variables through their impact

on entry regulation. While we cannot rule out the effect of government structure on

industry organization outside of regulation, this is the most natural channel through

which government may influence industry structure. Now, since we are using these

variables as instruments for regulation interacted with either turnover or USgrowth, the

instruments themselves will be interaction terms. In the first stage, our collection of

instruments is significant at the 1 percent level (based on an F-test); our presidential

dummy interaction is not significant, but all others are individually significant. In the

second stages, reported for the sub sample of rich countries in Table 7, we find that the

magnitudes of the coefficients generated by the instrumental variables approach are very

similar to those in our OLS regressions. Furthermore, with the exception of the results on

margins, all coefficients remain significant at conventional levels.



3.E. Other Forms of Regulation

In this paper, we have focused on the specific type of regulation that we expect to most

directly impact industry structure, due to the effect on the fixed cost of entry, relative to

production (fixed or marginal) costs. However, our explanation could potentially apply

to other types of indirect regulatory barriers to entry, which are correlated with entry




                                                                                          17
regulation. We therefore wish to get a sense of whether regulation generally is distorting

industrial structure by acting as a barrier to entry, or whether there is something special

about regulation of entry. We therefore provide an alternative set of results that examine

the impact of labor regulations, based on the data collected by Botero et al (2003).

        In Table 8 we show the results of all our main regressions. In the interests of

space, we report only those regressions considering the sub-sample of rich countries and

those where GDP per capita interactions have been included. Given the entry regulation

results, it is remarkable that none of the interaction terms involving labor regulation are

significant.   We have also repeated these regressions using the overall measure of

government intervention of Holmes, Johnson, and Kirkpatrick (1997), and find that

almost all coefficients are insignificant at the 10 percent level.



3.F. Additional Robustness Checks

As Djankov et al (2003) have noted, regulation is correlated with various other country-

level characteristics. While the most obvious control, log(GDP per capita), is included in

all reported specifications, there may be concerns of other omitted variables.         We

therefore repeated our full set of regressions including interactions involving a number of

additional covariates that might be expected to impact industry structure. First, we

consider interactions with a measure of financial market development, taken from Rajan

and Zingales, defined as the ratio of private domestic credit and stock market

capitalization to GDP. As well, we consider the effect of including interactive controls

utilizing the country-level measure of corruption developed by Kaufmann, Kraay, and

Zoido-Lobatón (2003). Finally, we try to control for overall bureaucratic quality using a




                                                                                        18
measure from Political Risk Services (1997). In no case were any of the coefficients

systematically significant. Furthermore, the coefficients on the interaction terms reported

above were uniformly unaffected by the inclusion of these additional interaction terms.21

           A second concern that affects the “average size” specification is that our measure

of firm size is based on value added, which incorporates both prices and quantities

produced. To ensure that these results are not driven purely by price effects, but signify

‘real’ distortions, we repeat these specifications using employment-based measures of

firm size, also derived from the UNIDO data. These results are reported in Table AP1 of

the Appendix, and parallel the firm size results based on firm value-added.

           As a final robustness check, we estimate analogous regressions using USEntry

instead of USTurnover as a proxy for entry barriers. These results are listed in Table AP2

of the Appendix; the coefficients in all regressions remain significant at conventional

levels, and are generally larger in magnitude than those reported in the main text.



4. Conclusions

           In this paper, we study the distortions to the organization of industry caused by

entry regulation, taking advantage of heterogeneity across industries in their natural

barriers and growth opportunities to examine whether some industries are differentially

affected in countries with high levels of entry regulation. First, we consider the effect of

entry regulation on the (static) structure of industry. We find that in industries with high

‘natural’ barriers to entry, as proxied by firm turnover in the U.S., entry regulation has

little impact on the quantity and average size of firms in an industry. By contrast, in


21
     These results can be obtained from the authors.


                                                                                          19
industries with low ‘natural’ entry barriers, countries with high entry regulation have few,

large firms, relative to less regulated economies. We find no relation between ‘natural’

entry barriers and overall industry share of manufacturing, as a function of entry

regulation.    Second, utilizing firm-level data, we show that operating margins are

relatively high in low barrier industries in high entry regulation countries (relative to high

‘natural’ barrier industries). Finally, we examine the impact of entry regulation on

industry dynamics, by analyzing the ability of industries to take advantage of shocks to

growth opportunities, and find that in countries with high entry regulation, industries

respond to growth opportunities through the expansion of existing firms, while in

countries with low entry regulation, the response is primarily through the creation of new

firms; the total sectoral response is invariant to the level of regulation. Overall, our

results provide a consistent body of evidence suggesting that regulation distorts the

(within) structure of industry, promoting industry concentration, but does not have

measurable effects on intersectoral allocations.

       It is worth noting, in conclusion, some potential policy implications of our

findings.     The Public Interest view does allow for the possibility that industrial

organization may be distorted through the creation of regulatory entry barriers. However,

the particular form of regulations that we examine here, in contrast to the regulation of

labor, environmental contaminants, or product safety, do not provide obvious social

returns. Therefore, the market power and distortions in industry structure that we report

may not be offset by social gains. We leave further analysis on the overall welfare

implications of regulation as an area for further research.
