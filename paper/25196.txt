                                          ABSTRACT

We examine how competition amongst lenders exacerbates risk taking during a boom using a
simple proxy for the risk of a bank’s loan portfolio—the average physical distance of borrowers
from banks’ branches. The evolution of lending distances is cyclical, lengthening considerably
during an economic upturn and shortening again during the ensuing downturn. More distant small
business loans are indeed riskier for the bank, and greater lending distance is reflective of more
generalized bank risk taking. As competition in banks’ local lending markets increases, their local
lending becomes riskier, and their propensity to make (risky) loans at greater distance increases.

   Descriptions of financial frenzies suggest lenders abandon caution in the midst of a boom

and become more aggressive (or careless) in their lending (see, e.g., Aliber and Kindleberger,

2015; Minsky, 2008). A number of studies (e.g., Madalloni and Peydro, 2010; Mian and Sufi,

2009; Gianetti and Laeven, 2012; Lisowski, Minnis, and Sutherland, 2017) demonstrate the

cyclicality of credit standards. However, not all lenders behave in the same way over the cycle.

In particular, the importance of competition between lenders as a factor modifying behavior is

relatively unexplored. In this paper, we examine this issue using an accessible proxy for risk

taking—the extent to which lenders are willing to expand their loan portfolio by lending to

borrowers at a greater physical distance from their branches.

   A large theoretical and empirical literature argues that banks add value through their special

ability to screen and monitor loans based on the private information they collect about current

and prospective clients (e.g., Diamond, 1984; James, 1987; Diamond, 1991). This ability to

produce information about hard to evaluate credits has historically been based on close

interactions between bankers and potential borrowers (e.g. Liberti and Petersen, 2017, Petersen

and Rajan 1994). As Stein (2002) suggests, “soft” information such as the firmness of a

borrower’s handshake, the cleanliness of her premises, or her punctuality in meetings might all

reveal valuable information about the likelihood of repayment. Petersen and Rajan (2002)

showed, however, that the adoption of information and credit scoring technologies in the 80s and

90s brought fundamental changes to the business models of banks. Slowly, but steadily,

information technologies allowed lenders to substitute somewhat for local interactions in lending

to small businesses. The average distance between banks and their borrowers increased steadily

as these technologies improved.




                                                  1
    Yet, at any point in time, available information and communication technologies determine

the limits of the area within which a bank can lend safely. If a bank stretches to lend beyond this,

it will screen and monitor the borrower less effectively, thus taking on more credit risk.

Therefore, a faster-than-trend expansion of the average distance a bank lends at is either

evidence of a rapid improvement of technology or suggestive of increased bank risk taking. If it

reflects risk taking and not simply more rapid innovation, we should see that the more distant

loans are associated with higher default rates, especially those made during the boom. A rapid

drop in average distance in the bust should also follow such risk taking as banks become more

conservative in lending.

    The key contribution of the paper is to use the distance proxy for risk taking to examine the

circumstances in which such risk taking is exacerbated. When many banks are competing for

business in an area, they may have the capacity to make yet more loans after all the obviously

safe loans are made (see, for example, Zentefis (2019)). It may be difficult for a branch manager

to sit on un-lent cash if competitors seem to have no difficulty booking fees by making loans.

Herd behavior or other forms of agency problems may therefore lead all banks in such areas to

make riskier loans (see Rajan, 1994; Agarwal and Ben-David, 2014). Since such competition-

induced agency problems increase bankers’ effective risk tolerance, it should also increase their

willingness to make loans at greater distances. Of course, in the bust, the pressure to make risky

loans falls as all banks have difficulties. Banks can then go back to lending primarily to local

borrowers. As a result, average distance should fall sharply. Areas with more competition

between banks should therefore see more cyclicality in lending distances.

    We test these ideas in this paper, exploiting two datasets that, when combined, offer

information on the locations of borrowers and respective lenders of most small business loans



                                                   2
originated in the U.S. over the last two decades. Specifically, we use the Community

Reinvestment Act (CRA) data that stratifies the annual volume of loans originated by banks with

total assets above $1 billion by the county of the loan recipient. We combine the CRA dataset

with the Summary of Deposits (SOD) dataset that provides information on the branch network of

all commercial banks operating in the United States to compute measures of the physical

distance between the county of the loan recipient and the closest branch of its bank lender.1

       We find that the long-run trend toward greater average distances between banks and their

borrowers, initially documented by Petersen and Rajan (2002), persists in the past 20 years.

Importantly, however, we find a significant cyclical component in the evolution of lending

distances. Distances widen considerably in boom periods and then shorten again during the

ensuing downturns. Between 2004 and 2007, banks increased their average distances from 175

miles to 350 miles. These distances, however, quickly slipped back to approximately 200 miles

following the 2008 financial crisis.

       This cyclical pattern in lending distances is observed after the inclusion of (borrower)

county-year fixed effects and bank fixed effects. As the former accounts for loan demand in the

county at a point in time, the results imply that in booms distant banks increase their lending to

borrowers in a county relative to nearby banks, and do so more than in down years. Put

differently, the results cannot be explained by differences in loan demand growth across

counties. Since we also correct for bank-specific effects, it cannot be explained by changes in the

composition of lenders in the economy over the cycle. This cyclicality also holds when we

examine other points of the distribution of distances, such as the median. We further confirm that


1
    Recent papers on lending distance use either cross-sectional surveys (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 2002; Brevoort and
    Wolken, 2008) or proprietary datasets obtained from a single financial institution (e.g., Agarwal and Hauswald,
    2010; Agarwal and Ben-David, 2014).


                                                             3
the effect can be seen in banks of different size classes. To address the worry that changes in the

nature of borrowers or loans over the cycle may drive the results, we show the effect exists in a

specific borrower industry such as agriculture, where loans are fairly standard.

    The next step is to establish that distant lending in the boom is, on average, riskier and hence

amounts to additional risk taking by the banks. Towards this end, we use the Small Business

Administration (SBA) loan-level dataset of government-guaranteed loans, which contains

information on ex-post defaults or charge-offs (as we unfortunately do not have default data for

loans in the CRA dataset). We find that distant loans originated in the pre-crisis boom years are

significantly more likely to be charged-off relative to other loans issued by banks closer to

borrowers in the same county during the same years, and this sensitivity of charge-offs to

distance is more pronounced for loans originated in the pre-crisis boom years. Specifically, a

one-percent increase in lending distance in 2006 and 2007 is associated with an increase in the

charge-off probability that is between two and three times larger than that of a similar increase in

lending distances in 2003. Furthermore, we find little evidence that banks obtain compensation

through higher interest rates for the additional risks of lending at a greater distance. Our results

suggest that, if anything, the sensitivity of interest rates to distance declines in the pre-crisis

boom period.

    Furthermore, we establish in two ways that such risk taking in small business lending is part

of a broader pattern of risk taking by specific banks. First, we know the overall loan losses for

each bank and hence can determine the average non-performing loan ratio for each bank over the

2007-2009 period. We find that the higher the average non-performing loan ratio of the bank, the

more cyclical is its pattern in lending distance, suggesting that heightened small business loan

distances can proxy for more general bank risk taking. Second, we use a returns-based measure



                                                   4
of risk to gauge whether greater cyclicality in lending distances are indicative of banks’

systematic risk exposures. Following Acharya, Pedersen, Phillipon, and Richardson (2017) and

Meiselman, Nagel, and Purnanamdam (2018), we capture a bank’s exposure to aggregate tail

shocks through its average return during the 5% worst days for the market. We find that, in the

cross-section of banks, the coefficient of correlation between a bank’s average lending distance

and each of our business cycle indicators is associated with this return-based measure of

systematic risk. These results are indicative that the boom-bust cycles in lending distances are

associated with banks’ tendencies to accept exposures to tail risks.

    Having established a cyclical pattern of risk taking, with distance being a good proxy for

such behavior, we now turn to the central question of the paper: what are the conditions under

which such risk-taking behavior emerges. We predict that banks whose branches are primarily in

competitive banking markets should see a more pronounced cyclical pattern in average lending

distance. Since such banks are likely to look for borrowers in less competitive areas, we should

find a similar cyclical pattern in average borrowing distance for borrowers located in less

competitive areas. Finally, distant loans made from a competitive area to a less competitive area

should also have a cyclical pattern. We find evidence consistent with all of these predictions,

measuring competition as the Herfindahl index for bank loans made in the respective county at

the beginning of our sample period.

    One reason banks in competitive areas may venture out to lend at a distance is that local

lending may get particularly risky in boom times. Indeed, we find that charge-offs become far

more sensitive to local market competition in the pre-crisis boom period than in other periods.

    A bank that has the ability to reallocate resources (and thus lending) within its branch

network from areas exposed to significant competitive pressures to areas with less fierce


                                                   5
competition will have less pressure to take distance risk during the boom. Consistent with this

conjecture, we find that the boom-bust cycle in lending distances is less pronounced for banks

that have very different degrees of competition within their own branch networks. More

precisely stated, banks with an above-median coefficient of variance of local market

concentration across counties in their branch network have less cyclicality in distance lending

than banks with a below-median coefficient of variation.2

       We undertake a number of robustness checks. A voluminous literature argues that high

concentration in an industry or region need not imply low competition – it could just mean that a

more efficient producer has grabbed more market share. We address this and other concerns

about the endogeneity of local competition with two alternative measures of bank competition.

One is the timing of adoption of interstate banking deregulation. Deregulation occurred at

different times for different geographies (e.g., Kroszner and Strahan, 1996; Stiroh and Strahan,

2003). If deregulation in a state occurred earlier, there was more time for competition to arise.

We therefore use the natural log of the years between 1996 and the year when the state’s banking

market for loan origination was deregulated as a measure of competition. We find that the longer

the time lapse since the adoption of interstate banking deregulation in the home market, the more

amplified is the boom-bust cycle in lending distance.

       For the second measure, we use a large bank’s entry into a local market (typically through a

merger or acquisition). For a large bank, the conditions in a specific small local market (where a

particular branch is located) are unlikely to affect the overarching M&A decision. However, the

presence of a large bank, which is able to send significant resources into the local market, is


2
    We also find, intuitively, that, among the subset of banks with below-median dispersion in their bank networks, the
    boom-bust cycle is more pronounced for banks that are exposed to uniformly high competitive pressures rather
    than banks that experience uniformly low competitive pressures.


                                                              6
likely to increase the level of local banking competition. We find that banks exposed to counties

in which a big bank entered have a more amplified boom-bust cycle in lending distance.

    That local competition affects risk taking during a boom suggests that not all lenders are

enveloped in the frenzy. The natural implication is that explanations of financial frenzies that

rely on overoptimistic participants need to be complemented with more traditional models

describing how competition reduces bank franchise value (e.g., Keeley, 1990), induces herd

behavior, distorts lender incentives, and exacerbates lending moral hazard.

    Given that a sharp departure from the trend in distance between banks and borrowers is

indicative of increased overall risk taking, distance is something that bank supervisors could

usefully track. However, we note that the cycle in distance lending, even if risky, may have a

silver lining. To the extent that banks push new lending technologies to their limit, it may give

them a better understanding of these technologies, and a greater ability to lend at a distance

during normal times. In other words, excess distance lending may expand the normal lending

potential of banks as well as accelerate the secular trend in lending distance. Until this issue is

further explored, any supervisory intervention needs to be measured.

    We are obviously not the first to examine distance lending. A number of papers have also

shown the cyclicality of cross-border lending (see, e.g., Gianetti and Laeven, 2012; De Haas and

Van Horen, 2013; Kleimeier, Sander, and Sylvia, 2013; and Cerutti, Hale, and Minoiu, 2014). In

domestic markets, Presbitero, Udell, and Zazzaro (2014) and Degryse, Matthews, and Zhao

(2018) show that banks cut back on distant loans during the crisis. Our contribution is to tie both

the increasing lending distance pre-crisis and bank risk taking more closely, and to identify the

bank-specific circumstances in which such risk taking increases. In particular, the nature of




                                                  7
competition in a bank’s lending markets seems to play an important part in whether they go the

extra mile.

                                      1.   Data Description

    We obtain small business lending data from the Community and Reinvestment Act (CRA)

small business loans database provided by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination

Council (FFIEC) pursuant to Regulations 12 parts 25, 228, 345, and 195 of the aforementioned

Act. This dataset contains information on the total number and volume of small business loans

originated by each reporting financial institution in each county of the United States during a

calendar year. Between 1996 and 2004, all commercial and savings banks with total assets

exceeding $250 million were required to report their originations of small business loans by

county of the borrower. Since 2005, the FFIEC raised the mandatory reporting asset size

threshold from $250 million to $1 billion. Following this increase in the asset size threshold, the

number of banks reporting to the CRA small business lending dataset declined from

approximately 2,000 to 1,000. For the data analysis, we use the entire sample of banks available

at any time. The empirical results are quantitatively and qualitatively similar when we use a

constant sample of banks with more than $1 billion in assets.

    We use the Summary of Deposits (SOD) database provided by the FDIC to obtain

information about the geographic characteristics of all branches of depository institutions

operating in the United States between 1996 and 2016. This dataset contains information on the

geographical coordinates, location, and deposits of each branch in the United States. We

complement the SOD dataset by assigning latitudes and longitudes to each branch address

whenever geographic coordinate data are missing. We use information on the address, zip code,

and county of the branch to retrieve the missing branch latitudes and longitudes via the Google


                                                  8
Geocoding Application Programming Interface (API). We also obtain financial characteristics of

the commercial and savings banks from the quarterly Reports of Condition and Income (Call

Reports) that banks file with the FDIC. Financial information on savings banks prior to 2012

comes from Thrift Financial Reports information available from the SNL Financial dataset.

      We know from the CRA dataset the quantity of small business loans lbct that a specific bank

b has made to a specific county c in year t. We combine the SOD dataset on bank branch

locations with information on the latitudes and longitudes of the geographic centroids of all U.S.

counties. For the CRA dataset,3 we assume that the closest geodetic distance d bc , i.e., the length

of the shortest curve between the centroid of borrower county c and the closest branch of bank b,

represents the average distance between the borrowers from the bank in county c and the bank

itself. We believe that this is a sensible measure of distance based on existing survey evidence

suggesting that 59% of all US small banks receive small business loan applications at any

branch, while 30% accept small business loan application at branches with loan offices, and only

11% accept applications online (FDIC, 2017). Thus, the value-weighted average loan distance

      We compute other measures of geographic distance such as the distance between the

population-weighted centroid of each county (rather than the geographical centroid) and the

    As described shortly, we use a slightly different approach for the SBA dataset because of differences in data
    availability.


                                                                       9
closest branch of the bank, the distance between each borrower county centroid and the

headquarters of each bank, and an indicator variable that takes the value of one if a bank has no

branch in the county where it originated the small business loans, essentially coding out-of-

versus in-county lending. We show in the Online Appendix that the main results are not sensitive

to these alternative measures of distance between lenders and borrowers.

       Since the CRA dataset does not contain loan by loan default or interest data, we also use the

Small Business Administration (SBA), which contains a list of all SBA-guaranteed loans under

the 7(a) program from 2000 to 2016.4 It also contains loan-level information about the identity,

address, city, and zip code of the borrowers and lenders as well as loan characteristics such as

total amount, the amount of SBA’s loan guarantee, initial interest rate, approval date, industry of

the borrower, and loan status (performing/default). The dataset also includes information on the

charge-off date and on the amount charged-off by the SBA on its loan guarantee when the loan is

charged-off by the bank. Following Brown and Earle (2017), we exclude cancelled loans from

the analysis because the cancellation may be at the initiative of the borrower.

       For the SBA dataset, using the University of Chicago Geographic Information Service (GIS),

we geocode the geographic coordinates of approximately 1 million borrowers and their lenders.5

We are unable to locate the geographic coordinates of approximately 0.6% of the SBA borrowers

in the dataset and we discard those observations. We compute the distance between borrowers

and lenders in the dataset as the geodetic distance between the reported addresses of borrowers

and respective lenders in the SBA dataset. This might seem more precise than our earlier method

for the CRA dataset, but there is an important caveat -- the lender address is usually the bank’s

    The 7(a) program is SBA’s primary and most popular general-purpose, government-guaranteed lending program.

headquarters and not necessarily the closest branch. We could follow our earlier strategy and

determine the closest bank branch. Unfortunately, the loan-level SBA dataset does not include

the regulatory identifiers of the lenders that originated the SBA loans, and there is the potential

for error in using the reported bank name (since they can be partial or truncated).6 Therefore, the

SBA dataset is more precise about borrower location, while the CRA dataset arguably provides

more precision on lender location. Nevertheless, the cyclical properties of the distance proxies in

both data sets are similar, allaying concerns about comparability or measurement error.

                      2.    Lending Distances, Bank Lending, and Business Cycles

      In this section, we document the main empirical patterns in banks’ lending distances and the

business cycle using the CRA dataset. We examine the matched CRA and SOD datasets to

unearth basic descriptive facts about the evolution of lending distances over the past twenty

years. After providing these statistics, we use regressions to more formally evaluate the role of

the business cycle in shaping the relation between lending distances and changes in bank

lending.

2.1. Summary Statistics

      We begin our analysis by presenting basic information about the market for small business

loans over the 1996 to 2016 sample period. Panel A of Table 1 shows that small business lending

increased substantially over this period: the total volume of small business loans originated by

CRA-reporting banks approximately doubled in current dollar terms from $115 billion in 1996 to

$227 billion in 2016. The growth in the aggregate amount of small business loans was, however,


6
    For a limited set of lenders, we hand-matched the information in the SBA to the SOD and computed the
    geographic distance between the address of the borrower and that of the closest branch of the respective lender. In
    the Online Appendix, we use this alternative measure and we show that the cyclicality in the evolution of lending
    distances in the SBA data is not sensitive to this alternative definition.

not always steady over this period. During the 2001-2007 period, small business lending

increased substantially to a peak of $324 billion in 2007 and subsequently saw a sharp decline to

half of that amount during the Great Recession.

    Small business lending is still mostly a local activity. Figure 1 and Panel A of Table 1 show

that approximately 80% of all small business loans originated in the United States over the

sample period went to borrowers that are less than 50 miles away from the closest branch of their

bank lender, whereas only 7.5% of all small business loans went to borrowers that are located

more than 1,000 miles away from the closest branch of their lender. The share of small business

loans that are allocated toward distant borrowers has nevertheless fluctuated substantially over

time. The plots of Figure 1 show that, between 2001 and 2007, distant lending increased at a

faster pace than nearby lending and that the share of distant loans in the small business lending

market increased substantially. The ensuing contraction in the 2007-2010 period was, however,

more pronounced for distant loans and the share of the small business lending market accounted

for by distant lending returned to pre-2003 levels in the years that followed the Great Recession.

    Panel A of Table 2 reports summary statistics of the main variables used in the empirical

analysis. The unit of observation is the (borrower) county-bank-year combination. The sample

includes a bank-county combination from the start of the sample until the moment in which the

bank disappears from the sample if the bank originated at least one small business loan in the

sample. The sample includes approximately 5 million observations but only 2 million

observations see non-zero growth in lending across two consecutive years. This large amount of

zeros occurs because it is not uncommon for a bank to lend nothing to borrowers in a specific




                                                  12
county through two consecutive years.7 The average growth in bank lending to a county is

13.5%. Consistent with the intuition that banks from more competitive areas seek lending

opportunities in less competitive areas, we also see the destination (borrower) markets are more

concentrated, on average, than the origin markets where the bank’s closest branch is located.

      In Figure 2, we present key statistics about the evolution of lending distances over time. In

Figure 2, Panel A, we plot the average distance of all small business loans weighted by their

respective dollar amount from 1996 onward. The figure shows that average distances between

borrower and lender trended positively over the sample period. From 1996 to 2016, average

distance increased from approximately 100 miles to 250 miles. But the evolution of average

lending distance did not always follow trend. Between 1996 and 2003, average distances rose

steadily except for a decline in 2001. From 2004 until 2008, average-lending distances increased

sharply above trend from approximately 175 miles to 350 miles and the Great Recession saw a

significant pullback in average distances to pre-2004 levels.

      The cyclical pattern holds when we compute alternative measures of lending distance

between lenders and borrowers. Figure 2, Panel B shows the evolution of an equal-weighted

average distance, which is determined as the simple average of the above lending distance

computed bank by bank. On average, banks expanded their lending distances over the sample

period and such expansion was strongly procyclical. In particular, average bank lending

distances increased sharply between 2003 and 2007 and subsequently contracted in the ensuing

years. This finding suggests that the previous results are not simply driven by an increase in the

sample representation of larger banks that specialize in distant lending. In Panel C of Figure 2,

    To check that the results are not sensitive to this characteristic of our dependent variable by using alternative
    dependent variables (Table IA.1) and by limiting the sample to (borrower) county-bank combinations where we
    see more than 100 loans originated over time (Table IA.6)


                                                            13
we compute the proportion of all small business loans made to borrowers that are located in

counties where lenders do not have a local branch. Similar to the previous results, this fraction

increased between 1996 and 2016 and exhibits a strong boom-bust pattern around the events of

the 2007-2009 financial crisis.8

      We also examine the evolution of distance across several points of its distribution. Figure 3

presents the median lending distance (Panel A), the lower decile of lending distance (Panel B),

and the upper decile of lending distance (Panel C) over the sample period. Consistent with the

notion that small business lending is very local, the median distance in the sample varies from

approximately 4 miles in 1996 to a peak of 8 miles in 2007. The evolution of lending distance is,

nevertheless, similar across the different points of the distribution: lending distances exhibit an

upward trend over the sample period and strong procyclicality, with rapid above-the-trend

growth in lending distances between 2003 and 2008 and a subsequent sharp decline between

2008 and 2010. These patterns suggest that a shift in the entire distribution of lending distances

rather than a few outliers drive the observed changes in average lending distance over time.

2.2. Empirical Results

      In this section, we formally evaluate how business cycles mediate the relation between

lending distance and changes in bank lending. We estimate an ordinary-least-squares (OLS)

model of the change in the volume of small business loans originated by each bank in each

county as a function of the distance of the bank to the county and the interaction between this

distance and a measure of the state of the cycle (business/financial). Specifically, we estimate the

following specification:



8
    In the online appendix, we show that the shape of these figures is not sensitive to the effects of mergers and
    acquisitions or to using a population weighted county-centroid to compute distance between borrower and lender.


                                                           14
       ∆%𝑺𝑩𝑳𝒃𝒄𝒕 = 𝜶𝒄𝒕 + 𝜸𝒃 + 𝜷𝟏 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 +𝜷𝟐 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 ×𝒁𝒕 + 𝜽𝑿𝒃𝒕 + 𝝐𝒃𝒄𝒕 (𝟏)

where b indexes a bank lending to borrowers located in county c during year t. The dependent

variable, ∆%𝑆𝐵𝐿!"# , is the logarithmic change in one plus the volume of small business loans

originated by bank b in county c during year t. Our main variable of interest, 𝐿𝑛(𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡)!"# ×𝑍! , is

the interaction between lending distance and a cycle indicator, Zt, defined variously as the

detrended change in real gross domestic product (GDP), the log difference in the US annual

unemployment rate, or the standardized net percentage of banks increasing spreads of loan rates

to small firms. We control for time-varying bank-level characteristics such as size and the shares

of residential loans and commercial real estate loans in 𝑋!" . The main coefficient of interest, 𝛽! ,

captures whether the relation between lending distance and changes in bank lending is more or

less pronounced depending on the state of the cycle. It is essentially a semi-elasticity of lending

growth with respect to geographic distance and the state of the economy.

    We include (borrower) county-by-year fixed effects α ct and bank fixed effects γ b . It is

important to understand what they do. For instance, some counties may be neglected by banks

(i.e., have few local banks) and hence, may receive a larger share of their small business credit

from distant lenders. We need to control for the possibility that demand for loans in these

counties grows relatively more in expansions (and relatively less in recessions). Therefore, we

include (borrower) county-by-year fixed effects that absorb any time-varying unobserved county

characteristics as well as local demand shocks. The bank fixed effects ensure that the relevant

coefficients are estimated off variation in lending distance within a bank and not in the

composition of lenders in the economy. Otherwise, a potential concern is that banks specializing

in distant lending may become a larger share of the sample during expansions and subsequently

lose share during recessions. In sum then, the coefficient of interest, β 2 , is positive if in business



                                                    15
cycle upswings, loan growth within a county comes disproportionately from banks with faraway

branches (who typically lend closer to their branches in more normal times). We cluster standard

errors at the county-level.

    Table 3 presents results that are largely consistent with the descriptive statistics of Figures 2

and 3. The main coefficient on distance, 𝛽! , is negative and significant across all three

specifications suggesting that when the economy is in a neutral state and credit conditions are

normal, greater distance to borrowers is associated with lower lending growth. More importantly,

as the interaction term reveals, when the economy is booming, the negative relation between

lending distances and changes in bank lending is significantly attenuated and potentially

becomes positive provided that economic conditions are sufficiently good. The results of column

(1) suggest that when the detrended real GDP series is one standard deviation above the mean, an

increase in lending distance is associated with approximately no decline in bank lending.

Similarly, the results of columns (2) and (3) suggest that a one-standard deviation decrease in

unemployment rates and credit spreads approximately halves the measured negative relation

between lending distance and bank loan growth.

    To better understand the role that cycles play in shaping the relation between lending

distance and credit supply, we consider an alternative approach in which we allow the effects of

lending distance to vary non-parametrically over time. In particular, we implement the following

specification:


            ∆%𝑺𝑩𝑳𝒃𝒄𝒕 = 𝜶𝒄𝒕 + 𝜸𝒃 +           𝜷𝒕 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 ×𝒀𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒕 + 𝜽𝑿𝒃𝒕 + 𝝐𝒃𝒄𝒕 (𝟐)
                                        𝒕


where 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟! is a set of dummy variables that equal to one at time t and zero otherwise and all

other variables are defined as above. This alternative specification allows us to examine the



                                                   16
relation between lending distances and changes in bank lending over the sample period without

imposing parametric assumptions about how the relation between lending distances and changes

in bank lending evolves over the business cycle.

    In Figure 4, we plot the series of estimated coefficients, 𝛽! , and corresponding standard

errors overlaid on a line representing the detrended GDP growth series. The figure further

suggests that recession years coincide with lower coefficients between lending distances and

changes in bank lending and boom periods coincide with greater coefficients and even positive

associations between lending distances and changes in bank lending. The univariate correlation

between the series of year-specific effects of lending distance with the detrended real GDP series

is 0.56. We interpret the results of this plot as supplementary evidence that the relation between

lending distances and credit supply is strongly procyclical.

    Next, we perform a battery of robustness checks to confirm the cyclical relation between

lending distances and changes in bank lending. First, we examine whether this cyclical pattern is

common across banks of different sizes, rather than limited to a few very large banks. In Table 4,

we stratify the sample based on whether banks have less than $10 billion in total assets, between

$10 and $50 billion in total assets, and more than $50 billion in total assets. The results reported

in this table support the idea that the cyclical relation between lending distances and changes in

bank lending is common to all bank sizes. Furthermore, in the online appendix we report that our

results are not sensitive to using alternative dependent variables (Figure IA.1 and Table IA.1),

other measures of distance (Figure IA.3, Tables IA.2 and IA.3), other business cycle indicators

defined at the state and local-level (Table IA.4), winsorization of the main dependent variables

(Table IA.5), limiting our sample to bank-county combinations whose number of total loans over




                                                   17
the sample period exceed a minimum threshold (Table IA.6), and to re-estimating the main

specification of the paper excluding one state at a time (Figure IA.6).

    Another possible concern is that the composition of borrowers or loans changes over the

business cycle – for example, during economic expansions loans may flow to industries that

allow for more distance in lending based on differences in collateral type and quality. To

examine whether the cyclical variation in distance is likely driven by changes in the pool of

borrowers over the cycle rather than by changes in the willingness of lenders to make distant

loans, we exploit a separate CRA dataset that only covers small agricultural loans. Agriculture is

a monitoring-intensive industry where lenders must at least deploy some resources to check if the

farmer is putting the loan to good use. Figure 5 suggests that small farm loan data also exhibit

cyclicality in lending distance. While the average lending distance in the agricultural sector is

less than for the rest of the economy, consistent with it being more monitoring intensive, the plot

shows within-sector, above-trend growth in lending distances during economic expansions and

subsequent declines in lending distance following recessions. In Table 5, we further show that

the cyclical relation between lending distances and changes in agricultural bank lending holds in

an empirical specification similar to that of equation (1). These results suggest that cyclicality is

not simply driven by varying industry or loan composition.

    Overall, the results in this section strongly support the idea that lenders are more willing to

extend credit to distant borrowers during economic expansions and subsequently pull back to

safety in the ensuing bust.

                              3.   Lending Distances and Risk Taking

    A potential explanation for the pattern we documented in the previous section is that during

lending booms, credit standards become lax and lenders are more willing to take risks by


                                                   18
originating loans to distant borrowers whose information is relatively harder to collect, evaluate,

and monitor. In what follows, we empirically analyze a straightforward implication of this

conjecture: that distant loans originated during booms should be relatively more likely to default.

3.1. Lending Distances and Loan-Level Loan Losses: Evidence from the SBA Loans

      Unfortunately, the CRA dataset does not contain data on the performance of SBA loans

made by the banks. Therefore, we use the Small Business Administration (SBA) loan-level

dataset of government guaranteed loans, which does have loan-level information on ex-post

defaults (also termed charge-offs). This dataset provides a rich set of information on the

identities and addresses of borrowers and lenders, loan amounts, interest rates, and maturities of

all government guaranteed loans approved since 2000. We use the listed addresses of the lenders

and the corresponding borrowers to compute the lending distance for each loan in the dataset and

to empirically examine the interplay between the business cycle and geographic distance in

shaping the ex-post default of SBA loans.

3.1.1. Cyclical Lending Distance Patterns in the SBA Dataset

    Before jumping to an empirical evaluation of the association between lending distances and

loan performance over the business cycle, we investigate whether the cyclical distance patterns

in the SBA dataset follow those of the broader CRA dataset. This step is necessary to support the

idea that the overarching forces that induce lenders to go the extra mile for regular small business

loans also apply in the SBA government-guaranteed lending market.

    In Figure 6, Panel A we plot the average lending distance between the borrower and lender

addresses of each loan in the SBA 7(a) dataset weighted by respective loan amount. Similar to

the analysis of Figure 2, the weighted average lending distance substantially increases between




                                                  19
2003 and 2007 and later declines to the levels seen in the early 2000s following the financial

crisis. In Panel B of Figure 6, we plot the average bank-level lending distance. Similar to the

cyclical patterns observed for small business loans reported in the CRA sample, we observe that

average bank-level weighted lending distance increases until the 2007-2009 financial crisis,

subsequently declines as the crisis unfolds and rebounds between 2010 and 2016.

       Next, we evaluate the cyclicality of lending distances in a regression analysis that follows the

specification of equation (1). To implement this analysis, we aggregate loan amounts at the

borrower county-bank-year level and we compute a measure of loan volume at bank-county-year

level that is similar to that used in Table 3. We also compute the average lending distance of the

bank to the county as the average distance of the bank to its borrowers in each county during that

year. Specifically, we estimate the following specification:

               ∆%𝑺𝑩𝑨𝒃𝒄𝒕 = 𝜶𝒄𝒕 + 𝜸𝒃 + 𝜷𝟏 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 +𝜷𝟐 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 ×𝒁𝒕 + 𝝐𝒃𝒄𝒕 (𝟓)

where b denotes the bank participating in the small business administration program, c the

county of the borrower and t the year in which the loan was originated. The dependent variable,

∆%𝑆𝐵𝐴!"# , is the logarithmic change in the volume of loans originated by bank b to borrowers

located in county c during year t. The independent variable of interest, 𝐿𝑛(𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡), is the average

distance between bank b and its borrowers located in county c.9 The business cycle indicators,

𝑍! , are those defined in the analysis of Table 3.

       We estimate specification (5) using OLS and report the results in Table 7. Similar to prior

analyses, the main coefficient on the interaction between the business cycle indicators and

lending distances suggests that during expansionary periods, the relation between lending


9
    Unlike the measure of distance used in the previous analyses, this measure of distance may vary over time within a
    county-bank pair because borrowers may be at different places within the same county over time.


                                                             20
distance and changes in bank lending becomes more positive and vice-versa. We also implement

and estimate a non-parametric specification akin to that of equation (2) in which we compute the

year-specific elasticities of the change in bank lending with respect to lending distance. We plot

the estimated coefficients and respective standard errors of this analysis in Figure 7. Similar to

the analysis of Figure 4, the positive elasticities of changes in SBA lending with respect to

lending distance coincide with expansionary periods and negative elasticities coincide with

recessionary periods.

       Overall, these results show that the evolution of distance in the government-guaranteed small

business loan market exhibits cyclical patterns that are similar to those of the broader small

business loan market.

3.1.2. Cyclical Lending Distance and Loan Default in the SBA Dataset

       Having established that SBA loans behave similarly to regular small business loans, we

proceed to exploit loan-level SBA data, which allows us to examine the evolution of the relation

between ex-post loan defaults (charge-offs) and lending distance. If distant loans carry additional

risks in the form of less effective screening and monitoring, we should see that distance is

associated with higher default rates, especially for vintages originated during the boom.10

       To empirically evaluate this conjecture, we implement the following empirical specification:


             𝐏𝐫 𝑪𝑶𝒊𝒃𝒄𝒕 = 𝟏 = 𝜶𝒄𝒕 + 𝜸𝒃 +                  𝜹𝒕 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒊𝒃𝒕 ×𝒀𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒕 + 𝜽𝑿𝒊 + 𝝐𝒊𝒃𝒄𝒕 (𝟔)
                                                     𝒕
where i indexes SBA government-guaranteed loans originated by lender b to small business

borrowers located in county c during year t. The main variables of interest, 𝐿𝑛(𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡)!"# ×𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟! ,



10
            We confirm that our results are not sensitive to using a sample of SBA loans whose maturity is less than or
     equal to five years and that were originated prior to 2013 in order to allow for enough time for all loans to be
     worked-out by the end of the sample period.


                                                             21
are interaction terms of the log-distance between the addresses of the lender and the borrower

and a series of year dummies. We further include county-by-year and bank fixed effects as well

as additional controls for loan-level characteristics in the vector 𝑋! , such as loan interest rates,

loan maturities, and a full set of borrower-industry fixed effects. As before, standard errors are

clustered at the county-level.

    The inclusion of county-by-year and bank fixed effects ensure that the results are not driven

by changes in local economic conditions or unobservable bank characteristics that affect the

overall likelihood of default of small business loans originated in a county. We are, therefore,

comparing the average outcomes of loans originated by nearby lenders relative to the average

outcomes of loans to borrowers located in the same county that receive loans from distant

lenders.

    We present the results of this analysis in Figure 8. The evolution of the main coefficients

presents a very clear pattern: over the initial years of the sample period, lending distances are not

significantly related to the likelihood of charge-off. However, beginning in 2003 the relation

between distance and the likelihood of charge-off becomes positive and statistically significant.

The magnitude of the main coefficients increases over time and peaks for loan vintages

originated in 2006. At the peak, the results suggest that a one percent increase in our measure of

distance between borrower and lender is associated with a 2% increase in the likelihood of

charge-off. This magnitude is economically significant especially when we benchmark it against

an unconditional probability of charge-off of approximately 15% reported in Panel B of Table 2.

After 2006, the relation between lending distances and likelihood of charge-off becomes less

pronounced and turns statistically insignificant after 2010.




                                                   22
    An important caveat of this analysis is that the government guarantee for SBA loans could

intensify incentives to throw caution to the wind relative to other small business loans that do not

include a guarantee. Lenders in a SBA guaranteed loan only absorb a predetermined fraction of

potential loan losses (typically 15-25 percent of all losses) but earn full interest and fees accruing

from the loan. This feature raises concerns about whether the results generalize to the broader

lending market. To assess this possibility, we partition the sample based on whether the loan was

originated under the regular 7(a) program or under the SBA Express program. The SBA Express

program ensures an expedited review of documentation by the SBA (usually less than 24 hours)

in exchange for a lower government-guarantee, 50% rather than the usual 75% or 85% guarantee

of a regular 7(a) loan. In the Online Appendix (Figure IA.4) we repeat the analysis of Figure 8

for the subsets of regular 7(a) and SBA Express loans. We find that the relation between distance

and charge-off is not significantly different in the subset of SBA Express loans that feature a

lower government guarantee, alleviating the concern about the role of guarantees in our result.

3.1.3. Cyclical Lending Distance and Interest Rates on SBA Loans

    Next, we investigate whether lenders require additional compensation on distant loans

originated in the run-up to the financial crisis. One drawback is that interest rates on SBA loans

are highly regulated. The SBA sets a maximum rate of the Prime rate + 2.25% for loans with

principal amount of more than $50,000 and maturity of less than 7 years and Prime +2.75% for

loans with principal amount of more than $50,000 and maturity of 7 years or more. In spite of

these rate ceilings, there is some variation in the interest rate of loans approved by the SBA even

on the same day, suggesting that not all loans are set at the maximum allowed interest rate.

    We assess if lenders require additional compensation for distant loans originated in the run-

up to the financial crisis, using an empirical specification similar to that of equation (6), in which


                                                   23
we use the initial interest rate on the SBA loan rather than the likelihood of charge-off as the

main dependent variable. We report the results in Figure 9. We do not observe any clear cyclical

pattern in the sensitivity of interest rates to distance – if anything, the sensitivity of interest rates

to distance declines in the lead up to the crisis, relative to earlier years. It increases only after the

crisis (after 2010). This pattern is consistent with greater risk taking before, and conservatism

after. What is abundantly clear is that lenders do not obtain additional compensation for the

incremental ex-post default risk that they incurred in distant loans.

    Overall, the results in this section are consistent with the idea that during expansionary

periods, banks lower credit standards and accept the risks of extending credit to distant small

business borrowers, who are relatively harder to evaluate and monitor.

3.2. Lending Distances and Banks’ Nonperforming Loan Ratios

    Having established that the stretch for distance is, in fact, risky, and not compensated by

higher interest rates, let us turn to whether this reflects a broader pattern of risk taking in the

banks. After all, small business lending is only a small portion of lending for many banks. If the

patterns we have documented are not part of a broader pattern of risk taking, our results are still

interesting, but of more modest importance for regulation and supervision, or economy-wide

policy making.

    Our first approach is to see whether lenders that experienced overall worse outcomes during

the 2007-2009 period (not just from small business loans) originated relatively more loans to

distant borrowers in the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and subsequently pulled back to

local markets in response to heavy loan losses. This pattern would suggest that the banks that

lend to distant small business borrowers are more willing to carry risks that are difficult to

evaluate and quantify and that later materialize into large loan losses. These losses created


                                                     24
significant balance-sheet pressures that induced these lenders to de-lever and retreat to the safety

of local markets (e.g., consistent with the pattern observed in the cross-border lending evidence

in DeHaas and Van Horen, 2012 and Gianetti and Laeven, 2012).

    We begin this analysis by stratifying banks based on the median of the distribution of

nonperforming loan ratio computed over the 2007-2009 period and plotting average distances

over the sample period for above- and below-median nonperforming loan ratio banks. The

results, shown in the left graph of Figure 10, are striking: above-median NPL banks exhibit a

very pronounced boom-bust cycle in the average bank-level lending distances. By contrast, the

average bank-level lending distances of below-median banks remain relatively steady over most

of the sample and increase slightly following the financial crisis. These results are consistent

with the notion that banks that reached farther out experienced larger overall loan losses.

    To formally examine this association, we expand the specification in equation (1) by

including a triple interaction between the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios, lending distance, and

the business cycle indicators. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

  ∆%𝑺𝑩𝑳𝒃𝒄𝒕 = 𝜶𝒄𝒕 + 𝜸𝒃 + 𝜷𝟏 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 +𝜷𝟐 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 ×𝒁𝒕 ×𝑵𝑷𝑳𝒃 + 𝑰𝑵𝑻 + 𝜽𝑿𝒃𝒕 + 𝝐𝒃𝒄𝒕 (𝟑)


where 𝑁𝑃𝐿! measures each bank’s average nonperforming loan ratio between 2007 and 2009

and all other variables are defined similarly to equation (1). We include all two-way interaction

terms (INT) between the nonperforming loan ratio, lending distance, and business cycle

indicators as well as county-by-year and bank fixed-effects in the above specification. We cluster

standard errors at the county-level.

    We report the results in Table 7. We find that lending distances are more positively

(negatively) associated with changes in bank lending during expansionary (recessionary) periods,




                                                  25
respectively. More importantly, the triple interaction between the NPL ratios, lending distances,

and business cycle indicators reveals that greater loan delinquency amplifies the effect of the

business cycle on the relation between distance and changes in bank lending. For example, the

results of column (1) of Table 7 suggest that a one-standard deviation increase in the NPL ratio is

associated with an increase of the interaction between lending distance and the detrended GDP

by approximately 7% (0.002/0.027). These magnitudes indicate that banks experiencing greater

loan losses experience more pronounced boom-bust cycle in distance lending. We obtain

qualitatively similar inferences with the other cycle variables (though with larger economic

magnitudes) in the other columns of Table 7.

    We also expand the specification of equation (2) and employ a nonparametric approach that

traces the marginal effects of lending distance on changes in bank lending over time at different

points of the distribution of the nonperforming loan ratio. Specifically, we include a triple-

interaction between lending distance, year dummies, and the NPL ratio:

where our independent variable of interest is the triple interaction between lending distance, year

dummies, and the NPL ratio at the bank level. As in other specifications, we also include two-

way interaction terms (INT) between these variables as well as county-by-year and bank fixed-

effect. Standard errors are clustered at the county level.

    To better visualize how NPL ratios mediate the association between lending distance and

changes in bank lending over time, we plot the time-series of estimated marginal effects of




                                                   26
distance at different levels of the NPL ratio using the estimates from specification (4). We

compute these marginal effects as:

                                      𝑀𝐹𝑋! = 𝛿! + 𝜆! ×𝑁𝑃𝐿

where 𝛿! represents the estimated year-specific elasticities of changes in bank lending with

respect to distance from estimating specification (4) using OLS, 𝜆! the year-specific elasticities

of changes in bank lending with respect to distance interacted with NPL. We evaluate and plot

these marginal effects for a representative bank with NPL ratios two standard deviations above,

and one with NPL ratios two standard deviations below, the average NPL ratio.

    The chart on the right in Figure 10 represents the marginal effects of lending distance on

changes in bank lending from estimating specification (4). The difference between the green

(above-average nonperforming loan ratio) and red (below-average nonperforming loan ratio)

suggest that banks that experienced greater nonperforming loan ratios between 2007 and 2009

show greater elasticities of changes in bank lending with respect to lending distances in the run-

up to the financial crisis. This pattern suggests that above-average NPL ratio banks were more

willing to take risks and increase lending to distant borrowers. We also find that this pattern

reverses between 2008 and 2010, a period in which above-average NPL banks show lower

elasticities of changes in bank lending with respect to lending distances. These last findings are

in line with Presbitero, Udell, and Zazzaro (2014), Degryse, Matthews, and Zhao (2018), and

Bord, Ivashina, and Taliaferro (2017) who find that banks experiencing greater delinquency

ratios were more likely to retreat to their local markets.

3.3. Lending Distance and Returns-Based Measures of Tail Risk




                                                    27
       The nonperforming loan ratio of each bank between 2007 and 2009 likely captures both

idiosyncratic and systematic risks that these banks carried in their lending portfolios.11 From a

regulatory perspective, however, the documented cyclicality in lending distances is even more

important if it is representative of exposures to systemic risks that were building up in the

financial system before the crisis.

       To gauge this possibility, we use a measure based on stock returns to capture the exposure of

a bank to aggregate tail shocks. We follow Acharya, Pedersen, Phillipon, and Richardson (2017)

and Meiselman, Nagel, and Purnanandam (2018) and measure exposure to systematic risks as a

bank’s average return during the 5% worst days for the market and bank industry stocks during

the financial crisis. Acharya et al. (2017) find that this measure is related to a financial

institutions’ propensity to be undercapitalized when a system as a whole is undercapitalized, a

concept that they refer to as the systemic expected shortfall. We explore whether investors

perceive banks that exhibit more pronounced cyclical fluctuations in their lending distances as

holding, on average, more systematic risk. The goal is not to claim that cyclicality in lending

distance is a driver of systematic risk, but rather that banks with greater exposures to aggregate

tail risk also exhibit greater cyclicality in lending distance, which in turn indicates that cyclicality

in lending distance is a manifestation of a greater propensity for bank risk-taking.

       In Table 8, Panel A we report summary statistics of the main variables used in this analysis.

We measure lending distance cyclicality as the coefficient of correlation over the entire sample

period between the business cycle indicator and the average lending distance of each bank. These


11
      In addition, a number of recent studies (Behn, Haselman, and Vig (2014), Begley, Purnanandam, and Zheng
     (2016), Plosser and Santos (2018), Blattner, Farinha, and Rebelo (2018), and Granja and Leuz (2019)) suggest that
     banks strategically understate risk exposures and underreport loan losses in response to capital constraints and
     regulatory incentives. This evidence suggests that the nonperforming loan ratio measured during the crisis may not
     accurately reflect differences across banks in their underlying portfolio risks.


                                                             28
descriptive statistics suggest that, on average, lending distance correlates positively with

detrended GDP growth and negatively with changes in unemployment and credit spreads at the

bank level. Average stock market returns in bad bank (market) days is -3.3% (-3.9%).

Importantly, there is significant variation in the stock market performance of banks during these

days suggesting considerable cross-sectional heterogeneity in bank exposure to systemic risks.

    We follow a specification similar to that of Meiselman, Nagel, and Purnanandam (2018) to

examine whether lending distance procyclicality is positively correlated with the return-based

measure of systematic risk in the cross-section of banks. We report the results of this analysis in

Panel B of Table 8. The results are indicative that more pronounced boom-bust cycles in lending

distances are associated with a bank’s propensity to accept exposures to tail risks. For instance,

the results of column (1) suggest that when the coefficient of correlation increases from zero to

one, the average returns on bad bank days decrease approximately one percentage point, which is

approximately one standard deviation of the distribution of the dependent variables. The results

reported in the other columns of Table 8 further support this association between procyclicality

in lending distances and systemic risks.

    In sum then, the move towards greater distance is both risky and uncompensated, and it is

reflective of more generalized risk taking by the bank. Let us now turn to the central question:

Which banks are likely to engage in such behavior?

                     4.   Lending Distances and the Role of Competition

    Having established that the cyclical pattern in lending distance is a good proxy for risk

taking, we turn to the conditions under which risk-taking behavior emerges. Banks whose

branches are primarily in competitive banking markets may find lending opportunities scarce and




                                                  29
profit margins small within their local areas.12 Herd behavior or other forms of agency could then

induce branch managers to step outside their comfort zones and seek distant borrowers in less

competitive areas rather than sitting on un-lent cash. We now examine whether banks whose

branches are primarily in competitive banking markets see a more pronounced cyclical pattern in

lending distance and whether we find a reciprocal cyclical pattern in average borrowing distance

for borrowers located in less competitive areas. We also evaluate whether banks that have the

ability to reallocate resources (and thus lending) within their branch network from areas exposed

to significant competitive pressures to areas that are less exposed to fierce competition will be

less pressured to take distance risk during the boom.

5.1 The Role of Competition in Home and Destination Markets

     We begin by asking whether local competitive pressures amplify the cyclical relation

between lending distances and changes in bank lending. To test this conjecture, we exploit

variation in the intensity of competition at the county-level in the small business lending market.

We base our measure of competition on the level of market concentration computed as the

Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in each county at the beginning of our sample.13

     A simple partition of the raw data in Panel A of Figure 11 suggests that the cyclical variation

in the average lending distance at the bank level is more pronounced in banks exposed to greater

competition. We first group banks based on the average HHI of their home markets, i.e. the HHI

of counties where the closest branch to the county of their borrower is located. We plot the

average lending distances at the bank level for banks below and above the median HHI in their


12
    See, for example, Degryse and Ongena (2005) on the role of proximate bank competition on interest rates banks
   can charge.
13
    We also compute a measure of competition based on the HHI in the deposit market. The results are qualitatively
   and quantitatively when we use this alternative measure of market concentration. See Drechsler, Savov, and
   Schnabl (2017) for the use of deposit HHI as a proxy for bank competition.


                                                         30
home market. The lending distances of banks with below-median concentration in their home

markets (the red line on the left side chart in Figure 11 Panel A) are more cyclical than those of

banks with above-median concentration in their home market (the green line in that chart). For

example, banks facing stiffer competition in their local branch markets, i.e. those with below-

median HHI in their home markets expanded bank-level average lending distances from 80 miles

in 2003 to approximately 130 miles in 2006 and saw their lending distances subsequently

contract to less than 100 miles by 2010. The group of banks with above-median HHI, i.e. facing

lower competition in their home markets, saw no such cyclical pattern and their bank-level

average lending distances hovered 40 miles throughout the entire sample period. These figures

suggest that banks exposed to greater competition see a more pronounced boom-bust cycle in

lending distances.

   One potential problem with the analysis above is that above- and below-median HHI banks

could be systematically different in ways that affect the relation between lending distance and

changes in bank lending but are not necessarily related with the local competitive pressures. To

formally examine whether exposure to greater competition amplifies the cyclical relation

between distance and changes in bank lending, we implement a specification similar to that of

equation (3) and include a triple interaction between the level of market concentration, lending

distance, and the business cycle indicators. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

  ∆%𝑺𝑩𝑳𝒃𝒄𝒕 = 𝜶𝒄𝒕 + 𝜸𝒃 + 𝜷𝟏 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 +𝜷𝟐 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 ×𝒁𝒕 ×𝑯𝑯𝑰𝒃𝒄 + 𝑰𝑵𝑻 + 𝜽𝑿𝒃𝒕 + 𝝐𝒃𝒄𝒕 (𝟕)


where 𝐻𝐻𝐼!" measures the county-level HHI of the small business lending market at the

beginning of the sample period. We compute 𝐻𝐻𝐼!" in the home market, destination market, and

as the difference in HHI between the destination and home market. We include all two-way




                                                 31
interaction terms (INT) between the HHI terms, lending distance, and business cycle. We cluster

standard errors at the county-level.

    Table 9 reports the results. We find that local bank competition is associated with greater

cyclicality between lending distance and changes in bank lending. The interaction term between

lending distances and business cycle indicators suggest that distance is more positively

associated with changes in bank lending in expansionary periods and vice-versa. But more

importantly, the triple interaction between the HHI measures, lending distances, and business

cycle indicators supports the notion that competitive pressures amplify the business cycle effects.

For example, the results of column (3) of Table 9 suggest that a one-standard deviation increase

in the difference between the HHI of the destination and home markets raises the marginal effect

of the interaction between lending distance and the detrended GDP by approximately 25%

(0.008/0.035). These magnitudes indicate that when the difference in HHI between destination

and home markets is large, lending distances and changes in bank lending are even more

positively associated in expansionary periods and more negatively associated in recessionary

periods. We obtain similar inferences with slight differences in economic magnitudes in other

columns of Table 9.

    We further investigate the role of market concentration by using a non-parametric approach

similar to that of specification (4). Specifically, we estimate the following model:


 ∆%𝑺𝑩𝑳𝒃𝒄𝒕 = 𝜶𝒄𝒕 + 𝜸𝒃 +            𝜹𝒕 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 ×𝒀𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒕 +         𝝀𝒕 𝑳𝒏(𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕)𝒃𝒄𝒕 ×𝒀𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒕 ×𝑯𝑯𝑰𝒃𝒄
                              𝒕                               𝒕
               + 𝑰𝑵𝑻 + 𝜽𝑿𝒃𝒕 + 𝝐𝒃𝒄𝒕 (𝟖)


where our independent variable of interest is the triple interaction between the lending distance,

year dummies, and the level of market concentration at home and destination markets. As in



                                                   32
other specifications, we also include main effects and interactions (INT) between these variables

as well as county-by-year and bank fixed-effect. As in previous specifications standard errors are

clustered at the county level.

    Similar to the approach of Figure 6, we compute and plot the marginal effects of lending

distance on changes in bank lending using estimates obtained from an OLS regression of

specification (4) and setting the levels of market concentration at two standard deviations above-

and below-average. The results presented in Panel B of Figure 11, reinforce the idea that the

boom-bust cycle in the marginal effects of lending distance is more pronounced when local

branch markets are more competitive and less concentrated and when destination markets are

less competitive and more concentrated. For instance, the plot on the left indicates that the

marginal effects of lending distances on bank lending are larger during 2006 and 2007 when the

home market is exposed to greater competitive pressures.

    All this suggests that banks in competitive markets stretch into distant lending because

heightened inter-bank competition makes local lending riskier in the boom – in other words, risk

increases for them across the distance spectrum. To get at this, using the SBA data we relate the

sensitivity of charge-offs in the market where the borrower is located to concentration in the

local lending market and plot the results in Figure 12. We find that in the years leading to the

crisis, loans made in more competitive markets experienced relatively greater charge-offs

(though not in normal times or after the onset of the crisis). This might explain why lenders try

and migrate out of those markets into more distant markets – of course, as we have seen, they

experience high charge-offs in that distant lending also. Overall, the results in this section

suggest that when lenders face diminishing profitable opportunities in core markets, they tend to

extend credit to distant borrowers.



                                                 33
    Overall, our findings suggest that interbank competition is a catalyst of cyclical risk-taking

by banks. When lenders face fierce competition in their local branch markets and economic

conditions are expansionary, they are more likely to step outside their local areas and make

distant loans. The flip side of such expansion is that when economic and credit conditions take a

turn for the worse, these lenders become more conservative and focus on their core markets by

disproportionately cutting lending to distant borrowers.

5.2 The Role of Internal Capital Markets

    Next, we examine whether banks that have the ability to redeploy resources from branches

facing significant competitive pressures to branches that are less exposed to fierce competition

are less inclined to lend to distant borrowers.

    A simple measure of dispersion of lending opportunities within a bank’s branch network is

the coefficient of variation of the HHI in the branch network of each bank. A large coefficient of

variation of the level of market concentration within a branch network indicates significant

dispersion of market concentration relative to the average level of market concentration of the

bank. We use this dispersion (relative to the mean) as a proxy for a bank’s ability to use their

branch network to reallocate resources from areas with significant competitive pressures where

lending opportunities are scarce and profit margins small to areas where they face lower

competitive pressures.

    We begin to examine this conjecture by partitioning banks based on the coefficient of

variation of the HHI of their local branch markets at the beginning of the sample period. Figure

13 stratifies the evolution of average bank-level lending distances based on above- and below-

median coefficient of variation of HHI. The plot suggests that the boom-bust cycle in lending

distances only exists in the subset of banks whose HHI dispersion relative to the mean is low. In


                                                  34
this group, average bank lending distances approximately double between 2003 and 2007 and

subsequently decline between 2008 and 2012.14

     To further examine the role of internal capital markets in shaping the cyclical relation

between lending distance and changes in bank lending, we also implement a specification similar

to equation (7) in which we use the triple interaction between lending distances, business cycle

indicators, and the coefficient of variation of HHI as the main independent variable of interest.

     We report these results in Table 10. We use the detrended change in real GDP, change in the

logarithm of the unemployment rate, and interest rate spreads on small business loans as our

business and credit cycle indicators in columns (1), (2), and (3), respectively. The main

coefficients suggest that the effect of the business cycle on the relation between lending distance

and changes in bank lending is more pronounced when the standard deviation of the HHI is

small. This result indicates that the relation between lending distance and changes in bank

lending is incrementally more positive in expansionary periods for banks with low dispersion in

the level of market concentration in their branch network relative to its mean. 15

5.3. Robustness: The Role of Competition at Home and Destination Markets

     A significant literature argues that high concentration in an industry or region need not mean

low competition – it could just mean that a more efficient producer has grabbed more market

share. We try to address these concerns using two alternative and more exogenous indicators of



14
   In the Online Appendix, we further split the group with low HHI coefficient of variation between those banks
  with uniformly low HHI across its branches and those with uniformly high HHI across its branches. Confirming
  our expectations, we find that the boom-bust cycle in lending distances is more pronounced in the subset of banks
  with low coefficient of variation that are exposed to uniformly low market concentration.
15
   This result is related to Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012), Gilje, Loutskina, and Strahan (2016) and especially Cortés
and Strahan (2017) who show that commercial banks actively redeploy resources within their areas of operation in
response to external shocks but show a preference for their core markets in doing so. Our result is slightly different
in that we show that some banks never need to venture outside their core.



                                                           35
bank competition. First, we follow a broad literature that exploits the timing of adoption of

interstate banking deregulation as a shock to competition in the banking industry (e.g. Jayaratne

and Strahan, 1996; Kroszner and Strahan, 1999; Stiroh and Strahan, 2003; Cetorelli and Strahan,

2006). The idea is that out-of-state banks had more time to enter, ramp up competition, and drive

out inefficient banks in states where deregulation occurred earlier. Second, we explore a large

bank’s entry into a local market (typically through merger). For a large bank, the conditions in a

specific small local market are unlikely to affect its merger decision. But at the county-level, the

entry of a large bank with a different business model and deep pockets is likely to disrupt local

bank competition.

    We use the natural log of the years between 1996 and the year when the loan origination

state’s banking market was deregulated as an additional measure of competition. We report these

results in Table 11. Overall, the shorter the time elapsed since the adoption of interstate banking

deregulation in the destination market, the more amplified the cyclical pattern in lending

distance. Similarly, the result of columns (2) and (4) suggest that the longer the time elapsed

since the adoption of interstate banking deregulation in the home market, the more amplified the

boom bust cycle in lending distance. Interestingly, in column (6) where the measure of the credit

cycle is spreads, the relevant coefficient is significant, albeit with the opposite sign to that

predicted. Because the credit cycle indicator (Spreads) in this specification loads strongly on

2008 and 2009, we suspect that this sign is related to the specific effect of one of these years.

    We also create an indicator that takes the value of one if a county saw a 5 percentage points

increase in the deposit market share held by a large banking organization, which we define as a

bank holding company whose total assets exceed $50 billion. Such a large increase suggests that

a large banking organization either acquired another bank with local operations or significantly



                                                   36
grew their operations in that county suggesting a more aggressive competitive environment. This

idea is in line with the work of Claessens, Demirgüc-Kunt and Huizinga (2001) showing that

foreign presence in the banking industry of a developing country is associated with lower net

interest margins and more aggressive competition.

    We report these results in Table 12. The results of columns (2), (4), and (6) show that when a

large banking organization substantially increases its presence in the home market of a bank, the

cyclical pattern in lending distance is substantially amplified as local banks react to intensifying

competitive pressures in their home markets from large banking organizations by going the extra

mile and increasing their distant lending during expansionary periods. Similarly, the results in

columns (1) and (3) suggest that distant lending increases less during expansionary periods in

counties of borrowers where large banking organizations significantly increase their presence,

consistent with the idea that lenders avoid going the extra mile to counties that are experiencing

increasing competitive pressures. We do not, however, find a significant effect in column (5)

when cyclicality is measured by spreads. Overall, though, the results in these columns support

the idea that competitive pressures in local lending markets during expansionary periods induce

banks to lend to borrowers that are farther away.

                6   Discussion of Results and their Relation to the Literature

    Our paper adds more evidence to support existing findings in a number of areas, so it is

important to identify the specific contribution of the paper. First, since Petersen and Rajan (2002)

a series of papers show that geographic distance still plays a major role in lending decisions. For

instance, Agarwal and Hauswald (2010) show that physical distance improves the ability of

lenders to produce soft information and extend credit to small businesses, Granja, Matvos, and

Seru (2017) show that geographic proximity is a significant determinant of who acquires failed


                                                    37
banks in the economy, and Nguyen (2019) finds that bank branch closures are associated with

declines in small business lending. We find that the secular trend toward greater lending

distances documented in Petersen and Rajan (2002) persists but we also uncover a significant

cyclical component to such distances, which is not only new but also suggests that banks that go

the extra mile indeed take undue risks. Proximity still seems to matter in controlling risks.

       Second, a number of studies examine the cyclicality of risk taking in the economy. Rajan

(1994), Ruckes (2004), Dell’Aricia and Marquez (2006), Zentefis (2018) and Kopytov (2019)

study how cyclical lending standards can emerge in equilibrium in the economy.16 A series of

papers (e.g. Madalloni and Peydro (2010), Mian and Sufi (2009), Gianetti and Laeven (2012),

Dell’Aricia, Igan, and Laeven (2012), De Haas and Van Horen (2013), Kleimeier, Sander, and

Sylvia (2013), Cerutti, Hale, and Minoiu (2014), Jimenez, Ongena, Peydro, and Saurina (2014),

Ioannidou, Ongena, and Peydro (2015), and Lisowsky, Minnis, and Sutherland (2017)) provide

empirical evidence of the cyclicality of credit standards. In domestic markets, Degryse,

Matthews, and Zhao (2018) and Presbitero, Udell, and Zazzaro (2014), suggest banks are quicker

to drop their distant clients in a downturn.

       We add to this literature by showing that a sharp departure from trend distance between

banks and borrowers is indicative of increased risk taking and by documenting strong cyclicality

of lending standards in the small business lending market.

       Perhaps most importantly, though, we attempt to understand why such behavior emerges,

and in which markets or banks. Hellmann, Murdock, and Stiglitz (2000) suggest that bank

16
      In an interesting recent paper, Kopytov (2019) describes why lending distance might increase as the cycle gets
     long in the tooth – essentially lending margins erode, therefore loans are riskier, and diversification (and hence
     distant loans) becomes more important for banks to avoid the expected costs of distress. Presumably margins erode
     more in competitive areas, hence there should be greater search for distance in those areas. Kopytov’s model
     would suggest an increase in diversification in all areas, but particularly in competitive ones. Our evidence
     suggests an increase in distance primarily in competitive areas (see Figure 11, Panel A).


                                                             38
competition can undermine prudent bank behavior and induce banks to take excessive risks. On

the other hand, Boyd and De Nicoló (2005) argue that concentration in banking markets could

encourage higher interest rates, which, in turn, could heighten moral hazard concerns with bank

borrowers. The former paper predicts more risk taking in competitive markets (as does Keeley,

1990) while the latter suggests potentially more losses in concentrated banking markets.17 Rajan

and Ramcharan (2015) suggest that the interplay of interbank competition and a positive shock to

agriculture exacerbated the boom-bust cycle in land prices in the run-up to the Great Depression.

Our findings go further to show that banks exposed to greater competitive pressures seem to go

out on a limb to make distant loans that pose additional risks, but primarily in the expansionary

phase of the cycle.

       We also show that banks that are diversified across areas with differing degrees of

competition do not succumb to such risk taking behavior. This may explain the finding in

Morgan, Rime, and Strahan (2004) that greater banking integration spurred by interstate banking

deregulation in the United States reduced business cycle volatility at the state-level. Our findings

also suggest that a focus on inter-bank competition and the incentives thereof is essential to

complement explanations of boom-bust episodes relying on over-optimism or other forms of

irrationality. It would otherwise be hard to explain why specific types of banks as well as banks

in certain areas seem more immune to the frenzy that overtakes bank lending episodically.

        Apart from helping us understand bank behavior, we believe our study’s finding that a sharp

departure from trend distance between banks and small borrowers is indicative of increased risk


17
      In an interesting set of papers, Dreschler, Savov, and Schnabl (2017, 2019) show that greater bank competition at
     the local deposit level (different from our focus on competition in lending markets) facilitates the pass-through of
     monetary policy to interest rates – so they would suggest greater fluctuation in credit availability from banks
     raising money from concentrated deposit markets over the cycle as they expand deposit financing in periods of low
     interest rates and contract it as interest rates rise.


                                                              39
taking could be useful to bank supervisors. Since distance is easily measurable, it is a metric that

bank supervisors could track as they monitor lending standards in the economy. Of course, we

realize that doing so would still be subject to Goodhart’s Law, i.e., as soon as supervisors start

using it as a measure, banks will behave in ways that make it less useful. Moreover, as noted in

the introduction, any supervisory intervention should also recognize the potential impact of any

intervention on banks’ incentives to innovate and learn as they stretch to lend at a distance.

Figure 1 shows the total amounts of small business loan origination and corresponding shares of the total small business loans originated in each of four bins
representing the minimum distance between the borrower’s county centroid location and the closest branch of the lender. The first bin represents distances
between 0 and 50 miles, the second bin represents distances between 50 and 250 miles, the third bin represents distances between 250 and 1,000 miles, and
the fourth bin represents borrowers and lenders that are more 1,000 miles apart. Data for this figure is computed using the CRA Small Business Lending
and the SOD datasets.

Figure 2 shows three plots. Panel A plots the average weighted distance of all small business loans over time. Lending Distance for
each loan is computed as the geodetic distance between the borrowers’ county centroid and the banks’ closest branch. Panel B plots the
bank equal-weighted lending distance over time. To compute the bank equal-weighted lending distance, we initially compute the average
lending distance for each bank-year combination and then average across all banks in each year. Panel C plots the percentage of loans
that are originated to borrowers that are located in counties where the lender does not have a branch. Data for all figures is obtained
from the combination of the CRA and SOD datasets.

               Figure 3: Evolution of Lending Distances: Other Points of the Distribution
Figure 3 shows three plots. Panel A plots the median of the weighted distance of all small business loans over time. Lending Distance for
each loan is computed as the geodetic distance between the borrowers’ county centroid and the banks’ closest branch. Panel B plots the
lower decile of the weighted distance of all small business loans over time. Lending Distance for each loan is computed as the geodetic
distance between the borrowers’ county centroid and the banks’ closest branch. Panel C plots the upper decile of the weighted distance
of all small business loans over time. Lending Distance for each loan is computed as the geodetic distance between the borrowers’ county
centroid and the banks’ closest branch. Data for all figures is obtained from the combination of the CRA and SOD datasets.

Figure 4 plots the estimated coefficients from a regression of the log change in the volume of small business loans by a lender to borrowers located in
a county on a series of interactions between lending distance and a set of dummy variable representing each year in the sample. Specifically, we plot
the series of estimated coefficients
                         P             βt and associated 99% confidence intervals estimated from OLS regression of the following empirical specification:
%∆SBLbct = θct + ωb + t βt Distancebct × Y eart + ΓXbt + bct . The shallow triangles connected by the dashed line represent the detrended GDP growth
series (HP-filtered). Data for this figure is computed using the CRA Small Business Lending and the SOD datasets.

      Figure 6: Evolution of Lending Distances in the Small Business Administration Dataset
Figure 6 shows two plots. Panel A plots the average distance of all small business administration loans over time. Lending Distance for
each loan is computed as the geodetic distance between the lender and borrower addresses listed on the SBA dataset. Panel B plots the
bank equal-weighted lending distance over time. To compute the bank equal-weighted lending distance, we initially compute the average
lending distance for each bank-year combination and then average across all banks in each year. Data for all figures is obtained from the
Small Business Administration

Figure 7 plots the estimated coefficients from a regression of the log change in the volume of SBA lending of a bank to a county on a series of interactions
between lending distance and a set of dummy variable representing each year in the sample. Specifically, we plot the series of estimatedPcoefficients βt and
associated 99% confidence intervals estimated from OLS regression of the following empirical specification: %∆SBAbct = θct + ωb + t βt Distancebct ×
Y eart + ΓXbt + bct , where %∆SBAbct is the log change in the total amount of small business administration loans originated by lender b in county c and
Distancebct is the logarithm of the average distance between the headquarters of the lender and its borrowers in the county. The shallow triangles connected
by the dashed line represent the detrended GDP growth series (HP-filtered). Data for this figure is computed using the SBA dataset.

                           Figure 8: Distance and Likelihood of Charge-Off over the Business Cycle
Figure 8 plots the estimated coefficients from a regression of a dummy variable that takes the value of one if loan was charged-off on a series of interactions
between lending distance and a set of dummy variable representing each year in the sample. Specifically, we plot the series of estimatedP coefficients βt and
associated 99% confidence intervals estimated from OLS regression of the following empirical specification: CObcti = θct + ωb + θi + t βt Distancebcti ×
Y eart + bcti , where CObcti is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the loan was charged-off and Distancebcti is the logarithm of the distance
between the address of the borrower and the headquarters of the lender. Data for this figure is computed using the SBA dataset.

Figure 9 plots the estimated coefficients from a regression of the interest rate charged on the SBA loan on a series of interactions between lending distance
and a set of dummy variables representing each year in the sample. Specifically, we plot the series of estimated coefficients
                                                                                                                    P         βt and associated 99% confidence
intervals estimated from OLS regression of the following empirical specification: %IntRatebcti = θct + ωb + θi + t βt Distancebcti × Y eart + bcti , where
%IntRatebcti is the interest rate on the SBA loan and Distancebcti is the logarithm of the distance between the address of the borrower and the headquarters
of the lender. Data for this figure is computed using the SBA dataset.

Figure 10 plots the average lending distance over time after stratifying the sample of banks based on the average nonperforming loan ratio of banks over
the 2007–2009 period. The figure on the left plots the equal-weighted bank distance for banks with above-median and below-median nonperforming loan
ratio during the 2007–2009 period. The figure on the right plots the incremental contribution of the nonperforming loan ratio on the estimated marginal
effect of distance on the log change in P  volume of loans. We compute  Pthe marginal effects of distance over time using estimates from the following empirical
specification: ∆%SBLbct = θct +ωb + t γt (Distance×Y ear)bct + t λt (Distance×Y ear ×N P Lbt )+ΓXbt +bct . The marginal effects are computed using
the year-specific elasticities of loan volume with respect to distance (γ̂t ) and the year-specific elasticities of loan volume with respect to distance interacted
with N P L (λ̂t ). Specifically, we plot γ̂t + λ̂t × N P L, where t = 1996, ...2016, and N P L takes values {µ − 2σ, µ + 2σ}, where µ is the mean value of N P L
over the entire sample and σ is the standard deviation of N P L. The green dashed line is the elasticity of the volume of loans over time for a representative
bank with N P Ls two standard deviations above the mean. The solid red line is the elasticity of the volume of loans over time for a representative bank with
N P Ls two standard deviations below the mean. Data for this figure is computed using the CRA Small Business Lending and the SOD datasets.

Panel A of Figure 11 plots the average lending distance over time after stratifying the sample of banks based on their level of concentration in their home
markets. The figure plots the bank equal-weighted lending distance for the groups of banks with above- and below-median concentration in their home
markets. Local market concentration is measured as the HHI of the small business lending market as of 1996. Panel B represents the evolution over time of
estimated marginal effect of distance on changes in bank lending measured at different points of the distribution
                                                                                                                P        of HHI. We compute theP marginal effects
of distance over time using estimates from the following empirical specification: ∆%SBLbct = θct + ωb + t γt (Distance × Y ear)bct + t λt (Distance ×
Y ear × HHIbct + ΓXbt + bct . The marginal effects are computed using the year-specific elasticities of loan volume with respect to distance (γ̂t ) and the
year-specific elasticities of loan volume with respect to distance interacted with HHI (λ̂t ). Specifically, we plot γ̂t + λ̂t × HHI, where t = 1996, ...2016, and
HHI takes values {µ − 2σ, µ + 2σ}, where µ is the average of HHI over the entire sample and σ is the standard deviation of HHI over the entire sample.
The green dashed line is the elasticity of the volume of loans over time for a representative bank-county pair whose value of HHI is two standard deviations
above the mean. The solid red line is the elasticity of the volume of loans over time for a representative bank-county pair whose value of HHI is two
standard deviations below the mean. Concentration is measured as the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index in the small business lending market as of 1996. The
specification includes borrower county-by-year and bank fixed-effects as well as baseline controls for natural logarithm of Total Assets, Share of Commercial
& Real Estate Loans, Share of Residential Loans, and Share of Commercial & Industrial Loans. Data for this figure is computed using the CRA Small
Business Lending and the SOD datasets.

Figure 12: Local Market Concentration and Likelihood of Charge-off in the Small Business
Administration Loan Dataset
Figure 12 plots the estimated coefficients from a regression of a dummy variable that takes the value of one if loan was charged-off on a series
of interactions between the small business lending market concentration in the county where the borrower is located and a set of dummy
variable representing each year in the sample. Specifically, we plot the series of estimated coefficients βt and  Passociated 99% confidence
intervals estimated from OLS regression of the following empirical specification: CObcti = θt + ωb + θi + t βt HHIc × Y eart + bcti ,
where CObcti is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the loan was charged-off and HHIc is the Herfindahl-Hirshmann index
(HHI) of the small business lending market in the county where the borrower address is located. We compute the HHI using the same
procedure we used in the main sample Data for this figure is computed using the SBA dataset.

Figure 13: Bank Internal Capital Markets: Coefficient of Variation of HHI within Branch Network
Figure 13 plots the average lending distance over time after stratifying banks based on the coefficient of variation of the market concen-
tration in counties where banks have a branch presence. The plot represents the equal-weighted bank distance for the group of banks
with above- and below-median coefficient of variation in market concentration. Local market concentration is measured as the HHI of
the small business lending market as of 1996. Data for this figure is computed using the CRA Small Business Lending and the SOD
datasets.

Table 2 reports summary statistics for the main variables in the empirical analysis. ∆ Volume Loans is the log change of one plus the volume of loans
originated by a bank in a county. NPL Ratio (07-09) is the nonperforming loan ratio of the bank during the 2007–2009 period. HHI Destination is the SBL
market concentration in the destination (host) market. HHI Origin is the SBL market concentration in the closest branch (home) market. HHI Difference
is the difference in SBL market concentration between destination (host) market and the closest branch (home) market. Coefficient Variation HHI is the
coefficient of variation of the market concentration in counties where banks have a branch presence. Local market concentration is measured as the HHI
of the small business lending market in each county measured in 1996. I(Charge-Off = 1 is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if the loan was
charged-off. SBA Loan Interest Rate is the initial interest rate on the SBA loan. SBA Loan Amount is the initial principal amount of the SBA loan. SBA
Loan Maturity is the initial mat.

includes borrower county-by-year and bank fixed-effects as well as baseline controls for natural logarithm of Total Assets, Share of Commercial & Real Estate
Loans, Share of Residential Loans, and Share of Commercial & Industrial Loans. The specification also conditions on the interactions between HHI and the
business cycle indicators, and HHI and Distance. Standard errors are presented in parentheses, and are clustered at the level of the county. ***, **, and *,
represent statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

        Table 10: Distance and Small Business Lending: The Role of Internal Capital Markets

Table 10 reports the coefficients of OLS regressions investigating the role that internal capital markets play in the relation between lending
distance and the business cycle. The dependent variable, ∆ Volume Loans, is the log change in the volume of loans originated by a
bank in a county. HP-Filtered Real GDP is the standardize HP-filtered percent change in the real GDP. Real GDP series is obtained
from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. ∆ Ln(Unempld Rate) is standardized
log difference in the US annual unemployment rate. The unemployment rate series is obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data
(FRED) website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Spreads is the standardized net percentage of domestic banks increasing spreads of
loan rates over banks’ cost of funds to small firms. The series is obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website of the
Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Ln(Distance) is the natural logarithm of the minimum distance between the bank’s branches and the county
centroid. Coefficient Variation HHI is the coefficient of variation of the market concentration in counties where banks have a branch
presence. Local market concentration is measured as the HHI of the small business lending market as of 1996. The specification includes
borrower county-by-year and bank fixed-effects as well as baseline controls for natural logarithm of Total Assets, Share of Commercial
& Real Estate Loans, Share of Residential Loans, and Share of Commercial & Industrial Loans. The specification also conditions on the
interactions between Std. Dev. HHI and the business cycle indicators, and Std. Dev. HHI and Distance. Standard errors are presented
in parentheses, and are clustered at the level of the county. ***, **, and *, represent statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,

Table 12 reports the coefficients of OLS regressions investigating the role that an increase in the presence by a large bank in a county plays in the relation
between lending distance and the business cycle. ∆ Volume Loans is the log change in the volume of loans originated by a bank in a county. HP-Filtered Real
GDP is the standardized HP-filtered percent change in the real GDP. Real GDP series is obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website
of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. ∆ Ln(Unempld Rate) is standardized log difference in the US annual unemployment rate. The unemployment rate
series is obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Spreads is the standardized net percentage
of domestic banks increasing spreads of loan rates over banks’ cost of funds to small firms. The series is obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data
(FRED) website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Ln(Distance) is the natural logarithm of the minimum distance between the bank’s branches and the
county centroid. ∆ Share Large Banks > 5% (Destination) is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if a large banking organization (bank whose
total assets exceed $50 billion) increases its share of deposits in the destination county by more than 5% in the preceding year. ∆ Share Large Banks > 5%
(Origin) is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if a large banking organization (bank whose total assets exceed $50 billion) increases its share of
deposits in the home (origin) county by more than 5% in the preceding year. We excluded the large bank observations that originated the shock. Therefore,
we exclude the lending in the county by the large bank itself. Standard errors are presented in parentheses, and are clustered at the level of the county. ***,
**, and *, represent statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Figure IA.1: Effects of Distance on Credit Growth over the Business Cycle (Alternative Dependent
Variables
Figure IA.1 plots the year-specific semi-elasticities of an increase in the lending distance on the growth in small business lending using
alternative dependent variables. The top figure represents the estimated coefficients from a regression of the log change in the number of
small business loans to borrowers in a county on a series of interactions between lending distance and a set of dummy variable representing
each year in the sample. Specifically,
                               P       we plot the series of estimated coefficients βt and associated confidence intervals in the regression
%∆N br.SBLbct = θct + ωb + t βt Distancebct × Y eart + ΓXbt + bct . The bottom figure represents the estimated coefficients from
a regression of an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the bank made a loan to a borrower located in a county where the
bank had not made loans the previous year on a series of interactions between lending distance and a set of dummy variable representing
                      P Specifically, we plot the series of estimated coefficients βt and associated confidence intervals in the regression
each year in the sample.
Startbct = θct + ωb + t βt Distancebct × Y eart + ΓXbt + bct . The shallow triangles connected by the dashed line represent the detrended

    Figure IA.2 plots the average weighted lending distance after purging the potential effects of M&As. Lending Distance for each loan is computed as the
    geodetic distance between the borrower’s county centroid and its respective lender closest branch. The top figure plots average distance after eliminating
    from the sample all banks that were the target of an acquisition. The bottom figure plots the average lending distance for a sample of pro-forma banks, i.e.
    after adjusting the lending of each surviving bank in the sample by including all loans of all banks that they acquired prior to 2016. In this analysis, the
    lending distance of each pro-forma bank in each county is computed as the minimum distance that the pro-forma had to the county over the entire period.

                      Figure IA.4: Effect of Distance on Likelihood of Charge-Off by Type of SBA Program
    Figure IA.4 plots the estimated year-specific semi-elasticities between the likelihood of charge-off of a SBA loan in each SBA program type and an increase in
    the lending distance between a bank and a borrower. The plot represents a series of estimated coefficients of a regression of the likelihood of loan charge-off
    on the interaction of lending distance and a set ofP  dummy variable representing each year in the sample. Specifically, we plot (βt ) from estimating the
    following specification: %CObcti = θct + ωb + θi + t βt Distancebcti × Y eart + bcti and the vertical bands present 99% confidence intervals for the point
    estimates in each year. The shallow red circles represent the coefficients for SBA loans originated under the SBA XPRESS program. The shallow green
    triangles represent the coefficients for SBA loans originated under the Regular 7(a) program.

              Figure IA.5: Internal Capital Markets (Coefficient of Variation in Areas with low and High HHI)
    Figure IA.5 plots the average lending distance over time after stratifying banks based on the coefficient of variation of the market concentration in counties
    where banks have a branch presence and further partitioning the subset of banks with low coefficient of variation between banks exposed to above- and
    below-median market concentration in the local markets of their branch network. The figure plots the equal-weighted bank distance for the groups of
    banks with above-median coefficient of variation of market concentration; below-median coefficient of variation and below-median HHI; and below-median
    coefficient of variation and above-median HHI Local market concentration is measured as the HHI of the small business lending market as of 1996. Data for
    this figure is computed using the CRA Small Business Lending and the SOD datasets.

Figure IA.7: Robustness: Alternative Measure of Distance in the Small Business Administration
Sample
Figure IA.7 plots the effect of distance between the borrower and lender in the SBA dataset over time. To compute distances, we
hand-match all lenders with more that 500 SBA loans to the Summary of Deposits dataset and we compute distance as the minimum
distance between the borrowers’ address and their respective lender closest branch. The plot shows the same boom-bust pattern in
average distance around the recent financial crisis.

Figure IA.8: Robustness: Alternative Measure of Distance in the Small Business Administration
Sample
Figure IA.8 represents the evolution over time of the estimated marginal effect of distance on changes in bank lending measured at
different points of the distribution of the HHI coefficient of variation of banks. We compute
                                                                                          P       the marginal effects of P
                                                                                                                          distance over time
using estimates from the following empirical specification: ∆%SBLbct = θct + ωb + t γt (Distance × Y ear)bct + t λt (Distance ×
Y ear × σHHIbct ) + ΓXbt + bct , where σHHIbct is the coefficient of variation of the HHI in the branch network of the bank. The marginal
effects are computed using the year-specific elasticities of loan volume with respect to distance (γ̂t ) and the year-specific elasticities of
loan volume with respect to distance interacted with σHHI (λ̂t ). Specifically, we plot γ̂t + λ̂t × σHHI, where t = 1996, ...2016, and
σHHI takes values {µ − 2σ, µ + 2σ}, where µ is the mean value of σHHI over the entire sample and σ is the standard deviation of
σHHI over the entire sample. The green dashed line is the elasticity of the volume of loans over time for a representative bank-county
pair whose value of σHHI is two standard deviations above the mean. The solid red line is the elasticity of the volume of loans over time
for a representative bank-county pair whose value of σHHI is two standard deviations below the mean. Data for this figure is computed
using the CRA Small Business Lending and the SOD datasets.

Table IA.1 reports the coefficients of OLS regressions investigating the effect of distance on alternative measures of small business lending.
∆ Number Loans is the percent change in the number of loans originated by a bank in a county. Start is an indicator variable that takes
the value of one if the bank made a loan to a borrower located in a county where the bank had not made loans the previous year. Exit
is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if the bank stopped lending to a county where the bank had originated a loan during
the previous year. ∆ Vol ≤ 100k is the percent change in the number of loans originated by a bank in a county with principal below
$100,000. 100k ≤ ∆ Vol ≤ 1M is the percent change in the number of loans originated by a bank in a county with principal amount
between $100,000 and $1M. HP-Filtered Real GDP is the standardize HP-filtered percent change in the real GDP. Real GDP series is
obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Ln(Distance) is the natural
logarithm of the minimum distance between the bank’s branch network and the county centroid. All specifications include county-by-year
and bank fixed-effects as well as baseline controls for natural logarithm of Total Assets, Share of Commercial & Real Estate Loans, Share
of Residential Loans, and Share of Commercial & Industrial Loans. Standard errors are presented in parentheses, and are clustered at

     in a county. HP-Filtered Real GDP is the standardize HP-filtered percent change in the real GDP. Real GDP series is obtained from the Federal Reserve
     Economic Data (FRED) website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. ∆ Ln(Unempld Rate is standardized log difference in the US annual unemployment
     rate. The unemployment rate series is obtained from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Spreads is
     the standardized net percentage of domestic banks increasing spreads of loan rates over banks’ cost of funds to small firms. The series is obtained from the
     Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Out-County Dummy is an indicator variable that takes the value of
     one if the lender does not operate a branch in the county of the borrower. HHI Difference is the difference in SBL market concentration between destination
     (host) market and the closest branch (home) market. HHI Origin is the SBL market concentration in the closest branch (home) market. HHI Destination
     is the SBL market concentration in the destination (host) market. Local market concentration is measured as the HHI of the small business lending market
     in each county measured in 1996. The specification includes county-by-year and bank fixed-effects as well as baseline controls for natural logarithm of Total
     Assets, Share of Commercial & Real Estate Loans, Share of Residential Loans, and Share of Commercial & Industrial Loans. The specification also conditions
     on the interactions between HHI and the business cycle indicators, and HHI and Distance. Standard errors are presented in parentheses, and are clustered
     at the level of the county. ***, **, and *, represent statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
