                                         ABSTRACT

This paper explores the relationship between exchange rate adjustment and trade policy in a
simple New Keynesian open economy macro model. We show that movement in exchange rates
have a direct implication for trade policy when governments choose tariffs endogenously. In
particular, we show that the strategic incentive to impose trade restrictions is greater under
flexible exchange rates than when exchange rates are fixed. This surprising result goes counter to
conventional wisdom, which suggests that pressures to impose trade restrictions are greater when
countries resist adjustments in exchange rates. But in fact, we show that the empirical evidence
supports the model predictions. The paper goes on to characterize the path of equilibrium
sustainable tariffs in the presence of sticky prices and flexible exchange rates. In our baseline
model, tariff rates will rise in response to monetary policy shocks, but fall in response to
productivity shocks. Estimating an SVAR model, we also find evidence in support of this
prediction.

1    Introduction
International macroeconomics typically treats the determination of trade policy separately from
the determination of exchange rates. Exchange rate adjustment is a central feature of open
economy business cycles and international macroeconomic transmission. But both exchange rate
movements and trade policy, such as tariffs or quotas, affect relative prices, competitiveness,
and trade flows. The factors which are important for the determination of exchange rate policy
are likely to have implications for trade policy, and vice versa. Recent events suggest that
protectionist trade policies are on the increase around the world. To the extent that trade
restrictions attempt to affect macroeconomic outcomes such as competitiveness or the trade
balance, their evaluation and impact may not be easily separated from the movements in exchange
rates.

    To take a concrete example, imagine a scenario where a country receiving a negative demand
shock experiences an exchange rate depreciation which acts as a stabilizing mechanism, improving
its trade balance and reducing the fall in domestic income. The exchange rate plays a role in
cushioning the impact of the shock, increasing the trade balance, but at the same time, reducing
the trade balance of partner countries. In this instance, one might expect that partner countries
might have an incentive to respond to the appreciation of their currency by imposing trade
restrictions. If trade restrictions follow exchange rate movements, then the stabilizing role of
exchange rate adjustment in business cycle transmission may be diminished. It follows that one
cannot analyze the mechanism of exchange rate adjustment without at the same time looking at
the incentives behind trade policy.

    A contemporary example of this perspective might be seen in the newly negotiated ‘USMCA’;
the Canada-US-Mexico trade pact which is set to replace NAFTA. Chapter 33 of this proposed
agreement concerns the set-up of a ‘Macroeconomic Committee’ comprised of representatives
from the three countries that will oversee macroeconomic policy in each country, designed to avoid
‘competitive devaluation’ and ensure ‘free market’ determination of exchange rates. Although
the implications of this new body is unclear, it is not unrealistic to imagine that it could constrain
a central bank from an easing of monetary policy following a negative shock, and thus prevent
desired exchange rate adjustment, for fear of retaliatory trade restrictions.

    This paper explores the relationship between exchange rate adjustment and trade policy in
a simple open economy macro model. We show that movement in exchange rates have a direct
implication for trade policy when governments choose tariffs endogenously. In particular, we
show that the strategic incentive to impose trade restrictions is greater under flexible exchange
rates than when exchange rates are fixed. This surprising result goes counter to conventional
wisdom, which suggests that pressures to impose trade restrictions are greater when countries
resist adjustments in exchange rates. But in fact, we show that the empirical evidence supports
the model predictions.

    The paper goes on to look at the business cycle determinants of trade policy and exchange
rates in a dynamic game in which governments choose tariffs subject to time-varying incentive
constraints. We identify the best sustainable tariff policies which satisfy this incentive constraint.
The environment is one in which both demand and supply shocks may affect the dynamics of
the best sustainable trade policy. In other words, we investigate whether the trade restrictions
implied by the model are influenced by the business cycle.

                                                  2
    We show that the cyclicality of trade policy is critically tied to the presence of sticky prices. In
an economy with fully flexible prices, and persistent productivity shocks, tariffs will be essentially
a-cyclical. In particular, a permanent shock to productivity in either country has no impact on
the equilibrium tariff policy. This is because such a shock leads to an equal increase in the costs
and benefits of deviating from a sustainable tariff policy, thus leaving the equilibrium sustainable
tariff unchanged. By contrast, with sticky prices, in which trade policy is determined conditional
on the preset prices, protectionism will vary at the business cycle frequency.

    Are equilibrium tariffs pro-cyclical or countercyclical? The answer to this question depends
both on the drivers of the business cycle; in our model these are both monetary shocks and
productivity shocks, and the parameters of the underlying model – in particular the elasticity of
inter-temporal substitution. In our baseline case, assuming a relatively high elasticity of intertem-
poral substitution, which we argue is appropriate for models of international trade, we show that
demand shocks, in the form of innovations to monetary policy, will lead to an increase in trade
restrictions, since these shocks will lead to a more binding incentive constraint on trade policy
determination for each policy maker. On the other hand, persistent supply shocks (technology
shocks) will relax the incentive constraint and reduce equilibrium trade restrictions. There is
also empirical support for this implication of the model. Evidence from a simple structural VAR
model for a subset of OECD countries with a flexible exchange rate regime provides support for
this prediction about the link between business cycle frequency shocks and trade restrictions.

    Our model has a further implication for the effects of cyclical macro shocks on protectionism.
As noted above, with fully flexible prices, sustainable tariff rates are unresponsive to macro
shocks, but in fact the average sustainable tariff level is higher, the greater the uncertainty in
productivity. By contrast, with sticky prices, a rise in the volatility of productivity shocks leads
to a large reduction in the mean sustainable tariff rate. We show that this is tied to the impact
of uncertainty on the price level, when productivity shocks are unpredictable. An increase in the
variance of productivity shocks, through its effect on price levels, causes a large increase in the
costs of deviating from a sustainable tariff path, and as a result reduces the incentive for any
country to deviate. Thus, our analysis implies that both first and second moments of equilibrium
tariff rates are critically tied to movements in exchange rates and macro shocks in the basic New
Keynesian open economy macro model.

    Our paper is not the first to investigate the question of the interaction between exchange rates
and trade restrictions or tariffs. Recently, Barattieri, Cacciatore, and Ghironi (2018) investigate
empirically the impact of exogenous changes in tariffs, and show that they act as negative sup-
ply shocks, depressing GDP and raising inflation with little effects on the trade balance. They
propose a small open economy model with firm entry and endogenous tradability that success-
fully rationalizes the empirical evidence. We adopt a mirror perspective, considering tariffs as
endogenous and ask how governments react to economic conditions to determine trade policies
over the business cycle. Another recent paper by Erceg, Prestipino, and Raffo (2018) studies the
effects of trade policies in the form of import tariffs and export subsidies. They show that the
macroeconomic effects of these policies critically depend on the response of the real exchange
rate, and that in turn depends on the expectations about future policies and potential retaliation
from trade partners. Finally, a recent paper by Furceri, Hannan, Ostry, and Rose (2018) exam-
ines the macroeconomic consequences of tariff shocks, and shows that these shocks are generally
contractionary.


                                                   3
    Focusing more closely on the endogenous determination of trade policies, Eaton and Grossman
(1985) study optimal tariffs when international asset markets are incomplete and show that they
can be used to partly compensate the lack of consumption insurance. Bergin and Corsetti (2015)
also consider tariffs as policy instruments in addition to monetary policy but their focus is not
specifically on tariffs, rather on the implications of monetary policy on the building of comparative
advantages. Closer to our paper, Bagwell and Staiger (2003) propose a trade model featuring
potential terms-of-trade manipulation by governments, and trade agreements as means to restrict
this policy option. They find that the resulting trade restrictions are countercyclical, because the
potential costs of opting out is pro-cyclical. Although our model has some differences, we adopt a
similar logic by looking at the incentive behind sustainable tariffs, but our paper is complementary
to theirs. In particular, it allows for different sources of business cycle fluctuations, and shows
that the cyclical pattern of trade restrictions depends on the type of shocks. In addition, we also
consider the importance of the exchange rate regime, as well as sticky prices in the determination
of trade policies.

    The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops a simple, tractable open economy
model where tariffs play a role in affecting the exchange rate and the terms of trade. Section 3
looks at the welfare effects of tariffs in this model, shows that the incentive to set tariffs depends
on the exchange rate regime and that incentives are higher under fixed exchange rate regimes.
Section 4 then extends the analysis to allow for endogenous tariffs, where tariffs are determined
as a sustainable equilibrium in a dynamic game between governments. This section shows that
tariffs are acyclical under flexible prices, but with sticky prices (where prices are preset one
period in advance), tariffs vary over the business cycle. In particular, tariffs respond negatively
(respectively positively) to expansionary supply (resp. demand) shocks. Section 5 extends the
analysis to a more elaborate dynamic model with gradual price adjustment and a Taylor-type
monetary policy rule. We show that the results of the analytical model carry over to the more
general specification. Section 6 is empirical. In Section 6.1, we use the Global Anti-Dumping
database maintained by the WTO, and find evidence that protectionist tensions are conditionally
more prevalent under flexible exchange rates. In Section 6.2, we present time series evidence
from a sub-set of countries that maintain flexible exchange rates. Using SVAR identification
assumptions, we show that supply shocks tend to reduce protectionism, while monetary policy
shocks tend to increase protectionism, as predicted by the models. Section 7 presents some
conclusions.


2     A tractable model with pre-set prices
To explore the ideas discussed in the introduction, we begin by developing a two country open
economy framework with endogenous trade policy that may depend on macroeconomic condi-
tions. Our first model is extremely simple. It can be solved with pen and paper, but despite
this, it carries quite a rich set of implications for the relationship between exchange rate regimes,
business cycle shocks, and protectionism. In a later section, we extend the analysis to a more
elaborate dynamic model which is solved numerically.

2.1   Households
We start with a plain vanilla two-country model. The two countries are home and foreign. In
each country, households earn wages and profits in each period, supply labor, and consume home


                                                  4
and foreign goods. In this version of the model there is no capital mobility across countries. The
home country utility is
                                            C 1−σ    H 1+ψ
                                       U=         −
                                            1−σ      1+ψ
where C is the consumption aggregator and H is labor supply. The consumption aggregator is
Cobb Douglas, and depends on home goods and foreign goods in the following way:

                                            C = Cxω Cm
                                                     1−ω


   Households in the home country face the budget constraint:

                       M + Px Cx + (1 + τ )SPm Cm = W H + Π + T + M0                           (1)

where τ is a tariff levied on the imported good, M represents money holdings, S is the nominal
exchange rate, Px is the home currency price of home goods and Pm is the foreign currency price
of foreign goods. Variable W is the nominal wage rate, and T is a lump-sum rebate of the tariff
revenue, so that:
                                          T = τ SPm Cm                                      (2)
    We assume that there is a binding cash in advance constraint for households, which acts so
as to pin down nominal magnitudes:

                                      M ≥ Px Cx + SPm Cm

where M is home country money supply, set exogenously by the home monetary authority. In
the dynamic model presented in Section 5, we expand the framework to allow monetary policy
to be set as an interest rate rule. For simplicity, in this section we make the assumption that the
cash in advance requirement exempts tariff payments. The consumer’s first-order conditions are
standard, and optimal consumption implies
                                             ω
                                  Px Cx =       SPm (1 + τ )Cm                                 (3)
                                            1−ω
   Optimal labor supply and the cash in advance constraint imply
                                                  Px Cx
                                     W = H ψ C σ−1                                             (4)
                                                   ω
                                    M = Px Cx + SPm Cm                                         (5)

2.2   Firms
Firms choose prices to maximize profits. Sticky prices are a key factor in the analysis. To avoid
intrinsic dynamics in the model, we assume that prices have to be set in advance of the within-
period (monetary and productivity) shocks. But once the shocks are realized, prices can fully
adjust before the next period. Firms operate with a linear technology:

                                              Yx = θH

and profits are given by:
                                        Π = Px Yx − W H


                                                 5
    The optimal price satisfies:1
                                              EWθ Yx λ
                                                   Px =
                                               EYx λ
where E is the expectation operator, and λ is the household’s Lagrange multiplier for nominal
income:
                                                1
                                         λ= σ                                             (6)
                                               C P
where
                                  P = Pxω ((1 + τ )SPm )1−ω                               (7)
    The following further conditions define the equilibrium market clearing in goods and money:
                                                 Yx = Cx + Cx∗
                                                            ∗
                                               Ym = C m + C m
                                                 M     = M0
                                                   ∗
                                               M       = M0

2.3    Solving the model
For given tariffs, using (1), (2), and (5) with M = M0 we can derive:
                              ω(1 + τ )                          ω∗            SPm Ym
                   Cx =                     Yx , Cx∗ =       ∗        ∗      ∗
                          ω(1 + τ ) + 1 − ω            (1 − ω ) (1 + τ ) + ω     Px
                                (1 − ω)       Px Yx    ∗      (1 − ω ∗ ) (1 + τ ∗ )
                    Cm =                            , Cm =                            Ym
                            ω(1 + τ ) + 1 − ω SPm          (1 − ω ∗ )(1 + τ ∗ ) + ω ∗
                                         Px Cx
    We can also show that P C =            ω ,   so that the wage W above is

                                                   W = HψCσP
and therefore the expression for the pre-set price may be written as
                                                                ψ
                                                            E H θYx
                                                   Px =                                                           (8)
                                                            E CYσxP
    We write out the equilibrium in a simple form as
                                    ω(1 + τ )                      ω∗
                         Yx =                     Yx +                             QYm                            (9)
                                ω(1 + τ ) + 1 − ω      (1 − ω ∗ ) (1 + τ ∗ ) + ω ∗
                                      1−ω          Yx      (1 − ω ∗ ) (1 + τ ∗ )
                         Ym =                         +                             Ym                          (10)

      Implicitly, we are assuming that the domestic good is differentiated into Dixit-Stiglitz substitutable products,
so that firms have a well-defined maximization problem. In addition, we are assuming that price markups are
offset with an optimal subsidy to eliminate monopoly distortions.

Expanding (8) using (6), (7), (11) and (12), we get the expression for the optimal price of home
goods as

where we have used P = Px ((1 + τ )Q)1−ω and P ∗ = Pm ((1 + τ ∗ )/Q)ω . Equations (13) and (14)

    The analysis of tariff setting in the model below depends critically on the way in which pre-set
prices depend on money and productivity shocks. We can illustrate this linkage by explicitly
solving (13) and (14). First, starting from (9), we can express the terms of trade as:

                                     Yx 1 − ω (1 − ω ∗ ) (1 + τ ∗ ) + ω ∗
                                                                         
                              Q=                                                                (15)
                                    Ym     ω∗     ω(1 + τ ) + 1 − ω
   Then, using (11) and (12) we get the following nominal exchange rate equation:

                                                     1 − ω (1 − ω ∗ )(1 + τ ∗ ) + ω ∗ M
                                               S=                                                                                     (16)
                                                       ω∗    ω(1 + τ ) + (1 − ω) M ∗
   Finally, using (16) along with the price equations (13) and (14), we can express the home
and foreign goods price as a function of the underlying shocks:

    Hence, the solutions (17) and (18) make clear that ex-ante pre-set prices depend on the
distribution of money shocks, productivity shocks and home and foreign tariffs. We use (17) and
(18) along with (11) and (12) to compute expected home and foreign output and expected utility
below. First note that if prices were fully flexible, and could adjust to money, productivity, or
tariff shocks, we would have the solutions:
              ψ+σ+ω∗ (1−σ))           (1−ω)(1−σ))                   ψ+σ+(1−ω)(1−σ))        ω∗ (1−σ))

                                                                                                      (21)
    With fully flexible prices money is neutral, but normalized prices are negatively related to
domestic productivity shocks, and positively related to own country tariffs.

2.5     Utility measures
In order to determine the path of tariffs, it is necessary to construct welfare measures for benev-
olent governments in each country. Given optimal price-setting, we can express expected utility
for the home country as:
                                       1−σ
                                                   H 1+ψ         C 1−σ
                                                         
                                        C
                            EU = E               −          = EΓ                               (22)
                                        1−σ        1+ψ           1−σ

where
                                                    (1 − σ)(ω(1 + τ ) + 1 − ω)
                                    Γ(τ ) ≡ 1 −                                                                      (23)
                                                          (1 + τ )(1 + ψ)
   From the equilibrium terms of trade in the previous section, we can express the consumption
aggregator as:
                              C = Cxω Cm 1−ω
                                             = Yxω Ym1−ω ζ(τ, τ ∗ )
                         ω          ∗
where ζ = δω(τ )ω(1+τ )
                               ( ω )1−ω , δω = ω(1 + τ ) + 1 − ω and δω∗ = (1 − ω ∗ )(1 + τ ∗ ) + ω ∗ .
                  δω∗ (τ ∗ )1−ω 1−ω
   So the equilibrium period expected utility expression can be written as:
                                                             ω         1−ω              !1−σ

where the prices are expressed as the above solutions (17) and (18), and depend on expected
productivity and money shocks. Expression (24) indicates that expected utility depends on the
tariff rates set by the home and foreign governments. In particular, it is easy see that for expected
output levels, beginning at a zero home tariff, expected utility is increasing in the home tariff
rate and (always) decreasing in the foreign tariff rate.

    In the case of fully flexible prices, we may combine (21) with (24) to express expected utility
solely as a function of productivity and tariff shocks:

   In section 4 below, we will use (25) to construct equilibrium value functions in the tariff game
between countries.


3     Tariff setting
We first look at the motives for setting tariffs among non-cooperative, benevolent governments.
The incentive to employ tariffs is critically dependent upon the timing of tariff setting, and the
degree of price rigidity. Let us first assume that prices are fully flexible and tariffs are set by
governments that internalize the price setting activities of firms.

3.1   Tariff setting with flexible prices
When prices are fully flexible, tariff setting must take account of both the direct effect on the
country terms of trade and the indirect effect on home and foreign output through endogenous
labor supply. From (15) and (24) above, we can easily show that holding home and foreign
output constant, a home country tariff improves the home terms of trade, and increases home
welfare. But the tariff will also affect domestic and foreign output. Note that from (21) above,
home output with flexible prices may be written as:

                                                  ψ+σ+ω∆∗ (1−σ)) "                   # (1−ω)(1−σ))
                                     θ1+ψ                              θ∗(1+ψ)              ∆
                                
                         Yx =                                                                                    (26)
                                    Λ(τ, τ ∗ )                        Λ∗ (τ, τ ∗ )
    The impact of a home tariff on home output depends on a mix of income and substitution
effects. The tariff raises the domestic terms of trade, which increases the real wage and increases
labor supply. But the rise in the terms of trade also increases consumption which reduces labor
supply through an income effect. When σ = 1, we see from (19) and (26) above that a home
tariff reduces domestic output, but has no impact on foreign output. More generally, we can
evaluate the impact of a tariff on Yx , in the special case where home bias is symmetric across
the two countries, so that ω ∗ = 1 − ω, and evaluated at zero initial tariffs. We obtain:

                  dYx                    (1 − ω)(ωψ(σ − 1) + ω(σ 2 − 1) + ψ + 1)
                      |{τ =τ ∗ =0} = −Yx
                  dτ                       (σ + ψ)((2ω − 1)σ + ψ + 2(1 − ω)))
    This may be positive or negative. In the case where σ < 1, it is possible that substitution
effects are strong enough that the tariff increases home country output. The effect of a home
tariff on foreign output may be expressed as

                     dYm                    (1 − ω)(σ − 1)(1 + ωψ + ω(σ − 1))
                         |{τ =τ ∗ =0} = Ym
                      dτ                   (σ + ψ)((2ω − 1)σ + ψ + 2(1 − ω)))
    When σ < 1 this is negative, as the fall in the foreign terms of trade generates substitution
effects in the opposite direction to those in the home country.


                                                             9
    Whether the tariff increases or decreases home or foreign output, it is easy to show that the
direct welfare benefit from terms of trade improvement always outweighs the indirect effects on
output. Even under flexible prices and endogenous output, a country gains from imposing a
small tariff, conditional on the zero tariff of the foreign country. Using (25) above, we can derive
the impact of a tariff on home welfare, evaluated at τ = τ ∗ = 0, as:

                          dU (τ, τ ∗ )                  (1 − ω)(1 + ωψ + ω(σ − 1))
                                       |{τ =τ ∗ =0} = Λ
                             dτ                          (2ω − 1)σ + ψ + 2(1 − ω)
where Λ > 0.

3.2   Tariff setting with pre-set prices
Now we ask what are the incentives to levy tariffs in the economy with sticky prices. For this we
need to be careful about the timing of tariffs. We make the following assumption. Say that tariffs
are levied at the end of a period, after prices have been set by firms. In addition, we assume
that there is no commitment in tariff setting. Tariffs are set in the current period for this period
alone, assuming that the future trade authority sets its own tariffs. So the trade authority this
period faces a static problem, setting tariffs once the prices have been set.

    Here we have to distinguish between fixed and flexible exchange rates. Under flexible exchange
rates, we have M and M ∗ exogenous, and the exchange rate is, from (16)

                                       1 − ω (1 − ω ∗ )(1 + τ ∗ ) + ω ∗ M
                                 S=
                                         ω∗    ω(1 + τ ) + (1 − ω) M ∗

    From the point of view of the tariff authority, Yx is taken as given, since Px is fixed and M is
outside of its control. But a tariff can tilt the terms of trade in its favour under flexible exchange
rates. Utility, given output, is just captured by C, which from the authority’s perspective, when
exchange rates adjust to change the terms of trade, is
                                      ω          M
                                                       !1−ω                ω         1−ω
                                                                                  M∗
                                                                 
                        M ω(1 + τ )        1−ω    Px                  M
               C=                                SPm
                                                              =                               ζ(τ, τ ∗ )   (27)
                        Px   δω             δω    Px
                                                                      Px          Pm

    This is increasing in τ , so the authority has an incentive to levy tariffs starting from a point of
zero tariffs τ = 0. In fact, it would want an infinite tariff, given the assumption of Cobb Douglas
elasticity and no production of importable. To prevent this from happening in the sustainable
tariff game, we will assume a maximum possible tariff rate of τ H .

    Now look at the same situation with fixed exchange rates. An important question arises as
to which monetary authority fixes the exchange rate. If it is the foreign monetary authority,
then from the point of view of the home tariff setter the movements in foreign money necessary
to maintain an exchange rate peg have no consequences for home welfare, as can be seen from
the middle equality in, (27), when S is fixed. But if it is the home monetary authority, this
is not the case, because movements in M have direct effects on the domestic output level and
the domestic endowment. To resolve this question, we use the following strategic rule. If the
home country deviates from a sustainable tariff (as defined below), we assume that the foreign
monetary authority adjusts policy to keep the exchange rate fixed, while if the foreign country
deviates, then the home monetary authority adjusts policy to maintain a fixed exchange rate.

                                                    10
This rule is intuitive in the sense that attempts by the home country to manipulate its effective
terms of trade by increasing tariffs are offset by the foreign monetary authority, and vice versa.

    Given this assumption, let us look at the incentive of the home monetary authority to levy
tariff under fixed exchange rates. When the exchange rate is fixed by the foreign country (where
the foreign monetary authority does by adjusting M ∗ to keep S fixed), then from the definition
of utility, we have:

                                       (1 + τ )ω         Px 1−ω ω
                                                         
                     ω 1−ω
                   Cx Cm = Yx                                     ω (1 − ω)1−ω
                                   ω(1 + τ ) + 1 − ω    SPm
    This is decreasing in τ , starting at τ = 0, given that S and Yx are both fixed from the point of
view of the tariff setter. Also, given fixed prices and domestic monetary policy set independently
of the tariff M , home labor will be independent of τ . So there is no incentive to levy a tariff
under fixed exchange rates. Intuitively, the trade authority cannot affect its terms of trade under
a fixed exchange rate regime, so the tariff only reduces its own welfare.

    We may summarize this section in the following way:
Result 1 Given the timing assumptions of tariff setting and policy response, the incentive to
    levy tariffs for domestic gain is greater in a flexible exchange rate environment than under
    fixed exchange rates.


4     Sustainable tariffs
We now extend this logic to the case of sustainable tariffs. The idea is that there is a utility
that each authority achieves from sustainable tariffs V (τ̃ , τ̃ ∗ ). If the authority cheats, and sets
the maximum tariff, it gets utility V cheat (τ H , τ̃ ∗ ). But if it cheats, then the maximum possible
punishment is imposed in the next period, and lasts forever. Since τ = τ ∗ = τ H is a Nash
equilibrium, this punishment is credible. As such, the maximum sustainable tariff is one which
just offsets the benefits of cheating against the losses of reverting to the maximum Nash tariff
equilibrium in the next period.

    However, given the timing of decision making for the tariff authority, there is an extra com-
plication. The tariff setter chooses τ once prices have been set. But she must take into account
the future consequences of either cheating or sticking to the sustainable plan, taking into account
the nature of price setting for the future. This means that the functional statements of the gains
from cheating are stated in a different way than the future consequences of cheating. Simply
speaking, the authority knows that prices will adjust, and takes this into account, whereas in the
current time period, prices are taken as given.

4.1   Notation
Start with some notation. There are four exogenous state variables, the two states of monetary
policy, and the two states of productivity. We define these as zt = {Mt , Mt∗ , θt , θt∗ }. We define
z t = {z0 ...zt } as a state history. In addition, from the perspective of the tariff authority at any
time t, the state includes the preset prices Pxt , Pmt . Thus, sustainable tariffs will be conditioned
on the state zt and preset prices. We thus define the expanded state z̃t = {zt , Pxt , Pmt }. The
task is to derive the sequences of sustainable tariffs τ̃ (z̃t ), τ̃ ∗ (z̃t ).

                                                  11
    First, for the home country tariff setter, define the one-period       payoff from cheating           on the
sustainable tariff sequence at time t. Let C z̃t , τ H , τ̃ ∗t (z̃t ) and H z̃t , τ H , τ̃ ∗t (z̃t ) respectively
                                                                                                   

denote the consumption and the hours worked levels that realize if the local tariff setter cheats
and applies τ H (the highest level of tariffs) while the foreign tariff setter remains on the path of
sustainable tariffs τ̃ ∗t (z̃t ). Then the current-period value of cheating is:
                                                                                              1−σ                                      1+ψ
                                                                 C z̃t , τ H , τ̃ ∗t (z̃t )              Yx z̃t , τ H , τ̃ ∗t (z̃t )

                                          , τ̃ ∗t (z̃t )
                                                           
                 v          z̃t , τ                            =                                     −
                                                                           1−σ                                θt1+ψ (1 + ψ)

and the value of cheating at time t in state z̃t for the home tariff-setter is

                        V CH (z̃t ) = v CH z̃t , τ H , τ̃ ∗t (z̃t ) + βEt V N (z̃t+1 )
                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                    (28)

where β is the tariff setter’s discount factor, and V N (z̃t+1 ) is the continuation value, given that
cheating has happened in the past. We define V N (z̃t ) as follows. The one-period payoff in the
worst Nash equilibrium is defined as
                                                                                          1−σ                                 1+ψ
                            N              H       ∗H
                                                                C z̃t , τ H , τ ∗H                    Yx z̃t , τ H , τ ∗H
                        v       z̃t , τ , τ                    =                                  −
                                                                         1−σ                             θt1+ψ (1 + ψ)

    Given this, the recursive form of V N (z̃t ) is written as

                            V N (z̃t ) = v N z̃t , τ H , τ H + βEt V N (z̃t+1 )
                                                            
                                                                                                                                                    (29)

   That is, V N (z̃t ) is the value to the tariff setter of being in the worst Nash equilibrium forever.
The one-period value of being on the sustainable path of tariff is defined as

                                                                C (z̃t , τ̃ t (z̃t ), τ̃ ∗t (z̃t ))1−σ   Yx (z̃t , τ̃ t (z̃t ), τ̃ ∗t (z̃t )) 1+ψ
             v C (z̃t , τ̃ t (z̃t ), τ̃ ∗t (z̃t )) =                                                   −
                                                                               1−σ                           θt1+ψ (1 + ψ)

    Using this, we define the continuation value of being on the sustainable tariff path as

                                      V C (z̃t ) = v C (z̃t , τ̃ t (z̃t ), τ ∗t (z̃t )) + βEt V C (z̃t+1 )                                          (30)

   Equivalent definitions apply to the foreign tariff setters decision. Given the above definitions,
a pair of sustainable tariff sequences τ̃ (z̃t ), τ̃ ∗ (z̃t ) is constructed from the following conditions:

                                                                      V CH (z̃t ) = V C (z̃t )                                                      (31)

                                                                    V ∗CH (z̃t ) = V ∗C (z̃t )                                                      (32)

4.2    Sustainable tariffs with flexible prices
We first illustrate the result stated in the introduction; the cyclical nature of tariffs appears only
when prices are sticky. To see this, we make the following assumptions regarding the money and
productivity shocks. Specifically, we assume that

                  Mt = Mt−1 (1 + µt ), Mt∗ = Mt−1
                                              ∗
                                                  (1 + µ∗t ), {µt , µ∗t } ∼ i.i.d.(0, σµ2 )                                                         (33)
                                                   ∗
                       θt = θt−1 (1 + νt ), θt∗ = θt−1 (1 + νt∗ ), {νt , νt∗ } ∼ i.i.d.(0, σν2 )                                                    (34)

                                                                                   12
Hence, both productivity and money growth are i.i.d. processes.

   In the fully flexible price environment, Section 2 above showed that home utility may be
written as
                                            Γ(τt )
                            U (τt , τt∗ ) =        (F(θt , θt∗ )H(τt , τt∗ ))1−σ       (35)
                                            1−σ
where Γ(τt ), F(θt , θt∗ ), and H(τt , τt∗ ) are as defined above.

   An equilibrium sustainable tariff sequence is defined as {τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t }, t = 0..., ∞. Using the value
function definition (28) along with (35), the expected utility from cheating along a sustainable
path may be written as

                         Γ(τ H )                            1−σ        β       Γ(τ H )                           1−σ
  EV CH (z˜t ) =                 F(θt , θt∗ )H(τ H , τ̃ ∗t )     +          1−σ         F(θt , θt∗ )H(τ H , τ H )
                         1−σ                                       1 − βEΞ1     1−σ
                                                                                                                    (36)
                                   (1+ψ)(ω(σ+ψ)+(1−σ)ω ∗ )             (1+ψ)2 (1−ω)
where Ξ1 = (1 + νt+1 )       (σ+ψ)δ           ∗ ) (σ+ψ)δ
                                        (1 + νt+1            This expression uses the property
that expected utility is homogeneous in productivity, and productivity shocks are i.i.d., so that
Et (Ξ1t+1 )1−σ is constant.2

       By contrast, the expected utility from remaining on the sustainable path is

               Γ(τ̃ t )                                          β       Γ(τ̃ t+1 )                                  1−σ
EV S (τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t ) =  (F(θt , θt∗ )H(τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t ))1−σ +          1−σ            F(θt , θt∗ )H(τ̃ t+1 , τ̃ ∗t+1 )
               1−σ                                          1 − βEΞ1      1−σ
                                                                                                                     (37)
Equating (36) and (37) and canceling the term F(θt , θt∗ ) gives us

                             Γ(τ H )                1−σ        β       Γ(τ H )              1−σ
                                     H(τ H , τ̃ ∗t )     +          1−σ         H(τ H , τ H )
                             1−σ                           1 − βEΞ1     1−σ

                             Γ(τ̃ t )                              β       Γ(τ̃ t+1 )                     1−σ
                         =            (H(τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t ))1−σ +          1−σ            H(τ̃ t+1 , τ̃ ∗t+1 )         (38)
                             1−σ                              1 − βEΞ1      1−σ

    Condition (38), and an equivalent condition for the foreign country, defines an equilibrium
sequence of sustainable tariffs {τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t }, t = 0..., ∞. However, since (38) contains no time-varying
coefficients, a stationary equilibrium for the sustainable tariff sequence for each country implies
a constant tariff rate. We conclude from that the following result:

Result 2 With flexible prices, the stationary equilibrium sustainable tariffs are constant over
    time.

    Hence, with flexible prices, protectionism is acyclical in our model. Even though countries
are subject to random productivity shocks, the productivity shocks affect the costs and benefits
of deviating from the sustainable path in the same way. Thus, the incentive towards increased
protectionism is unaffected.
   2
       We must also assume that expected utility converges, which requires βEΞ1 1−σ < 1.




                                                                  13
4.3     Sustainable tariffs with pre-set prices
When prices are pre-set, the sustainable path of tariffs is characterized in a different manner,
and critically, the equilibrium sustainable tariff sequence will be time-varying, depending on the
outcome of productivity and money shocks. A key feature of the determination of tariffs is that
the policy-maker in any time period takes the prices as pre-set, so that output is given. Hence,
while monetary policy shocks will affect output and the gains to cheating by affecting demand,
productivity shocks will not – although technology shocks affect the disutility of labor in the
one-period utility of cheating, they affect the one-period utility of remaining on the sustainable
path in exactly equivalent ways, so the two effects cancel out. However, productivity shocks are
permanent, as described by (34) above, so these shocks will impact on future expected utility,
and as such affect the costs of cheating on the sustainable tariff equilibrium.

    In order to explore this trade-off, we compute the value functions faced by the tariff setters
in each country when tariffs are set conditional on pre-set prices. To begin, we have the value of
being in the worst Nash equilibrium as described by (29). This may be written more explicitly
as
                           ω  ∗ 1−ω              !1−σ

where the term ζ(τ H , τ H ) indicates that both countries set the highest possible tariff τ H .

   Taking expectations of (39) dated t − 1, we can use the property (22) to show that
                                                              !1−σ

   Then, using the equilibrium home and foreign prices (13) and (14), we can express (40) as

     The key difference between (44) and (48) is that the sequence of sustainable tariffs {τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t }
is now stochastic. Thus, the value function conjecture is only verified if AS is constant, which
requires that sustainable tariffs are time-invariant functions of the shocks zt . Since shocks are
i.i.d. this would ensure that {τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t } are also i.i.d., verifying the conjecture. We will show below
that the incentive constraint in fact ensures that {τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t } is i.i.d.

   Both (46) and (47) represent value functions pertaining to the home country, but equivalent
functions taking analogous forms may be derived for the foreign country.

4.4        The dynamic incentive constraints
The conditions (31) and (32) may now be applied using (46) and (47) to characterize the equilib-
rium sequence of sustainable tariffs. In particular, the incentive constraint for the home country
is

    Note that we have dropped the disutility of labor terms in the period utility for both sides of
the incentive constraint because they cancel out. This is because H = PMx and the price is set on
the assumption that the sustainable path is maintained, so employment and the disutility term
for the period utility is that same for V N (z̃t ) and V S (z̃t ).
                                                                                           ∗ )
    Now, we can use the homogeneity of the value function to cancel out the term F(θt−1 , θt−1
from both sides of (49), and again use the properties of the pricing equations (13) and (14) to
restate (49) as:

and as before, we define:
                                                                 ω ∗ (1+ψ)                             (1−ω ∗ )(σ+ψ)+(1−σ)(1−ω)

   Here (51) differs from (50) due to home bias in preferences, since ω ≥ ω ∗ . Conditions (50)
and (51) indicate that the incentive constraints will depend on shocks to money growth Ξt and to
productivity growth Ξ1t . We can now confirm that the equilibrium sustainable tariff sequence is
indeed i.i.d. Self-evidently, (50) and (51) depend only on current valued shocks, and the shocks
themselves are i.i.d.

   Although the incentive constraints are affected by both monetary growth and productivity
growth, these shocks have very different effects on the incentive constraints. A money growth
shock affects the immediate benefits from cheating, affecting current period utility but not ex-
pected future utility. By contrast, a productivity shock has no immediate effects on the current
benefits from cheating, since it impacts only the disutility of labor supply, and it does so in an
equal way for both the value of cheating and the value of remaining on the sustainable path.
But a productivity growth shock affects the expected future path of utility, both for the Nash
’punishment’ path, and the expected future utility along the sustainable path.




                                                                         16
    How will this difference in the time dimension of shocks affect the response of equilibrium
sustainable tariffs? The critical feature of (50) and (51) is that there is a current benefit from
cheating, but this brings future costs of cheating. As a result, we have:

                                       ζ(τ H , τ̃ ∗t ) > ζ(τ̃ t , τ̃ ∗t )

and
                                                AS > AN

    This implies that a money growth shock will lead the response of equilibrium sustainable
tariffs to move in a different direction than will a productivity growth shock. To make this
concrete, assume that σ < 1. Then a money growth shock will raise the first expression on both
the left and right hand side of (50), but will also raise the incentive to cheat, since it raises the
left hand expression more than the right hand expression. As a result, given a higher incentive
to cheat on the sustainable tariff sequence, equilibrium sustainable tariffs must rise to offset this
incentive.

   On the same logic, when σ < 1, a productivity shock will raise the future cost of cheating
more than it raises the future benefits of remaining on the sustainable path. Hence, there is a
reduced incentive to cheat, and equilibrium sustainable tariffs will fall to reflect this.

    When σ > 1, this logic is reversed, and monetary growth shocks will lead to a fall in the
sustainable equilibrium tariff rates, while productivity growth shocks will lead to a rise in sus-
tainable tariffs. Note however that the evidence in Section 6 above suggests that protectionism
in increasing (falling) in expansionary (contractionary) monetary shocks, while decreasing in
productivity shocks, suggesting that the case σ < 1 is more pertinent in the context of our static
model.

   Given this discussion, we may conclude:

Result 3. (i ) When σ < 1 (resp. > 1), a positive shock to M or M ∗ raises (reduces) the benefits
   of cheating on the sustainable tariff policy, leaving the costs of cheating unchanged, leading
   to an increase (decrease) in the equilibrium sustainable tariff. (ii ) When σ < 1 (resp. > 1),
   a rise in home or foreign productivity θ, θ∗ raises (reduces) the costs of cheating on the
   sustainable tariff equilibrium, leaving the benefits of cheating unchanged. As a result, the
   equilibrium sustainable tariff will fall (rise).

    Thus, we find that the cyclical pattern of tariffs depend on the source of shocks and the value
of σ. We take the case σ < 1 as a baseline. While macro and asset pricing models typically
assume σ > 1, it is typical in trade models which abstract from inter-temporal asset trade to
assume σ = 0. In any case, we present the σ > 1 case below, following our main discussion. Thus,
in the case σ < 1, protectionism is procyclical when the business cycle is driven by monetary (or
demand) shocks, but countercyclical when productivity shocks are the main sources of business
cycle variation.

4.5    Calibration and simulations
We calibrate the baseline model with the following parameters; σ = .5, and ψ = 2. We assume
a moderate degree of home bias in preferences, so that ω = 1 − ω ∗ = 0.7. We set the maximum
feasible tariff rate at sixty-two percent, so that τ H = .62. This is the average tariff rate estimated
by Ossa (2014) that would apply in a full scale world “tariff war”, and hence represents the
appropriate limit for the static Nash equilibrium tariff rate within our model – the implications
of varying τ H are also explored below.

   Given this, we choose a discount factor β = β ∗ so that the mean tariff rate in the sustainable
equilibrium in the baseline case is 10 percent, which is approximately the average degree of
trade restriction (including both tariff and non-tariff barriers), reported by UNCTAD (2013) for
advanced economies. This leads to a value of β = β ∗ = 0.6. We then choose independent money
and productivity shocks in the home and foreign country, assuming a standard deviation of 2
percent for each shock.3

    Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between tariffs and ex-post productivity and monetary
policy shocks, under various scenarios. Figure 1a illustrates the variation in home and foreign
tariffs as a function of home country productivity. The blue line shows the base case, and the red
line shows the impact of an unanticipated home country money shock. Absent the money shock
tariff rates are effectively equal in the two countries, so that tariffs respond in the same way to
productivity shocks in either country. After a home country money shock, the tariff schedule
shifts up in both countries, but to a greater degree in the home country, since the money shock
gives a greater incentive for the home country to deviate from the sustainable tariff equilibrium.

   Figure 1b shows the effect of differential discounting among the two countries. For this Figure
we set β = 0.5 and β ∗ = 0.6. Thus, the home country is more impatient than the foreign country.
As expected, it will therefore set a higher tariff rate than the foreign country, for any pattern
of monetary and productivity shocks, which reflects the higher relative valuation of the current
benefits from cheating, compared to the patient country. However, the response to productivity
and money shocks is qualitatively the same as in Figure 1a.

    Figure 1c illustrates an opposite parameterization for the elasticity of intertemporal substi-
tution, where σ = 1.5. As explained above, in this case, the cyclical pattern of tariffs is the
reverse of that described in the previous Figures. Tariffs are increasing in productivity shocks,
and decreasing in money shocks. Since our empirical results described below are more consistent
with the previous parameterization, we choose instead to concentrate on the case σ < 1. As
noted above, this is more consistent with most models of international trade, where intertempo-
ral consumption smoothing is not explicitly modeled. In particular, our model is quasi-static,
and consumption smoothing motives are not key to the dynamics of the model, which makes the
assumption more innocuous.

    Further, Table 1 reports the mean and coefficient of variation of tariff rates under the baseline
case and various alternative scenarios. The most important implication of the Table is the
large impact of productivity shocks on the average tariff levels. In the absence of variation in
productivity growth, average tariff rates would be 56 percent, close to the maximum Nash tariff
levels. By contrast, variance in monetary shocks has almost no effect on the mean tariff levels.
   3
    The model is solved assuming each shock takes on a five point distribution with equal probabilities, with a
standard deviation of 2 percent.

    What explains the large impact of productivity variance on tariff levels? The key intuition is
due to the impact of productivity uncertainty on sustainable tariffs, and through this channel,
the effect on equilibrium nominal prices. The intuition can be gleaned from Equations (17)
and (18) above, which give the pre-set prices in the presence of money and productivity shocks.
With independent money and productivity shocks across countries, an increase in the volatility
of either shock will lead to a lower price set by firms in each country. This is particularly
more important for productivity shocks. A fall in the level of pre-set prices will increase the
continuation value of the game for each country, whether on the sustainable path or in the Nash
punishment equilibrium. However, there is a critical difference between the sustainable path
and the Nash punishment equilibrium in that, under the sustainable path, tariff rates in the
future are uncertain, since they will respond to realized productivity shocks. This implies that
the effect of uncertain productivity on price levels is much stronger for the continuation values
under the sustainable path than the effect under the Nash punishment path. As a result, a rise
in the variance of productivity shocks makes the continuation value in the sustainable path more
attractive, allowing for a lower mean level of sustainable tariffs required to offset the incentive
to cheat in any period. Hence, a higher variance of productivity shocks reduces the mean level
of tariffs in the sustainable equilibrium.

    However, the above result is critically dependent on the price setting assumption. With fully
flexible prices, as captured by (37), tariff rates are constant, but the level of tariffs will depend
on the distribution of productivity shocks due to effect of this distribution on the discount factor.
In fact in this case, uncertainty in productivity has the opposite effect on the level of tariffs in
a sustainable equilibrium: a higher variance of productivity shocks will reduce the term EΞ1 1−σ
in the effective discount factor. This reduces the expected benefit from the continuation game,
and reduces the cost of cheating. As result, with flexible prices, productivity uncertainty raises
the mean tariff rate in a sustainable equilibrium.4

  Table 1 also illustrates the effect of differences in the discount factor between countries.
When the home country discount factor falls from 0.6 to 0.5, the mean sustainable tariff rate
   4
     Note that, in our current calibration, sustainable tariffs under fully flexible prices are equal to the maximum
Nash tariff rates. With a higher discount factor, sustainable tariff rates would be lower. In that case, it is easy to
see from (37) that a rise in the variance of productivity shocks will raise the level of sustainable tariffs.


                                                         20
rises substantially for the home country. The mean tariff rate rises as well for the foreign country,
although not as much as that of the home country, even though the foreign countries discount
factor is unchanged.

    Finally, country size plays an interesting role. Country size may be captured by variations
in ω and ω ∗ . In particular, allowing for a rise in both ω and ω ∗ , implies that the home country
produces a larger share of the world goods than the foreign country, and thus is the larger
country.5 Here we set ω = 0.725 and ω ∗ = 0.325. We find in this case that the mean tariff
rates falls for both countries, although the home country (the larger country) tariff rates remains
higher than that of the foreign country.


5        A dynamic model with sticky prices
5.1       Model set-up
We extend the previous model to relax some of the restrictive assumptions. In the dynamic
model, prices are set subject to Rotemberg adjustment costs, financial markets are incomplete
and the trade elasticity is allowed to differ from unity. In addition, we consider an alternative way
of conducting monetary policy assuming that Central Banks commit to Taylor-type rules, subject
to unexpected monetary policy shocks. Notations are deliberately kept as close as possible to the
tractable model. The economy is made of two countries, home and foreign. The home economy
produces good x and the foreign economy produces good m. The representative household of
the domestic economy maximizes a welfare index
                  (∞                               !)

    In Equation (52), β is the subjective discount factor, Ct is the level of consumption, made of
domestic goods in quantity Cxt and foreign goods in quantity Cmt , and Ht is the level of hours
worked. In Equation (53), Bt∗ is the holdings of one-period international bonds denominated
in the foreign currency, that pay a gross return Rt∗ between period t − 1 and period t, and
Bt the holdings of domestic bonds. Variables Pxt and Pmt respectively denote the prices of
the domestic and foreign goods, Pt (defined below) is the domestic CPI and St is the nominal
exchange rate. Imports are subject to tariffs at the rate τt where the proceeds
                                                                              R 1 are be rebated to
households through lump-sum transfers. The nominal wage is Wt , Πt = 0 Πt (i)di is the profit
paid by the monopolistic firms to the domestic households, and Tt is a lump-sum tax. Finally,

    Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) develop a model in which country size (population) has the same measure of a
country’s share of differentiated traded goods. We follow that interpretation here.

    Domestic and foreign goods are imperfectly substitutable with elasticity of substitution
µ > 0. In addition, households’ preferences are biased towards local goods, as ω ∈ [1/2, 1]
denotes the share of domestic goods in the consumption bundle of the domestic households.
Optimal good demands are derived maximizing Ct for a given total expenditure on goods

equilibrium where τt = τt∗ = τ H by a ‘N’ superscript, the variables under the equilibrium where
the home (foreign) tariff setter cheats by a ‘HC’ (‘FC’) superscript, and the equilibrium under
sustainable tariffs with a ‘S’ superscript, in which case τt = τ̃ t and τt∗ = τ̃ ∗t . The value functions

5.2    Model solution and calibration
The above dynamic model can be solved for a single equilibrium when tariffs are exogenous.
Alternatively, when tariffs are endogenous and on the sustainable path, the form of the value
functions shows that we need to solve the model under four equilibria: one for the (worst) Nash
equilibrium, one for the case in which the home tariff setter cheats, one for the case in which
the foreign tariff setter cheats and one for sustainable tariffs. In the first equilibrium, tariffs are
simply τt = τt∗ = τ H , in the second one, we have τt = τ˜t and τt∗ = τ H , in the third one, we have
τt = τ H and τt∗ = τ˜t∗ , and in the last one we have τt = τ˜t and τt∗ = τ˜t∗ , where τ˜t and τ˜t∗ are
respectively determined by (103) and (104).

    The model is solved under rational expectations up to a first-order approximation around
the steady state using Dynare.10 The calibration is as follows. The discount factor of households
is β = 0.99 while the discount factor of tariff setters is β g = β g∗ = 0.6 and the highest tariff
rate is τ H = 0.62. The consumption risk-aversion parameter is σ = 0.5, the inverse of the Frisch
elasticity of labor supply is ψ = 2, the home bias parameters are ω = 1 − ω ∗ = 0.5, the trade
elasticity is µ = 1 and the portfolio adjustment cost parameter is φ = 0.001. On the production
side, we assume η = η ∗ = 6, impose a subsidy that removes steady-state distortions induced by
monopolistic competition τy = 1/(1 − η) and τy∗ = 1/(1 − η ∗ ), and assume that the Rotemberg
parameter is ϕ = 80. Parameters of the Taylor rules are ρr = 0.7 and dπ = 1.5. The previous
Section looks at growth (permanent) shocks. To remain as close as possible to this situation, we
look at quasi-permanent shocks and impose ρθ = ρθ∗ = 0.9999. Finally, the standard deviations
of productivity and monetary policy shocks are σ (ξθ ) = σ (ξθ∗ ) = 0.02 and σ(ξr ) = σ(ξr∗ ) = 0.002.

5.3    Exogenous tariff shock
Consider the case where the economy is initially at zero tariffs in both countries. Consider that
the home tariff setter imposes a very persistent tariff on imports. Figure 2 reports the resulting
Impulse Response Functions (IRFs hereafter) under a flexible exchange rate regime.11

    Figure 2 shows that a home tariff shock appreciates the real exchange rate, which eventually
boosts domestic consumption through the wealth effect, that overturns the expenditure switching
effect. Home and foreign output and hours worked fall, but more so in the Home economy, since
home products are affected by the negative expenditure switching effect implied by the real
appreciation. Home consumption rises and hours worked fall together, which raises the utility of
home consumers, while the fall in foreign consumption – induced by the negative wealth effect
– and the relatively smaller fall in hours worked – since home and foreign consumers buy more
of the foreign good – trigger a drop in the utility of foreign consumers. Starting from a zero
tariff situation, the dynamic model fully preserves the incentive to impose tariffs under flexible
exchange rate regime, and the latter very clearly depend on the relative size of wealth and
substitution effects, as in the static model.

5.4    Sustainable tariffs dynamics
Let us now look at the dynamics of sustainable tariffs when those are endogenously determined
by the incentive constraints (103) and (104). Figure 3 below reports the dynamics of sustainable

    First, we want to know whether the intuition from the tractable model about sticky vs.
flexible prices applies to the dynamics set-up. In the tractable model, price flexibility, beyond
making the difference between exchange rate regime irrelevant, predicted that tariffs should be
constant under flexible prices (Result 2). Under sticky prices, the tractable model found (under
some conditions) that positive local productivity shocks led local tariffs to fall and that restrictive
local monetary policy shocks led local tariffs to rise (Result 3).

    Figure 3 (top row) shows that these results carry over to the dynamic model. Under flexible
prices, the impact response of the home tariff is and remains zero after restrictive local monetary
policy shock. It is and remains zero as well after a local positive productivity shock. Result 2
thus holds in our dynamic model for the calibration considered. In addition, under sticky prices,
the sustainable tariff set by the home tariff setter decreases on impact after a positive local
productivity shock, and falls (resp. rises) after a restrictive (resp. expansionary) local monetary
policy shock, as in the static model.

    In addition, we also want to know about the incentive to change tariffs under flexible vs.
fixed exchange rate regimes, as the static model had a sharp prediction about it (see Result
1). Our dynamic model first implies that the mean sustainable tariff with a flexible exchange

                                                                 28
rate is 0.4393 while the mean sustainable tariff with a fixed exchange rate is lower, at 0.4391. In
addition, Figure 3 (bottom rows) suggests that changes in sustainable tariffs with a fixed exchange
rate after productivity shocks are either similar, or smaller than with a flexible exchange rate,
and that these changes are much smaller after monetary policy shocks. In terms of volatility,
the standard deviation of sustainable tariffs is 0.1198 under flexible exchange rates while it is
only 0.0016 under fixed exchange rates. Sustainable tariffs are thus lower on average and less
volatile under fixed exchange rates according to the dynamic model, which comforts our Result
1, obtained in the static model.


6     Empirical evidence
In this Section, we take a look at the data to see whether our theoretical predictions can find some
empirical support. We first investigate the effects of the exchange rate regime on the incentive
to initiate trade disputes, which often result in applying retaliatory tariffs. We then focus on a
small sub-set of countries with flexible exchange rates and look at the empirical responses of trade
disputes/tariffs to positive supply shocks and restrictive monetary policy shocks. In both case,
we find empirical evidence in favor of the theoretical results described in the previous Sections.

6.1    Exchange rate regimes
We start our empirical investigation by looking at the impact of various variables on the incentive
to apply tariffs, with a special focus on the exchange rate regime. Intuitively, the exchange rate
regime should matter because exchange rate manipulation or currency wars, that are more likely
under flexible exchange rate regimes, can lead to retaliation through tariffs. Flexible exchange
rate regimes should therefore lead to stronger incentives to manipulate tariffs. Following Barat-
tieri, Cacciatore, and Ghironi (2018), our empirical analysis of this potential effect relies on Bown
(2016)’s Global Anti-Dumping database that collects anti-dumping or trade disputes initiatives
at the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO, that are usually followed by the imposition of
tariffs.

    For each country covered by the dataset, we count the number of trade disputes initiated each
year and relate this variable to a set of explanatory variables. Those include the level of GDP,
the GDP growth rate, net exports to GDP, a measure of trade openness, a measure of exchange
rate flexibility, and a trade-weighted measure of real exchange rate.12 We have no prior about the
effect of size (measured by the log of GDP) and openness (measured by the trade openness ratio)
on the occurrence of trade disputes. We expect GDP growth, net exports and competitiveness
(measured by the level of the trade-weighted real exchange rate) to reduce the probability of
trade disputes while exchange rate flexibility should raise the probability of trade disputes, since
the former makes currency manipulations easier both by the country and by partners, and thus
enhances the probability that trade restrictions are used as a tool in a potential currency war.
Table 2 below summarizes the characteristics of the different variables contained in our dataset.
    The dependent variable – the number of trade disputes initiated – is a count variable that is
non-negative and takes integer values. As such, it requires that a Poisson or a negative binomial

regression is used. Under the Poisson model, the dependent variable is distributed as a Poisson
describing the probability that a number of events realizes within a given time interval. One
limitation of the Poisson model however is that it does not account for potential over-dispersion
given that the Poisson distribution imposes a variance of the dependent variable that is equal to
the mean, a condition that is likely not to be met in our sample. The negative binomial model
is a generalization of the Poisson model that loosens this restrictive assumption by specifying a
Poisson-gamma mixture distribution, according to which overdispersion can be estimated. We
include a constant, abstract from any country fixed-effect, pool our panel data and report the
results of the Poisson and negative binomial regression in Table 3 below.

    Table 3 shows that positive GDP growth and net exports lower the probability of trade
disputes. Depending on the specification, net exports or GDP growth are statistically non-

                                                30
significant. In both cases the signs make sense: countries with a growing economy and posi-
tive trade balance are less likely to initiate trade disputes. The log of GDP affects positively
the probability of trade disputes under both specifications: larger countries initiate more trade
disputes all else equal, potentially making strategic use of their home market size. Openness
significantly lowers the probability of trade disputes, which can also be rationalized by the fact
that more open economies have more to lose to deter international trade flows. Exchange rate
flexibility is statistically non-significant in the Poisson model but has the same positive sign than
in the negative binomial model, where it is statistically significant: all else equal, countries with
a more flexible exchange rate are more likely to initiate trade disputes. Finally, competitiveness
affects trade disputes in the way it is expected to: countries with a relatively depreciated trade-
weighted real exchange rate are less likely to initiate trade disputes. Overall, we conclude that
most macroeconomic variables inspected in this empirical work affect trade disputes in a signifi-
cant and sensible way, and that our main variable of interest, exchange rate flexibility raises the
probability of trade disputes.

6.2   Business cycle frequency evidence
We now investigate the effects of macroeconomic shocks on trade disputes/tariffs. In particular,
we would like to uncover the response of tariffs, approximated by our trade dispute variable, to
standard supply and monetary policy shocks. To do so, we estimate country-specific VAR models
using quarterly data, and identify structural shocks using sign restrictions (see Uhlig (2005)).

    Our previous analysis suggests that countries with flexible exchange rates are more likely to
initiate trade disputes, and hence to apply tariffs. We thus focus on a subset of countries with
flexible exchange rates for which we have a data sample that is long enough: Australia, Canada,
and the USA. Each VAR is estimated with the following specification:
                               Xt = α1 + α2 × t + α3 (L) Xt + α4 ξt                            (105)
where Xt = [log(1 + T Dt ) log (Yt ) 100 × πt 100 × it ]0 , T Dt being the number of trade disputes,
log (Yt ) the log of GDP, 100 × πt and 100 × it respectively being the core inflation rate and the
nominal interest rate, in percents. The datasets are quarterly. In the above specification, α1 is
a vector of constants, α2 is a vector of coefficients attached to the linear trend, and α3 a matrix
of lagged coefficients where L is the lag operator. Lag selection is achieved using the Akaike
information criterion and yields 3 lags for Australia, 2 lags for Canada and 3 lags for the USA.
Finally, α4 is a variance-covariance matrix and ξt is vector of normally distributed innovations.

    As usual, ξt contains the reduced-form innovations and those are not structural. The struc-
tural shocks are identified using the sign restriction method proposed by Uhlig (2005). Let ut
denote the set of structural shocks and define ξt = B −1 ut as the relation between reduced-form
residuals and structural shocks. The identification method imposes restrictions on matrix B
using commonly used assumptions about the sign of the implied responses of variables for some
periods after the shock. Technically, this is done by drawing random orthonormal candidate
B matrices, compute the associated IRFs and keep candidates that satisfy the imposed scheme
of sign restrictions on the response of variables. If the restrictions are satisfied, IRFs and the
associated B matrix are kept as a valid draw for the computation of median IRFs and confidence
bands. We use the set of restrictions summarized in Table 4 below.
    We impose that a trade dispute shock raises the number of trade disputes, and leave other
the response of other variables unrestricted. A positive supply shock is assumed to raise GDP,

lower inflation and the nominal interest rate. The response of trade disputes to a supply shock is
left unrestricted. A demand shock raises GDP, inflation and the nominal interest rate, while the
response of trade disputes is, once again, left unrestricted. Finally, we assume that a (restrictive)
monetary policy shock raises the nominal interest rate, lowers the inflation rate as well as the
level of GDP, and we leave the response of trade disputes unrestricted. Our main interest is the
response of trade disputes to other structural shocks, with a special focus on monetary policy
and supply shocks.

    We draw enough candidate matrices until 100 matrices satisfy the imposed restrictions, which implies drawing
thousands or tens of thousands of candidate matrices.

    First, Figure 4 shows that a trade dispute shock is self-correcting in several countries, i.e. that
that a rise in the number of trade disputes is followed by a subsequent statistically significant
fall in trade disputes. Second, although we do not restrict the response of GDP to a trade
dispute shock, we find that a rise in trade disputes lowers GDP quite substantially for at least
4 to 5 quarters. For the U.S., the effects on the level of GDP even more persistent. For all
three countries, we also find that a trade dispute shock is inflationary, as core inflation increases
significantly. This is consistent with the views that trade disputes or trade restrictions act as
negative supply shocks, in line with the findings of Barattieri, Cacciatore, and Ghironi (2018).
While interesting, these results are not our main focus though. Our chief interest is indeed in
the response of trade disputes/tariffs to supply and monetary policy shocks. As such, Figure 5
reports the IRFs to a supply shock for the three countries.

     Under our identifying assumptions, Figure 5 shows that a positive supply shock generates a
fall in trade disputes on impact. The latter is statistically significant for Australia and Canada
but not for the U.S. This pattern is consistent the empirical exercise of the previous section:
a positive supply shock raises GDP growth and competitiveness, which makes the use of trade
disputes/tariffs less appealing from a policy perspective, perhaps by raising the output costs of
a tariff/trade war. Finally, Figure 6 reports the IRFs to a (restrictive) monetary policy shock
for the different countries.

    Figure 6 shows that the response of trade disputes to a tightening of monetary policy is
significantly negative. This result is consistent with our theoretical findings, showing that a

restrictive monetary policy shock lowers the current gains from raising tariffs while leaving the
future costs of deviating from the sustainable path of tariffs basically unaffected.

  Are those results robust to alternative identification schemes? To answer this question,
Appendix C performs three different exercises.

    In the first one, for the same three countries, bi-variate VARs are estimated using quarterly
data on the growth rate of labor productivity and the total number of hours worked. Following
Debortoli, Galı̀, and Gambetti (2018), supply shocks are identified using long-run restrictions.
Supply shocks are assumed to be the only shocks that affect the level of labor productivity
permanently. The identified shocks are then used to estimate a bi-variate VAR with trade
disputes, assuming that supply shocks do not affect trade disputes permanently. Appendix C
shows that supply shocks tend to lower trade disputes for all countries on impact, although the
response of trade disputes is significant only for the U.S.

    In the second one, monetary policy shocks are identified using a Cholesky decomposition
where the nominal interest rate is ranked last, i.e. assuming that monetary policy shocks do not
have contemporary effects on other variables. The VAR specification includes the trade dispute
variable, the log of GDP, an index of oil prices, the core inflation rate and the nominal interest
rate. Appendix C shows that restrictive monetary policy shocks identified using a Cholesky
decomposition also produce a significant drop in trade disputes, as in the baseline case where
monetary policy shocks are identified using sign restrictions.


                                                                       34
    In the third one, we perform SVAR estimations for the same three countries using sign
restrictions but using tariffs instead of trade disputes, and including the real exchange rate
as an additional variable. Appendix C shows that for these countries, tariffs tend to respond
negatively to positive supply shocks (except for Canada), and negatively to restrictive monetary
policy shocks (except for Australia). Overall, we conclude that our results are relatively robust
to alternative identification schemes/specifications.


7    Conclusion
We discussed the joint determination of trade policies and exchange rates in a stylized open-
economy model with sticky prices, productivity and money growth shocks. Despite its relative
simplicity, the model is able to deliver a surprisingly large number of results that are consistent
with empirical evidence. We found that policy-makers faced higher incentive to set tariffs in
flexible exchange rate economies than in fixed exchange rate economies. We also found that
tariffs resulting from a dynamic game were constant with flexible prices, and time-varying with
sticky prices. Whether they fell or rose was shown to depend on whether the shock was to money
growth or productivity, and on whether the intertemporal elasticity of substitution was above or
below unity, reflecting the relative importance of income versus substitution effects of exchange
rates on aggregate consumption.

    Future research on the subject might involve considering the effects of alternative financial
market structures on the incentive to apply tariffs. One could also be interested in looking at
different pricing schemes for exports, considering local currency or dominant currency pricing for
instance.

B     Data description
B.1     Exchange rate regimes
We test the effects of various variables on trade disputes. The explained variable is the total
number of trade disputes observed for country i at time t. The dataset is annual and covers
the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, Costa
Rica, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New
Zealand, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, Taiwan, the USA, Venezuela
and South Africa. The longest time range is 1977-2015 and most countries have more limited
time ranges. The potential explanatory variables are:

    • The log of GDP (PennWorld Tables 9.0)

    • The annual rate of GDP growth (PennWorld Tables 9.0)
    • The depreciation rate of nominal exchange rate (vs the US dollar). Positive = depreciation,
      negative = appreciation. (PennWorld Tables 9.0)
    • Net exports to GDP (PennWorld Tables 9.0)
    • The openness ratio: exports plus imports divided by GDP (PennWorld Tables 9.0)
    • The exchange rate regime according to the Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2017) classifica-
      tion (http://www.carmenreinhart.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/11/)
    • The trade-weighted measure of the real exchange rate take from the EQCHANGE CEPII
      Database (http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/fr/bdd modele/presentation.asp?id=34). Weights
      are time-varying (averaged over the last 5 years). This variable is an index (100 in 2010)
      and expressed with opposite signs as usual in the litt. We thus take log(100/x) where x is
      the variable expressed in the database to get a measure of depreciation in the usual sense
      (positive = depreciation, negative = appreciation).

B.2    Trade disputes at the business cycle frequency
In this subsection, we focus on a narrower set of countries: Australia, Canada, and the U.S. Each
VAR contains the log of one plus the number of trade disputes, the log of GDP, the annualized
rate of core inflation and the nominal interest rate. The time series for these last three variables
are taken from the OECD Economic Outlook dataset for a time range that corresponds to the
time range of available data for trade disputes:
    • Australia: 1989-2015
    • Canada: 1985-2015
    • USA: 1979-2015


C     Robustness checks for the VAR analysis
C.1    Supply shocks
An alternative way of identifying supply shocks is the one proposed by Debortoli, Galı̀, and
Gambetti (2018). According to this approach, a bi-variate VAR is estimated using the log-
difference (growth rate) of labor productivity and the total number of hours worked. For the
three countries, we use OECD data for the log level of GDP (yt ), for the average number of hours
worked annually (ht ) and total employment (et ) to build a measure of the total number of hours
worked (nt = log(ht × et )) and the associated growth rate of labor productivity (∆(yt − nt )).
The time range remains unchanged for the three countries. The vector of variables included
in the VAR is thus Xt = [∆(yt − nt ) nt ]0 , the VAR includes a constant and a trend, and lag
selection proceeds through Akaike information criterion. The structural shocks are identified
using long-run restrictions à la Blanchard and Quah: demand shocks are assumed to be those
that do have permanent effects on the level of labor productivity. By contrast, the other shock is
a supply shock. Once the supply shocks have been identified for the three countries, we estimate
a bi-variate VAR with Xt = [T Dt supplyt ]0 , and report the effects of an innovation to the supply
shock in Figure 9 below.

C.2    Monetary policy shocks
We also investigate the robustness of our results to an alternative identification scheme for
monetary policy shocks. The usual alternative to sign restriction is the Cholesky decomposition
of the B matrix where the nominal interest rate is ranked last. The assumption then amounts
to impose that monetary policy shocks do not have any contemporaneous effects on all the
variables included in the VAR. We consider the following variables and ranking: the log of one
plus trade disputes, the log of GDP, an oil price index, core inflation and the nominal interest
rate. GDP, core inflation and the nominal interest rate are taken from the OECD Economic
Outlook database. The oil price index is computed from the Spot Crude Oil Price (WTI), taken
from the FRED database. The specification includes a constant and a trend, and lag selection
proceeds through Akaike information criterion. Figure 10 below reports the effects of a monetary
policy shock identified through short-run restrictions in the three countries.

C.3    Alternative specification
One might wonder what are the results of considering tariffs instead of trade disputes in our
VAR analysis. In addition, one might also wonder what happens if the real exchange rate is
introduced. We perform both exercises in this subsection. Instead of trade disputes, we consider
the average tariff rate. We use data from the World Bank Development Indicators, that reports
the weighted-average tariff rate applied by several countries from 1988 to 2015. One important
potential caveat is that the dataset for average tariffs is annual, which explains why we do not
use this specification as our benchmark. We convert annual time series into quarterly times series

                                                                            41
using a spline interpolation method, and include this variable along with the log of quarterly
GDP, the quarterly core inflation rate and the quarterly series for the nominal interest rate. We
also include the real exchange rate at a quarterly frequency using the competitiveness indicator
reported by the OECD Economic Outlook database. The latter is computed based on trade-
weighted relative CPIs, and has to be inverted to be made consistent with the model, i.e. so
that it goes up in case of a real depreciation. We consider two-lags, include a constant and a
linear trend, and the identification scheme remains broadly the same. In particular, the response
