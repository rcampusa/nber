                                          ABSTRACT

Previous research found that the initiation of Hospital Compare (HC) quality reporting had little
impact on patient outcomes. However little is known about its impact on hospital prices, which
may be significant since insurers are positioned to respond to quality information when engaging
hospitals in price negotiations. To explore this issue we estimate variants of difference-in-
difference models allowing HC impacts to vary by levels of quality scores. We separately
examine the effects of the three main scores (heart attack, heart failure, and combined mortalities)
on transaction prices of two related cardiac procedures: bypass surgery and angioplasty. States
which had mandated reporting systems preceding HC form the control group. Analyzing claims
data of privately insured patients, we find that HC exerted downward pressure on prices, which
we attribute to competitive pressures. However, hospitals ranked “above average” captured
higher prices, thereby offsetting the overall policy effect. We conclude that HC was effective at
constraining prices without penalizing high performers.

    I.        Introduction

Consumer information in the form of hospital rating systems known as ‘reports cards’ have been

in existence in various forms as early as the 1990s. However, such report cards were made

available in a small number of states that generated them independently from each other, while

employing a mix of measures and ranking methodologies. In 2005, the Centers for Medicare

and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched a uniform on-line national rating system, known as

Hospital Compare (HC), aimed at informing consumers and promoting competition among

hospitals. Initially, HC consisted of a set of process measures of hospital performance based on

general practices. 1 In 2008, these were augmented with outcome-based measures, namely

mortality-based hospital rankings which were deemed to be more easily understood by patients,

and more effective at motivating hospitals to engage in quality improvement practices (Harris,

2007).

         In practice, opinion surveys have shown that consumers were generally unaware or

uninterested in these rankings, even as they had become more accessible, and there is little

evidence in the empirical literature to suggest that hospital report cards had an impact on

consumer choices of hospitals. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that hospital

administrators and executives were ostensibly responsive to these rankings, there is similarly

little evidence that HC and other report cards have had a significant impact on patient outcomes.

We briefly review the literature in the next section.

       A less explored channel through which public reporting might impact health care

markets, and ultimately patients, is hospital pricing. In the private segment of the health care

market, private insurers rather than individual patients face the main part of the price. As group

purchasers, large insurance firms and managed care organizations who engage in price

negotiations with hospitals are more likely to incorporate information from public reporting in

their decision-making (Dor, Encinosa, Carey, 2015; Reinhardt, 2006, 2009). However, there is a

paucity of evidence on the impact of HC on hospital pricing. An earlier study suggested the

initiation of HC reporting contributed to a slowing in the rate of price increases of related

hospital procedures (Dor et al., 2015), but it did not address the issue of the responsiveness of

prices to rating differences as flagged by Hospital Compare. Yet in a well-functioning market, a

hospital’s ability to deliver better health outcomes should lead to greater demand and bargaining

power for the hospital, and hence be rewarded by higher prices (Brooks et al., 1997). In this

paper, we fill the gap by examining the relationship between publicly reported hospital ratings

and inpatient prices, allowing for hospital differentiation by relative rankings. Specifically, we

conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of the HC measures, as implemented in 2008,

on actual prices negotiated and transacted between private insurers and U.S. hospitals. These

measures are the HC categorical rankings based on hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates for the

three medical conditions made available on-line as of 2008, which included heart attack, heart

failure, and pneumonia. We focus on prices of major cardiac procedures related to heart attacks

and heart failure. Results suggest that HC exerts downward pressure on prices, but that this

effect is offset for hospitals ranked in the highest quality category.

       We note that in public discourse there is considerable confusion between hospital billing

data, such as those CMS began to release in 2013, and actual payments made to hospitals,



                                                  4
namely transaction prices (Meier et al., 2013). Using a claims database for large private insurers

we focus our analysis on transaction prices. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II

provides background on hospital report cards and hospital pricing. Section III lays out the

analytical framework, including data and sample, estimation strategy, and variable specification.

Section IV presents descriptive results for the comparisons of the pre and post Hospital Compare

initiation year in control versus treatment states, and the program effects of the intervention.

Section V discusses implications. The full regression models are provided in Appendix A.



   II.     Background

Public Reporting of Hospital Performance

Information about hospital quality performance began appearing in the public domain in the

1990s. An early review of the gains from public disclosure of performance data found that

consumers showed little interest in or use of the available information due to various reasons

including difficulty in understanding, failure to trust in, and lack of timely access to the data

(Marshall et al., 2000). Anecdotal surveys of hospital administrators and executives are more

positive, with most reporting increased investment in quality improvement in response to the

newly created report cards (Laschober et al., 2006). More recent study of public reporting

suggests that information included in hospital report cards may be disconnected from consumer

decision-making because of weakness in content, design, and accessibility even as information

became more widely disseminated (Sinaiko et al., 2012). Such policy discourse even prompted

the California Hospital Association to review and withdraw support for state report cards due to

perceived lack of value to users (Teleki and Shannon, 2012).




                                                  5
         In some respects, the empirical literature tends to lend support to the view that hospital

report cards have limited effect on patient choices and medical outcomes. For instance, Dranove

and Sfekas (2008) found that the hospital report cards in New York State had little impact on

choices of hospitals by consumers and on hospital market share and Wang et al. (2011) found no

significant effects of mortality-based scores in Pennsylvania report cards on hospital volume.

Turning to outcomes, Ryan et al. (2012) found that the requirement for hospitals to report

process of care measures under the earlier wave of Hospital Compare did not lead to reductions

in 30-day mortality rates for heart attack and pneumonia, and had only minimal impact on heart

failure mortality. Moreover, choosing reportedly high performing hospitals in New York State

did not decrease a patient’s chance of dying following coronary intervention (Chen et al., 2012).

More recently, Dor, Encinosa, and Carey (2015) began to explore a different channel through

which report cards might affect providers and patients, namely by mitigating hospital prices.

They found that the introduction of excess mortality measures in Hospital Compare slowed the

rate of increase in prices of related cardiac procedures overall. They speculated that the mere

injection of quality information, albeit imperfect, into the healthcare market weakens the

competitive position of hospitals in hospital-insurer negotiations. 2 However, they did not

differentiate between hospitals by their relative rankings, and thus were unable to establish

whether better ranked hospitals were able to capture a “rating premium” or if they were

penalized by pricing pressures to the same extent as lower-ranked hospitals.

         Studies of Cardiac Procedure Pricing




2
  Silber et al [2010] demonstrate that hospital mortality scores are sensitive to model specification. For instance they
show that adding volume and hospital staffing to bed ratios that are omitted in the Hospital Compare methodology
improved predictability. Note however that from the perspective of evaluating Hospital Compare we are interest in
the impact of publically available report cards rather than constructs available to researchers only.

                                                           6
Previous studies examined pricing of cardiac services including coronary artery bypass surgery and

angioplasty. Dor, Grossman, and Koroukian (2004) used a bargaining model to derive price

models that reflect the dynamics of the hospital-insurer interaction. Results indicated that health

maintenance organizations (HMOs) are able to capture larger price discounts from hospitals than

more open forms of managed care such as point-of-service (POS) plans and preferred provider

organizations (PPOs), a result the authors attributed to the HMO’s ability to exercise greater

bargaining power due to large-volume purchasing. In a related paper, Dor, Koroukian and

Grossman (2004) explored the impact of standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for coronary artery

bypass surgery and for angioplasty on their corresponding prices. As expected, adverse quality had

a negative impact on prices; however, this result was not statistically significant. While these

scores reflected the type of report card information available in certain states during the period

studied (1994-1996), and potentially to some private insurers, they were not widely disseminated;

this contrasts with the risk-standardized SMRs (RSMR) that were used in subsequent years to

construct the categorical quality ratings reported in Hospital Compare. Broader dissemination of

the information in recent years may yield more significant effects of adverse quality on prices than

found in the earlier period.



    III.    Analytical Framework

    Data and Study Population

The main patient and price data consist of the Truven Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims

and Encounters database (CCE). This database assembles complete insurance claims for

approximately 100 medium-size and large employers previously used in nationally

representative population-based studies (Zhou et al., 2005; Hansen and Chang, 2011). The



                                                  7
advantage of using the CCE database is that it reports actual transaction prices paid by patients

and insurers. Prices are adjusted for local differences by the wage index from the CMS Cost

Reports, then inflation adjusted to 2010 dollars. Hospital Compare (HC) ratings come from the

CMS Hospital Compare database. In the CMS methodology, they are derived from post

discharge risk-standardized 30-day mortality, but are displayed as a categorical score that take

one of three values (“Better than,” “No Different than,” and “Worse than” the U.S. national rate).

Other hospital characteristics were obtained from the American Hospital Association Annual

Surveys. The full census of inpatients from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was used

to create market concentration ratios for hospitalized patients undergoing cardiac procedures.

Finally, the Managed Market Surveyor File from InterStudy provided the market area HMO

penetration rates.

       We extracted claims for hospitalizations for non-elderly employees and dependents

undergoing coronary revascularization, comprising coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and

percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), formerly referred to as PTCA (angioplasty). In

addition to being associated with cardiac conditions featured in HC, CABG and PCI are among

the most common major medical procedures in the U.S. healthcare system, with over 1 million

procedures performed annually (DeFrances et al., 2008). They also are among the most costly,

accounting together for over $3.5 billion in 2007 (CMS, 2010), an amount larger than for any

other medical or surgical procedure except for hip and knee replacement (Epstein et al., 2011).

CABG and PCI occur relatively frequently compared with other cardiac procedures, and tend to

be well defined in claims data for purposes of price estimation.

       Our database observes a large proportion of all CABGs and PCI procedures covered by

private insurers in 1,288 and 706 hospitals respectively. We merged the above data files for the



                                                 8
years 2005-2010. This allowed us to conduct analysis on impacts of the quality measures after

their introduction in 2008, as well as a comparison before and after the 2005-2007 phase-in

period. After excluding small hospitals with less than 10 procedures and patients who

underwent non-cardiac procedures in the same hospitalizations, our sample consisted of 53,765

observations on CABG patients and 24,441 observations on PCI patients. The distribution of

patients undergoing CABG and PCI according to quality rankings are displayed in Table 1.

       Seven states had reporting systems for hospital quality metrics based on mortality rates

following revascularization procedures: California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New

York, Pennsylvania, and Washington. We included only six states in this group because

hospitals in the state of Washington participated in the reporting system on a voluntary basis. We

characterize all other states as the intent-to-treat group, since none had report cards of their own

prior to the initiation of the federal Hospital Compare. Appendix Table A.1 displays the years in

which reporting systems were in effect in each of the control states.

       Estimation Strategy

We initially define a simple difference-in-differences (DD) estimator for the treatment effect of

Hospital Compare (HC) from the perspective of states without state reporting systems (intent-to-

treat states). The change in hospital price due to the initiation of Hospital Compare in all states

can be described as

                ΔPHC = [E(PNR| post HC treatment) − E(PNR| pre HC treatment)] –

                          [E(PR| post HC treatment) − E(PR| pre HC treatment)]

Where NR is an indicator for intent-to-treat states having no state report card systems prior to HC

initiation. At the individual admission level we have


          Pihjt = a0 + a1HCt-1 + a2NRijt + a3HCt-1*NRijt                                (1)


                                                  9
P is price for the individual hospital admission, where i indexes the patient admission, h indexes

the hospital, j indexes state, and t indexes year, HC is an indicator for the post implementation

period. The effect of HC on the intent-to-treat group of states is given by a3. 3


           Adjusting for characteristics of the admission in question we obtain the estimating

equation


                 Pihjt = a0 + a1HCt-1 + a2NRijt + a3HCt-1*NRijt + a4Zijt + fh + ft + eihjt           (2)


Where in addition to the variables previously defined, Z is a vector of medical characteristics of

the admission and insurance type (as described in Appendix Table A.3), fh and ft are binary

indicators for hospital and year fixed effects, and eihjt is a random error term. HC enters the

model with a one year lag because prices in insurance contracts are fixed in a given year t and

can adjust only at the next annual update. Note that while a3 in equation (1) and (2) can be taken

as the treatment effect on price levels, it does not account for differences in reported quality

(mortality) scores as flagged in Hospital Compare.


           Next, we expand equation (2) to allow the impact of the policy to vary by the intensity of

the treatment. More specifically, we will allow the effect of HC to depend on the reported

hospital mortality score, Qh. Noting that Qh applies to the intent-to-treat states after, but not prior

to the initiation of HC, we obtain the following estimating equation:


              Pihjt = a0 + a1HCt-1 + a2NRijt + a3HCt-1*NRijt + a4HCt-1*Qh,t-1                  (3)

                                            + a5HCt-1*NRijt*Qh,t-1+ a6Zijt + fh + ft + eihjt


3
    This is the familiar case whereby ∆ = [(a1 + a2 + a3) - a2] - [a1 - 0] = a3.




                                                             10
Here the second level interactions control for post-HC trend in the intent-to-treat group

independently from the mortality scores (a3), and for the national trend in the HC mortality

scores (a4). The third level interaction gives the incremental program effect (a5), namely the

effect of the HC mortality scores (lagged a year) on prices after the initiation of HC, in intent-to-

treat states. The lag in Q accounts for last year’s published quality scores in the current year’s

hospital-insure contract. This estimation strategy is similar to using a continuous variable to

define varying policy impacts within the distribution of observations in the treatment group, as

found in Finkelstein (2007) 4, and Chou et al., 2014. Although model 3 appears notationally

analogous to the familiar difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD), here the main program

effect is given by the same bi-level interaction term as in the basic DD model, rather than the

triple interaction term.


                  To see how the full policy effect is derived, we note the expected value analogue

of equation (3):


               ΔPHC(Q) = [E(PNR(QNR)| post HC treatment) − E(PNR| pre HC treatment)] –

                           [E(PR(QR)| post HC treatment) − E(PR(QR)| pre HC treatment)]

Substituting in the parameters of (3) we have

    ∆PHC(Q) = [(a1 + a2 + a3 + a4*E(Q|NR=1) + a5 E(Q|NR=1)) - a2] - [(a1+ a4*E(Q|NR=0)) - 0] =

                         a3 + a4*(E(Q|NR=1) - E(Q|NR=0)) +a5 E(Q|NR=1)                                     (4)

Henceforth we refer to eq. (4) as the full DD model and (2) as the naïve DD model. Note that a3

from equations (3) and (4) are equal if either a4=0 or [E(Q|NR=1)-E(Q|NR=0)] =0, and if a5=0.

4
  Finkelstein employed a continuous variable such as the local area senior population share, interacted with a post-
treatment dummy to analyze interrupted trends due to the introduction of Medicare. Chou et al use density of
obstetrics hospitals as the impact variable in a DD analysis of expansions in maternity benefits in Taiwan.


                                                         11
Thus the implicit premium paid to hospitals for being highly ranked is decomposed into two

effects, a direct effect due to scoring levels in the treated states (a5) and a relative effect when the

group is compared with controls. 5


         Note that differencing requires Pihjt to be specified linearly. We estimate the linear

models with hospital fixed effects using the generalized method of moments (GMM). This

method provides heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, and is more efficient than robust OLS

(Hansen, 2016). Additionally GMM has been shown to be appropriate in panel data estimation

when the number of states and individual observations is large, while the number of periods is

small, (Hausman and Kuersteiner, 2008). These conditions are met in our data. 6 We ran four

models on the CABG and on the PCI samples, including the naive DD model and three full DD

models corresponding to the flagged quality scores for heart attacks, heart failure, and for the

combined scores. The baseline DD estimates are reported in Appendix Table A.3 and the full

DD models are reported in Appendix Table A.4.


         There are several reasons to assume that the HC scores are orthogonal to the error term in

equations 1 through 4. First, the scores are hospital level variables, whereas prices are measured

at the patient level. Second, the HC scores are calculated from a complex transformation of

underlying mortality.7 Third, although the published HC scores are the reference measure in

5
  Empirically the term in the middle disappears, both because a4 is non-significant and because the Q’s for
intervention and control states are similarly distributed. In practice we estimate the policy effect as a3 +
a5E(Q|NR=1). See Table 4.
6
  Hausman and Kuersteiner (2008) define a ‘’large’’ number of states at 50. Our data contain 49 states plus
the District of Columbia, and a large sample of individuals, i.e N= 53,765 and N= 24,441 in the CABG and
PCI samples.
7
   The Hospital Compare categories are drawn from a highly transformed excess mortality variable. To summarize,
prior to being grouped into categories, the underlying mortality scores were generated from the risk-standardized
mortality ratio (RSMR) defined as the ratio of predicted to expected mortality rates in the hospital. The
denominator adjusts for patient characteristics x only; in the numerator the predictive mortality model incorporates a

                                                         12
public reporting, they are based on the census of Medicare beneficiaries, while pricing is

observed for the privately insured. 8         To be sure we also conducted tests for endogeneity using a

predictive model for the underlying scores (observable to researchers). As expected we found

strong evidence for rejecting endogeneity. 9


         The results from the familiar “naïve” models are used simply as a basis for comparison.

These models simply examine whether changes in the states that had report cards of their own

similar to Hospital Compare prior to 2008 exhibited less price sensitivity to HC rankings

compared with the intent-to-treat states, independently of any tradeoff between price and rating.

Finally, we also create a counterfactual to the full model, to test for the validity of the various

quasi-experiment designs above. The counterfactual is based on rerunning the models using non-

cardiac procedures that should be weakly susceptible to the information from Hospital Compare

with respect to pricing. Following Ryan, Nallamothu, and Dimick (2012) and Carey (2015), who

employ gastrointestinal diagnoses as the counterfactual for AMI when evaluating the mortality

consequences of HC initiation, we first employ surgeries for gastrointestinal cancers as the

random hospital-specific effect (α) that accounts for within-hospital correlations of the observed patient outcomes.
Accordingly, the excess mortality score is redefined as the ratio of predicted to expected mortality rate, with a
random effects term set equal to zero:
                𝐸(𝑦ℎ |𝑥ℎ ;𝛽,𝛼ℎ )
  � 𝑅ℎ =
𝑅𝑆𝑀           𝐸(𝑦ℎ |𝑥ℎ ;𝛽,𝛼ℎ =0)

Additionally, the underlying scores were constructed as 3-year moving averages with data drawn from Medicare
claims and administrative data. Note that Silber et al showed that hospital mortality scores are sensitive to model
specification. However, our interest is in the scoring as publically announced.
8
 For Medicare patients price variation is minimal, since Medicare prices for all inpatient services are administered
and essentially set constant for general medical service and diagnosis categories, under the Inpatient Prospective
Payment System.
9
 To test for such endogeneity, we performed the Durbin–Wu–Hausman test on the continuous mortality scores for
pneumonia, heart attack, and heart failure. The tests consist of saving the residuals from the first stage predictive
models as covariates in the pricing models. Hospital staffing variables such as nurses per bed, other full time
employees per bed, and log of beds as instrumental variables in the first stage estimates of mortality, we find that for
all three mortality outcomes in both CABG and PCI samples, the residuals from the first stage mortality regressions
were never statistically significant (p>0.10) in the second stage price regressions. Thus, we find no evidence of the
mortality scores being endogenous in our price regressions.

                                                          13
comparison to CABG and PCI. A primary example is surgery for colorectal cancer

(colectomy). ICD-9 and CPT codes needed to define colectomy related admissions are found in

a previous related study (Dor et al., 2012). Secondly, we examine the prices of gastrointestinal

hemorrhage cases, since this was one of the few principal diagnoses used in the AHRQ mortality

indicators but not adopted in Hospital Compare (but, later adopted by CMS in the HAC

Reduction Program; See AHRQ, 2015).10 We present the GMM estimates for colectomy and

gastrointestinal hemorrhage in Table 3. As expected, the HC public reporting does not impact

prices for these procedures.


        An additional sensitivity analysis that allows for balancing samples in the control and

intervention state using propensity scores matching is provided in Appendix B. We find that the

results from the matched samples are similar to the results from the full sample analysis. Given

the matching estimates are less efficient, we focus on the latter.


        Variable Specification

In its on-line rankings Hospital Compare reports separate mortality-based quality scores for heart

attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia, using the general categories labeled as above average, at

the national average, and below average in each. These rankings are based on 95 percent

confidence intervals for the deviation of actual relative to expected mortality rates, using risk

adjustment models described in Krumholz et al, 2006a, and 2006b. As a consequence few

hospitals were actually ranked below average, while the vast majority of hospitals were classified

as average (Table 1; also see Silber et al., 2010). To capture the incremental effect of higher


10
  Beginning in 2015, the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program, mandated by the Affordable
Care Act, requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) to reduce hospital payments by 1 percent for
hospitals that rank among the lowest-performing 25 percent with regard to HACs.

quality in the pricing models we created binary indicators for the grouping of hospitals ranked

above average versus the grouping of all other hospitals, ranked average or less. We estimated

the impact of this variable separately for each of the two Hospital Compare conditions that

pertain to cardiac (heart attacks, chronic heart failure), and for a “combined” indicator which was

flagged if the hospital received above average rankings in all of the HC condition-specific

measures (heart attacks, chronic heart failure, pneumonia) during the year. We further estimated

separate models for CABG and PCI patients (summarized in Table 3).11 All models controlled

for patient demographics, clinical case complexity, HMO penetration rate, and hospital market

concentration (see Appendix Tables A.2-A.3 for the full specification).



    IV.       Results

Tables 1 and 2 show the distribution of the raw prices and the Hospital Compare quality levels in

our data. Table 1 shows that prices for hospitals in the average and below average categories

were nearly equal, especially in the case of PCI, while price corresponding with the above

average category were substantially higher. Thus, prices generally increased as the HC quality

score improved. Table 2 adds the dimension of the comparison between the intent-to-treat states

(states with no cardiac report cards prior to HC) and the control group (states with reports prior

HC reporting). We observe that, overall, the treatment states experienced smaller increases in

CABG and PCI prices around the initiation of HC than the control states. This suggests that

simply introducing public reporting had a pro-competitive effect, exerting downward pressure on


11
   In trial regressions we also ran specifications where the below average categories entered the equation separately
and results were essentially the same with respect to quality. For example, in a model based on the combined score
of all HC conditions which included binary indicators for both the above average and below average categories, the
premium for above average in CABG ($5,408 in Table 3) becomes $5,278 (p=0.099); there appears to be a below
average “penalty”, but it is not statistically significant (-$5,468, p=.39). Similarly, in the equivalent model for PCI,
the premium for above average is $965 (p=0.145) and the below average “penalty” is -$1,338 (p=.39).

                                                           15
hospital prices overall. However within the treated group price increases after the

implementation of Hospital Compare were substantially higher for hospitals in the above-

average category, suggesting that higher rankings would have been rewarded in the marketplace.

While these results are unadjusted and descriptive, they provide additional motivation for our

hypotheses about the impact of Hospital Compare. We proceed with full analysis below.

       Table 3 summarizes the main GMM estimates for the policy variables for CABG and

PCI. The bi-level interaction terms for HC and no-report state represents the main program

effect in all models. The related coefficients were highly significant in all models, with price

reductions ranging from 8,054 to 9,854 for CABG, and 1,364 to 1,756 for PCI. The incremental

effect of the high quality ranking is captured by the triple interaction terms in the full DD

models; all of the related coefficients were positive. The variation in these coefficients was

substantial, with statistical significance found in the models which included the heart failure

mortality or the combined scores, while the corresponding coefficients in the heart attack models

were not significant. Taken together we interpret these results as indicating that high quality

hospitals were not penalized by the initiation of Hospital Compare and may have benefited from

a quality premium. We also note the coefficient of the binary Hospital Compare indicator was a

highly significant and consistent across all models, reflecting the general increase in CABG and

PCI prices between the pre HC and post HC period. Holding the program effects constant, there

were no significant differences between no-report states and control states, as would be expected

for valid controls.

       The bottom panel of Table 3 summarizes coefficients of the counterfactual cases, namely

colectomy procedures and Gastrointestinal (GI) treatments. We would not expect to find a strong

effect of the cardiac-related HC measure on unrelated GI care and colon cancer surgery. This is



                                                 16
confirmed by the estimates. Indeed, none of the program coefficients were significant. 12 As

before, the HC coefficient for the pre-post comparison was significant, indicating an increase in

prices over the study period independently of the intervention.

        In Table 4 the regression coefficients are extracted to demonstrate the overall price-

reducing impact of Hospital Compare and the potential offsetting effect of being ranked in the

high-quality category (above average) category. 13 The first column reports prices for the baseline

case, in the states with no reports (intent-to-treat) in the non-reporting period. The baseline case

prices here are risk adjusted using the regression covariates and predicted for the baseline period.

As expected, CABG prices are substantially higher than PCI prices. The second and third

columns decompose the full policy effect. The second column reflects the change in price due to

the introduction of HC at the “typical” hospital with average or below average quality reported.

The third column reflects the combined effect of the policy and the premium for reporting high

quality.

        The second column indicates that HC exerts downward pressure on prices ranging from -

16.2% to -19.1% for CABG and -6.3% to -7.3% for PCI across all measures used. From the

third column we observe that in general, hospitals in the high quality bracket are able to

command higher prices relative to all other hospitals. For instance, in the case of CABG, the

second row implies that when the heart failure mortality measure is used, the full effect is 5.7% =

-19.1% + 24.8%, where 24.8% represents the quality premium. Note that in this case, the quality

premium more than offsets the downward pricing pressure exerted by the introduction of HC. A

similar finding is found for PCI. In both the CABG and PCI cases, for the heart attack measure,

12
  For colectomy, the number of patients undergoing the procedure in our data was 4,955, and the mean price was
$21,690. For GI hemorrhage, there were 16,924 patients, with a mean price of $11,302.
13
   The term a4*(E(Q|NR=1) -E(Q|NR=0)) in equation 4 ranged from $1 to $22 and was not statistically significant
in any of the models. Therefore it is omitted from the program effect calculations as reported in Table 4.

                                                       17
the quality effect dampens the downward pressure on prices due to HC, but does not fully offset

it.



      V.      Discussion

Previous studies have shown limited impacts of hospital report cards on medical outcomes and

consumer choices, calling their value into question. Shifting the focus on hospital prices, the

results of this study increases confidence in the value of disseminating report cards while

alleviating concerns over markets potential failure to reward higher-performing hospitals. Our

results generally suggest that Hospital Compare, the premier source of publicly reported

information on hospital quality in the U.S., exerts competitive pressures on hospital pricing

contributing to lower prices. However, high quality hospitals were able to capture higher prices,

offsetting the effect of Hospital Compare initiation.

           Our results have important implications for the future of health care reform. With the

implementation of Health Exchanges under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), hospital price

negotiations will likely intensify as more participants enter private markets. Despite the growing

need, information on pricing remains limited; and while hospital report cards are now accessible

to consumers, particularly in the case of cardiac procedures and diagnoses, little is known about

the impact of this information on prices ultimately paid by patients and plans.

           In addition to recognizing the importance of providing quality information, policy makers

have identified a need to provide hospitals with financial incentives to induce delivery of higher

quality services to patients. Under revised payment rules now incorporated into the ACA, CMS

will adjust overall payments made to hospitals for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries

based on adherence to certain quality indicators (Value Based Purchasing). In private markets,



                                                   18
however, formal pay-for-performance rules for hospitals are less applicable, and compensation

for higher performance is left largely to market forces, through price differentials that are

renegotiated annually with insurers. This study suggests that quality report cards can inform and

influence hospital-insurer negotiations in the intended direction, thereby increasing consumer

welfare.

Source: Authors calculations based on the MarketScan 2005-2010 inpatient claims files.
Notes: Mean prices are in 2010 dollars. Pre-reporting period is 2005-2007. Post-reporting period is 2008-2010. As in Table 1,
above average means above average for all three years in at least one of the three HC mortality measures. Below average is
below average for all three years in at least one of the three measures. Details on states with pre-HC reporting are in Appendix
Table A.1.
***The “at most average” difference is statistically different from the “above average” difference at the 99% level.

Appendix B: A test for misspecification error.
Two confounding effects due to treatment assignment may arise when estimating average

treatment effect on the treated (ATT), due to sample selection bias and group matching. While

selection bias is highly unlikely in our case (patients do not select their location based on which

states provided report cards) matching may be in issue both between groups and within groups

overtime. As a sensitivity test, here we rerun our difference-in-difference models subsetting to

samples that have been matched with propensity scores. In particular, in the CABG sample, we

match the 4,096 observations in the reporting states to 4,096 in the no reporting states using

nearest neighbor matching, without replacement and with common support. In the PCI sample,

we match 7,195 observations in the reporting states to 7,195 in the no reporting states. We use

the Stata program “psmatch2” to construct the propensity scores as the propensity to be a

reporting state, based on all the patient and market characteristics used in all our models (Leuven

and Sianesi, 2012). Comparing matching to no matching before the regressions, the bias is

reduced from 15.9 to 7.8 in the PCI model, and from 16.6 to 7.3 in the CABG model. The bias is

the difference of the sample means in the reporting and no reporting (full or matched) sub-

samples as a percentage of the square root of the average of the sample variances in the reporting

and no reporting groups (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1985). Applying the GMM fixed effects

difference-in-difference estimators to the matched samples, we obtained the results shown in

Table B.1. These results do not differ much from the patterns found in the full sample results of

Table 3.

       Note that Busso, DiNardo, and McCrary (2014) show that matching with propensity

scores is preferable to sample reweighting, however, propensity scores are sensitive to model

specification, and in our case is not clear which variables should account for common support,

e.g., patient level variables or all variables including hospital and market area characteristics

                                                 31
(Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2008; Leuven and Sianesi, 2012). To assess the potential bias more

generally we expand the expected value of the full DD estimate to include the vector of all such

variables.

Restating equation [4] we have:

 Pihjt = a0 + a1 HCt + a2 NR ijt + a3 𝑄ℎ,𝑡−1 + 𝑎4 HCt ∗ NR ijt + a5 Qℎ,𝑡−1 ∗ NR ijt + a6 𝐻𝐶𝑡
             ∗ 𝑄ℎ,𝑡−1 + 𝑎7 ∗ 𝐻𝐶𝑡 ∗ 𝑁𝑅𝑖𝑗𝑡 ∗ 𝑄ℎ,𝑡−1 + a8 ∗ Zijt + eihjt

Under this model, the average impact of hospital compare is given by:

ΔHC = [E(P|nr, Post) − E(P|nr, Pre)] − [E(P|r, post) − E(P|r, pre)]

= ��𝑎0 + 𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + 𝑎3 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎4 + 𝑎5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎6 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)
             + 𝑎7 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎8 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)�
             − �𝑎0 + 𝑎3 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒) + 𝑎5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒) + 𝑎8 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��
             −��𝑎0 + 𝑎1 + 𝑎3 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎6 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝑎8 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)�
                           − �𝑎0 + 𝑎3 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒) + 𝑎8 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��

= 𝑎3 {[𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] − [𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)]} + 𝑎4
               + 𝑎5 [𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] + 𝑎6 [𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)]
              + 𝑎7 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)
               + 𝑎8 {[𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] − [𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)]}

Similarly, using equation 3 (Hospital Compare quality scores are not reported prior to HC

implementation), we have


ΔHC = ��𝛼0 + 𝛼1 + 𝛼2 + 𝛼3 + 𝛼4 ∗ 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼6 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)�
            − �𝛼0 + 𝛼2 + 𝛼6 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��
            −��𝛼0 + 𝛼1 + 𝑎4 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼6 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)� − �𝑎0 + 𝛼6 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��

= �𝛼1 + 𝛼3 + 𝛼4 ∗ 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼6 �𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��
             −�𝛼1 + 𝛼4 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) + 𝛼6 �𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��

= 𝛼3 + 𝛼4 [𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑄𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)] + 𝛼5 𝐸(𝑄𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡)
             + 𝛼6 ��𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)� − �𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)��

Thus, misspecification due to balancing would not be an issue if

[𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑛𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] − [𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) − 𝐸(𝑍𝑟 |𝑝𝑟𝑒)] ≈ 0

                                               32
Calculating this term in our data we get -263 for CABG and 754 for PCI in the full difference-in-

difference model for the combined heart failure/heart attack score. Taking account of this

component will not alter the basic empirical finding of a negative program effect (Table 4).

Moreover, from a two sided Z-test neither term was statistically different from zero (p=.95,

p=0.92 respectively).

Notes: Matched samples: CABG N=8,198 and PCI N=14,390. Observations in “no reporting “states were matched 1 to 1 to observations in reporting states by
nearest neighbor propensity scores. Hospital fixed effects GMM using the covariates of Appendix Table A.4, with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in
parentheses. Hospital Compare and mortality scores are lagged a year. DD= Difference-in-Difference estimates without the quality report.
