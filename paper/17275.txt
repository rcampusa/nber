Substitution Between Individual and Cultural Capital Pre-Migration Labor Supply, Culture
and US Labor Market Outcomes Among Immigrant Women

                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper we use New Immigrant Survey data to investigate the impact of immigrant women’s
own labor supply prior to migrating and female labor supply in their source country to provide evidence
on the role of human capital and culture in affecting their labor supply and wages in the United States.
We find, as expected, that women who migrate from countries with relatively high levels of female
labor supply work more in the United States. Moreover, most of this effect remains when we further
control for each woman’s own labor supply prior to migrating, which itself also strongly affects labor
supply in the United States. Importantly, we find a significantly negative interaction between pre-migration
labor supply and source country female labor supply. We obtain broadly similar effects analyzing
the determinants of hourly earnings among the employed in the United States, although the results
are not always significant. These results suggest an important role for culture and norms in affecting
immigrant women’s labor supply, since the effect of source country female labor supply on immigrant
women’s US work hours is still strong even controlling for the immigrant’s own pre-migration labor
supply. The negative interaction effects between previous work experience and source country female
labor supply on women’s US work hours and wages suggest that cultural capital and individual job-related
human capital act as substitutes in affecting preparedness for work in the US.

I. Introduction


         In recent decades, the share of the US population that was foreign-born has risen from

4.8% in 1970 to 11.1% in 2000, with a further increase to 12.2% in 2009 (US Bureau of the

Census web site: http://www.census.gov ). Perhaps more dramatically, the percentage of the

foreign-born population that came from Europe or North America fell from 70.4 to 18.5%

between 1970 and 2000,1 with a corresponding increase in the Asian and Latin American share

from 28.3 to 78.2%; by 2009, the combined Asian and Latin American share had risen further to

81.1% (US Bureau of the Census web site: http://www.census.gov ).

         As the share of US residents who were born abroad rises and as the regions from which

immigrants arrive shift toward areas with different cultures and traditions from the largely

European origins of the US-born population, economists are paying increasing attention to issues

of culture and assimilation. Recent research has shown that immigrants increasingly come from

countries with a more traditional division of labor by gender than exists among the US-born

population (Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011). Moreover, several studies have found a positive

correlation between indicators of female labor force activity in an immigrant or second

generation woman’s source country and her labor supply behavior in the United States (Antecol

2000; Fernández and Fogli 2009; Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011). Such findings are suggestive of

cultural influences on female labor force behavior, particularly since the effects on immigrants

persist with long duration in the United States (Blau, Kahn and Papps 2011) and influence the

labor supply behavior of second and higher generation women (Fernández and Fogli 2009;

Antecol 2000).




1
  The Census did not report data for the North America category separately in its 2009 report, so that we were not
able to construct a combined European-North American share; however the share of immigrants from Europe fell
from 59.7% in 1970 to 15.8% in 2000, and 12.4% by 2009 (US Bureau of the Census web site:
http://www.census.gov ).
        In this paper, we take a closer look at the association between female labor force activity

in the source country and immigrant woman’s behavior in the United States to better understand

the mechanisms through which the effect operates. For example, do immigrant women from

high female labor supply source countries have more work experience prior to their arrival in the

United States? If so, the observed effect of source country may be due at least in part to the

relatively high levels of job-related human capital that they accumulated before migration. On

the other hand, if there is a positive relationship between high source country female activity

rates and immigrant women’s US labor supply, even controlling for their pre-migration labor

supply, then one may be more confident that labor market-oriented values or additional skills

beyond those directly tied to employment have been transmitted to such women. In other words,

it would provide evidence for an effect of broader culture or social capital in the relationship

between source country participation rates and the US labor market behavior of immigrant

women.

        Evidence on these mechanisms could also yield important information about the likely

impact of immigration policies on the labor force behavior of the women who migrate. For

example, US policies regarding diversity visas have a direct effect on the distribution of

countries from which immigrants arrive and therefore the cultural backgrounds of those migrants

who are granted visas.2 Employment visas, on the other hand, are likely to be selective of those

with previous work experience; thus, policies regarding the number of such visas may directly

affect the prior work experience of immigrants as well as indirectly affecting the types of source

countries they migrate from. Since immigration policies may have differing effects on the

distribution of source countries and the pre-migration labor supply of migrant women, it is




2
  The US Diversity Immigrant Visa Program creates 50,000 diversity visas each year, which are given by lottery to
those from countries with low immigration rates to the United States. See
http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/types/types_1322.html .

                                                        2
important to have information on the impact of both source country characteristics and actual

pre-migration behavior on US labor supply.

         In this paper, we use a rich new data set, the New Immigrant Survey, to investigate the

separate effects of immigrant women’s own labor supply prior to migrating and of their source

country characteristics, and thus to provide new evidence on the role of human capital and

culture in affecting immigrant women’s labor supply in the United States. Our major

contribution over previous research is that we are able to disentangle the effects of immigrants’

own past behavior from that of the average behavior of women and men in their source country

in affecting labor supply in the United States.3 Similar to previous work (Antecol 2000; Blau,

Kahn and Papps 2011), we find that women who migrate from countries with relatively high

levels of female labor supply work more in the United States. Of particular interest is that, using

this unique data source, we are able to show that most of this effect remains when we further

control for each woman’s own labor supply prior to migrating, and, further, that immigrant

women’s pre-migration labor supply also strongly positively affects their labor supply in the

United States. Finally, we find a significantly negative interaction between pre-migration labor

supply and source country female labor supply. This means that the impact of source country

female labor supply is stronger for those who did not themselves work for pay before migrating

than among those with work experience in their source country, while the impact of pre-

migration work experience is larger for those from source countries with low female labor supply

than for those from high female labor supply countries. We obtain broadly similar results

analyzing the determinants of hourly earnings among immigrant women who are employed in

the United States, although the effects are not always significant.

         These results suggest an important role for culture and norms in affecting immigrant

women’s labor supply, since the effect of source country female labor supply on immigrant

3
 As discussed in more detail below, this feature of our design is similar conceptually to Fernández and Fogli’s
(2006) analysis of the fertility of US-born women with different ethnic backgrounds.
                                                          3
women’s work hours in the United States is still strong even controlling for the immigrant’s own

pre-migration labor supply. The negative interaction effects between pre-migration work

experience and source country female labor supply on immigrant women’s US work hours and

wages suggest that cultural capital can substitute for individual job-related human capital in

affecting preparedness for work in the United States.



II. Relationship to Previous Literature and Contribution of the Study




       Our analysis builds on some recent papers that have studied the impact of source country

characteristics on the labor supply of immigrant women. For example, Antecol (2000) found,

using the 1990 Census, that source country female labor force participation rates were positively

correlated with the US labor force participation of immigrant women, even controlling for

human capital characteristics. Blau, Kahn and Papps (2011) further elucidated the nature of this

relationship by examining the impact of source country characteristics on immigrant women’s

labor supply assimilation profiles—the relationship between time in the United States and labor

supply. They found that migrating from a country with higher female labor force participation

permanently raised immigrant women’s labor supply profile in the United States but did not

influence its slope, which was strongly positive no matter what type of country they migrated

from. Those who came from high female labor supply countries eventually assimilated fully to

native labor supply levels, while there was a persistent 10-12% shortfall relative to comparable

natives among those who migrated from a low female labor supply country. In addition, Blau’s

(1992) study, which found a positive effect of source country fertility rates on immigrant

women’s fertility, also suggests an impact of gender roles in source countries on the behavior of

immigrant women in the United States.

       Recent economic research has also studied the impact of source country characteristics on

the behavior of US-born women descended from immigrants. For example, Antecol (2000)

found a positive correlation between US and source country participation for “second and higher

                                                 4
generation” immigrants, defined by their answer to the Census question on ancestry. Similarly,

the labor supply and fertility behavior of US-born daughters of immigrants (the second

generation) has been found to be positively associated with both female participation and fertility

rates in their parents’ country of origin (Fernández and Fogli 2009) and the participation and

fertility patterns of immigrants from those origin countries (Blau, Kahn, Liu and Papps 2008).

Moreover, in a study that examined the impact of culture on the fertility of US-born women from

different ethnic backgrounds, Fernández and Fogli (2006) used General Social Survey (GSS)

data from 1977-1987 to examine the determinants of fertility in analyses that included both the

1950 fertility rate of the respondent’s self-reported country of ancestry and her number of

siblings as explanatory variables. Their paper’s design is conceptually similar to ours in that

they had a control for both the fertility of the respondent’s own parents (i.e., her number of

siblings) and fertility in her country of ancestry. Both variables positively affected current

fertility and, since the impact of the source country fertility level was still positive even

controlling for the number of siblings, the results suggest an impact of culture beyond the

behavior of one’s own family.

       These studies of the transmission of source country values and behavior among

immigrants and their descendants are also relevant to a broader literature examining the impact

of “culture,” or preferences and beliefs developed in a different time or place on current

economic behavior (Fernández 2008). While prior results relating immigrant women’s US labor

supply to female labor force participation in their source countries suggest an impact of culture,

they do not provide much insight into the possible mechanisms behind this relationship. The

correlation could be partially or fully due to the effects of ethnic capital or culture. A woman

growing up in a country where women are expected to work outside the home may acquire

knowledge about how to succeed in the workplace, or a predilection for market work, regardless

or whether or not she has been employed herself. Such knowledge might be transmitted through

role models such as relatives or friends who have work experience. Thus, cultural capital as

measured by female labor force activity in an immigrant’s source country may be a source of

job-related human capital that can be tapped upon migration to the United States. Alternatively,


                                                   5
the correlation between source country female labor supply and immigrant women’s labor supply

in the United States might simply reflect the immigrant woman’s own pre-migration behavior.

This would be the case if, as is likely, women migrating from high female labor supply countries

have accumulated higher levels of labor market experience prior to migrating. Such an

association could not only influence their wages upon migrating to the United States, but also

their attitudes about market work. Any association between pre-migration work experience and

labor supply in the United States due to these factors may be magnified or reduced by selection:

migrants from high female labor force participation source countries may be more or less

positively selected on pre-migration labor supply/work-orientation than those from low female

labor force participation source countries. Finally, the observed correlation between source

country female labor supply and immigrant women’s labor supply in the United States might be

due to a combination of both factors: the impact of broader culture and prior work experience.

       These hypotheses about the mechanisms through which the work orientation of women in

a migrant’s source country affect work behavior in the United States can be analyzed only if one

has data on both individual migrants’ source countries and their work behavior before and after

migrating. If the impact of source country female labor supply remains positive and significant

in models which control for immigrant women’s pre-migration work experience, it suggests that

culture or ethnic capital may have broader impacts beyond merely influencing women’s pre-

migration work behavior.

       The data sets generally used to analyze immigrant behavior in the United States—the

Census, the American Community Survey (ACS), and the Current Population Survey (CPS--

since 1994)—contain information on immigrants and their source countries, but not on

immigrants’ work behavior prior to migrating. National origin country data sources, from which

labor force behavior in source countries may be calculated, do not of course break out the

behavior of residents from that of future migrants to the United States. Thus, in this paper, we

study these issues using a relatively new data set, the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), which

contains information not only on immigrants’ source countries and labor supply behavior in the

United States, but also on the labor supply and schooling they received before migrating. The


                                                 6
NIS allows us to disentangle the effects of the migrant’s own past behavior from that represented

by source country characteristics. Because the NIS contains information on when the respondent

left the source country, we can assign source country characteristics as of that date of migration,

as in Blau, Kahn, and Papps (2011). In addition, unlike the Census, ACS or CPS, the NIS

contains detailed information on visa type, allowing for a more extensive set of controls in

studying immigrants’ labor market outcomes.


III. Data and Descriptive Patterns

        Our basic data source, the NIS, is a nationally-representative survey of 8573 adult

immigrants who received admission to permanent legal residence in the United States in 2003

(Jasso, Massey, Rosenzweig and Smith forthcoming).4 The respondents were interviewed during

2003 or 2004 with about 2/3 of the sample surveyed in the earlier year. Some had just arrived in

the United States with permanent residence visas already issued, while others were already in the

United States, either under temporary visas or illegally. Although the NIS is not representative

of all immigrants (because presumably some never become legalized), it does represent a random

sample of those obtaining legal status in a given year. The NIS contains information on the

respondent’s country of birth and when the immigrant left his/her source country. We use this

information to match source country characteristics from a time-series cross-section data base we

constructed, as described in more detail below and in the Appendix. A key component of our

design is that we are able to measure source country variables at the time one left that country.

This is a potentially important feature of our analysis, since we would like to know the kinds of

norms and values the respondent grew up with.

        Our sample is restricted to individuals who migrated as adults (age 18 and over) and were

currently no older than 65. Focusing on adult immigrants is appropriate because we want to

study the effects of source country culture on US behavior, and those who migrated at very
4
  A small fraction (about 0.5%) were admitted during 2002. For additional information on the NIS, see:
http://nis.princeton.edu/ .
                                                        7
young ages may be very Americanized by the time they reach adulthood. Moreover, since we

wish to examine the role of pre-migration labor market experience, we need a sample of

individuals for whom this is a realistic possibility. We also exclude the small number of new

immigrants who were not currently living in the United States (about 1.2% of the sample),

although the results were virtually identical including them. The NIS supplied a set of sampling

weights, which we use in all of our analyses, thereby assuring that we have a representative

sample of newly legalized immigrants.

        We now examine the characteristics of the NIS sample, which as noted contains

information not available in other data bases on immigrants. Table 1 shows descriptive

information for men and women overall as well as separately for three major source regions:

South and East Asia; Latin America and the Caribbean; and Europe and Central Asia. Several

conclusions about gender and employment before and after immigration emerge. First, overall,

immigration seems selective of women with high relative work propensities. This can be seen by

comparing the gender ratio for the average incidence of pre-migration employment among

immigrants to the gender ratio for activity rates in the source country.5 Table 1 shows that before

migration, women were 78% as likely as men to have worked for pay (i.e., 0.532/0.6860.78),

while the average female/male activity rate ratio in migrants’ source countries at the time they

migrated was only 0.59-0.60.6 Of course, in addition to selection, the higher female/male ratio in

pre-migration employment propensity in the NIS compared to the source country average may

also be due to the age or education composition of immigrants or to temporarily high labor

supply among immigrant women earning money before leaving their source country to help

finance their (and their family’s) migration.



5
  While the activity rates include unemployment, the NIS does not contain information on pre-migration
unemployment.
6
  This average is implicitly a weighted average across source countries, where countries which send a lot of
migrants to the United States will be more highly represented in the average.
                                                          8
        Second, in terms of the labor supply behavior of the specific women who do migrate,

migration appears to widen the gender gap in employment or work hours. For example, 53.2%

of women worked before migrating, compared to only 46.8% after coming to the United States

(a 6.4 percentage point decline, or about 12 percent of the pre-migration mean); for men, the

share working rose from 68.6% before migration to 73.6% in the United States (7.3 percent

relative to the mean). While average work hours (including those not working) fell for both men

and women, they fell much more for women (306 hours, or 29.4%) than for men (114 hours, or

7.5%).7 Several interpretations of these changes in labor supply are possible. On the one hand,

perhaps women are returning to their intended labor supply levels, which may have been

temporarily inflated pre-migration in an attempt to help finance their move. Alternatively, it is

possible that women’s early labor supply in the US is temporarily reduced due to their having

greater difficulty than men in locating employment or to the disruption of moving and the

resulting disproportionately high level of family responsibilities for women under a traditional

division of labor. Gender differences in visa types may also contribute to this result. The NIS

data show that family visas are by far the most common method of attaining legal permanent

resident status for both sexes, but were more common among women than men. Fully 62.5% of

women compared to 47.6% of men had such visas. Not surprisingly, the reverse was true for

employment visas, which were somewhat more common for men (14.5%) than women (10.1%).

        In addition to these results for all immigrants, Table 1 shows some interesting patterns

among the three major source regions represented in the NIS. Pre-migration labor supply among

women is ranked similarly to the average source country female/male activity rate ratio: women

worked on average 860 hours before migrating in Latin America and the Caribbean region, far

less than they worked in South and East Asia (1128 hours) and in Europe and Central Asia (1368

hours)—regions with higher relative female activity ratios. Women’s labor supply fell sharply

7
  Using the NIS data, Akresh (2008) found that women experience larger post-migration reductions in occupational
prestige than men; a pattern that is similar to the labor supply comparisons we obtain here.
                                                             9
after migration among Europeans and Asians but hardly changed for those migrating from Latin

America and the Caribbean region. The gender gap in US labor supply was smaller both

absolutely and relatively for Europeans and Central Asians than for those migrating from the

other regions. Finally, the gender pay gap was about 0.20 log points for those from Latin

America and the Caribbean area and about 0.30 log points for those from the other two regions.

       Gender differences in the level of pre-migration schooling also differed by region. Men

and women from Europe and Central Asia had about the same level of pre-migration schooling

(14.1 years), while men’s pre-migration schooling was somewhat higher than women’s among

those moving from Latin America and the Caribbean area (10.5 vs. 10.1 years) and considerably

higher than women’s for those migrating from South and East Asia (13.8 vs. 12.6 years). There

were also some differences by visa type across the regions. The gender gap in employment visas

was particularly large among those migrating from South and East Asia (20.3% for women and

33.1% for men). Legalization visas were especially common among those migrating from Latin

America and the Caribbean area (13.8% for women and 19.3% for men), and diversity or refugee

visas were more common among Europeans and Central Asians (42.1% for women and 46.5%

for men) than for the other groups. The higher incidence of employment visas among those from

Asia may reflect their longer distance of migration, a fixed cost that requires a larger labor

market return to migration to offset (Chiswick 1978). Moreover, the higher incidence of

legalization visas among those from Latin America likely reflects their relative ease of illegal

border crossings, given their physical proximity to the United States, raising the stock of those

potentially requesting such visas.

       Table 1 Panel B shows means for the source country characteristics in the aggregate and

separately by region. The source countries are implicitly weighted by the (weighted) number of

immigrants from each country. Not surprisingly, the Europe and Central Asia region has higher

levels of income, lower fertility, higher female activity rates, and higher schooling levels than the

                                                 10
other two regions. In contrast, the Latin America and Caribbean region has relatively high

fertility, low income, low education and low female supply. The international contrasts on these

dimensions at the source-country level provide a source of cultural variation among immigrants

that we will use in our empirical analyses.

        Since the NIS sample includes only legalized immigrants, it may not be representative of

all immigrants, because a large share of immigrants is believed to be undocumented. For

example, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that as of January 2006, 39.6% of the

US foreign-born population was unauthorized (Hoefer, Rytina and Campbell 2007, p. 3). While

it is impossible to fully ascertain the characteristics of the undocumented, it is instructive to

compare the NIS data to US Census and ACS data, which contain information on both

documented and undocumented immigrants, albeit in unknown proportions.8 Appendix Table

A1 shows information from the 2000 US Census and 2005 ACS on similar variables (when

available) for foreign-born individuals who arrived in the United States in the last 5 years (about

69% of the NIS sample arrived during the previous 5 years).

        Several interesting contrasts and similarities emerge between the NIS and the samples

collected by the Census Bureau data sets. First, the NIS sample is older than the immigrant

respondents in the Census or the ACS—mean age was 38 for the NIS compared to 32-34 for the

Census and ACS. This difference is consistent with the inclusion of unauthorized immigrants in

the Census and ACS sample, since it is likely that it takes a significant amount of time for an

undocumented immigrant to obtain permanent resident status.

        Second, the NIS respondents are more highly educated than those in the Census or ACS:

total years of schooling average 13.2 for men and 12.3 for women in the NIS, compared to 11.8-

12.3 in the Census and ACS.9 It is likely that the sample of NIS respondents contains a


8
  In addition, illegal immigrants may be underrepresented in these data sets.
9
   Because the Census and ACS code education in categories, we use Jaeger’s (1997) suggested algorithm to convert
these to years of schooling.
                                                         11
disproportionate share of those with work qualifications and therefore higher schooling levels.

Moreover, there is a gender gap in education favoring men in the NIS, while, in the Census and

ACS, women have slightly higher levels of schooling. This pattern is consistent with those

entering with work visas being disproportionately male (as we have seen is the case) and

undocumented immigrants being disproportionately comprised of less educated men. This latter

interpretation is also supported by the pattern showing larger shares of immigrants from Latin

America and the Caribbean area in the Census and ACS than in the NIS. In addition, taking into

account sampling weights, the 2000 Census and 2005 ACS samples consist of 52.1-52.5% men,

in contrast to the NIS’s 42.5% figure. Again, a higher level of illegal immigration among men is

suggested.

        Finally, despite these differences in demography and education, the gender gaps in work

behavior and wages are very similar in the NIS to the Census and ACS. In the NIS, men work an

average of 1399 hours (including those with zero work hours), compared to 1436-1634 in the

Census and ACS; women in the NIS work 735 hours, compared to 764-826 hours in the Census

and ACS. (Other measures of labor supply show also show comparable levels in the NIS and the

other data sets.) And, the gender pay gap is roughly 0.20 log points in the NIS, compared to

0.14-0.16 in the Census and ACS.10 Thus, overall, for the purposes of analyzing work behavior,

the NIS seems fairly representative of all immigrants, despite its limitation to those with

permanent resident status.




IV. Empirical Procedures and Regression Results

10
  The NIS provides information on the respondent’s rate of pay and the time unit upon which this is based (i.e.,
hourly, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or annually). Combined with information on weeks worked in the last year and
usual work hours, we can compute an hourly earnings measure. The NIS also has information on labor income in
the last year. However, since there are more missing values for this variable than for the rate of pay on one’s job,
we use the latter in our wage analyses. As explained in the footnote to Table A1, we compute average hourly
earnings in the Census and ACS using annual wage and salary income divided by annual work hours for wage and
salary workers.
                                                         12
         A. Empirical Procedures

         We analyze labor supply in the United States for a sample of women who migrated after

age 17 and who were 65 years old or younger by estimating the following equation for

immigrant i, migrating from source country c at time t:

         Hict F Xi , Zct , ui)   (1),

where:

H is annual hours worked in the United States, including zeroes; X is a vector of personal

characteristics; Z is a vector of source country characteristics measured at the time of migration;

and u is a disturbance term. We estimate (1) as a linear regression, although implementing a

Tobit analysis to take account of the mass of points at zero hours led to very similar results.

Standard errors were clustered at the source country level, allowing for a correlation across

respondents from the same country regardless of the time of arrival.

         X includes current age; age squared; a dummy for married spouse present; years of

schooling completed before migrating; years since migrating to the United States (ysm); ysm

squared; a series of race/ethnicity dummy variables including: Hispanic, Asian Nonhispanic,

Black Nonhispanic, and Other Nonwhite Nonhispanic; and annual work hours before migrating,

including zeroes. The source country characteristics (measured at the time of arrival) include

female/male activity rate ratio; completed fertility; GDP in 1995 US dollars; gender-specific

primary and secondary enrollment rates; distance to the United States; and dummies for English-

speaking and for English-official but not English speaking countries. The construction of these

variables is described in detail in the Appendix.

         The personal characteristics variables are intended to measure preparedness for the US

labor market, labor supply propensities and job opportunities. Age, schooling, and ethnicity may

be proxies for human capital, the quality of schooling, or discrimination. Labor supply before

migration and marital status may also reflect human capital as well, or labor supply propensity

                                                    13
given human capital levels. The years since migration variable likely combines both true

assimilation as well as cohort effects. Since the NIS consists of one cross-section, it is not

possible to disentangle these using Borjas’ (1985) suggested use of multiple cross-sections or

Lubotsky’s (2007) longitudinal data approach. Nonetheless, years since migration is a

potentially important control, since as noted earlier, about 31% of immigrants who obtained legal

permanent resident status arrived more than five years before the NIS survey.

       Source country variables were selected to serve as indicators of the degree to which the

source country has a traditional division of labor by gender and the extent of labor market

preparedness of men and women from that country, and also to address possible issues of

selective migration. Female relative labor supply and fertility rates in the source country are

indicators of traditional gender roles in the country of origin which may, or may not, be

replicated in the United States. Note that the measure of source country female labor supply we

employ is women’s labor force participation relative to men’s (female LFP/male LFP). This

relative measure is appropriate in that it captures the gender division of labor explicitly. A

further advantage is that it implicitly adjusts for any problems in measuring the labor force,

particularly at different levels of economic development, at least to the extent that such problems

affect men’s and women’s measured participation rates similarly. Moreover, both source

country female relative labor supply and fertility, as well as income, education, and use of

English are all likely to be related to preparedness for work in the US labor market. In addition,

migration likely involves a disruption of work patterns due to housing and job search in the

United States. Those who came a long distance may suffer the largest disruption, likely

negatively affecting their labor supply on arrival in the US. On the other hand, as discussed,

because of the fixed costs of migration, those who choose to come from a greater distance are

likely to have higher labor market returns to migration than those coming from shorter distances,



                                                 14
all else equal (Chiswick 1978). Therefore, distance could be positively or negatively associated

with labor supply in the United States.

          Since we have controlled for actual work behavior and schooling before migrating, the

source country variables can be interpreted as indicators of culture or community-level effects on

the US labor supply of immigrant women. Moreover, an important test we implement is to

interact the respondent’s pre-migration labor supply with the female relative activity rate. The

sign of this interaction effect will provide evidence on the degree to which actual work

experience prior to immigration and source country female work propensity act as substitutes or

complements in affecting preparedness or desire for work in the United States. On the one hand,

it is possible that growing up in a country where women expect to work or observe others who

work outside the home can provide skills which substitute for actual pre-migration work

experience, producing a negative interaction effect. On the other hand, growing up in such a

country may enhance the skills one has learned on the job, producing a positive interaction

effect.

          We note that the explanatory variables in equation (1) can affect immigrant women’s

labor supply directly as well as indirectly through their effects on wage offers in the United

States. Thus, equation (1) should be seen as a reduced form. For example, source country

female relative activity rates may, as suggested above, enhance immigrant women’s human

capital and affect their wage offers, which in turn will affect labor supply in the United States. In

addition, even controlling for wage offers, cultural capital can affect women’s desires for

working in the United States, in effect shifting their labor supply function to the right. Below,

we also examine the determinants of wage offers in the United States and make inferences about

these direct and indirect effects of cultural capital on immigrant women’s labor supply.

          In addition to the basic model outlined above, we also estimate some supplementary

specifications to test the robustness or sharpen our interpretation of the basic results. First, we

                                                  15
estimate the basic models for men. Such analyses may be of interest in and of themselves and

also provide a useful check on our interpretations. For example, suppose we find that the source

country female relative activity rate is positively related to female labor supply in the United

States. While this effect may be due to the impact of culture and gender-related norms, it may

also be due to unobserved factors correlated with overall preparedness for work in the United

States. Obtaining similar results for men would support the latter interpretation; however, if such

a variable only affects women, then it likely would reflect gender-related norms.

       Second, research on the assimilation of immigrants has acknowledged the potential

problem of selective return migration. Specifically, in a sample of immigrants, we only observe

those who have decided to stay, and their labor market experience may not be representative of

the full population of individuals who have ever migrated. For example Lubotsky (2007) finds

evidence that the stayers are positively selected. The immigrants in the NIS sample are mostly

recent arrivals, so the problem of selective return migration may be less severe than in, for

example, the Census, ACS or CPS, which contain many immigrants who have been in the United

States for many years. Nonetheless, even recent immigrants may be planning return migration,

and these plans, while possibly endogenous with respect to source country labor supply and past

work behavior, may influence immigrant women’s employment in the United States.

       We address the issue of the possible selection bias due to return migration by using

available data on emigration rates by source country (see the Data Appendix). Specifically, we

include the female 1980-1990 emigration rate for immigrant women from the respondent’s

source country in some supplementary labor supply models. Adding this variable at least

partially controls for differences across respondents in their plans to emigrate. However, since

these plans themselves are likely to be affected by the respondent’s own work history and

cultural capital, our basic models are estimated without including the emigration rate.



                                                 16
        Third, in some models we include controls for the type of visa the respondent has

obtained in achieving permanent resident status, a variable not available in other data sources.

These include family visas, employment visas, diversity visas, refugee visas and legalization

visas (e.g., those given during amnesties to people who were previously undocumented), with the

omitted category being unspecified visa type. While visa type is likely endogenous with respect

to skills and labor supply intentions, it may be useful to control for it in order to sharpen the

interpretation of the underlying labor supply and source country characteristics variables.

        Fourth, we additionally include dummies referring to the region in which the respondent

was born and an indicator for the respondent’s current religious tradition in some labor supply

models. The regions include Africa, East and South Asia, Latin America, Europe-Central Asia,

and North America-Oceania, with the latter group omitted. While the NIS data are not fine

enough to permit individual source country dummies to be included, by adding regional controls

in some models, we are able to sharpen the interpretation of the source country characteristics.

Religious tradition takes on nine possible values, referring to: Catholic, Orthodox Christian,

Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Other Religion, and No Religion (the omitted

category). Controlling for the respondent’s religion allows us to study the possible mechanisms

through which source country culture can affect work behavior in the United States.

        Fifth, in some models we control for education acquired in the United States and number

of children ever born, again likely endogenous variables whose inclusion may reveal information

about the effects of past labor supply and source country characteristics.11 Finally, we

experimented with alternative forms of the dependent variable and found similar results to those

reported here. Specifically, we estimated models with current employment or labor force

participation as the dependent variable.



11
   One might argue that marital status is similarly endogenous, and we also estimate some models excluding marital
status.
                                                          17
        In addition to analyzing labor supply, we also study the determinants of hourly earnings

among immigrant women who were wage and salary workers. We are particularly interested in

the impact of pre-migration labor supply and source country culture/norms on the labor market

opportunities facing immigrant women, as indicated by wage offers. We use a sample of wage

and salary workers who are not currently enrolled in school and a similar specification of

explanatory variables to that in the labor supply models, augmented by years of schooling

obtained in the United States. This specification allows us to compare the value of schooling

obtained before and after migration. In estimating the wage equations, we need to confront the

issue of sample selection, since, as Table 1 shows, only about 41% of immigrant women in the

NIS were currently employed. We take two approaches to the issue of selection. First we

assume that the wage offers of the nonemployed are similar to those of the employed who work

only part of the year and predict log wages for the nonemployed using coefficients from a log

wage regression estimated for those with low weeks worked.12 We may then include all

respondents in the wage analysis by giving each woman her actual or predicted wage. Second,

we perform a traditional selectivity bias correction analysis (Heckman 1979). In addition to

functional form, the model is identified by including number of children, a variable that is

excluded from the second stage (log wage) equation, in the first stage (probability of having a

wage observation). We note that, since less than half of the sample is employed, we cannot use

median regression methods to account for selection bias, as in Neal and Johnson (1996), Neal

(2004), and Blau and Kahn (2006).



        B. Basic Regression Results

        Table 2 contains regression results for the determinants of annual work hours in the

United States for immigrant women. We show several specifications, as indicated in our

12
  This method of estimating wages for the nonemployed has been used by Juhn (1992), Juhn and Murphy (1997),
and Blau and Kahn (2007), among others.
                                                      18
previous discussion. The first column shows the simplest specification, with only individual

characteristics included, excluding visa type. Work hours before migrating have a positive,

highly significant effect on work hours in the US. The coefficient is 0.101, implying that a

woman who worked the average number of hours among those who were employed prior to

migrating (approximately 2000) will work roughly 202 hours (or about 27% of the immigrant

unconditional mean work hours) more than a woman who did not work before migrating to the

United States. Column 2 shows that this effect remains the same when we add source country

characteristics other than female relative activity rate.

        Column 3 shows the reduced form effect of the female relative activity rate obtained by

excluding the respondent’s own work hours prior to migration. The effect is 982 hours and is

highly statistically significant. To gauge the magnitude of this effect, we note that the 75th

percentile of the female relative activity rate in our sample is .7045 (roughly the level in Sub-

Saharan Africa) and the 25th percentile is .4726 (roughly the level in the Dominican Republic).13

The estimate in column 3 implies that an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the

female relative activity rate will raise women’s work hours by 228 hours (31% of the mean).14

        Columns 4-6 of Table 2 explore the interplay between source country culture (the

female/male activity rate ratio) and actual pre-migration labor supply in affecting immigrant

women’s work behavior in the United States. First, column 4 shows that adding the respondent’s

annual pre-migration work hours variable to the model reduces the effect of the source country

female/male activity rate ratio by about 99 hours to a still highly significant value of 883. Thus

about 90% (883/982) of the total effect of source country culture remains even after we control

for the immigrant’s actual labor supply before migrating. And the effect of the respondent’s pre-

migration labor supply remains unchanged at .1. This latter result is interesting, partly because
13
    These percentiles are based on individual observations (with sampling weights), which means that countries with
a large number of observations, such as Mexico, will get greater weight in computing the percentiles.
14
    This is larger than the 12% figure obtained for newly arrived married immigrant women by Blau, Kahn and
Papps (2011), using 1980-2000 Census data. When we restrict the sample to married women (Table A3), the impact
is reduced to about 27%, somewhat closer to Blau, Kahn and Papps’s result.
                                                           19
the own labor supply variable can now be interpreted as labor supply relative to the average in

one’s source country.

        Second, columns 5 and 6 of Table 2 show statistically significant negative interaction

effects between pre-migration labor supply and female relative activity rate ranging from -0.222

to -0.193 (with visa category excluded and included, respectively). Table 3 employs the

coefficients from Table 2 to compute the impact of pre-migration labor supply for women

migrating from high vs. low female activity rate countries, as well as the impact of female source

country activity rate for women who worked before migration vs. those who did not. Table 3

shows that the impact of working before migration (at the conditional average of roughly 2000

hours per year) on U.S. labor supply is 253-262 hours for those coming from low female labor

supply countries and 160-163 hours for women from high female labor supply countries.

Moreover, the impact of coming from a high female labor supply country vs. a low female labor

supply country is 213-259 hours for those who did not work before migrating and 123-156 hours

for those who did work. The effects shown in Table 3 are all highly statistically significant as

are the negative interaction terms shown in Table 2, columns 5 and 6.

        These comparisons illustrate the degree to which previous labor supply and a work-

oriented source country culture can substitute for each other in affecting immigrant women’s

labor supply in the United States. The average effect of prior work experience is about the same

size as the average effect of coming from a high vs. a low female labor supply source country.

And the negative interaction effects we have just discussed imply that in general source country

labor supply is more important for those without prior work experience, while prior work

experience is more important for those coming from traditional source countries. This suggests

that human capital acquired on the job and human capital transmitted through source country

culture act as substitutes.



                                                20
       While our results suggest substitutability between on-the-job human capital and source

country culture, it is also possible that the women from low female labor supply countries who

worked prior to migration are relatively more positively selected for labor supply than those who

worked prior to migration from high female labor supply countries. Blau and Kahn’s (2003) and

Olivetti and Petrongolo’s (2008) results showing a positive cross-country relationship between

the gender pay gap and female labor supply are consistent with view—i.e., that women who are

employed in low female participation countries are more positively selected for wages (in terms

of their unmeasured characteristics) than their counterparts in high female participation countries

for wages. Such a selection pattern would in turn be expected to increase their labor supply.

However as Blau and Kahn (2003) argue, it is also possible that high female labor supply lowers

women’s relative wages through simple supply effects, as long as men and women are imperfect

substitutes in production. Nonetheless, if the selection argument is valid, then it may be that the

women from traditional source countries who had previous work experience are an especially

positively selected group. While the selection mechanism can help explain the small effect of

source country female relative activity rate among those who did work before migration, it

cannot explain the very large effects of source country female labor supply on women who did

not work before migrating. This is the case since under the selection scenario laid out above,

women from low female labor supply countries who did not work pre-migration are less

negatively selected relative to women from high female labor supply countries who did not work

before migrating.

       Table 2 also contains some interesting results for other factors that influence immigrant

women’s labor supply in the United States. Looking first at the impact of individual

characteristics, we see that, as would be expected, married women work less than single women,

other things equal, impacts that are very similar across specifications. We also find that pre-

migration schooling significantly raises post-migration labor supply in all specifications. The

                                                 21
impact of a college degree vs. a high school degree is 46-69 hours. It is noteworthy that this

effect does not change when we control for source country enrollment rates, a specification that,

as we noted in our earlier discussion of the impact of own labor supply, in effect transforms the

own schooling variable into one that measures schooling relative to one’s source country peers.

Years since migration has a positive main coefficient and a negative quadratic coefficient in the

analysis of work hours, with a positive derivative for women who have been in the United States

for up to 19-20 years (depending on the specification in Table 2), or about 96% of the

population-weighted sample. As noted earlier, while this effect could be interpreted as

assimilation, it may also be a cohort effect, since we have only one cross-section. And compared

to the omitted “other” visa category, refugees, women with employment visas, and previously

undocumented women have especially high labor supply.

       The source country characteristics besides female labor supply have some interesting

effects on labor supply as well. First, longer distance to the United States is associated with

decreased work hours, implying that the disruption effect outweighs the selection effect

discussed above. Second, coming from a country in which English is an official language is

associated with longer work hours. Both of these effects were also found for recent immigrants

by Blau, Kahn, and Papps (2011).

       While the results in Table 2 suggest the presence of substitution effects between own

labor supply and a female work-oriented culture, it is possible that the source country effects

reflect overall preparedness for work in the United States rather than the source country division

of labor by gender. Table A2 implicitly tests this view by showing results for the same models

estimated for men. While prior work experience has a roughly similar effect for men to its effect

for women (a coefficient of about .11), the effects of source country female/male activity ratio

and its interaction with pre-migration labor supply are small and insignificant. Thus, our

interpretation of these effects for women as reflecting gender and culture would appear valid.

                                                 22
       Tables 4-6 continue our investigation into culture and immigrant behavior by studying

the determinants of log hourly earnings among women who were wage and salary workers and

not enrolled in school. We measure prior work experience in these Tables by a dummy variable

equaling one for those who were employed before migrating. Using annual hours worked before

migrating gave similar but less statistically significant results. The results in Table 4 are

qualitatively similar to those in Table 2 for annual work hours but less statistically significant.

For example, in columns 1, 2 and 4 of Table 4, which show effects of pre-migration labor supply

on current wages without any interactions with source country female labor supply, the effect of

the respondent’s own pre-migration labor supply on wages is 4-5% and only slightly larger than

its standard error. Moreover, in columns 3 and 4, the impact of source country female labor

supply is positive, but only about the same size as its standard error. However, the results

become stronger when we include an interaction term for these two variables, as shown in

columns 5 and 6. For example, in both columns 5 and 6, the main effect of previous

employment is significantly positive, the main effect of the female/male activity ratio is positive

and 1.5-2.0 times its standard error, and the interaction effect is negative and 1.4-1.6 times its

standard error in absolute value.

       Table 5 shows wage results for the fully specified model (i.e., including an interaction

term for work before migration and female/male activity rate ratio) using the two alternative

selectivity bias correction methods discussed above: (i) assigning nonworkers wages based on

equations for those with low (less than 26) weeks worked (columns 1 and 2), and (ii) a two step

Heckman (1979) estimator (columns 3 and 4). The selectivity bias-corrected results are

qualitatively similar to the OLS results in Table 4. However, the effects in columns 1 and 2 of




                                                  23
Table 5, which are based on the assignment of wages to nonworkers based on workers with low

weeks worked, are particularly large and statistically significant.15

         Table 6 evaluates the impact of pre-migration labor supply and source country female

activity rate on immigrant women’s wages based on models including interaction effects. Panel

A shows the effect of pre-migration work experience. For women migrating from low female

labor supply countries, working before migration raises wages by a statistically significant 8-

12% when we do not control for visa type. Controlling for visa type, the effects are somewhat

smaller than this range and less significant. Overall, the results suggest that pre-migration work

experience has a modest labor market return in the United States for women from low female

labor supply countries. In contrast, working before moving to the United States has virtually no

effect on the wages of women moving from high female labor supply countries.

         Table 6, Panel B shows the wage effects of migrating from a high female activity rate

country vs. one with a low female activity rate. For women without pre-migration work

experience, coming from a high female labor supply country raises wages by 10-13% using the

OLS or Heckman methods and 20-35% using the low work weeks assignment method. These

effects are all significant controlling for visa type, but significant only for the low work weeks

assignment method when we do not control for visa type. The effects are noticeably smaller for

those who worked before migrating: statistically insignificant effects of 3.6-6.6% using OLS or

Heckman methods and a significant 12-24% using the low work weeks method.16




15
   There are slightly more observations for the analysis which uses workers with low weeks than for the Heckman
models since the latter includes number of children, which has some missing cases, as an explanatory variable. In
addition, there were slightly different numbers of cases of predicted wages outside the 1 to 250 per hour range than
for actual observed wages. Results were virtually identical to those shown in Table 5 when we estimated the
selection models on common samples.
16
   We note that both methods of correcting for selection bias may have flaws. Specifically, nonemployed women
may differ in unmeasured ways from employed women with low work hours, and the number of children may not be
a valid instrument. Table 5 shows that the selectivity variable coefficient (“Inverse Mills Ratio”) is not statistically
significant in either column 3 or 4; while this does not prove that selectivity bias is not a problem, a formal statistical
test accepts the null hypothesis of no selectivity bias. Indeed, the results for our key variables were, as discussed,
similar for the Heckman models and the OLS models.
                                                            24
       The OLS and selectivity bias-corrected results in Tables 4-6 suggest the following

interpretation, which is similar to what we concluded about the determinants of labor supply.

Pre-migration labor supply and growing up in a work-oriented culture can both impart skills that

are marketable in the US, and these two sources of human capital act as substitutes in the sense

that an increase in one reduces the marginal productivity of the other. While we obtain no

evidence that pre-migration work experience raises wages in the United States for those who

were born in a country with high levels of female labor force participation, pre-migration work

experience has potentially substantial positive effects on US wages for those growing up in a

country with low female labor participation.

       Part of the wage effects obtained in Table 6 for pre-migration labor supply and source

country female activity rate may be due to the positive impact of these on US labor supply.

However, assuming that the wage results are entirely due to source country culture and human

capital acquisition, the combination of the labor supply results in Table 3 and the wage results in

Table 6 suggests the possibility that our labor supply results could simply represent a movement

along the labor supply curve, since the key variables have the same signs in both equations.

Consider first the effect of pre-migration labor supply on wages and work hours. For women

moving from low female labor supply countries, the effect of pre-migration work experience on

work hours not controlling for visa type is 35.7% (Table 3, Panel A Column 1), while its effect

on log wages using the same specification is at most 0.118. Thus the hours effect is 3.0 times the

wage effect in this specification, and the ratio is even higher for the other specifications in Tables

3 and 6, Panel A. For movements along the labor supply curve to explain the entire work hours

effect, the female labor supply elasticity would need to be at least 3, and previous research finds

that this parameter was about 0.26-0.32 in the aggregate for women in the United States in 2000

(Blau and Kahn 2007). In other words, for movements along the labor supply curve to fully

explain our results for work hours, the labor supply elasticity of immigrant women would need to

                                                 25
be at least roughly 10 times that of the full population of immigrants and natives. This strongly

suggests that pre-migration work experience likely shifts the labor supply to the right as well as

contributing to an upward movement along the supply curve.

       Looking at the magnitudes of the effects of source country labor supply, the results are

slightly less clear but still suggest that higher source country female labor supply acts to shift the

US immigrant women’s labor supply function to the right. On the one hand, the OLS and

Heckman models would require labor supply elasticities in excess of roughly 2.2, again a very

high level relative to the estimates of aggregate female labor supply elasticity, in order for

movements along the labor supply curve to be the entire mechanism raising US labor supply. On

the other hand, using the method of assigning wages based on low weeks workers would only

require labor supply elasticities in the 0.9-1.4 range, which, although lower are still substantially

higher than the estimates of aggregate female elasticity.

       Other results for wage determination can be briefly summarized. First, both Tables 4 and

5 show that pre-migration and US schooling both contribute positively to earnings, with, as

would be expected, a substantially larger effect of US schooling. Second, in results not shown

but available upon request, Black, Hispanic and Asian immigrants earn less than white

immigrants, all else equal. Third, growing up in an English-speaking or English-official country

raises earnings. And, finally, employment visas are associated with especially high earnings.



       C. Supplementary Analyses



       As mentioned above, we performed a number of alternative analyses which, in each case,

found similar results to those reported above. First, Tables A3 and A4 report labor supply and

wage results for married women. The findings for the key variables are quite similar in

female 1980-90 emigration rate to the basic labor supply models, and the results (available upon

request) were unchanged. The emigration rate had a positive, but insignificant effect on United

States labor supply. The positive impact is consistent with the positive selection among stayers,

although this effect did not influence our basic conclusions about cultural and human capital.

Therefore, possible plans for return migration are not part of the explanation for the basic labor

supply results in Tables 2 and 3. Third, we controlled for region and religious tradition in

studying labor supply. The basic labor supply results, also available from the authors on request,

for pre-migration employment and source country female labor supply were again unchanged.

Not surprisingly, the religious tradition variables had negative effects relative to the omitted

category—No Religion. Thus, the basic labor supply results shown in Tables 2 and 3 also hold

up within region and religious groups.17 Fourth, we used two different dependent variables in

analyzing the determinants of labor supply: labor force participation and the probability of

current employment. The results were in both cases very similar to those in Table 2. Finally, in

our basic analyses of labor supply, we additionally controlled for schooling in the US and

fertility. The results were again very similar.


V. Conclusions




         In this paper we use New Immigrant Survey data to investigate the impact of immigrant

women’s own labor supply prior to migrating and source country characteristics to provide

evidence on the role of human capital and cultural capital in affecting their wages and labor

supply in the United States. We find, as expected, that women who migrate from countries with

relatively high levels of female labor supply work more in the United States. Moreover, most of
17
  Respondents were allowed to list more than one religious tradition, and 13 of the 2769 women (i.e., 0.47%) with
complete data listed a second religion that was different from the first one they listed (including No Religion as a
possible second option). Our basic analysis used the respondent’s first response to the religion question in forming
the dummy variables, but the results were virtually identical when we excluded the 13 women who listed more than
one religion or included these respondents with a dummy variable indicating multiple responses to the religion
question.
                                                           27
this effect remains when we further control for each woman’s own labor supply prior to

migrating, which itself also strongly affects labor supply in the United States. Moreover, we find

a significantly negative interaction between pre-migration labor supply and source country

female labor supply. This means that the impact of source country female labor supply is much

stronger for those who did not themselves work for pay before migrating than among those with

work experience in their source country, while the impact of pre-migration work experience is

larger for those from source countries with low female labor supply than for those from high

female labor supply countries. We obtain broadly similar effects analyzing the determinants of

hourly earnings among the employed in the United States, although the effects are not always

significant.

        These results suggest an important role for culture and norms in affecting immigrant

women’s labor supply, since the effect of source country female labor supply on immigrant

women’s work hours in the United States is still strong even controlling for the immigrant’s own

pre-migration labor supply. The negative interaction effects between previous work experience

and source country female labor supply on immigrant women’s US work hours and wages

suggest that cultural capital can substitute for individual job-related human capital in affecting

preparedness for work in the United States. And, the very large positive effect of source country

female labor supply on the work hours of women who did not work before migrating that the

interaction effect implies further reinforces the inference that broader cultural or social capital

effects on women’s labor supply in the United States can be substantial.

Appendix: Construction of the Source Country Variables

        The source country characteristics described below were collected at five-year intervals
for the period 1950 to 2000 and were originally used in Blau, Kahn and Papps (2011). To form a
consistent list of source countries, we combine some countries which were not available in some
Census years (e.g. subsets of countries in Africa, the Pacific Islands, and the West Indies) and
countries that split or combined between 1980 and 2000 (e.g. the former USSR countries, East
and West Germany, former Czechoslovakia, and former Yugoslavia). Some countries were
combined because data on source country characteristics were only available in a combined
form. The data set includes 106 source countries in total. The characteristics for each composite
group are the average values over constituent countries weighted by each country’s population
age 18 to 65 from the 2000 Census 1% extract. Due to missing values of source country
variables in some years, we have, in cases, interpolated for intervening years, used earliest (most
recent) values for preceding (subsequent) years, and imputed source country characteristics from
neighboring countries. Source country characteristics were matched to arrival cohorts as
follows: 1950-1959: 1955; 1960-1964: 1960; 1965-1969: 1965; 1970-1974: 1970; 1975-1979:
1975; 1980-1984: 1980; 1985-1990: 1985; 1991-1994: 1990; 1995-2000: 1995.

        We then merged the data set into the NIS’s list of source countries. In some cases, we
had to aggregate countries from the source country data set, since the NIS includes only 29
source countries or country groups. In the aggregation, we used separate weighted averages by
gender by source country for immigrants who arrived in the last 5 years, taken from the 2000
Census of Population. The averages used Census sampling weights.

Note: Low work weeks models assign predicted wages to nonworkers based on wage regressions for workers
with less than 26 weeks of work. Heckman two step model includes number of own children in the first step.
Other controls in the wage regressions include age, age squared, and race/ethnicity.
