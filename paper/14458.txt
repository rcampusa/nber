Using the Census Bureau's internal March Current Population Surveys (CPS) file, we construct and
make available variances and cell means for all topcoded income values in the public-use version of
these data. We then provide a procedure that allows researchers with access only to the public-use
March CPS data to take advantage of this added information when imputing its topcoded income values.
As an example of its value we show how our new procedure improves on existing imputation methods
in the labor earnings inequality literature.

Introduction

        For confidentiality reasons, the Census Bureau topcodes all values above some maximum

for each income source in the public-use version of the March Current Population Survey (CPS).

Since 1996, the Census Bureau has provided the cell mean of all topcoded incomes reported for

at least some of these income sources, including the four income sources related to labor

earnings.1

        With these cell means, researchers using the public-use CPS can match the mean values

found using internal CPS data for these income sources.           Most researchers interested in

measuring long-term trends in earnings including years prior to 1996, however, have imputed

their own topcode values to create a consistent series. A common practice is to impute topcoded

earnings as a fixed multiple above the topcode point, although there is little consensus on the

appropriate multiple to use. For example, Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993) impute weekly wages

and salaries for workers with topcoded earnings at 133% of their topcoded value using 1963–

1989 public-use CPS data and ignored changes over time in the proportion of the weekly wages

and salaries distribution affected by the topcode rule. Lemieux (2006) multiplies topcoded hourly

wages and salaries by a factor 1.4 using the public-use CPS, while Autor, Katz, and Kearney

(2008) and Katz and Murphy (1992) multiply topcoded weekly wages and salaries by a factor of

1.5.2

        In order to further alleviate concerns about topcoding, many researchers who impute

topcoded wages as a fixed multiple above the topcode point also focus on the P90/P10 ratio

rather than inequality statistics such as the Gini coefficient or the Theil index which incorporate

information about the full distribution of wages and salaries. However, Burkhauser, Feng, and

Jenkins (2007) demonstrate that while the P90/P10 ratios for both wages and salaries and total




                                                                                                 2
labor earnings are not greatly impacted by topcoding, the trends using the P90/P10 ratio are

different than those found using the Gini coefficient. Thus, a more precise topcode correction

method would allow for a further analysis of inequality trends using inequality statistics that

encompass more of the earnings distribution than the P90/P10 ratio.

       Fichtenbaum and Shahidi (1988) use a slightly more sophisticated topcode correction

method, setting all values above the topcode threshold in the public-use CPS to a single value

such that the distribution of annual wages and salaries above the median best fits the Pareto

distribution. Bernstein and Mishel (1997) use a similar approach, but fit the entire distribution of

hourly wages and salaries to the Pareto distribution instead of just the upper half of the

distribution. As a result, if the distribution of wages and salaries shifts to the right, then the

imputed value for topcoded wages and salaries will increase even if the topcode threshold is

unchanged. Bernstein and Mishel note that such a Pareto imputation for topcoded values in

public-use CPS is not perfect, as it involves imputing one value for all top-coded wages and

salaries but they argue that it is better than ignoring topcodes altogether. See Angle and Tolbert

(1999) for a further discussion of using a Pareto distribution to impute a single value for

topcoded wage and salaries .

       With access to internal CPS data used by the Census Bureau in their official estimations

of income and its distribution,3 we have constructed and disseminate cell means for the years

1976-2002 (Larrimore, Burkhauser, Feng and Zayatz, 2008).4 With these cell means researchers

who previously assigned all topcoded earnings values an estimate of the mean of all of those

earnings values above the topcode threshold can now assign these individuals their mean values

above the threshold based on the internal data. However, this approach is still limited because it

assumes all individuals with a topcoded earnings value have the identical earnings value for that




                                                                                                  3
type of earnings.

       A potential remedy for the problem of assigning all individuals with topcoded earnings

the same value is to assume that topcoded earnings fit the Pareto distribution. It is then possible

to use a multiple imputation approach to assign earnings to topcoded individuals such that the

distribution of their earnings both fit the Pareto distribution and has a mean that matches the cell

means in the internal data.

       While this approach is consistent with the common assumption that the earnings

distribution roughly follows a Pareto distribution, we believe one can do even better than Pareto

when matching earnings to those seen in the internal CPS data. In this paper, we construct and

disseminate the variances of each cell for topcoded incomes in the public-use March CPS. This

information can be used together with our cell means to further improve estimates at the top of

the income distribution. While the Pareto distribution is convenient since it can be fitted using

only the mean earnings above the topcode, it is not flexible enough to also match a known

variance. Therefore, we instead assume that earnings above the topcode threshold fit a Stoppa

distribution, which is a generalization of the Pareto distribution (Stoppa, 1990). Using a multiple

imputation approach to fit topcoded labor earnings to the Stoppa distribution fitted around the

mean and variance of topcoded labor earnings, we find that one can very closely match the

distribution of labor earnings found in the internal CPS data. While we focus on the broadest

definition of labor earnings, which includes income from primary earnings, wages and salaries,

self-employment, and farm earnings, similar results are obtained when focusing on the narrower

category of only income from wages and salaries.

       In the following section we briefly explain how we calculate the cell means and variances

using the internal CPS data. We then demonstrate that the log variance of labor earnings found




                                                                                                  4
using a multiple imputation procedure based on public-use CPS data with our cell mean and

variance data better matches the log variance using the internal CPS than other methods used in

the literature. While we focus on the log variance of labor earnings, such an imputations

procedure could similarly be used to obtain more accurate values of other statistics of interest

such as the Gini Coefficient or could be applied to other definitions of income including earnings

from wages and salaries or total household income including non-labor income. More generally,

any researcher using the public-use CPS data can now use these newly available variance data to

improve their imputations of topcoded incomes.

Cell Means and Variances for Topcoded Incomes

       In calculating the cell mean and variance for each source of topcoded income in the

public-use March CPS from 1976-2004, we attempted to remain consistent with the procedures

used by the Census Bureau to provide its cell means in recent years. Since topcoding in the

public-use CPS occurs for each separate income source, we calculated cell means and variances

for each source of income separately—11 prior to 1988 and 24 since then. Also mirroring

Census Bureau practices, our results are the weighted mean and variance of the income of all

individuals above the topcode value for the income source.

       While, in general, cell means and variances are reported separately for each income

source, for confidentiality reasons cell means were combined when less than 5 individuals are

topcoded from a source of income. In these instances, we combined 2 or more income sources to

achieve a group of at least 5 individuals and then provide the mean and variance of topcoded

incomes from this combined cell. This is the same procedure for handling small cells used by

the Census Bureau in the cell means they have released in recent years (Census Bureau, 2007a).

See Larrimore, Burkhauser, Feng, and Zayatz (2008) for a more detailed discussion of the




                                                                                                5
creation of the cell mean series and the procedures for protecting the confidentiality of

respondents. For ease of presentation of the variance data, we took the square-root of the

variance and provide the standard deviations instead. The means of topcoded incomes for each

income source are provided in Appendix Tables 1 and 2 and the standard deviations are reported

in Appendix Tables 3 and 4.

       For those interested in more details about specific demographic groups, for each source

of labor earnings we also provide cell means and variances divided by race, gender, and

employment status. These are the same demographic groups used by the Census Bureau in the

cell means they have released in recent years. For these demographic-based cell means, the cell

mean is the weighted mean earnings from each of these sources of labor earnings for topcoded

individuals with the specified demographic characteristics. As was the case for the standard cell

means, if less than 5 individuals within a demographic group are topcoded on a source of labor

earnings then for confidentiality reasons those individuals are combined with other demographic

groups to ensure that at least 5 people are included in the cell mean calculation. The means of

topcoded values for each source of labor earnings for each demographic group are provided in

Appendix Tables 5 through 11 and their standard deviations are reported in Appendix Tables 12

through 18.

Imputation Using Both Cell Means and Variances

       Using the cell means and variances reported above, it is possible to improve on previous

methods of imputing topcoded earning values as a fixed multiple above the topcode threshold or

of assigning all topcoded individuals the cell mean as their imputed earnings. Since these

methods assign all topcoded individuals the same level of earnings income, they implicitly

assume no variance in topcoded earnings. This causes calculations of the variance of earnings




                                                                                               6
for the entire population to be understated.

       In order to improve estimates of topcoded earnings by using the variance and cell mean

information from internal data, we assume that the labor earnings distribution fits the Stoppa

distribution, which is a generalization of the Pareto distribution. The Stoppa distribution has a

cumulative distribution function:




where y0 is a lower bound of the distribution, in this case representing the topcode threshold, and

the parameters α and θ specify the shape of the distribution. The Pareto distribution is the special

case of the Stoppa distribution where θ equals 1.

       While the Pareto distribution is often considered a good fit for the US income distribution

(Piketty and Saez 2003), and has commonly been used to determine fixed-values to impute

topcoded wages and salaries (see Fichtenbaum and Shahidi, 1988; Bishop, Chiou, and Formby,

1994; and Bernstein and Mishel, 1997), it is not flexible enough to incorporate known

information about the variance of the distribution. As a result, while one could use the Pareto

distribution to impute varying earnings for individuals above the topcode threshold, even when

setting the mean of the imputed earnings correctly, such an imputation will generally estimate the

variance incorrectly.

       By using the more general Stoppa distribution, we can improve on imputations using the

Pareto distribution. Because it is a two-parameter distribution, we can use the Stoppa distribution

to incorporate the known information about both the mean and variance of topcoded incomes.

Thus, instead of assuming that the variance of topcoded labor earnings fits the standard variance

of the Pareto distribution, the Stoppa distribution allows us to ensure that the variance of

topcoded labor earnings in our imputations match the variance in the internal CPS data.



                                                                                                  7
       Before imputing topcoded values, we must first calculate α and θ for each of the four

sources of labor earnings (primary earnings, wages and salary, self-employment, and farm

earnings) in each year such that the mean and variance of topcoded values based on the Stoppa

distribution will match those seen in the internal CPS data. 1 This is done by solving for α and θ

that simultaneously solve both of the first two moments of the Stoppa distribution:




where m and v are the mean and variance of the distribution and                   and

are beta functions.2

       Because of natural shifts in the distribution above the topcode threshold, the parameter

values for the Stoppa distribution differ from year to year and across labor earnings sources.

However, some of the largest changes, such as the shift from 1981 to 1982, coincide with

changes to the topcode threshold in the public-use data. This is to be expected since any change

to the topcode threshold can dramatically alter the mean and variance of topcoded values.

Because the parameter values change over time both due to natural fluctuations in the topcoded

population and changes in the topcode thresholds, when imputing topcoded values we use

different parameter values for each year and earnings source in order to provide the best fit to

internal data. These parameter values for the four sources of income that make up labor earnings

are provided in Table 1.3

       Having determined the appropriate parameters in the Stoppa distribution, we can proceed

with imputing each source of topcoded labor earnings. First, for each of the four sources of labor

earnings (three sources prior to 1988), we find all its topcoded observation and then for each of




                                                                                                    8
these observations we draw a value from the distribution that is implied by the fitted Stoppa

distribution. For observations that are not topcoded, no imputation is required so we simply use

the earnings as reported in the public-use CPS data. Second, we sum the four sources of labor

earnings, to calculate the total labor earnings in our distribution for all individuals in each year.

We estimate our inequality statistics using this distribution which includes imputed labor

earnings for topcoded observations and observed labor earnings for non-topcoded observations.

Third, we repeat steps 1 and 2 one hundred times, and finally, we average the one hundred

estimates in each year to generate the reported inequality statistics.

Comparing the log variance of labor earnings using different topcode corrections

        In Figure 1, we compare the trends in the log variance of labor earnings in the public-use

March CPS using our multiply imputed data based on the Stoppa distribution (Public-Stoppa) to

those obtained using four other methods of correcting for censoring in the public-use CPS data.

These methods include ignoring cell means and assigning the topcode value as the labor earnings

for all topcoded individuals (Public-NoCM), assigning a value equal to 1.4 times the topcode

threshold to topcoded individuals (Public-Multiple),8 assigning the cell mean value as the

earnings for all topcoded individuals (Public-CM), and using our multiple imputation approach

but fitting topcoded values to the Pareto distribution instead of the Stoppa distribution (Public-

Pareto). Finally, we also include the log variance of labor earnings values found in the actual

internal data (Internal).

        We find that in all years except 1985 (the only year the public-use top code values were

identical to the censoring threshold of the internal CPS data) the Public-NoCM series understates

the log variance of labor earnings in the internal CPS compared to each of the other series. This

should not come as a surprise since this series will suppress the values of top labor earners, thus




                                                                                                   9
compressing the labor earnings distribution and reducing the labor earnings variance.

       The log variance found in the Public-Multiple series is higher than that found in the

Public-NoCM series because it allows for greater labor earnings at the top of the labor earnings

distribution. Prior to 1994, this series does a reasonable job of approximating the log variance of

labor earnings seen in the internal data. However, after 1994 when the Census increased the

censoring levels in their internal data the Public-Multiple series greatly understates the amount of

labor earnings held by top labor earners and as a result also understates the log variance of labor

earnings. Using this procedure to match the level of labor earnings received by topcoded

individuals in the internal data would require imputing topcoded sources of labor earnings at

approximately twice the topcode threshold instead of 1.4 times the threshold. However, even

with a more accurate multiple for estimating topcoded sources of labor earnings, this method

would still understate the log variance of labor earnings because there is no variance in the

imputed labor earnings for topcoded individuals.

       Using cell means to impute topcoded values further improves the estimates of the log

variance of labor earnings since, unlike the Public-NoCM and Public-Multiple series, the Public-

CM series does not assign topcoded individuals an arbitrary level of earnings. It assigns them

the actual mean labor earnings seen in the internal CPS data. However, as was the case with the

Public-Multiple series, even with the most accurate estimate of the level of earnings received by

topcoded individuals the log variance of labor earnings will be understated compared to the

actual log variance seen in the internal CPS data because it assumes that all topcoded individuals

have the same earnings.

       To further improve approximations of the log variance found in the internal CPS data, it

is necessary to drop the restrictive assumption that all individuals with a topcode for some source




                                                                                                 10
of earnings have the same earnings values for that source of labor earnings. Prior to the

availability of cell means and variances for earnings above the topcode threshold for each

sources of labor earnings, the best approximation, not assuming that all topcoded individuals

have the same value, was the Public-Pareto series. This series assumes topcoded earnings values

fit the Pareto distribution fitted so that the mean of the distribution matches the cell mean of

topcoded income sources. However, since the variance of the Pareto distribution is greater than

the observed variance of topcoded labor earnings, we find that this approach greatly overstates

the log variance of labor earnings in the internal CPS data. In fact, for many years the Public-

Pareto series misses the log variance of labor earnings in the internal data by even more than the

Public-CM series.

       The Public-Stoppa series, which uses our multiple imputation approach to fit topcoded

values for each sources of labor earnings to the Stoppa distribution with a mean and variance for

topcoded labor earnings that matches the mean and variance of topcoded labor earnings in the

internal CPS data, provides a much better fit to the log variance of labor earnings seen in the

internal CPS data. Since this series does not assume that all individuals topcoded for a given

source of labor earnings have the same earnings from that source, it accurately finds a higher

variance than each series that make this assumption. And since it fits the variance of topcoded

labor earnings to the actual variance in the internal CPS data, it provides a much better fit to the

true distribution of labor earnings above the topcode in the internal CPS data than the Public-

Pareto series which relies on the assumption that the variance of topcoded earnings matches the

variance of the Pareto distribution.9

Conclusions

       Topcoding in the public-use CPS data has limited the ability of researchers to incorporate




                                                                                                 11
high earners in estimates of the US earnings inequality. This problem is exacerbated by non-

systematic changes in topcoding over time, causing inaccuracies in trends observed based on this

data. Using internal CPS data, we have created a series of cell means and variances for topcoded

income which can be used in conjunction with public-use CPS data to generate more accurate

estimates of US income levels and trends. When using the cell means and variance to impute

topcoded labor earnings in the public-use CPS we found that the log variance of labor earnings is

greater than is observed when ignoring topcodes or when using cell means alone and less than

that found assuming a Pareto distribution. It much more closely mirrors the actual log variance of

labor earnings using the internal CPS data than these other approximations.

       Because some censoring exists in the internal March CPS data, results based on these

statistics will still omit the very top earners whose labor earnings are above both the public-use

topcode and the internal thresholds.     For researchers interested in these earners, who are

generally confined well within the top 1% of the income distribution, it is necessary to make

additional out-of-sample predictions about the distribution of labor earnings above the internal

censoring points (for an example of such an out-of-sample estimation, see Burkhauser, Feng,

Jenkins and Larrimore, 2008). For researchers limited to using the public-use CPS, who wish to

avoid the additional distributional assumptions required for such out-of-sample predictions,

using variance and cell means of topcoded incomes that we provide will yield the best estimates

of the US earnings and income distribution that can be made without making out of sample

predictions on incomes above the internal censoring points.

A
  – Primary Earnings were not reported as a separate category prior to 1988. All labor earnings were allocated separately
to wage, self-employment, or farm-earnings.
B
  – Indicates that the public-use topcode was identical to the internal topcode, so the value in the public-use data matches
the value in the internal data without the use of the imputations procedure.

A
  - Indicates that there are not enough observations to report a cell mean for this population group in this year. The reported cell mean is a combined cell mean
with the other footnoted population groups in the same year.
B
  - Indicates that the internal censoring point is identical to the public cell mean so no additional information can be obtained from the internal data.
C
  - Interest income in 1984 does not properly match between the internal and the public data. This cell mean is based on the 25 individuals with interest income
at or above $75,000 topcode threshold in the internal data, not just the 11 people who are listed as topcoded for interest income in the public data.
N/A – Indicates that no individual with these demographic characteristics were topcoded in this year from the specified income source

Note: In parentheses below each variable name is the mnemonic for the income source from the March Current Population Survey Technical Documentation.

A
  - Indicates that there are not enough observations to report a cell mean for this population group in this year. The reported cell mean is a combined cell mean
with the other footnoted population groups in the same year.
B
  - Indicates that the internal censoring point is identical to the public cell mean so no additional information can be obtained from the internal data
C
  - Indicates that there are not enough individuals topcoded for INCSI2 to report a cell mean in this year, so the cell mean reported is a combined cell mean for
INCSI1 and INCSI2
D
  - Indicates that there are not enough individuals topcoded for INCDS2 to report a cell mean in this year, so the cell mean reported is a combined cell mean for
INCDS1 and INCDS2
N/A – Indicates that no individual with these demographic characteristics were topcoded in this year from the specified income source

Note: In parentheses below each variable name is the mnemonic for the income source from the March Current Population Survey Technical Documentation.

A
  - Indicates that there are not enough observations to report a cell mean for this population group in this year. The reported standard deviation is the standard
deviation for a combined group with the other footnoted population groups in the same year.
B
  - Indicates that the internal censoring point is identical to the public cell mean so no additional information can be obtained from the internal data.
C
  - Interest income in 1984 does not properly match between the internal and the public data. This standard deviation is based on the 25 individuals with interest
income at or above $75,000 topcode threshold in the internal data, not just the 11 people who are listed as topcoded for interest income in the public data.
N/A – Indicates that no individual with these demographic characteristics were topcoded in this year from the specified income source

Note: In parentheses below each variable name is the mnemonic for the income source from the March Current Population Survey Technical Documentation.

A
  - Indicates that there are not enough observations to report a cell mean for this population group in this year. The reported standard deviation is the standard
deviation for the combined cell mean with the other footnoted population groups in the same year.
B
  - Indicates that the internal censoring point is identical to the public cell mean so no additional information can be obtained from the internal data.
N/A – Indicates that no individual with these demographic characteristics were topcoded in this year from the specified income source

    Labor earnings include income from: primary earnings, wages and salaries, self-employment, and farm-earnings

sources. This is a slightly broader definition of earnings than income from primary earnings and wages and salaries that

is most commonly used in the literature.
2
    Although researchers have explored hourly, weekly, and annual wage inequality using March CPS data, all of these

measures of wages are based on respondents reported annual income from wages and salaries. Wage earnings are then

rescaled to a weekly or hourly basis by dividing annual income from wages and salaries by the weeks or hours worked

over the course of a year.
3
    Each year the Census Bureau uses the internal March CPS data to produce its official statistics on the average income

and poverty rates (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007b). These official values are based on the internal March CPS data that is

not available, except under certain conditions, to researchers outside of the Census Bureau.
4
    Each CPS survey captures income from the previous year. In this paper all references are to the survey year, so when

we discuss the year 1976, this refers to income from various sources that members of the household received in 1975

reported on the March 1976 Current Population Survey.
5
    In the analysis of the log variance of earnings, we use the cell means and variances for all individuals from each source

of topcoded labor earnings without dividing the sample by demographic information. This provides more stable

parameter estimates, since the small number of topcoded individuals in some demographic groups would lead to large

fluctuations in these estimates.

    Because of the complexity of these equations, an analytical solution does not exist to solve the simultaneous equations.

Instead, the solution to the moment equations were calculated using a constrained minimization problem, setting the first

moment equation as a constraint and finding α and θ that minimize the square of the second moment equation with the

additional constraint that both α and θ are in the positive domain. To ensure that the solution found through the

constrained minimization problem solves both moment conditions and is not simply the best available solution given the

constraints, a similar minimization was repeated using the second moment as the constraint and minimizing the square of

the first moment equation.         In all years, we found identical solutions of α and θ when performing the second

minimization problem.

    Since the Pareto distribution is a special case of the Stoppa distribution, it is easy to test whether the Pareto assumption

that the θ parameter equals 1. Unfortunately, due to the relatively small number of topcoded individuals from labor



                                                                                                                            37
earnings sources in some years, for confidentiality reasons on the internal data we are unable to release the variance-

covariance matrices that would be required to produce standard errors for our cell means and variances in order to test

whether the Pareto assumption is satisfied in specific years.
8
    In creating the Public-Multiple series, we followed an approach similar to that used by Lemieux (2006). For self-

employment and farm earnings in all years, we assign topcoded individuals earnings from that source equal to 1.4 times

the topcode threshold. For wages, prior to 1988, topcoded individuals for each source of income are assigned 1.4 times

the topcode threshold. After the 1988 Census redesign, we follow Lemieux’s approach and assume that all primary labor

earnings are from wages and salaries and thus combines the primary labor earnings and secondary earnings from wages

and salaries. From 1988 to 1995 individuals with combined wages greater than 99,999 from the two sources are

considered topcoded and assigned a value of 1.4 times the topcode threshold of 99,999. Starting in 1996, individuals

with combined wages greater than 150,000 from the two sources, which is the topcode threshold for primary labor

earnings, are considered topcoded and assigned a value of 1.4 times the topcode threshold of 150,000.
9
    Note that while imputing topcoded values using the cell means and variances allows us to better match measures of

earnings and income inequality using the public-use CPS to results found when using the internal CPS data, these

methods are limited in detecting the true levels of US inequality because the internal CPS data is also subject to a degree

of censoring. The internal censoring points are generally much higher and more stable over time than the public-use

topcodes, but this censoring means that the very top values will still not be captured. Additionally, a substantial increase

in internal censoring points in 1994 leads to a trend break in that year for any series based on the internal CPS. Despite

these limitations, since this is the same data used to produce official Census Bureau statistics, these remaining censorship

problems for users of the variance and cell mean data in conjunction with the public-use March CPS data are no worse

than those in the data used by the Census Bureau to produce its official statistics with the internal March CPS.
