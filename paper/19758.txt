O.M.W. Sprague was America’s leading expert on financial crises when America was debating establishing
the Federal Reserve. His History of Crises under the National Banking Act is one of the most enduring
legacies of the National Monetary Commission; a still frequently cited classic. Since the Commission
recommended a central bank, and its recommendation after some modifications became the Federal
Reserve System, it might be assumed that Sprague was a strong supporter of establishing a central
bank. But he was not. Initially, Sprague favored more limited reforms, a position that he did not abandon
until the Federal Reserve became a fait accompli. Here I discuss the sources of Sprague’s opposition
to a central bank and the relationship of that opposition to his understanding of the history and structure
of the American banking system at the turn of the nineteenth century.

1. Professor Sprague1

Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague was America’s leading expert on financial crises

when America was debating establishing the Federal Reserve. He was, literally, the

man who “wrote the book” on financial crises. His History of Crises under the National

Banking Act is the most enduring intellectual legacy of the National Monetary

Commission; a still frequently cited classic. Since the Commission recommended a

central bank, and its recommendation after some modifications became the Federal

Reserve System, it might be assumed that Sprague was a strong supporter of

establishing a central bank. But in fact Sprague was opposed to a European style

central bank and supported more limited reforms. Sprague’s views have often been

ignored by historians of thought because he was not a theoretician like his

contemporary Irving Fisher, or a successful businessman like investment banker Paul

M. Warburg. But I think the neglect of Sprague is somewhat unfair, and I hope to

redress the balance by re-examining his views on the need for a central bank. Sprague

had an encyclopedic knowledge of the history and institutional structure of American

banking in his day, and an examination of Sprague’s views, I hope to show below,

enhances our understanding of U.S. banking history prior to the Federal Reserve.

       Sprague had written a series of papers in the early years of the twentieth century

that established his reputation as one of America’s experts on money and banking

(Sprague 1900, 1903a, 1903b, 1908). He had also edited and revised Charles F.

Dunbar’s classic text, Chapters on the Theory and History of Banking (Dunbar and

Sprague 1901). So he was already one of America’s leading experts on banking and

banking crises when he was chosen to write the crucial volume on banking crises for

the National Monetary Commission that had been established in the aftermath of the

panic of 1907.

        Sprague was born in 1873. He was an undergraduate and graduate student at

Harvard, where he did his Ph.D. in Political Science. His dissertation was “The English

Woolen Industry in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries.” His teaching career was

spent mainly at Harvard where taught in the Department of Economics and from 1908 in

the newly established Harvard Graduate School of Business where he was appointed to

the first endowed chair. Sprague served from 1930 to 1933 as special adviser to the

Bank of England, and briefly during 1933 as special adviser to the U.S. Treasury. At

other times he served as consultant to the Reichsbank, the Bank of France, and the

League of Nations. In 1937 he was president of the American Economic Association.

He died in 1953. Cole, Masson, and Williams (1954) is a detailed obituary.




2. Warburg versus Sprague, 1908

Whether the United States should have a central bank was debated at the annual

meetings of the American Economic Association held in Atlantic City in December 1908.

There were two papers: the first by Paul M. Warburg made the case for a European

style central bank and the second by Sprague made the case against such a bank.

Warburg is widely regarded as one of the intellectual fathers of the Federal Reserve.2


2
 Perry Mehrling (2002) discusses Warburg’s views, and describes him as “the chief spokesman for this
point of view [that the U.S. needs a European style central bank], and the most important intellectual force
behind the proposals put forward in the failed Aldrich Bill of 1912” (Mehrling 2002, 211-2).

                                                     4
An investment banker, his views had already received considerable attention. Perry

Mehrling (2002, 211-2) describes him as “the chief spokesman for this point of view

[that the U.S. needs a European style central bank], and the most important intellectual

force behind the proposals put forward in the failed Aldrich Bill of 1912.” The Aldrich

Bill, although it failed passage, was the precursor to the Federal Reserve Act, and

contained many of the same features. Not surprisingly, Warburg made an effective case

for a central bank along European lines to the assembled economists.

       In one way Warburg had the easier task. This was the Progressive Era. Elites in

both political parties had come to believe that the lot of the average American could be

improved by creating federal agencies (or failing that state or local agencies) that

regulated economic life. The Interstate Commerce Commission had been established in

1887, the U.S. Forest Service in 1905, the Federal Drug Administration in 1908, the

Children’s Bureau of the Department of Labor would be established in 1912, and the

Federal Trade Commission in 1914. In a sense the burden proof had shifted from those

who like Warburg supported establishing a new federal agency to those who like

Sprague opposed it. In other words, Warburg was moving with the prevailing ideological

currents.

       Warburg suggested several reasons for adopting a European central bank, but

the heart of his case was the contrast between the European and especially the

German experience in 1907 and the American experience.

       Expansion was probably more acute in Germany than with us; why then did
       Germany, much weaker than we, weather the storm without a panic, while we
       went into a most disgraceful state of utter helplessness and temporary
       bankruptcy? (Warburg 1909, 344)



                                             5
Warburg noted several factors that accounted for the difference, but the major

difference, clearly, was the Reichsbank.

      Furthermore, there was unimpaired confidence that so long as the Reichsbank
      was in general touch with the situation, though some things might be rotten, they
      would remain the exceptions; and that it would be impossible for all or even any
      large proportion of the financial institutions to be unsound (Warburg 1909, 344)

Contrast that with the American experience in 1907.

      Whatever causes may have combined in the United States to bring about the
      crisis of I907, it cannot be doubted that it would never have reached such
      appalling dimensions had it not been for the lack of elasticity in our currency; the
      utter uselessness of our reserves; our inability to apply the brakes while we were
      going too fast; the absence of any means to negotiate for measures of relief with
      other countries through a channel recognized by them as official; and finally the
      lack of modern American bills of exchange, which, while serving as the means of
      settling the daily balances of the nation, would have been assets on which the
      banks might have realized in Europe and in the United States, by rediscounting
      amongst each other or at a central bank (Warburg 1909, 345).

      What about Canada? Canada did not have a central bank, but it had also

weathered the storm without a financial crisis. Warburg expressed some doubts about

the comparison: – Canada, for example, had a population of six million and the United

States a population of 85 million – but his main concern was political. The Canadian

banking system was highly concentrated. Creating a highly concentrated system of

large branch banking networks in the United States would mean creating a system that

“popular sentiment abhors” (Warburg 1909, 355).

      Warburg then went on to provide a detailed outline for a system of currency

associations which would discount paper and pass the paper along to a “central issue

department” in Washington that would issue notes. It was not a full blown central bank,

it was something less. It would, however, supply an emergency currency. The details of



                                            6
how the system would work, need not detain us here. The point is that Warburg was the

man with the plan.

      The case against a European style central bank was made by Sprague (1909a).

In the space available, Sprague was provided only an outline of his case against a

European style central bank. Soon after, in the Quarterly Journal of Economics,

Sprague (1909b) published a detailed exposition of his case. Here I draw on both

papers to summarize Sprague’s views. I should add, however, that the discussants of

the Warburg and Sprague papers gave short shrift to Sprague’s views in part perhaps

because his paper lacked the detailed plan that Warburg’s paper included.

      Sprague thought that American conditions raised serious questions about how a

European style central bank would function in ordinary times and that there were

alternatives for dealing with financial panics. Two considerations weighed against

establishing a European style central bank in the United States. The first was the

geographical dispersion and fragmentation of the American banking system. Political

pressures would inevitably force an American central bank to allocate its lending on the

basis of population, and so force the Federal Reserve into the difficult although possible

prospect of lending “fairly” to thousands of local banks. A central bank would have funds

to lend because, if European precedent was followed, it would become the fiscal agent

of the government and the U.S. was running persistent, although highly variable

surpluses. At the time, the U.S. relied on its independent Treasury system, which, to

some degree, simply locked away excess reserves. Simply requiring the Treasury to

deposit its excess balances in National banks, Sprague thought, would be sufficient to

solve this problem. As it turned out, the Federal Reserve Act adopted the system of



                                            7
regional reserve banks to ameliorate concerns about fairness in the allocation of

loanable funds, thus addressing the political forces that Sprague identified.

        A second problem with a European style central bank was the potential for

inflation. A central bank would mean the issue of a new form of currency. The amount

would be limited because of the tie to gold. It might be more appropriate to think of it as

middle-powered money in contrast with bank deposits (low-powered money) and gold

(high-powered money).3 But it would be treated as a reserve by commercial banks and

have the power to generate multiple increases in credit. Here is how Sprague (1909a,

362) expressed it at the annual meetings of the American Economic Association.

        “By substituting the notes issued by a central bank for money now in circulation
        which could be counted as reserve, our banks could further enlarge the credit
        structure until checked by gold exports, unsound business conditions, and lack of
        confidence.”

In his paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics Sprague (1909b, 386) was more

explicit.

        The conclusion would seem to be inevitable that with a highly developed deposit
        credit system the note of a central bank is a dangerous instrument, tending
        towards inflation.4

This danger would be especially acute, Sprague thought, during a period of excessive

credit expansion preceding a financial panic. Optimistically, we might hope that a central

bank would raise its discount rate, or take other actions, to limit the speculative boom.

3
 This is not something I just invented. Although Friedman and Schwartz used a simple distinction
between high-powered money and low-powered money in their basic money-supply formula, in appendix
B of A Monetary History they (1963) developed models for the gold standard that treated central bank
notes as middle-powered money. In order to use the simple high-low distinction they treated national
bank notes during the national banking era as high-powered money because they were backed by federal
government bonds and commercial bank deposits as low-powered money.
4
 This conclusion applied to central banks that could freely choose their gold reserve ratio. An 1844 law
made Bank of England notes gold certificates (covered 100% by gold). This limited the ability of the Bank
of England to respond to financial panics. It could only issue more notes if it was given permission to
break the 1844 restriction.

                                                    8
Sprague (1909b, 398), however, was skeptical. An American central bank might end up

leaning with the wind rather than against it.

       Is it not certain that, in the eager search for funds in times of active business, the
       other banks would resort to it [the central bank] for heavy loans? Doubtless a
       considerable measure of accommodation would have been thus granted if we
       had possessed such a central bank in the years before the crisis of 1907, even
       though it had been managed with far more conservatism than we have any
       reason to be certain of securing at all times. Every dollar thus borrowed would
       have been an addition to the extension of credit at a time when restraint was
       needed, not expansion

The experience of the U.S. Independent Treasury provided some practical evidence on

this point. The surplus funds in the Independent Treasury had been made available to

the banks during periods of “real or fancied need” and as a result they had become less

mindful of “indications of approaching emergency” Sprague (1909b).

       The Quarterly Journal article gave Sprague the opportunity to address some of

the lesser arguments for a central bank. Let me briefly consider three. (1) One of the

main complaints of the Populists was the seasonal in interest rates. Interest rates rose

in the fall of the year during the crop moving season. To the Populists it was a

conspiracy: Eastern bankers raised interest rates when the farmer needed to borrow. A

major assignment for the Federal Reserve was to eliminate this seasonal, a goal which

accomplished. Sprague (1909b, 387-8), however, thought that the seasonal had a

positive value because it “brings home to the banks the necessity of keeping their house

in order at all times.” In other words, he questioned one of the main reasons (from a

political point of view) for establishing the Federal Reserve.

       (2) As Sprague noted, the traditional theory of central banking, as developed by

Bagehot in Lombard Street (1873) held that the central bank should meet financial

panics by lending freely (to the market) at high rates. However, Bagehot was no longer


                                                9
the last word on central banking. Sprague believe that the British and American

experience showed that a central bank could increase stability by conserving the assets

of large banks that were in trouble, and whose failure might precipitate a financial panic.

Although Sprague did not feel that in practice a European style central bank was more

likely to be successful than a clearing house. I will consider this issue in more detail

below under the heading “bailouts.”

       (3) Finally, there is the problem of securing gold abroad during a financial panic.

As noted in the quote above Warburg thought that a major problem for the United

States requiring a central bank was “the absence of any means to negotiate for

measures of relief with other countries through a channel recognized by them as official”

(Warburg 1909, 345). In other words, a U.S. central bank would be able to negotiate

with foreign governments and central banks for a loan of gold during a threatened or

actual panic. Sprague’s answer was simply that the United States had never had any

trouble securing gold from abroad. In 1907 $100,000,000 million had come in.5

       What then was to be done? How could panics like the panic of 1907 be

prevented? There were, Sprague suggested, several ways forward. One was simply to

persuade the six largest New York banks, for practical purposes the holders of the bulk

of the usable U.S. gold reserve, to act in concert during financial crises as the lender of

last resort. As a result of their central position in the financial system, as a result of their

wealth and power, they had a social responsibility to act in the public interest during an

emergency. In this respect, Sprague’s purpose was the same as Bagehot’s in Lombard

Street (1924[1873]). Bagehot thought that the Bank of England had acted appropriately

episode.


                                                 10
in several past crises. But some leaders of the Bank of England still resisted the idea

that the Bank of England had a social responsibility to use its reserves during a financial

panic. Bagehot’s purpose was to persuade the Bank to acknowledge its responsibility to

act as lender of last resort; Sprague’s purpose was to persuade the six largest New

York banks to acknowledge their responsibilities and act as lender of last resort.

Sprague, however, does not acknowledge the huge collective action problem raised by

his policy that was not an issue for Bagehot, who had only to persuade one institution

that was highly dependent on special grants of power to act in the public interest.

       Sprague made a similar argument in a paper in the Commercial and Financial

Chronicle. This paper was then bundled with a paper by George Roberts, a banker, and

published as a pamphlet by the Bankers Publishing Company (Roberts and Sprague,

1910). The pamphlet presented a debate over the question of whether the United States

needed a national bank of issue, Roberts writing in the affirmative, and Sprague

against. Here Sprague argued that a bank of issue was dangerously inflationary, and

that combining the largest banks in New York, or persuading them to act in concert

would create as much central banking as the United States needed.

       But combining the New York banks or persuading them to act in concert for the

public good during an emergency were not the only ways forward. Sprague believed

that there were several ways of providing emergency liquidity. An alternative was to

provide for a temporary currency that banks could take out in an emergency in order to

meet extraordinary demands for cash. This proposal was embodied in the Federal

Reserve Act in order to handle an emergency that might occur before the Federal

Reserve could be set up, the Act called for an emergency currency that could be taken



                                            11
out by individual banks and used to meet over the counter withdrawals, what became

known as the Aldrich-Vreeland Currency.

       What about Canada? Would it be possible to solve the problem of banking

panics by allowing a system of nationwide branch banks to develop? Sprague did not

address the issue in his response to Warburg. But we know that he was not on board.

Sprague (1903b) had addressed the issue of branch banking. He did see many

advantages of branch banking, but did not number preventing panics among them. And

he saw some advantages in the local system of unit banks. In the end he compromised

the two visions and recommended branch banking at the state level.

         As noted above, two prominent academic economists, Horace White and

Joseph French Johnson (1909), discussed Warburg’s and Sprague’s papers.6 In

substance they were largely agreed. The chief problem of the American banking system

was its fragmented structure in which small independent local banks played a large role.

The experience in Canada was very different from the U.S. and very instructive. Here is

how White (1909, 372-3) put it

       “The wealth of Canada is much less than ours. Moreover, the wheat crop of
       Canada last year was in part frosted and under suspicion, while ours was sound.
       Yet Canadian bank credit was not shaken. The banks did not make runs on each
       other, therefore the public did not make runs on the banks. There are no country
       banks in Canada as we understand that term, only branches of thirty-five city
       banks, the heads of which are near enough to each other to secure unity of
       action.”

But adoption of a Canadian style system in the United States, White argued, was by

now politically impossible, the unit bankers were too powerful politically. European

countries, however, had also avoided the banking crisis (although not the commercial


6
 Horace White was a distinguished journalist and expert on banking. Joseph French Johnson was a
professor at NYU and an expert on banking, including the Canadian banking system.

                                                12
crisis) because central banks pumped liquidity into financial markets. Adoption of

European style central banking, White thought, was feasible politically if local banks

could be persuaded that a central bank would be in their interest, perhaps by making

local banks part owners of the central bank.

       Johnson reiterated White’s view. The problem was the fragmented structure of

the American banking system.7 But this was no longer capable of being remedied. A

central bank, evidently a second best solution from an economic point of view, might be

possible if local bankers could be convinced it was in their interest to support it.

       Neither of the discussants paid any attention to Sprague’s recommendations:

persuading the big New York banks to act as lender of last resort or providing an

emergency currency. Neglect of the first possibility is understandable. What Sprague

was suggesting was reasonable. But how could it be made to happen? What were the

incentives that would make the New York banks do the right thing? Praise from public?

What law would enforce compliance? Sprague’s first proposal was simply out of sync

with the spirit of the Progressive era: Reform meant new laws and government

sponsored institutions. What about Sprague’s second idea: an emergency currency?

After all, this idea was included in the Federal Reserve Act and did prove successful in

1914. Here my guess is that part of the problem was that Sprague simply did not

provide sufficient details for his colleagues to sink their teeth in. All that Sprague

(1909a, 369) said at the meetings was “An emergency currency would be of some

assistance.”


7
 Some states insisted on unit banks while others permitted some or statewide branching.
California, notably, permitted statewide branching. And there, A.P. Giannini, the founder of Bank
of America, had already begun his storied career. Branching across state lines by state or
national banks, however, was prohibited.

                                               13
3. The Lessons of History

Sprague’s History of Crises under the National Banking Act (1910d) was the capstone

for the studies written for the National Monetary Commission. There were many fine

studies that dealt with important topics that would be of interest to reformers of the

banking system: studies of British and French banking, a fine study of seasonal

fluctuations in interest rates by Edwin W. Kemmerer, and so on. But it was Sprague’s

book that dealt with the central questions: why did the U.S. have so many banking

crises and what could be done about it. His book was a masterpiece filled with

quantitative data, institutional details, and historical narrative. To this day monetary

historians mine Sprague for these details, but in the process they have often ignored the

underlying structure of his argument and the policy conclusions he drew. It is therefore

worth summarizing what this famous and frequently cited book actually said about the

causes of and possible cures for financial crises. 8



                                         Pooling Reserves

The basic structure of that argument is laid out in Table 1. The first thing to note is the

suspension of legal tender payments. In other words, the refusal of most banks in the

country to pay out legal tenders on demand in exchange for the bank’s notes or




8
 There have been many important additions to the literature on the banking panics of the National
Banking Era since Sprague wrote, but it is fair to say that Sprague remains fundamental. Elmus Wicker’s
Banking Panics of the Gilded Age (2000) comes closest to being the successor to Sprague. Wicker
accepts the conclusions that Sprague drew about the need for collective action by the New York Clearing
House in panics, but adds additional information on several issues including banking difficulties outside
New York, the quantitative record of bank suspensions, and the role of J.P. Morgan in the panic of 1907.

                                                   14
deposits.9 For Sprague, suspension was the ultimate disaster. Suspension demoralized

(a favorite Sprague word) markets and depressed economic activity. Workers could not

be paid and other transactions could not be completed. To be sure, suspensions were

complicated affairs. Sometimes individual banks continued to make payments, and

often exceptions were made for emergencies, for example so that factories could make

wage payments. Legal tender could often be obtained, albeit at a premium, in the

market place. Nevertheless, when suspensions were widespread the disaster was clear.

Recent econometric work by James and Weiman (2013) confirms the negative impact

of suspensions. Friedman and Schwartz (1963, 693-94), with the 1930s in mind,

famously argued that a suspension had positive long-run benefits: it cut short the

process of bank closures and contraction of the money supply and allowed healing to

begin. Suspension was like surgery, painful in the short-run, but beneficial, hopefully, in

the long-run. But Sprague did not see things that way. What Sprague took away from

history was, as shown it Table 1, is that suspensions, which occurred in 1857, 1873,

1893, and 1907 were associated with – and Sprague was sure, caused – severe

economic contractions, and that periods of banking distress in which suspension was

avoided, 1860, 1884, and 1890 were associated milder economic contractions. In other

words, suspensions were extremely bad news. How did Sprague know that

suspensions were independent events that magnified contractions, and not simply

symptoms of more intense contractions? Sprague did not consider the issue explicitly.

His conclusion seems to have been based on the timing of the intensification of the

9
  Nowadays financial historians often prefer the term “restriction” to “suspension.” Restriction may convey
a more accurate picture of the event to modern readers. Conversions of deposits into currency were
(often) not permitted, while other transactions were. But Sprague and his contemporaries, who I follow
here, used the term suspension.

contraction (it came after the suspension), on the common sense understanding of the

problems created by suspension (such as the inability to pay workers), and on the

seemingly arbitrary play of events that characterized the decisions to suspend.

        In most cases, suspension of legal tender payments meant suspension of gold

payments. The one exception is 1873. In 1873 the United States was still on the Civil

War greenback standard, so suspension meant banks were refusing to pay greenbacks

over the counter.10 In the 1930s there was no domestic suspension and Sprague

attributed the severity of the contraction to non-monetary forces. But Sprague was

adamantly opposed to the United States abandoning the traditional fixed price for gold,

an analogous problem – suspension, or partial suspension, of international gold

payments.

        Next consider the famous clearing house loan certificates. These were issued

during periods of financial distress when banks had trouble meeting obligations to other

banks in legal tender. They were having trouble because they were paying out, or

thought they soon might be paying out, legal tenders over the counter to depositors and

noteholders. The clearing house to which a group of banks belonged would then issue

certificates to its members in exchange for selected assets which they could use in lieu

of legal tenders to clear their obligations to other members of the clearinghouse. The

clearing house loan certificate is a fascinating example of private regulation of banking

and as a result has received considerable attention from banking historians including

Timberlake (1984), Gorton (1985), Gorton and Mullineaux (1987), Moen and Tallman

(2000, 2013), and Jacobson and Tallman (2013).

10
  The United States returned to the gold standard in 1879. The Populists with some legal justification
maintained that the United States was adopting the gold standard for the first time, and that the prewar
standard was bimetallic.

                                                    16
       Sprague thought that clearing house loan certificates were important and that

they were one half of the solution to the problem of suspensions during periods of

incipient panic or realized panic. They were only half the solution because they did not

solve the problem of having to pay out legal tenders over the counter. True, a bank that

had a deficit with other members of the clearing house could use the certificates to pay

its debts to other banks, thus retaining more legal tenders to pay out to its customers.

But a bank that had a surplus was in the opposite position. It needed legal tenders, it

was owed legal tenders, but it couldn’t get them. It was only getting clearing house loan

certificates.

       Why couldn’t a bank that was experiencing a run simply pay out clearing house

loan certificates over the counter? In a few cases in the South and West this was done.

The local clearing house issued small denomination loan certificates which its members

then paid out over the counter in lieu of gold. This solution, however, was never used,

on a large scale. As far as I am aware, it was never used in New York. The problem

was that what the public wanted was gold, greenbacks (because they were legal

tender), or national bank notes (because they were backed more than 100% by federal

government bonds) not a substitute. Sprague was opposed to the issue of small

denomination loan certificates to the public. He thought they were “demoralizing!”

       What could be done? The other half of the solution to the problem of banking

panics was “pooling” or “equalizing” reserves. This meant an agreement among the

banks that if one was running low on gold, the reserves of the other banks would be

used to supplement the reserves of the bank that was running short. Pooling reserves

reassured the public that their demands for gold would be met. In effect, once the



                                            17
agreement to pool reserves was reached the banks had turned themselves into a

central bank. It was not, to be sure, like a modern central bank that could simply print

legal tender, but it was analogous to a nineteenth century central bank that had a large

gold reserve that it could deploy in an emergency.

       What was the evidence that a combination of clearinghouse loan certificates and

pooling reserves would work? Here, interestingly, the best evidence was not from the

cases that were covered in the History of Crises under the National Banking System.

Sprague’s mandate from the National Monetary Commission was to cover the crises

under the National Banking Act, which was Civil War legislation. But as Sprague pointed

out in his History (1910d, 49) the best evidence that a combination of loan certificates

and pooling reserves would stop a panic was from the crisis of November 1860 which

was precipitated by the secession of the southern states after the election of Abraham

Lincoln. The use of the crucial combination of policies in 1860 was possible because the

banks were prepared. The panic occurred only three years after the panic of 1857, and

in the meantime plans had been laid – the banker George S. Coe was important here –

to deal with the next crisis.

       In both his argument as a whole and his use of 1860 Sprague was following his

Harvard mentor Charles F. Dunbar. Here is how the 1860 agreement among the New

York banks to pool reserves was described in the 1901 second edition of Dunbar’s

Chapters on the theory and history of banking which was edited by Sprague after

Dunbar’s death in 1900.11

       By this plan the banks agreed that, for the purpose of enabling them to expand
       their loans, the specie reserves held by them should be treated as a common

11
  The crisis of 1860 was also discussed in Dunbar (1904). The volume in which this essay appeared was
also edited by Sprague.

                                                 18
       fund and, if necessary, should be equalized among the banks by assessments
       laid upon the stronger for the benefit of the weaker; and that, for the purpose of
       settling balances between the banks, a committee should be appointed with the
       power to issue certificates of deposit to any bank placing with them adequate
       security in the shape of stocks, bonds, or bills receivable, and that these
       certificates should be received in payment by creditor banks (Dunbar and
       Sprague 1901, 81).

What was the effect of this agreement which was announced on November 21, 1860?

       The effect of this arrangement was instantaneous. The announcement that it had
       been made quieted the money-market and ended the panic. In the next week the
       banks increased their loans rapidly, and nearly the whole of the additional loans
       went to swell the mass of deposits, with only an inconsiderable loss of specie
       (Dunbar and Sprague 1901, 82-3).

       The 1860 crisis, however, was unusual. There was no speculative bubble before

the crisis. The economy had been doing well in the period leading up to Lincoln’s

election and the banks were in good shape (Dunbar 1904, Swanson 1908a). People

were not questioning the basic solvency of the banks, or at least not questioning that

the banks would have been solvent given normal political conditions. Rather, the

problem was that southerners were withdrawing specie from New York banks while

southern banks were refusing to honor sterling acceptances normally sold in New York.

This problem was faced by all of the New York banks, and there was no guarantee that

the weaker banks would be hit harder. This made securing the cooperation of all of the

New York banks easier than it normally was: Even the banks with strong balance sheets

had an incentive to join the coalition. Sometimes the rational policy for the strongest

individual is to flee and let devil take the hindmost; sometimes the rational policy is to

join with others and circle the wagons. This was one of the latter cases.

       This effect of this action, moreover, was to some degree confined to New York.

In the South, of course, the banks faced enormous challenges as Southern states



                                             19
withdrew from the union. But even in the north there were a variety of effects from

disunion. The Boston banks issued clearing house loan certificates on November 24,

but did not pool reserves, perhaps because they saw less danger of withdrawals. On

the other hand, banks in many cities closer to the South, and presumably with stronger

economic ties to the South, suspended. These included the banks of Pittsburgh with

one exception (New York Times, November 22, 1860, 4); Philadelphia (Swanson

1908b, 222; New York Times, November 23, 1860, 1); the District of Columbia (New

York Times, November 23, 1860, 1); Trenton (New York Times, November 24, 1860, 4);

and St. Louis also with one exception (New York Times, November 29, 1860, 5).

      Clearinghouse loan certificates and pooling of reserves were used again on April

21, 1861. Dunbar did not dwell on this episode, perhaps because it occurred at the start

of the Civil War: Fort Sumter was attacked on April 12. Again war news provided a

common threat that encouraged adoption of common action. Despite the special

circumstances in which the pooling agreements of 1860 and 1861 were attained,

Sprague (1910d, 49) saw these episodes as clear evidence that a combination of

clearing house loan certificates and pooling reserves could be used in peacetime to

prevent suspensions.

      The evidence from the crises that fell within Sprague’s mandate told against

pooling. In 1873 clearing house loan certificates and pooling of reserves were used, but

there was still a suspension of legal tender payments and the economic contraction that

followed was severe. Why didn’t loan certificates plus pooling work? Here again

Sprague’s argument was adumbrated in Dunbar and Sprague (1901, 84-86). There

were, Dunbar and Sprague suggested, two factors that explained the failure of the 1860



                                           20
formula. One was that insolvency was an issue in 1873. The country was awakening

from an “intoxicating speculation.” Perhaps nothing could have prevented a panic and

suspension.

       A second factor that Dunbar and Sprague thought might explain the failure of

pooling was that the banks were a bit slow in adopting pooling. The failures started on

September 8th, the panic started on the 18th, but it was not until evening of Saturday the

20th that the banks acted and pooled reserves. However, this did not end the crisis: on

September 24, the New York banks suspended specie payments. Granted, it would

have been better if the New York banks had announced an agreement to pool reserves

between the 8th and the 18th. But to demand that a group of separate banks with very

different balance sheets and without the clear signal of a national threat reach a

cooperative agreement in less than 10 days would appear to be asking a lot. And there

is no guarantee that reaching an agreement earlier would have prevented the

suspension.

       Sprague (1910d, 54) thought that suspension when it happened was “amply

justified” by the low level reached by reserves when pooling was finally adopted. This is,

of course, a matter of judgment. Elmus Wicker (2013), after looking at the reserves of

the New York banks, rejected Sprague’s contention that the suspension was justified.

Sprague noted, however, that the suspension was not carried as far as in subsequent

suspensions, perhaps because reserves had been pooled. Many depositor requests

were honored. Indeed, Sprague (1910d, 55) claims that in 1873 “money continued to be

paid out by the banks – indeed almost as freely as before.” Nevertheless, the bottom

line was that the loan-certificate-and-pooling policy had failed to prevent a panic and at



                                            21
least a partial restriction of payments. Sprague nevertheless praised the action of the

New York Banks in his History.

       During the continuance of the arrangement the banks were converted, to all
       intents and purposes, into a central bank, which, although without the power to
       issue notes, was in other respects more powerful than a European central bank,
       because it included virtually all the banking power of the city (Sprague 1910d,
       90).

       And that was it: pooling was not used in subsequent crises, although half of the

solution, the issue of clearing house loan certificates was used. Two successes in an

unusual political situation and one failure (or partial failure) in more typical

circumstances seems a weak basis for drawing conclusions. Nevertheless, Sprague

was convinced that pooling reserves was crucial to preventing suspensions. In

reviewing the events of 1907, for example, Sprague argued, based mainly on the large

reserves then available in New York, that the 1907 suspension could have been

prevented.

       Recalling the course of events in 1873 [when pooling was used], it cannot be
       questioned for a moment that suspension would not have occurred had similar
       action been taken in 1907, nor would agreement by all the clearing-house
       members have been necessary. The six large banks acting in concert could
       have sustained the local situation by making loans and at the same time could
       have supplied the demands of outside banks for money (Sprague 1910d, 273).



                                           Bailouts

       Presumably reserves should be pooled so that banks that were rich in reserves

could help banks that were running short. But what if the bank that was running short of

reserves was insolvent? What if it was a very large bank with a superior reputation, so

that its failure was bound to start or deepen a panic? Sprague never answered these

questions in general terms. But it would appear from the cases that he examined that he


                                              22
thought that panics could be ameliorated by dispensing aid to specific firms, although

the presumption would be that these firms would be illiquid rather than insolvent. As

noted above, Sprague thought that the guarantee of the liabilities of the Barings in 1890

by a consortium organized by the Bank of England had marked a new departure in

central bank responses to financial crises.

More recently still another method of relief has been adopted in practice, if not in theory.
Central banks have at times taken the lead, as in the Baring instance, in arrangements
for the conservation of the assets of large banks which are not hopelessly insolvent, and
by preventing sudden liquidation have confined the disturbance within narrow limits
(Sprague 1909b, p. 401).

And as noted above, Sprague thought that the Clearing House associations could

manage this as well as a central bank. It should be added that the determination of the

long-run solvency of a bank could be a difficult judgment to make in the middle of a

panic. Clearly, we don’t want to aid a bank that was “hopelessly insolvent.” But this is a

formulation which suggests a grey area. A bank might be worth aiding if it was in deep

trouble.

       Sprague, however, did not think that the ability to engage in this sort of deal

making required a central bank.

        In this matter the central bank has no very marked advantage over the clearing-
        house organization in American cities. The machinery for united action will hardly
        be set in motion in the absence of some person of commanding influence in
        whom the business community has confidence (Sprague 1909b, 401).
I take this to mean that the leadership in 1890 in London came from the Bank of

England, but that it might as easily come from some other quarter, say the president of

a clearing house bank, or as I 1907, J.P. Morgan.

       Sprague’s positive American case for bank-specific aid was 1884 when the New

York Clearing House aided the Metropolitan National Bank. The Metropolitan, a large

                                              23
New York bank, had suspended on Wednesday, May 14, 1884. The run was caused by

the sudden fear that the bank’s president, who was known to be a player on the stock

exchange, had borrowed heavily from the bank or that the bank had loaned money to

his favorites. Later, the Comptroller of the Currency was unwilling to write that evidence

had been found to support the rumor, although the bank was under a regulatory cloud

when the run began and had been prevented from issuing dividends when it suspended

(Sprague 1910d, 348-9).12 The New York Clearing House sent a team to inspect the

books of the Metropolitan, and decided that helping it was justified, partly because the

Metropolitan was a large holder of interbank deposits and that its continued suspension

might endanger the entire payments system. Clearing house loan certificates were

issued, and the Metropolitan was able to resume the next day. Almost 30 percent of the

$24.9 million in clearing house certificates taken out during the crisis were issued to the

Metropolitan. Many of the other certificates were taken as a precautionary measure and

not used. By July 1, 1884 all of the certificates were cancelled with the exception of

some issued to the Metropolitan. Eventually, the bank went into voluntary liquidation.

Sprague believed that the issue of clearing house loan certificates, especially to the

Metropolitan, had been “immediate and effective” in ending the panic and minimizing

the damage (Sprague 1910d, 113).

        Sprague’s negative example was the run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company in

1907, the precipitant of the crisis of 1907. As in the case of the Metropolitan in 1884 the

run seems to have started with the rumor that the president of the Knickerbocker was

involved in Wall Street speculations that had gone bad. On Monday, October 21 the

  This is from an extract from the Comptroller of the Currency’s report on the crisis included in Sprague
(1910d).

                                                    24
National Bank of Commerce announced that it would no longer clear for the

Knickerbocker. An unofficial committee representing banks and trust companies led by

Benjamin Strong visited the Knickerbocker that evening, but no aid was forthcoming,

and the next day a run forced the Knickerbocker to suspend. Sprague (1910d, 252)

thought that if assistance was possible (if the Knickerbocker was not too far gone) and

was provided that it was certain that “it would have been of advantage both to the banks

and the other trust companies.” Assistance was prevented, however, by the size of the

bank – it would have been “an undertaking of no little difficulty” – by the lack of

organization of the trust companies, and by the strained relations between the banks

and the trust companies (Sprague 1908; 1910d, 251). Subsequently, aid was arranged

with the help of J.P. Morgan for the Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust

Company when they experienced similar devastating runs. But in Sprague’s judgment,

this aid, although important in ending the crisis, had come too late to calm fears and

prevent the breakdown of the payments mechanism. Thus, Sprague’s conclusion was

that aid to large institutions, today we might say systemically important institutions, was

justified even if there were some questions about the ultimate soundness of the

institution.



                                     The Bottom Line

       The central argument of Sprague’s great book was that no fundamental changes

in the banking institutions of the United States were needed to solve the problem of

panics and suspensions. All that was necessary was that during incipient panics or at

least at the start of a panic the large New York banks acted in concert in the public



                                             25
interest. They had done so on some occasions, but failed on others. In effect Sprague

had cast himself as the American Bagehot. Just as Bagehot had set himself the task of

persuading the Bank of England, a private bank, to act in the public interest during

emergencies, Sprague had set himself the task of persuading the large New York banks

to do likewise.

        In the conclusion of the book, however, Sprague acknowledged that there were

alternatives. There had to be a liquid reserve in New York, but there might be several

ways of tapping it. He concluded somewhat vaguely as follows.

        Provision for such a reserve power may doubtless be made in a number of
        different ways. This investigation will have served its purpose if in showing the
        causes and consequences of its absence in the past it brings home to the reader
        the need not only for this reserve power, but also of the readiness to use it in
        future emergencies (Sprague 1910d, 320)


4. Sprague offers Plan B

Sprague adapted quickly to the changing political realities after the Panic of 1907,

including what he recognized as a surprising degree of support for a central bank.13 In a

series of papers published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics Sprague (1909b,

1910a, 1910b, and 1910c) was specific about what could be done in the way of

improving the banking system and offered his plan for a central bank.14 (1) National

banks could be allowed to start savings departments that would invest in mortgages and

issue time deposits to minimize the danger of runs. (2) The Comptroller of the Currency


13
  White (1983) traces the growing support in the business community for a European style central bank.
Livingston (1986) reaches similar conclusions. In 1909 a survey reported by the Banking Law Journal
showed that 60% of U.S. bankers favored a central bank (Livingston 1986, 174, ftn. 26).
14
  These papers were collected in a book (Sprague 1911c). Only minor changes were made; the main
one being that Sprague now stressed that his opposition to a central bank was specifically to a European
style central bank that would influence the economy through its lending operations and discount policy.

                                                   26
could be allowed to suspend the reserve requirements of the national banks, much as

the British Bank Act could be suspended in an emergency to make more reserves

available. (3) The national banks could shift from a bond based currency to an asset

based currency. (4) A central bank would be a useful addition to the financial system if it

could be structured so that its main function was to provide gold in emergencies.

       The last point, of course, was a major concession for someone who had until

quite recently opposed a central bank. Although Sprague was now willing to

countenance a central bank he was still extremely skeptical about the wisdom of what

he repeatedly identified as a European style central bank. Commercial banks, he still

believed, were more likely to take excessive risks if there was a central bank on the

scene, and this would especially be true in the United States with its myriad of small

banks that in the aggregate exercised considerable political clout. He also thought that

relying on the discount rate as a tool of monetary policy would be far more difficult in the

United States than for example in England. Foreign rates were less closely tied to

domestic rates in the United States, and a rate that might be appropriate in New York

which was dealing with Europe would be inappropriate for the nation as a whole. The

large interregional differences in rates within the United States posed a related problem.

The central bank lending rate appropriate for one region would be inappropriate for

another. But political pressures would push the central bank toward a common rate.

       The central bank that Sprague proposed, therefore, would not normally be in the

market lending to commercial banks. Rather, it would be mainly a government

sponsored replacement for the clearing houses. Banks would deposit funds in

Sprague’s central bank and then clear with each other by making transfers on the books



                                            27
of the central bank. In emergencies banks could draw down their deposits, and would

not have to worry about a cutoff of gold payments, as had happened during the National

Banking Era. Thus, Sprague’s central bank would provide for the pooling of reserves in

emergencies that Sprague thought was crucial to preventing or stopping panics, but

which the New York Clearing House had repeatedly failed to do. The willingness of the

central bank to meet all legal demands would in itself, Sprague thought, reduce the risk

of a panic. Conceivably, of course, alarm might develop if the reserve of the central

bank appeared to be falling to a dangerously low level. This was, after all, the gold

standard and even central banks did not have unlimited firepower.

       While in normal times Sprague’s bank would not be lending to banks, in

emergencies, Sprague’s bank would make advances to banks “whose reserves had

been depleted” (Sprague 1910c, 79). This would help to calm panics. Since the lending

would be restricted to banks that were at the end of their tether, there was no room here

for lending that would support growth of the money supply. Monetary policy would be

left to the gold standard.

       A look at the initial balance sheet Sprague constructed for his bank will further

clarify his proposal.

Commercial banks would make deposits of ($75 million) in the central bank so that they

could use it to settle interbank deficits, replacing the clearing houses. Gold certificates

and U.S. notes (greenbacks) would be retired and replaced by notes issued by

Sprague’s bank ($316). Sprague’s bank would also serve as the U.S. Treasury’s bank

($160) replacing the Independent Treasury and its network of commercial banks.

However, there are no loans to banks on the books of Sprague’s bank: Sprague’s bank

would not normally be in the business of making loans to commercial banks, a power

that he thought would produce much inflationary mischief. The bank would not,

therefore, be in a position of trying to regulate the economy through changes in its

discount rate. Some loans to banks might show up on the balance sheet, but only in

emergencies, and only temporarily. The bank would be in a position, however, to pay

gold to banks that needed it to meet withdrawals in emergencies. Thus, Sprague’s bank



                                             29
would provide the pooling of reserves that Sprague thought would cure panics if only

the New York banks could be persuaded to do it.



5. The Crisis of 1914

The crisis of 1914 provided a test for the emergency currency that had been included in

the Federal Reserve Act and had been advocated earlier by Sprague. The Aldrich-

Vreeland Act passed on May 30, 1908 provided, as a stop gap measure, for an

emergency currency. This provision was initially scheduled to expire on June 30, 1914,

but the expiration date was extended, fortunately as it turned out, to provide protection

for the banking system until the new Federal Reserve System was in operation. The

emergency currency provision was complicated. The basic idea was that ten or more

national banks could form a National Currency Association to issue members of the

Association a currency that they could pay to note holders and depositors in lieu of legal

tender. To receive the notes the banks had to deposit commercial paper or approved

state and local securities. The amount of notes that could be taken out was a fraction of

the assets deposited, the fraction varying with the class of asset. In order to encourage

retirement of the notes after the emergency, the banks were subject to additional taxes

based on the amount of currency outstanding. The Aldrich-Vreeland notes were similar

to national bank notes. They were not necessarily backed by federal government bonds

as the national bank notes were, but on the other hand, they were issued by a group of

banks rather than one individual bank.

      The outbreak of World War I led in short order to the deployment of the Aldrich-

Vreeland Currency. Perhaps the biggest immediate problem created by the outbreak of


                                            30
the war was the sale of securities on the stock exchange as foreign and perhaps

domestic holders of securities tried to turn stocks into gold. The stock market was

closed, as it had been in 1873, although as it turned out for three months rather than 10

days as in 1873.15

       They were put into circulation as soon as the threat of runs on the banks

developed. At their maximum $364 million were in circulation which was nearly one-

quarter of the currency in the hands of the public before the outbreak of the war

(Friedman and Schwartz 1963, 172).

       Sprague was pleased with the result.

       Thanks to the emergency notes, the banks were able to maintain payments
       without difficulty, both over the counter and between themselves. All requirements
       for currency for use outside the banks were met with the new notes, thus
       safeguarding the reserves of the banks. The notes also were a positive means of
       increasing reserves. Gold, gold certificates and other lawful money received
       by the banks over the counter in the ordinary course of business were retained,
       while counter payments were regularly made in the new notes, which proved in
       every way quite as acceptable, indeed, in one respect more so, since they were
       all new currency (Sprague 1915, 519).

Indeed, Sprague thought that things had gone better than in previous crises because

bank lending was not adversely affected by the crisis to the same degree that it had

been in earlier crises.

       In some ways the situation in August 1914 was analogous to November 1860

when the election of Lincoln and the secession of the Southern states threatened the

stability of the gold backed monetary system. Lincoln was elected on November 6,

1860. On November 10 the South Carolina legislature authorized a special convention

to discuss secession. On November 21, two weeks after the election, bankers in New

emergency currency.

                                                   31
York authorized the pooling of reserves. The same rapid response can be seen in

1914. On the 28th of June 1914 Archduke Ferdinand was murdered in Sarajevo. On

July 28th Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Just four days later Secretary of the

Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo declared an emergency and invited banks to apply for

emergency currency. On August 4th Congress passed a bill making it easier for the

large New York banks to qualify for emergency currency. In both 1860 and 1914 there

were clear threats to the system as a whole, there were patriotic motives for

cooperating, and in neither case was it was clear that the withdrawals would be focused

on the weaker banks. These were all factors favoring collective action. It is far from

clear that collective action could have been achieved under the circumstances that

accompanied normal peacetime financial crises. This is especially true when one thinks

about the 1930s when the banking crisis started with small unit banks in rural areas.

Even the larger failures in the 1930s that are usually considered the precipitants,

Caldwell and company and the Bank of United States, were outside the circle of large

New York banks to which Sprague normally looked for definitive action. And there were

questions about their ultimate solvency that raised further obstacles to collective action.

      The Federal Reserve was not fully in operation when the crisis of 1914 hit.

Sprague thought this a good thing. If the Federal Reserve had made mistakes, as might

well be expected from a new institution, confidence in it would have been undermined.

After the crisis, however, the Federal Reserve encouraged the banks to cooperate to

supply additional loans to cotton growers and Sprague saw this as a harbinger of the

good things that might be expected of the Federal Reserve in the future (Sprague 1915,

532-3).



                                            32
       Although Sprague saw the use of Aldrich-Vreeland currency as successful in

1914, it did not lead him to renew his opposition to a central bank. Sprague had moved

on, accepted the Federal Reserve as an established feature of the institutional

landscape, and begun to see its positive side. In an early review of the Aldrich plan

Sprague (1911a) did not question the wisdom of establishing a central bank, he merely

suggested a number of changes in the law that it would make it more acceptable to

western, southern and small bank interests, and hence increase its chance of adoption.

       At the annual meetings of the American Economic Association in 1912 Edwin

Kemmerer (1913) presented a plan for improving on the Aldrich plan, and a number of

economists including Sprague were asked to comment on Kemmerer’s paper

(Hollander, et. al. 1913). On this occasion Sprague simply suggested a way of tying the

new institution’s hands: Loans should be limited to 25 percent of reserves (Sprague

1913, 70). In that way, the inflationary dangers that Sprague foresaw could be avoided.

If the total amount of bank loans was increased too much the result would be a disaster

because business would begin to rely on short-term loans in circumstances when long-

term investments were required. Under Sprague’s 25 percent rule the Federal Reserve

would become the emergency reserve that Sprague had pushed for earlier. But it was

clear that Sprague was adapting to a fait accompli.



6. Conclusions

One might guess that O.M.W. Sprague, America’s leading academic expert on financial

panics during the Progressive era had been an early and strong advocate of a central

bank. After all, at least in the usual telling the Federal Reserve followed inevitably from


                                             33
the findings of the National Monetary Commission. One might suppose that the expert

who “wrote the book” on financial panics for the Commission would have been on

board. This, however, was not the case. Sprague, in fact, was initially opposed to

establishing a central bank, and thought that more limited reforms would have solved

the problem of banking panics. His opposition, as explained in detail above, rested on a

number of considerations. Most important was his concern that creating a central bank

would be inflationary. Speculative periods leading up to financial panics, Sprague

worried, would be reinforced rather than weakened by a central bank. This might not be

true for central banks in Europe, such as the Bank of England, or the Reichsbank, but it

would be true in the United States because of the unique political economy of American

banking. When commercial banks wanted more credit from the central bank, most likely

during an economic boom, they could bring political pressure to bear on the central

bank to provide it.

       What then could be done to stop the run of banking panics in the United States?

The central argument of his History of Crises under the National Banking system

(1910d) was that the key to stopping suspensions of specie payments, and thus

preventing severe recessions, was to persuade the large New York banks to act in

concert as a lender of last resort during the periods of apprehension (to use Bagehot’s

term) that preceded panics. This argument seems, at least to me, to be less than

compelling. The evidential base was slim. Sprague had only three examples of the New

York banks pooling reserves and acting as a central bank during incipient panics. His

best examples, 1860 and 1861 were outside the period that he examined intensively,

and in any case were the product of unusual political circumstances. The other example



                                           34
of pooling, 1873, is unclear at best. The banks did suspend in 1873. In all the crises

after 1873 the banks issued clearing house loan certificates, but failed to pool reserves,

the latter being, according to Sprague, half the solution banking panics. Thus, Sprague

cast himself as the American Bagehot. Lombard Street was dedicated to persuading the

Bank of England to assume the role of lender of last resort. And Bagehot appears to

have had some success. After the repeated failures of the New York banks to act

collectively for the common good, however, it is hard to believe that strong words from

academic economists could have changed the behavior of the six largest New York

banks during panics.

       Sprague was on sounder ground, I believe, when he endorsed the idea of

“reserve power” in the central money market as the key to preventing suspensions.

Indeed, it would appear that the Aldrich-Vreeland currency, which Sprague (1915)

thought had worked well, was precisely the sort of reserve power that he had been

calling for. Again, the evidence is limited to one example, and one in unusual political

circumstances, analogous to 1860. But there does seem to be a consensus that the

Aldrich-Vreeland currency had worked well. Dodge (1922), Friedman and Schwartz

(1963, 171-3), Wicker (2005, 47-49), Silber (2007a; 2007b, 66-85), and Jacobson and

Tallman (2013) all agree with Sprague on the effectiveness of the Aldrich-Vreeland

currency.16 Indeed, Friedman and Schwartz (1963, 172) argued that the use of the

Aldrich-Vreeland currency in 1930-33 would have produced better results than were

produced in fact by the Federal Reserve, although they acknowledged that there were

actions that the Federal Reserve could have taken that would have produced a still

                                                  35
better outcome. But whether the Aldrich-Vreeland currency, even if it had been

available, would have been deployed in a timely fashion in the circumstances of the

Great Depression which differed so much from the circumstances of 1914, is an open

question.

      Sprague’s views on the Depression are a matter for another paper. One episode,

however, is worth recalling here. In 1933 he resigned his position as special advisor to

the U.S. Treasury in opposition to Roosevelt’s gold policy. Sprague was a thorough

going supporter of the international gold standard and thought Roosevelt’s policy of

manipulating the price of gold was a disaster. In this respect Sprague’s position was at

one with his earlier studies. International suspension of payments, or partial suspension,

was analogous to the domestic suspensions that had long absorbed him. Sprague lived

into the postwar era, but by the time of his death had ceased to comment on monetary

affairs. What he would have made of the world of fiat money that emerged after World

War II is anyone’s guess.
