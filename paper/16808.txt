                                             ABSTRACT

Firms face uncertain financing conditions and are exposed to the risk of a sudden rise in financing
costs during financial crises. We develop a tractable model of dynamic corporate financial management
(cash accumulation, investment, equity issuance, risk management, and payout policies) for a financially
constrained firm facing time-varying external financing costs. Firms value financial slack and build
cash reserves to mitigate financial constraints. However, uncertainty about future financing opportunities
also induce firms to rationally time the equity market, even if they have no immediate needs for cash.
The stochastic financing conditions have rich implications for investment and risk management: (1)
investment can be decreasing in financial slack; (2) firms may invest less as expected future financing
costs fall; (3) investment-cash sensitivity, marginal value of cash, and firm's risk premium can all be
non-monotonic in cash holdings; (4) speculation (as opposed to hedging) can be value-maximizing
for financially constrained firms.

1     Introduction

The financial crisis of 2008 is a fresh reminder of the substantial uncertainties about financing
conditions that corporations face at times, as well as the impact that market shutdowns can
have on the economy. Recent studies have documented dramatic changes in firms’ financing
and investment behaviors during the crisis. For example, Ivashina and Scharfstein (2009)
document aggressive credit line drawdowns by firms for precautionary reasons. Campello,
Graham, and Harvey (2009) and Campello, Giambona, Graham, and Harvey (2010) show
that the financially constrained firms planned deeper cuts in investment, spending, burned
more cash, drew more credit from banks, and also engaged in more asset sales in the crisis.

    Intuitively it is quite sensible that firms should try to adapt to the fluctuations in financ-
ing conditions, including timing favorable market conditions and hedging against unfavorable
market conditions. However, there is little existing theoretical work that tries to answer the
following questions: How should firms change their financing, investment, and risk manage-
ment policies during a period of severe financial constraints? And how should firms behave
when facing the threat of financial crisis in the future?

    In this paper we address the above questions by proposing a dynamic model of invest-
ment, financing, and risk management for firms facing stochastic financing conditions. Our
model combines the corporate precautionary cash saving motive due to financial constraints,
developed in Bolton, Chen, and Wang (2010) (henceforth BCW), with the market timing
motives that endogenously arise due to stochastic financing opportunities. The four main
building blocks of the model are: 1) a long-run constant-returns-to-scale production function
with independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) productivity shocks, convex invest-
ment adjustment costs, and a constant capital depreciation rate (as in Hayashi (1982));
2) stochastic external equity financing costs; 3) constant cash carry costs; and 4) dynamic
hedging opportunities. We purposely hold the investment opportunities constant in order to
highlight the role of time-varying financing conditions.

    We analyze how a firm simultaneously adjusts its cash reserves, investment, hedging,



                                                1
financing, and payout decisions in two settings. In one case, the firm is in the midst of a
financial crisis trying to survive so as to preserve the firm’s going-concern value. In a second
case, we consider a firm currently facing relatively favorable financing conditions, but is
anticipating a potential financial crisis that will freeze up financial markets.

      The main results of our model are as follows. First, during a period of high external
financing costs (e.g., a financial crisis), the firm cuts investment and delays payout aggres-
sively in order to survive the crisis.1 While in general, the sooner the crisis is expected to end,
the less valuable cash can be to mitigate financial constraints, we show that the opposite can
be true when cash holding is low. The intuition for this seemingly counter-intuitive result is
as follows. With low cash holding, the firm is facing an immediate liquidation threat. When
the crisis is expected to end soon, the “breathing room” provided by an extra dollar of cash
becomes especially valuable. This effect can cause the marginal value of cash to rise as the
expected duration of the crisis gets shorter. It can also cause firms with low cash holdings to
underinvest more aggressively while its expected future financing costs are falling, whereas
firms with relatively high cash holdings will invest more at the same time. Another interest-
ing finding in the crisis state is that the firm’s payout boundary is first increasing and then
decreasing in the probability of exiting the crisis.

      Second, we show that it may be optimal for firms to time equity markets. When there
is a significant chance that financing conditions will deteriorate dramatically, the firm will
optimally time the market by issuing new equity before it runs out of cash. Otherwise,
the window of opportunity for cheap equity funding may vanish. The timing results are
consistent with the findings in Baker and Wurgler (2002), DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Stulz
(2009), Fama and French (2005), and Huang and Ritter (2009).

      Moreover, we show that market timing together with fixed costs of external financing
can give rise to convexity of firm value for low levels of cash holdings in states with good
financing opportunities. The convexity result has several important implications. It implies
that investment can be decreasing in cash holding simply due to the market timing option.
  1
      See the empirical evidence cited in the opening paragraph.



                                                      2
This prediction is opposite to most models of investment with financial constraints. It also
implies that the risk premium of a financially constrained firm might not necessarily decrease
with its cash holding as often perceived. Finally, it implies that speculation instead of risk
management can sometimes be value-maximizing for a financially constrained firm.

      Our third result is that the firm’s risk premium can be decomposed into two parts: a
technology risk premium and a financing risk premium. Both components are sensitive to
changes in the firm’s cash holding, especially in the state of poor financing conditions, where
the conditional risk premium ranges from 2% to 30% depending on the firm’s cash holding.
Moreover, while the technology risk premium generally decreases with cash holding, the
market timing effect can make it increase with cash due to the convexity of firm value in
cash.

      Fourth, as the expected duration of the state with favorable financing conditions shortens,
the firm issues equity sooner in that state because the window of opportunity is smaller,
and the firm optimally delays cash payouts to shareholders more. Overall, the firm’s cash
inventory rises in anticipation of a significant worsening of equity financing opportunities.
These results confirm the conjecture of Bates, Kahle, and Stulz (2009), who find that the
average cash-to-asset ratio of US firms has nearly doubled in the past quarter century, and
who attribute this rise in cash holdings to firms’ perceived increase in risk. These results
also help explain the investment and financing policies of many US non-financial firms in the
years prior to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, to the extent that these firms had anticipated
a potential worsening of financing conditions.

      Our results highlight the sophisticated dynamic interactions between firm savings and
investment. Typically, we expect that higher cash holdings or lower expected future financing
costs will relax a firm’s financial constraint. Hence, investment should increase with cash
(and other financial slack measures such as credit) and decrease with expected financing
costs. This is generally true and holds in dynamic corporate finance models and also optimal
dynamic contracting models in the absence of stochastic financing conditions.2 However, we
  2
      See DeMarzo, Fishman, He, and Wang (2010) for an example.



                                                  3
show that with stochastic financing opportunities, investment is no longer monotonically
increasing in cash, nor is it monotonically decreasing with expected financing costs. The key
to these relations lies in the optionality of market timing and the dynamic behavior of the
marginal value of cash.

      Our result also shows that first-generation static models on financial constraints and
corporate investment3 are inadequate to explain corporate investment policy based on simple
comparative statics analysis. In particular, static models are unsuited to explain the effects
of market timing on corporate investment, since these effects do not simply operate through a
change in the cost of external equity financing or a change in the firm’s cash holdings. Rather,
market timing matters when there is a finitely-lived window of opportunity for cheap equity
financing. Moreover, market timing interacts in a complex way with the firm’s precautionary
cash management: when cash is tight and dwindling it induces an acceleration in capital
expenditure, while when cash is abundant it induces a deceleration of investment in response
to a local reduction in cash holdings.

      By construction, the productivity shocks in our model are i.i.d. Thus, firms that time
equity markets in our model are also ones with low cash holdings (as opposed to having
better investment opportunities). This is consistent with the empirical findings of DeAn-
gelo, DeAngelo and Stulz (2009) that most firms who issue stock look as if they are cash
constrained. Therefore, one cannot reject the market timing hypothesis based on this finding
alone. Certainly, firms may issue equity in good times to finance investment opportunities,
but our model shows that firms issuing equity when cash holdings are low can be consistent
with a rational market timing explanation. Testing of our market timing hypothesis would
ideally look for firm behavior not only in equity issuance, but also in investment and hedging
decisions. For cash-strapped firms, corporate investment may increase, and speculation may
arise as the firm’s cash dwindles and gets closer to the issuance boundary to replenish its
cash holding.

      To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first dynamic model of corporate
  3

investment with stochastic financing conditions. We echo the view expressed in Baker (2010)
that supply effects may be significant for corporate finance. While we treat changes in
financing conditions as exogenous in this paper, the cause could be time variations in the
frictions of financial intermediation, investors’ risk aversion, or aggregate uncertainty and
information asymmetry. Earlier theoretical work on investment with financial constraints
mostly focus on the demand side, i.e., the firm’s optimizing behavior taking the financing
conditions as constant and time invariant. See Kaplan and Zingales (1997), Gomes (2001),
Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004), Hennessy and Whited (2005, 2007), Gamba and
Triantis (2008), Riddick and Whited (2009), Bolton, Chen, and Wang (2010), among others.



2     The Model

We build on BCW by introducing stochastic investment and external financing conditions
into a firm’s dynamic investment, financing, cash management, and hedging problem. Specif-
ically, we assume that the firm can be in one of two states, denoted by st = 1, 2. In each
state, the firm faces different financing and investment opportunities. The state switches
from 1 to 2 (or from 2 to 1) over a short time interval ∆ with a constant probability ζ 1 ∆
(or ζ 2 ∆). For an analysis with a more general setup, see the appendix.


2.1    Production technology

The firm employs capital as the factor of production and the price of capital is normalized
to one. We denote by K and I respectively the firm’s capital stock and gross investment.
As is standard in capital accumulation models, the capital stock K evolves according to:


                                 dKt = (It − δKt ) dt,   t ≥ 0,                              (1)


where δ ≥ 0 is the rate of depreciation.

    The firm’s operating revenue at time t is proportional to its capital stock Kt , and is given


                                                5
by Kt dAt , where dAt is the firm’s productivity shock over time increment dt. We assume
that
                                     dAt = µ (st ) dt + σ (st ) dZtA ,                                  (2)

where ZtA is a standard Brownian motion and µ(st ) and σ(st ) denote the expected return on
capital and its volatility in state st . The firm’s incremental operating profit dYt over time
increment dt is then given by:


                           dYt = Kt dAt − It dt − Γ(It , Kt , st )dt, t ≥ 0,                            (3)


where It dt is the investment over time dt and Γ(It , Kt , st )dt is the additional adjustment cost
that the firm incurs in the investment process. Note that we allow the adjustment costs to
be state dependent. Following the neoclassical investment literature (Hayashi (1982)), we
assume that the firm’s adjustment cost is homogeneous of degree one in I and K. In other
words, the adjustment cost takes the homogeneous form Γ(I, K, s) = gs (i)K, where i is the
firm’s investment capital ratio (i = I/K), and gs (i) is a state-dependent function that is
increasing and convex in i.4 Our analysis does not depend on the specific functional form of
gs (i) and to simplify the analysis we assume that gs (i) is quadratic:

                                                     θ s (i − ν s )2
                                          gs (i) =                   ,                                  (4)
                                                            2

where θs is the adjustment cost parameter and ν s is a constant parameter.5

    The firm can liquidate its assets at any time. The liquidation value Lt is proportional to
the firm’s capital at time t, but the liquidation value per unit of capital can change with the
state st , that is, Lt = ls Kt , where ls is the recovery value per unit of capital in state s.
   4
     For notational convenience we use the notation xs to denote a state dependent variable x(s) whenever
there is no ambiguity.
   5
     In the literature, common choices of ν s are either zero or the rate of deprecation δ. While the former
choice implies zero adjustment cost for zero gross investment, the latter choice implies a zero adjustment
cost when net investment is zero.




                                                      6
2.2       Stochastic Financing Opportunities

Neoclassical investment models (Hayashi (1982)) assume that the firm faces frictionless cap-
ital markets and that the Modigliani and Miller theorem holds. However, in reality, firms
face important financing frictions for incentive, information asymmetry, and transaction cost
reasons.6 Our model incorporates a number of financing costs that firms face in practice and
that empirical research has identified, while retaining an analytically tractable setting.

      The firm may choose to use external financing at any point in time. For simplicity, we
only consider external equity financing as the source of external funds for the firm. We leave
the generalization of allowing the firm to also issue debt for future research. The firm incurs
a fixed and a variable cost of issuing external equity. The fixed cost is given by φs K, where
φs is the fixed cost parameter in state s. As in BCW we take the fixed cost to be proportional
to the firm’s capital stock K. This assumption ensures that the firm does not grow out of its
fixed issuing costs. It is also analytically convenient, as it preserves the homogeneity of the
model in the firm’s capital stock K. The firm also incurs a (state dependent) proportional
issuance cost γ s for each unit of external funds it raises. That is, after paying the fixed cost
φs K, the firm pays γ s > 0 in state s for each incremental dollar it raises.

      We denote by:

  1. H the process for the firm’s cumulative external financing (so that dHt is the incre-
        mental external financing over time dt);

  2. X the firm’s cumulative issuance costs;

  3. W the process for the firm’s cash stock;

  4. U the firm’s cumulative non-decreasing payout process to shareholders (so that dUt is
        the incremental payout over time dt).

      Distributing cash to shareholders may take the form of a special dividend or a share
  6
      See Jensen and Meckling (1976), Leland and Pyle (1977), and Myers and Majluf (1984), for example.



                                                    7
repurchase.7 The benefit of a payout is that shareholders can invest the proceeds at the
market rate of return and avoid paying a carry cost on the firm’s retained cash holdings. We
denote the unit cost of carrying cash inside the firm per unit of time by λ ≥ 0.8

       If the firm runs out of cash (Wt = 0) it needs to raise external funds to continue operating
or its assets will be liquidated. If the firm chooses to raise new external funds to continue
operating, it must pay the financing costs specified above. The firm may prefer liquidation
if the cost of financing is too high relative to the continuation value (e.g., when the firm is
not productive, i.e., low µ). We denote by τ the firm’s stochastic liquidation time. Note
that τ = ∞ means that the firm never chooses to liquidate.

       We may write the dynamics for the firm’s cash W as follows:


              dWt = [Kt dAt − It dt − Γ(It , Kt , st )]dt + (r(st ) − λ) Wt dt + dHt − dUt .             (5)


where the firm term is the firm’s cash flows from operations dYt given in (3), the second
term is the return (net of the carry cost λ) on Wt , the third term dHt is the cash inflow from
external financing, and the last term dUt is the cash outflow to investors, so that (dHt − dUt )
is the net cash flow from financing. Note that this is a completely general financial accounting
equation, where dHt and dUt are endogenously determined by the firm.

       The homogeneity assumptions embedded in the adjustment cost, the “AK” production
technology, and financing costs allow us to deliver our key results in a parsimonious and
analytically tractable homogeneous model. Adjustment costs may not always be convex and
the production technology may exhibit long-run decreasing returns to scale in practice, but
   7
      We cannot distinguish between a special dividend and a share repurchase, as we exclude taxes. Note,
however, that a commitment to regular dividend payments is suboptimal in our model. We also exclude any
fixed or variable payout costs so as not to overburden the model. These can be added to the analysis
    8
      The cost of carrying cash may arise from an agency problem or from tax distortions. Cash retentions
are tax disadvantaged because the associated tax rates generally exceed those on interest income (Graham
(2000)). Since there is a cost of hoarding cash λ the firm may find it optimal to distribute cash back to
shareholders when its cash inventory grows too large. If λ = 0 the firm has no incentives to pay out cash
since keeping cash inside the firm does not have any disadvantages, but still has the benefit of relaxing
financial constraints. We could also imagine that there are settings in which λ ≤ 0. For example, if the firm
may have better investment opportunities than investors. We do not explore this case in this paper as we
are interested in a trade-off model for cash holdings.


                                                     8
these functional forms substantially complicate the formal analysis.9 As will become clear
below, the homogeneity of our model in W and K allows us to reduce the dynamics to a
one-dimensional equation, which is relatively straightforward to solve.


2.3        Systematic Risk and the Pricing of Risk

There are two different sources of systematic risks in our model: i) a small, continuous,
diffusion shock, and ii) a large discrete shock when the economy switches from one state
of nature to another. The diffusion shock in any given state s may be correlated with the
firm’s productivity shock, and we denote the correlation coefficient by ρ. The discrete shock
affects both the firm’s productivity and its external financing costs, as we have highlighted
above.

       How are these sources of systematic risk priced? Our model can allow for either risk-
neutral or risk-averse investors. If investors are risk neutral, then the pricing of risk is
zero and the physical probability distribution coincides with the risk-neutral probability
distribution. If investors are risk-averse, however, we need to distinguish between physical
and risk-neutral measures. We do so as follows.

       For the diffusion risk, we assume that there is a constant market price of risk η s in
each state s. The firm’s risk adjusted productivity shock (under the risk-neutral probability
measure Q) is then given by


                                       dAt = µ̂ (st ) dt + σ (st ) dẐtA ,                              (6)


where the mean productivity shock is adjusted to account for the firm’s exposure to diffusion
risk as follows:
                                         µ̂(st ) ≡ µ̂s = µs − ρη s σ s ,

                                                                                                      10
and ẐtA is a standard Brownian motion under the risk-neutral probability measure Q.
  9
       See Hennessy and Whited (2005, 2007) for an analysis of a non-homogenous model.
  10
       In the appendix, we provide a more detailed discussion of systematic risk premia. The key observation


                                                       9
   A risk-averse investor also requires a risk premium to compensate for the risk of the
economy switching states. As we show in the appendix, this involves transforming the
transition intensity under the physical probability measure to the risk-neutral probability
measure Q as follows: let ζ̂ 1 and ζ̂ 2 denote the transition intensities from respectively state
1 to state 2 (and state 2 to state 1) under the risk-neutral measure, then these intensities
are related to their physical intensities as follows:


                                                ζ̂ 1 = eκ1 ζ 1 , and ζ̂ 2 = eκ2 ζ 2 ,


where κ1 = ln(ζ̂ 1 /ζ 1 ) and κ2 = ln(ζ̂ 2 /ζ 2 ) represent a form of risk premium required by a
risk-averse investor for the exposure to this jump risk.

   Note that a positive κs implies that ζ̂ s > ζ s . In other words, when κs is positive it
is as if a risk-averse investor perceived a higher transition intensity under the risk-neutral
probability measure than under the physical measure. Vice versa, a negative κs implies that
ζ̂ s < ζ s . In other words, the perceived transition intensity for a risk-averse investor under
the risk-neutral measure is lower. As we show in the appendix, κs is positive in one state
and negative in the other. Intuitively, this reflects the idea that a risk-averse investor makes
an upward adjustment of the transition intensity from the good to the bad state (with κs > 0)
and a downward adjustment of the transition intensity from the bad to the good state (with
κs < 0). In sum, it is as if a risk-averse investor were uniformly more ‘pessimistic’ than a
risk-neutral investor: she thinks ‘good times’ are likely to last shorter and ‘bad times’ longer.


2.4     Firm optimality

The firm chooses its investment I, cumulative payout policy U, cumulative external financing
H, and liquidation time τ to maximize firm value as follows:

3     Model Solution

3.1     First-best Benchmark

We begin by characterizing the solution in the neoclassical benchmark, where there are no
external financing costs, φs = γ s = 0. In the neoclassical (frictionless-markets) solution
firms hold no cash (W = 0) and the optimal investment is determined by Tobin’s q, which
is the ratio of the market value and replacement value of capital. As Hayashi (1982) has
first established, marginal q is equal to average (Tobin’s) q in the first-best benchmark due
to the homogeneity in K of the production and adjustment-cost functions.

    The first-best Tobin’s q and investment-capital ratio iFs B satisfy

Note first that Tobin’s q is greater than one only due to the presence of investment adjust-
ment cost. Second, as described in the system of equations (8), firm value in the first-best
benchmark, qsF B in state s (normalized by the firm’s capital stock K), is the sum of the
present value of expected earnings net of investment and adjustment costs per unit of capi-
                                                                       2

iFs B and qsF B can be solved in closed form by mapping this system of bi-variate quadratic

3.2    Second-best Solution

Let P (K, W, s) denote firm value when the firm faces positive external financing costs (φs > 0
and γ s ≥ 0) in state s, with capital K and cash holding W . Firm value P (K, W, s) then
satisfies the following system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations when its cash
holding is above the financing-liquidation boundary W s and below the payout boundary
W s , i.e., for W s ≤ W ≤ W s ,

                                                                               σ 2s K 2
rs P (K, W, s) = max [(rs − λs ) W + µ̂s K − I − Γ (I, K, s)] PW (K, W, s) +            PW W (K, W, s)
                  I                                                                2
                                                                                    
                      + (I − δK) PK (K, W, s) + ζ̂ s    P (K, W, s− ) − P (K, W, s)             (10)


where s− denotes the other state.

   Intuitively, the first and the second terms on the right side of the HJB equation (10) give
the effects of the expected change (drift) and volatility of cash holding W on firm value,
respectively. The third term gives the effect of the expected change of capital stock K on
firm value. The last term gives the expected change of firm value due to the change of the
state from s to s− . When ζ̂ s = 0, we uncover the special case where the firm remains forever
in the same state (the case treated in BCW).

   As in BCW, firm value is homogeneous of degree one in W and K within each state. We
may write P (K, W, s) = ps (w)K, and substitute it into (10) and simplifying, we then obtain
the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) for ps (w):

                                                                              σ 2s ′′

                               + (is − δ) (ps (w) − wp′s (w)) + ζ̂ s (ps− (w) − ps (w)) .       (11)




                                                  12
The first-order condition (FOC) for the investment-capital ratio i(w) is then given by:
                                                             
                                      1        ps (w)
                             is (w) =                  − w − 1 + ν s,                      (12)
                                      θs       p′s (w)

where p′s (w) is the marginal value of cash in state s.

   The implied investment response to changes in w is thus given by:

                                                 1 ps (w)p′′s (w)
                                   i′s (w) = −                    .                        (13)
                                                 θ s p′s (w)2

As in BCW, the endogenous payout boundary ws = W s /K satisfies the following value
matching condition:
                                           p′s (ws ) = 1,                                  (14)

which states that the marginal value of cash is one when the firm chooses to pay out cash.
Moreover, the optimality of a payout implies the following super contact condition (see, e.g.,
Dumas, 1991) holds:
                                           p′′s (ws ) = 0.                                 (15)

   In contrast, the lower endogenous financing boundary in state s is determined by a
fundamentally different trade-off than in the single-state model in BCW. Let ws = W s /K
denote the endogenous lower boundary for equity issuance in state s, and let ms denote the
“return target” financing level in state s per unit of capital. A key result in BCW is that
the firm never chooses to raise external equity before it exhausts its cash stock. That is, in
BCW the firm optimally chooses w = 0. The reason is that the firm always has the option
to raise external equity financing in the future, and market financing terms do not change
over time (i.e., financing opportunities are constant). The firm is therefore better off relying
first on its cheaper internal funds before turning to external financing. As is highlighted in
BCW, this is a form of dynamic pecking order of financing.

   When financing opportunities are changing, however, as they are in our setting here, it
is no longer necessarily optimal to set w = 0. It may now be optimal for the firm to time


                                                  13
the market and issue equity before it runs out of cash, if it is concerned that financing costs
could rise in the future. That is, the option to tap cheaper equity markets now even though
the firm has not run out of cash can be an optimal strategy if the cheap financing terms are
not permanent.

   Given any equity issuance boundary ws , however, we have the same value matching and
smooth pasting conditions at issuance as in BCW. These allow us, in particular, to determine
the return target ms :


                         ps (ws ) = ps (ms ) − φs − (1 + γ s )(ms − ws ),                  (16)

                         p′s (ms ) = 1 + γ s .                                             (17)


   If the firm chooses to raise external equity, it first pays the fixed equity issuance cost
φs per unit of capital and then incurs the marginal issuance cost γ s for each unit of equity
it raises. The condition (16) thus gives the accounting relation for firm value immediately
before and after issuance. Second, as the firm optimally chooses its external financing at the
margin it sets ms so that marginal benefit of issuance p′s (ms ) is equal to the marginal cost
1 + γ s , which yields condition (17).

   How does the firm determine its equity issuance boundary ws ? We use the following
two-step procedure. First, suppose that the optimal lower boundary w s is interior (ws > 0),
then, the standard optimality condition implies that the derivatives of the left and the right
sides of (16) with respect to ws should be equal. This argument gives the following condition:


                                         p′s (w s ) = 1 + γ s .                            (18)


If there exists no w s such that the above condition holds, we obtain a corner solution, ws = 0.
In that case, the option value to tap equity markets earlier than absolutely necessary is valued
at zero. Using this procedure, we can characterize the optimal lower boundary w s ≥ 0.

   Next, we need to determine whether costly external equity issuance or liquidation is
optimal, as the firm always has the option to liquidate. Under our assumptions, the firm’s

                                                  14
capital is productive and thus its going-concern value is higher than its liquidation value.
Therefore, the firm never chooses to exercise its liquidation option before it runs out cash.
Under liquidation, we then have
                                           ps (0) = ls .                                  (19)

Hence, the firm chooses costly equity issuance as long as the equilibrium firm value ps (0) is
greater than ls .

   Finally, we specify the value function outside of the financing and payout boundary. If
the firm has too much cash in state s (so that w > ws ) it will reduce its cash holding to ws
immediately by making a lump-sum payout. That is, we have


                          ps (w) = ps (w s ) + (w − ws ) ,   w > ws .                     (20)


This scenario is possible when the firm with high cash holding moves into a state with a
lower payout boundary.

   Similarly, when the firm suddenly transits from the state s− with the financing boundary
ws− into the other state s with a higher financing boundary (w s > ws− ) and its cash holding
lies between the two lower financing boundaries (w s− < w < ws ) it is then optimal for the
firm to immediately issue external equity and restore its cash balance to the target level ms .
The following equation describes this rebalancing:


                    ps (w) = ps (ms ) − φs − (1 + γ s ) (ms − w) ,   w ≤ ws.              (21)


   In the remainder of the paper, we use this model framework to study several scenarios.
In Section 4, we consider the case where the firm is attempting to survive a financial crisis
during with financial markets are temporarily shut down. In Section 5, we consider the
situation where the firm expects to transit from the good state, denoted by G, in which
external costs of financing are low, to the other state, denoted by B, where the costs of
financing are high. And in section 8 we consider the general case where the firm’s environment



                                                15
transits between two recurrent states B and G.



4        Fighting for Survival in a Crisis

Our first scenario captures the situation faced by firms in the midst of a financial crisis. Much
empirical work has shown, firms in such an environment scramble to survive by cutting back
capital expenditures, drawing down lines of credit, and (when possible) engaging in asset
sales so as to preserve cash.11 In this section we analyze how firms optimally manage their
finances when their priority is to survive in a severe but temporary financial crisis. To make
our notation more intuitive, we use state G to refer to the good state, in which financial
markets operate normally. We set the fixed cost of equity issuance to 1% of the firm’s
capital stock in this state (φG = 1%) and the marginal cost of issuance to γ G = 6%. We
also set the liquidation value of assets to lG = 1.1. State B is the financial crisis (bad) state,
where the market for external financing shuts down. Should the firm run out of cash in this
state it would be forced into liquidation. During a financial crisis, few investors have either
sufficiently deep pockets or the risk appetite to acquire assets. This leads to fire sale prices
of assets and low liquidation values12 For these reasons, we set lB = 0.7.

       The other parameters remain the same in the two states: the riskfree rate is r = 4.34%,
the risk-adjusted mean and volatility of the productivity shock are µ̂ = 21.2% and σ = 20%,
the rate of depreciation of capital is δ = 15%, the adjustment cost parameters are θ = 6.902
and ν = 12%.13 Finally, the cash-carrying cost is λ = 1.5%. Although in reality these
parameter values clearly change with the state of nature, we keep them fixed under this
scenario so as to isolate the effects of changes in external financing conditions. All the
parameter values are annualized whenever applicable and summarized in Table 1.

       To make our point in the simplest possible setting, consider a firm currently in the

     Other than the volatility parameter, we rely on the technology parameters estimated by Eberly, Rebelo,
and Vincent (2009).


                                                    16
financial crisis (state B), and that the state G is absorbing, i.e., once the firm reaches state
G, it remains there permanently (ζ G = 0). The firm exits the crisis state with transition
probability ζ B ∆ over time period ∆, and as a benchmark we set ζ B = 0.9, which implies
that the average duration of a financial crisis is 1.1 years. Under the risk-neutral measure,
with a pricing of risk with respect to changes in the state of nature of κG = −κB = ln(3),
the corresponding risk-neutral transition intensity is ζ̂ B = 0.3.

   The firm’s behavior in the absorbing state G is identical to that in the model with
constant financing opportunities in BCW. Figure 1 plots the average q and its derivative,
as well as the investment-capital ratio i(w) and its derivative in this state. The average q
is a natural measure of the value of capital. It is defined as the ratio between the firm’s
enterprise value, P (K, W, s) − W , and its capital stock:

                                      P (K, W, s) − W
                           qs (w) =                   = ps (w) − w.                        (22)
                                             K

The sensitivity of average q to changes in cash holdings is thus given by


                                       qs′ (w) = p′s (w) − 1 .                             (23)


We may interpret qs′ (w) as the (net) marginal value of cash, as it measures how much the
firm’s enterprise value increases with an extra dollar of cash. The firm’s investment-capital
ratio is (w) and investment-cash sensitivity i′s (w) in each state are given by equations (12)
and (13), respectively.

   After reaching the absorbing state G, the firm’s financing follows a strict pecking order
with internal funds always tapped before external funds, so that wG = 0. The return target
for equity issuance, which is also the total amount of equity issuance due to wG = 0, is
mG = 0.17, and the payout boundary is wG = 0.49 (each marked by a vertical line in the
graphs). As w rises, the financial constraint is relaxed. As a result, both the average q
and investment rise with w, while the net marginal value of cash and the investment-cash
sensitivity fall with w. Obviously, the transition intensity ζ B into the absorbing state has

no impact on the results in the absorbing state G.

   Next, we turn to the crisis state B, where the firm’s overriding concern is survival due
to the lack of any external financing. The firm also anticipates an improvement in financing
opportunities when the state of the economy switches back to normal. Thus, a rise in the
probability of leaving the crisis state can have two effects. First, it might encourage the firm
to invest with the hope that external financing will become available soon. Second, it raises
the continuation value for the firm, which makes the firm place extra weight on survival in
order to preserve its going concern value. The tradeoff between these two effects determines
how the firm times payout and investment in the crisis state.

   Figure 2 plots the average q and investment in state B. Panel A plots qB (w) and gives

Figure 2: Firm value and investment in (transitory) state B.                       This figure plots

financing is available in state G, but not in B. We consider three risk-neutral transition intensities

the optimal payout boundary wB in the transitory state B. We consider three levels of
risk-neutral transition intensity, ζ̂ B = 0, 0.3, 1, which corresponds to ζ B = 0, 0.9, 3 under
the physical measure. Regardless of the transition intensity, the average q always starts at
lB = 0.7 due to liquidation at w = 0. When the probability of exiting a crisis increases, firm
value rises, and the firm responds by reducing its cash holding. The payout boundary wB
falls from 0.78 to 0.76 and then to 0.68 as ζ̂ B rises from 0 to 0.3 and then to 1.0.

   It is worth noting that the payout boundary in state B is not always monotonic in ζ̂ B . For
very high and very low transition intensities the firm pays out sooner than for intermediate
intensities. The reason is that when the firm is stuck in the crisis state for a long time the



                                                           19
value of its investment opportunities is so low that it is best to payout cash to shareholders.
When the probability of exiting the crisis is very high then the prospect of raising cheap
equity in the future also encourages the firm to pay out more dividends in the crisis state.
It is for intermediate probabilities, when the value of the firm’s investment opportunities is
relatively high, but the risk of staying in a prolonged crisis is also high, that the firm is most
conservative in its payout policy.

   However, even when the crisis is expected to end quickly (e.g., ζ̂ B = 1 corresponds
to ζ B = 3, which implies the average duration of state B is only 0.33 years), the payout
boundary is still significantly higher than in the good state (wG = 0.49), suggesting that the
firm has a strong desire to hold more cash in the crisis state. The graph also shows that
moving from state B to G can result in a big jump in firm value when the cash holding is low,
but the effect is much smaller when the cash holding is high. This difference reflects the fact
that the firm uses precautionary savings to cushion the impact of severe financial constraints.
One implication of this finding is that we should not expect to see sharp increases in stock
valuations for cash rich firms as the economy exits the crisis state.

   Panel B plots the net marginal value of cash qB′ (w) in state B. As w approaches 0,
the marginal value of cash rises significantly because an extra dollar of cash can reduce the
chance of costly liquidation. While the net marginal value of cash in state G reaches at most
$0.2 as w → 0, it can be as high as $6 in state B. Again, this is due to the fact that the
firm has access to external financing in state G but not in state B.

   Interestingly, when cash holdings w are relatively high the marginal value of cash in
state B decreases with the transition intensity ζ̂ B , while it increases with ζ̂ B when w is
low. This result might appear counter-intuitive, as a higher probability of ending the crisis
ought to help relax the financial constraint the firm is facing. Intuitively, the severity of
financial constraints depends on the probability of the firm running out of cash before the
crisis ends. When current cash holding is high, a higher ζ̂ B makes liquidation less likely,
hence reducing the importance of hoarding cash today. However, when the firm is facing an
immediate liquidation threat, yet the chance of the crisis ending in the near future is high,


                                               20
the “breathing room” provided by an extra dollar of cash can be especially valuable, which
explains why the marginal value of cash rises with ζ̂ B . Notice that for w > 0, the marginal
value of cash should eventually decrease in ζ̂ B as ζ̂ B becomes large, since the high intensity
eventually makes liquidation concerns irrelevant.14

       The behavior of the marginal value of cash is key to understanding the firm’s investment
policy. As Panel C shows, the investment-capital ratio iB (w) in state B is increasing in
w. This result is driven by the rise in firm value and the fall in marginal value of cash
with w. With sufficiently high w, investment increases with ζ̂ B . But the opposite is true
when w is low. Underinvestment is a form of risk management for a financially constrained
firm. When the firm does not face an immediate threat of liquidation, a higher transition
intensity ζ̂ B further reduces the need to save cash and hence makes the firm more willing
to invest. However, if the cash holding is already low, a higher ζ̂ B can induce the firm to
underinvest more in order to avoid running out of cash before the end of the crisis. The
different investment policy at the lower and higher ends of w highlights the importance of a
dynamic risk management perspective.

       Panel D of Figure 2 shows that the investment-cash sensitivity i′B (w) is positive but non-
monotonic in w. Kaplan and Zingales (1997) show that investment increases with net worth
(i′ (w) > 0) but cannot sign i′′ (w) in their static setting. In the scenario we illustrate here,
the sensitivity i′ (w) is positive, and indeed can be either increasing or decreasing in w.

       In summary, when current external financing is impossible but may be available in the
future, the potential change of financing terms in the future affects the firm’s payout and
investment policies. From the comparative statics for ζ̂ B , we can conjecture the implications
of a time-varying transition intensity in a dynamic setting. When ζ̂ B rises, which can be
either because the expected duration of the crisis is getting shorter (ζ̂ B falls), or because
investors are less concerned with the crisis state (the risk premium for financing shocks falls),
firm value will rise, firms will tend to hold less cash, and investment may be falling for firms
with low cash holdings (despite the fact that expected future financing costs are falling) but
  14
     The exception is at the limit as w approaches 0, where one can prove that the marginal value of cash
will be monotonically increasing in ζ̂ B .


                                                   21
rising for firms with high cash holdings.



5     Market Timing: Building a War-chest in Good Times

In this section, we consider a setting where the firm is currently in state G. However, the
economy may switch out of state G to enter the crisis state B with probability ζ G ∆ over the
time interval ∆. Moreover, in state B the firm cannot access external financing and can only
survive on internal funds. Thus, under the scenario considered in this section the firm has
an external financing window only in state G, and this window has limited duration. Unlike
in the previous section, we show that the option to time the market has significant value.

    This predictable worsening of financing conditions generates a positive timing-option
value for the firm. By tapping external equity markets while there is still time, the firm can
build a cash war chest for the future. By deferring external financing, it would save on the
time value of money for financing costs and also on subsequent cash carry costs. However,
doing so would then take a risk of being shut out of capital markets forever before it had
time to accumulate cash. Facing this tradeoff, the firm chooses its external equity issuance
policy together with its investment and payout policies to maximize its value.

    The firm’s behavior in the absorbing state B is essentially the same as in BCW. Figure 3
plots the average q and i(w) in the absorbing state B. If the firm runs out of cash in state B,
the inability to raise external funds results in immediate liquidation. Average q thus is equal
to the liquidation value lB = 0.7 at w = 0. Also, average q is concave in w (as in BCW). The
net marginal value of cash qB′ (w) can be as high as 3.5 when the firm is close to runnning
out of cash, but it decreases to 0 monotonically as we w increases from 0 to the endogenous
payout boundary w B . As in BCW, investment is increasing but is not necessarily concave
in cash: from Panels C and D one can see that i′ (w) is positive but not monotonic.

    Next we turn to the transitory state G, Figure 4 plots firm value, investment, and their
sensitivities in state G for three levels of risk-neutral transition intensity ζ̂ G = 0, 0.3, 1.0
from state G to B, which corresponds to ζ G = 0, 0.1, 1/3 under the physical measure.

   Panel A plots average q. Intuitively, the higher is the transition intensity from G to
B (the higher ζ̂ G ) the lower is firm value for the same cash-capital ratio w. Importantly,
when ζ̂ G is sufficiently high firm value is no longer globally concave in w. Since financial
constraints typically induce the firm to hoard cash for precautionary reasons, firm value is
increasing and concave in financial slack in almost all models featuring financial constraints.
In our scenario, the precautionary motive for hoarding cash is still present. Yet, stochastic
financing conditions also introduce a motive to time equity markets, which potentially results
in a locally convex firm value.

   From Panel B, it is easy to see that firm value is not globally concave in w. For sufficiently
high w (w ≥ 0.17 with ζ̂ G = 0.3 and w ≥ 0.26 with ζ̂ G = 1) qG (w) is concave. When the

firm has sufficient cash, the firm’s equity issuance need is then quite distant so that the
financing timing option is out-of-the-money. Recall that the sign of i′ (w) is determined by
p′′G (w) (see equation 13). Hence, the concavity of pG (w) in the cash rich region also implies
that investment responds positively to increases in cash in that region, which is confirmed
in Panels C and D of Figure 4. To sum up, with sufficient financial slack, the firm behaves
effectively in the same way as in standard models with financial constraints (e.g. BCW).

   In contrast, when w is low (e.g. w ≤ 0.17 with ζ̂ G = 0.3 and w ≤ 0.26 with ζ̂ G = 1) the
firm is more concerned about the risk of being shut out of capital markets when the state
switches to B. A firm with low cash holdings may want to issue equity while it can, even



                                                          24
before running out of cash. In addition, such a firm may choose to accelerate its cash burn
rate by increasing its investments, to bring forward the time when it raises new funds through
equity issuance. Also, due to the fixed costs of issuing equity, the firm will engage in a lumpy
equity issue when it chooses to tap equity markets. This means that post issuance the firm
will have high cash holdings. Thus when w is low, the expectation of high post issuance cash
reserves coupled with the inclination to time favorable equity markets dominates the firm’s
precautionary motive, resulting in a locally convex-shaped firm value in w.

   How does the transition intensity out of state G affect firms’ market timing motive?
Consider first the limiting case when state G is absorbing (ζ̂ G = 0). In this case, the
firm taps equity markets only when it runs out of cash (wG = 0), and to economize the
fixed cost of issuance, the firm issues a lumpy amount mG = 0.17. Firm value qG (w) is
then globally concave in w and iG (w) increases with w everywhere. Note in particular that
the fixed issuance cost by itself is not sufficient to generate market timing behavior. The
transitory nature of favorable market conditions is necessary to induce the firm to time
the market. As the transition intensity ζ̂ G rises above 0 the equity issuance boundary w G
may possibly move above 0. In these situations, the optimality condition for the issuance
boundary requires that the net marginal value of cash at the issuance boundary be equal to
the proportional financing cost γ = 6%. As one would expect, the return cash-capital ratio,
mG , is also increasing in the transition intensity (as can be seen in Panel A), since a higher
likelihood of an impending financial crisis raises the firm’s precautionary demand for cash.
The firm also chooses to preserve more cash in response to an increase in ζ̂ G by postponing
payouts to shareholders. This can be seen from the shift to the right for the optimal payout
boundary w G as ζ̂ G rises. In sum, Panel A shows that through a combination of market
timing and reduced payout, the firm optimally responds to a greater crisis risk by holding
more cash on average.

   Besides the finite duration of the option to time the equity market, the fixed issuance
cost is also necessary to obtain local convexity of the value function. In Figure 5, we examine
average q and investment in the transitory state G for three levels of fixed cost of equity

Figure 5: The effects of financing costs on firm value and investment in (transitory)
state G. This figure plots firm value and investment in state G for the case where G is transitory.
We consider three levels of fixed costs of equity financing in state G: φG = 0, 1%, 5%. The transition
intensity is ζ̂ G = 0.3. All other parameter values are given in Table 1.


financing φ = 0, 1%, 5% (with transition intensity ζ̂ G = 0.3). Note first that the lower the
fixed cost parameter φ is the earlier the firm issues equity in state G. Intuitively, the firm
exercises the financing option earlier if the cost of doing so is lower. In Panel A, as φG drops
from 5% to 1% and then to 0, the financing boundary w rises from 0 to 0.08 and then to
0.24. Second, without the fixed cost (φG = 0), the firm issues just enough equity to stay
away from its optimally chosen financing boundary w, as the net marginal value of cash
cannot be higher than the marginal cost of financing γ. In this extreme case, the marginal
               ′
value of cash qG (w) is monotonically decreasing in w as can be seen from Panel B; hence,
firm value is globally concave in w even under market timing. Thus, stochastic financing



                                                          26
costs and fixed costs are both necessary to generate convexity.15

       When the fixed cost of issuing equity is positive but not very high (φG = 1% or 5%)
the marginal value of cash is no longer monotonic in w. Moreover, higher fixed costs lead
firms to choose larger issuance sizes (mG − wG ). Notice also that wG = 0 when φG = 5%.
This result shows that market timing does not necessarily lead to a violation of the pecking
order between internal cash and external equity financing, and importantly that wG > 0
is not necessary for the convexity of the value function. Finally, when the fixed cost of
issuing equity is very high (not shown in the graph), the market timing effect is so weak
that the precautionary motive dominates again, so that the net marginal value of cash is
monotonically decreasing in w.

       Having determined why the value function may be locally convex, we now explore the
implications of convexity for investment. Recall from equation (13) that the sign of the
investment-cash sensitivity i′s (w) depends on p′′s (w). Thus, in the region where pG (w) is
convex, investment is decreasing in cash holdings w. This finding is in sharp contrast to the
standard result in the investment with financial constraint literature, where investment is
always positively related with w. Indeed, in all existing models with financial constraints in-
vestment increases with financial slack. Existing models only differ in their results concerning
investment-cash sensitivity (the sign of the second derivative i′′ (w)).16

       The economic reason for why investment may be locally decreasing in financial slack is
related to market timing. When the firm’s cash holding is low, it wants to take advantage
of the favorable financing condition in state G before it disappears. As a result, rather
than cutting investment further to avoid further reducing the cash holding, the firm actu-
ally wants to accelerate investment in order to reach the equity issuance boundary sooner.
Also anticipating equity issuance, it is less worthwhile for the firm to significantly distort
investment. The optionality of issuing equity generates convexity. Simply put, the firm is
  15
     More generally, the value of the market timing option depends on the difference in financing costs between
the two states: either lowering the financing costs in state G or raising the financing costs in state B (or
making liquidation more costly in state B) will lead the firm to issue equity early.
  16
     See Kaplan and Zingales’ (KZ) discussion of Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988). See also Stein
(2003) for a survey on the issue of investment/cash sensitivity.


                                                      27
more willing to invest when higher investment reduces the chance of missing out on favorable
equity financing conditions, and when it expects its cash holding to substantially increase
post equity issue. This behavior is shown in Panels C and D of Figure 4 and 5. Our model
is thus able to account for the behavior that the threat of high financing costs in the future
can cause changes in investment and cash holding to be negatively correlated.

       There may be other ways of generating a negative correlation between changes in in-
vestment and cash holding. First, when the firm moves from state G to B, this not only
results in a drop in investment, especially when w is low (comparing Panel C in Figure 3
and 4), but also in an increase in the payout boundary, which may explain why firms during
the recent financial crisis have increased their cash reserves and cut back on capital expen-
ditures, as Acharya, Almeida, and Campello (2010) have documented. Second, in a model
with persistent productivity shocks (as in Riddick and Whited (2009)), when expected future
productivity falls, the firm will cut investment and the cash saved could also result in a rise
in its cash holding.17

       Is it possible to distinguish empirically between these two mechanisms? In the case
of a negative productivity shock the firm has no incentive to significantly raise its payout
boundary, as lower productivity lowers the costs of underinvestment, hence reducing the
precautionary motive for holding cash. This prediction is opposite to the prediction related
to a negative financing shock. Thus, following negative technology shocks we will not see
firms aggressively increasing cash reserves. In fact, firms that already have high cash holdings
will likely pay out cash after a negative productivity shock, but hold on to even more cash
after a negative financing shock.

       Another empirical prediction which differentiates our model from other market timing
models concerns the link between equity issuance and corporate investment. Our model
predicts that underinvestment is substantially mitigated when the firm is close to the eq-
uity financing boundary. Moreover, the positive correlation between investment and equity
issuance in our model is not driven by better investment opportunities (as the real side of
  17
    This mechanism is captured in our model with the two states corresponding to two different values for
the return on capital µs .

the economy is held constant across the two states) it is driven solely by the market timing
and precautionary demand for cash.



6        Financial Constraints and the Risk Premium

In this section, we explore how financial constraints and time-varying external equity issuance
costs affect the firm’s cost of capital. A heuristic derivation of the firm’s (risk-adjusted)
expected return involves a comparison of the HJB equations under the physical and risk-
neutral measures P and Q. Let the firm’s conditional risk premium in state s be µR
                                                                                 s (w). We

may write the HJB equation under the physical measure as follows

                                                                               σ 2s ′′
          rs + µR                                                       ′
                s (w) ps (w) = max [(rs − λs ) w + µs − is − gs (is )] ps (w) +     p (w)             (24)
                                is                                              2 s
                                       + (is − δ) (ps (w) − wp′s (w)) + ζ s (ps− (w) − ps (w)) ,


where µs and ζ s denote the expected excess return on capital and the transition intensity
from state s to s− under the physical probability measure, respectively.

       By matching terms in the HJB equations (11) and (24), one then obtains the following
expression for the conditional risk premium:

                                           p′s (w)                 (ps− (w) − ps (w))
                     µR
                      s (w) = η s ρs σ s           − (eκs − 1) ζ s                    ,               (25)
                                           ps (w)                        ps (w)

where ρs is the conditional correlation between the firm’s productivity shock dA and the
stochastic discount factor in state s.18 The first term in (25) is the technology risk premium,
which is the product of the firm’s exposure to systematic Brownian risk ρs σ s p′s (w)/ps (w) and
the price of Brownian risk ηs . It is positive for firms whose values are positively correlated
with aggregate technology shocks. The ratio p′s (w)/ps (w) measures the percentage change
of firm value with respect to a unit change in w. The second term is the financing risk
  18
    This expression can also be obtained via the standard covariance between return and stochastic discount
factor derivation (see e.g., Duffie (2001)).



                                                      29
premium, which compensates risk-averse investors for the exposure to the firm’s risk with
respect to time-varying equity issuance costs. Since the stochastic discount factor (marginal
utility) jumps up when financing conditions deteriorate we naturally have κG = −κB > 0
in our two state model: risk-averse investors demand this extra premium for firms whose
values drop during times when external financing conditions worsen (pG (w) > pB (w)).19

       Note that in the first-best setting where there are no equity issuance costs, the firm’s
expected risk premium is constant and can be recovered from (25) by setting η, ρ, and σ to
be constants and dropping the second term. We then obtain the standard CAPM formula:

                                                 1
                                  µF B = ηρσ          = β F B (rm − r) ,                              (26)
                                               qF B

where β F B = ρσ/(σ m q F B ), (rm − r) is the excess market portfolio return, and σ m is the
market portfolio volatility.

       The comparison between µR (w) and µF B highlights the impact of external financing
frictions on the firm’s cost of capital:

 Constant equity issuance costs: When financing opportunities are constant over time,
         financial constraints only affect the cost of capital by amplifying (or dampening) a
         firm’s exposure to technology shocks. This effect is captured by the technology (dif-
         fusion) risk premium in (25). As the cash-capital ratio w increases, the firm tends
         to become less risky for two reasons. First, if a greater fraction of its assets is cash,
         the firm beta is automatically lower due to a simple portfolio composition effect. As
         a financially constrained firm hoards more cash to reduce its dependence on costly
         external financing, the firm beta becomes a weighted average of its asset beta and the
         beta of cash, which is equal to zero. In particular, with a large enough buffer stock of
         cash relative to its assets, this firm may be even safer than a firm facing no external
         financing costs and therefore holding no cash. Second, an increase in w effectively re-
         laxes the firm’s financing constraint and therefore reduces the sensitivity of firm value
  19
   Livdan, Sapriza, and Zhang (2009) also study the effect of financing constraints on stock returns. Their
model, however, does not allow for stochastic financing conditions or cash accumulation.

                                                      30
     to cash flow, which also tends to reduce the risk of holding the firm.

 Time-varying equity issuance costs: Time-varying equity issuance costs affect the cost
     of capital for a financially constrained firm in two ways. First, the firm’s exposure to
     technology shocks changes as financing conditions change, as the marginal value of cash
     p′s (w) and firm value ps (w) both depend on the state s. Second, when external financing
     shocks are priced, investors demand an extra premium for investing in firms that do
     poorly when financing conditions worsen. This effect is captured by the second term in
     (25). Note that (ps− (w) − ps (w)) /ps (w) gives the percentage change of firm value if
     financing conditions change, and this term measures the sensitivity of firm value with
     respect to changes in w. Intuitively, the financing risk premium is larger the bigger
     the relative change in firm value due to a change in external financing conditions.

   Figure 6 plots the conditional risk premium for a firm as a function of w. Recall that
state G (with low financing costs) is transient and state B (with high financing costs) is
absorbing. We set the price of Brownian risk to η G = η B = 0.4, and the correlation between
the aggregate and firm level Brownian shocks to ρG = ρB = 0.6. The remaining parameters
are the same as in the benchmark case and are reported in Table 1. The risk premium for
an unconstrained firm in the first-best setting is then µF B = 3.2%.

   In Panel A, the total risk premium in state B is shown to be decreasing in the firm’s cash
holding. When w is close to 0, the annualized conditional risk premium can exceed 30%,
but it falls rapidly as w rises. This result mirrors the rapid decline in the marginal value
of cash (see Figure 3, Panel B): thus, high marginal value of cash in the low w region can
dramatically amplify the firm’s sensitivity to technology shocks relative to the unconstrained
case. The risk premium can be as low as 2% for a firm near the payout boundary–even lower
than the total risk premium for a financially unconstrained firm (3.2%). This is due to the
asset composition effect discussed earlier. As the firm approaches the payout boundary, the
marginal value of cash p′B (w) approaches 1. By definition, pB (w) = qB (w) + w. While the
average q for the constrained firm will always be below the q under the first best, q F B , the
sum of average q and w can exceed q F B , which causes µR
                                                        B (w) to fall below µ

Figure 6: The effects of stochastic financing conditions on the cost of capital. This
figure plots firm risk premium in state G and B for the case where G is transitory. We consider
three levels of transition intensity from G to B: ζ̂ G = 0, 0.3, 1.0.


   In Panel B, the total risk premium in state G also decreases when the firm’s cash holding
rises. Compared to state B, the level of risk premium is lower, especially when the firm has
low cash holdings. Moreover, a higher probability of switching into state B raises the risk
premium. This effect is weaker for a firm with a higher cash-capital ratio as the composition
effect then becomes stronger.

   When we decompose the total risk premium in state G into the technology and financing
components we observe the following. First, Panel C plots the technology risk premium (the
first term in (25)). As can be seen from this panel, when the external financing conditions do
not change (ζ̂ G = 0) the technology risk premium is monotonically decreasing in w. However,
under time-varying external financing costs, the risk with respect to higher future financing


                                                                32
costs generates market timing behavior and non-monotonicity in the marginal value of cash
(Figure 4, Panel B), which in turn may involve a technology risk premium that is locally
increasing in w for low levels of w. As the non-monotonicity in the marginal value of cash
is partially offset by the asset composition effect, the non-monotonicity in the technology
risk premium is relatively weak. Similarly, holding w fixed at a low level, market timing can
lower p′G (w) as the transition intensity ζ̂ G increases. This explains why the technology risk
premium may be decreasing in the transition intensity for low w.

    Second, Panel D plots the financing risk premium. The size of this premium depends on
the relative change in firm value when external financing conditions change. It is increasing
in the transition intensity ζ̂ G , but decreasing in w. Intuitively, when cash holdings are low,
a sudden worsening in external financing conditions is particularly costly, but when cash
holdings are high, the firm is able to avoid liquidation by cutting investment, engaging in
asset sales, and deferring payout, all of which mitigate impact of the financing shock.

    Our model has several implications for expected returns of financially constrained firms.
Controlling for technology parameters and financing costs, the model predicts an inverse re-
lation between returns and corporate cash holdings, which has been documented by Dittmar
and Mahrt-Smith (2007) among others. Our analysis points out that this negative rela-
tion may not be due to agency problems, as they emphasize, but may be driven by relaxed
financing constraints and a changing asset composition of the firm.20

    A related prediction is that firms that are more financially constrained are not necessarily
more risky. The risk premium for a relatively more constrained firm can be lower than
that for a less constrained firm if the more constrained firm also holds more cash. This
observation may shed light on the recent studies by Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006,
2009) documenting that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility have low average returns. In
   20
      When heterogeneity in technology and financing costs is difficult to measure, it is important to take into
account the endogeneity of cash holdings when comparing firms with different cash holdings empirically. A
firm with higher external financing costs will tend to hold more cash, however its risk premium may still
be higher than for a firm with lower financing costs and consequently lower cash holdings. Thus, a positive
relation between returns and corporate cash holdings across firms may still be consistent with our model
(see Palazzo (2008) for a related model and supporting empirical evidence).



                                                      33
our model, firms that face higher idiosyncratic risk will optimally hold more cash on average,
which could explain their lower risk premium.

       Finally, with time-varying financing conditions, our model can be seen as a conditional
two-factor model to explain the cross section of returns (we provide details of the derivation
in the Appendix). A firm’s risk premium is then determined by its technology beta and its
financing beta. Other things equal, a firm whose financing costs move closely with aggregate
financing conditions will have a larger financing beta and earn higher returns than one with
financing costs independent of aggregate conditions. Empirically, this two-factor model can
be implemented using the standard market beta plus a beta with respect to a portfolio that
is sensitive to financing shocks (e.g. a banking portfolio). This model, in particular, shows
how a firm’s conditional beta depends on the firm’s cash holdings.



7        Market Timing and Dynamic Hedging

We have thus far restricted the firm’s financing choices to only internal funds and external
equity financing. In this section, we extend the model to allow the firm to engage in dynamic
hedging via derivatives such as market-index futures. How does market timing behavior
interact with dynamic hedging? And, how does the firm’s dynamic hedging strategy affect
its market timing behavior? These are the questions we address in this section. We denote
by F the index futures price for a market portfolio that is already completely hedged against
financing shocks. Under the risk-neutral probability measure, the future prices F then
evolves according to:
                                            dFt = σ m Ft dẐtM ,                                         (27)

where σ m is the volatility of the market index portfolio, and {ẐtM : t ≥ 0} is a standard
Brownian motion that is correlated with the firm’s productivity shock {ZtA : t ≥ 0} with a
constant correlation coefficient ρ.21
  21
    Note that the futures price F follows a martingale after risk adjustment. The interesting case to consider
is when the index futures is imperfectly correlated with the firm’s productivity shock.



                                                     34
   We denote by ψ t the fraction of the firm’s total cash Wt that it invests in the futures
contract. Futures contracts require that investors hold cash in a margin account. Thus, let
αt ∈ [0, 1] denote the fraction of the firm’s total cash Wt held in the margin account. Cash
held in this margin account incurs a flow unit cost ǫ ≥ 0. Futures market regulations typically
require that an investor’s futures position (in absolute value) cannot exceed a multiple π of
the amount of cash αt Wt held in the margin account. We let this multiple be state dependent
and denote it by π(st ). The margin requirement in state s then imposes the following limit
on the firm’s futures position: |ψ t | ≤ π(st )αt . As the firm can costlessly reallocate cash
between the margin account and its regular interest-bearing account, it optimally holds the
minimum amount of cash necessary in the margin account when ǫ > 0. Without much loss of
generality we shall ignore this haircut on the margin account and assume that ǫ = 0. Under
this assumption, we do not need to keep track of cash allocations in the margin account and
outside the account. We can then simply set αt = 1. Since the derivation of firm value and
optimal hedging policy follows closely the analysis in BCW we do not develop it in the text
below and provide a more detailed derivation in the Appendix C, where we establish that:

   We choose the correlation between index futures and the firm’s productivity shock to be
ρ = 0.6 and a market return volatility of σ m = 20%. The margin requirements in states G
and B are set at πG = 5 and π B = 2, respectively. All other parameter values are the same
as in the previous sections.

Figure 7: Optimal hedge ratios ψ ∗ (w) in states G and B when state B is absorbing.
The parameter values are: market volatility σ m = 20%, correlation coefficient ρ = 0.6, margin
requirements π G = 5 and π B = 2. All other parameter values are given in Table 1.


Optimal hedge ratios ψ ∗s (w). Figure 7 plots the optimal hedge ratios in both states:
ψ ∗G (w) and ψ ∗B (w). First, we note that for sufficiently high w, the firm hedges in the same
way in both states. Hedging is then unconstrained by the firm’s cash holdings and costless,
so that the firm chooses its hedge ratio to be equal to −ρσσ −1
                                                             m /w so as to eliminate its

exposure to systematic volatility of the productivity shock. This explains the concave and
overlapping parts of the hedging policies in Figure 7.

   Second, for low w hedging strategies differ in the two states as follows: in state B the
hedge ratio hits the constraint ψ ∗B (w) = −π B = −2 for w ≤ 0.3. In state G on the other
hand, firm value turns from concave to convex (due to market timing) when w is less than
w̃G = 0.16 (where p′′ (w̃G ) = 0). For w ∈ (w G , w̃G ) firm value is convex in w so that the
firm does the opposite of hedging and engages in maximally allowed risk taking by setting
ψ ∗G (w) = π G = 5 for w ∈ (0.06, 0.16).

Figure 8: Firm value and investment in the (absorbing) state B. This figure plots the
average q and investment in state B with and without hedging opportunities. External financing
is available in state G, but not in B. For the hedging case, we set market volatility σ m = 20%,
correlation coefficient ρ = 0.6, and margin requirements: π G = 5 and π B = 2. All other parameter
values are given in Table 1.


Hedging and investment in the absorbing state B. Figure 8 plots firm value q(w) and
the investment-capital ratio i(w) as functions of w in the absorbing state B. We compare the
solutions with and without hedging. As in BCW, firm value q(w) is higher with hedging than
without (Panel A). Also, when w is sufficiently high the net marginal value of cash qB′ (w) is
higher for firms that do not hedge than for those that do. This is because cash plays a more
important role in risk management when there are no other hedging tools available. However,
when cash is low, the marginal value of cash is higher when the firm hedges than when it
does not. This is due to the fact that the firm is more valuable with hedging opportunities
in the future than without. Hence, the marginal value of cash is greater for firms with better


                                                           37
future prospects.

   Similarly, investment-capital ratios on average are higher for firms that also hedge with
futures and for firms with sufficiently high cash. However, when cash is low disinvestment
becomes a risk management tool: by reducing investment in productive capital the firm re-
plenishes cash and potentially lowers other costs of risk management. The end result is higher
firm value. Thus, although risk management in the long run helps mitigate underinvestment,
in the short run (when w is low) it may give rise to more underinvestment. These results
underscore the importance of analyzing an intertemporal model, as a dynamic analysis may
reveal surprising optimal behavior that would not be plausible in a static model.


Hedging, investment, and market timing in the transitory state G. Figure 9 plots
firm value, investment-capital ratio, and their sensitivities as functions of w in the transitory
state G. Again, we compare the solutions with and without hedging. Note first that hedging
(or speculation) significantly increases firm value (compare Panel A of Figure 8 with Panel
A in Figure 9). This value gain is much larger than in the absorbing state B. Second, the
marginal value of cash is lower for firms that hedge as long as the firm is not too constrained
(i.e., has enough cash). For cash strapped firms the marginal value of cash is higher for
firms with hedging opportunities (See Panel B of Figure 9). Third, firms issue equity later
(engage in less market timing) when they hedge than when they do not (i.e., w is lower with
hedging). Similarly, firm that hedge hoard less cash and pay out to shareholders earlier.

   Comparing investment policies for firms that hedge to those of firms that do not hedge
we note, first, that investment is on average higher with hedging than without hedging.
This follows directly from the observation that hedging increases firm value by mitigating
its underinvestment problem (Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993)). Second, note again that
while hedging mitigates underinvestment for most values of w, it does not for sufficiently
low w. The logic is the same as in the absorbing state: when w is low underinvestment is a
more efficient way to manage risk.

Figure 9: Firm value and investment in the (transitory) state G. This figure plots the
average q and investment in state G with and without hedging opportunities. External financing is
available in state G, but not in state B. For the hedging case, we set market volatility σ m = 20%,
correlation coefficient ρ = 0.6, and margin requirements: π G = 5 and π B = 2. All other parameter
values are given in Table 1.


8     A Recurrent Two-State Model

For expositional clarity, we have so far considered only somewhat stylized scenarios where
either the “low-cost” or the “high-cost” financing state are absorbing. In reality, firms face
mean-reverting financing opportunities and the reader may wonder whether our main results
carry over to this more general setting. We next show that our main results on market timing,
investment, and risk management continue to hold with recurrent changes in the financing
conditions. Moreover, they carry over even when we allow firms to tap external equity
markets in state B albeit at a high cost. We now assume that the fixed cost of financing is

Figure 10: Firm value and investment in the recurrent model. This figure plots the
average q and investment when the two states are recurrent. All the parameter values are given in
Table 1.

φB = 30%, a level at which the firm still prefers financing to liquidation in state B.

   Figure 10 plots firm value (average q) and investment is (w) for both states, and their
sensitivities with respect to w. The top left panel shows that average q in state G is higher
than the average q in state B: the firm has higher valuation in the state with low financing
cost than the state where external financing is more costly. Note that the valuation (average
q) difference in this example is purely due to the difference in financing costs between the two
states. Therefore, using average q to control for investment opportunities and then testing
for the presence of financing constraints by using variables such as cash flows or cash (which
is often done in the empirical literature) would be misleading in our setup. Second, as shown
in Panel C, investment in state G is higher than in state B for a given w, but the difference


                                                                 40
is especially large when w is low. Also, investment on average is much less variable with
respect to w when external financing costs are lower.

    Third, the convexity of firm value and the non-monotonicity of investment in state G for
low values of w continues to hold. This is illustrated in the upper left and right panels. The
intuition is essentially the same as that in the earlier sections. Financing is cheap in state G
only for a finite stochastic duration, which makes the financing timing option valuable. The
optimal equity issuance boundary in state G is strictly positive: w = 0.055. These findings
imply that our earlier results about speculation continue to hold in the recurrent setting.

    Finally, as in the previous analysis, we find that in state B there is no market timing: the
firm does not issue equity before it exhausts its cash holdings. Also, firm value is concave in
w in state B and investment responds positively in w, as the external financing option is out
of the money in state B. In sum, firm behavior in states B and G are drastically different
even in the recurrent model. Financing constraints and stochastic financing opportunities
significantly influence firm value (average q) and investment.



9     Conclusion

We provide a simple integrated framework of dynamic market timing, corporate investment,
and risk management. Financing conditions and supply of external capital change stochas-
tically over time. Firms anticipate the stochastic evolution of these financing opportunities
and respond optimally. In particular, they optimally build war-chests by issuing equity and
hoarding cash, when external financing is sufficiently cheap. For firms anticipating an eq-
uity issuance, investment may be decreasing in the firm’s cash-to-asset ratio: when firms
get closer to equity issuance their investment policy is less constrained by the availability of
internal funds, as the firm anticipates that more cash will be raised through an equity issue
in the near future. We also show that market timing is consistent with risk-seeking behavior
by the firm. The key driving mechanism for these surprising dynamic implications is the
finite duration of “cheap” financing conditions and the fixed cost of equity issuance.


                                               41
   While we provide the first dynamic framework to jointly study market timing, corporate
investment, and risk management, our model is one with exogenous shifts of financing op-
portunities. It would clearly be desirable to consider a general equilibrium setting where the
stochastic financing opportunities arise endogenously. We leave this for future research.

A          A more general formulation of the model

Our text analysis focuses on variations of the two-state model. However, it is straightforward
to generalize our model to a setting with multiple states, denoted by st = 1, · · · , n. Let the
transition rate matrix for the n-state Markov chain be ζ = [ζ ij ]. The n-state Markov
chain can capture both aggregate and firm-specific, both productivity and financing shocks
(examples are business cycle or financial crises shocks). The firm’s expected return on capital,
volatility, and financing costs can all change when the state changes.


A.1        Risk adjustments

To properly adjust for systematic risk in the model, we assume that the economy is charac-
terized by a stochastic discount factor (SDF) Λt , which evolves as

               dΛt                                   X                   
                                                          eκ(st− ,st ) − 1 dMt t− ,
                                                                             (s ,st )
                   = −r (st− ) dt − η (st− ) dZtM +                                                (28)

where r(s) is the risk-free rate in state s, η(s) is the risk price for systematic Brownian shocks
ZtM , κ (i, j) is the relative jump size of the discount factor when the Markov chain switches
                                  (i,j)
from state i to state j, and Mt           is a compensated Poisson process with intensity ζ ij ,

different types of risk in the markets: small systematic shocks generated by the Brownian
motion, and large systematic shocks from the Markov chain. We assume that dZtM is par-
tially correlated with the firm’s productivity shock dZtA , with instantaneous correlation ρdt.
Chen (2010) shows that the SDF in (28) can be generated from a consumption-based asset
pricing model.

   The SDF defines a risk neutral probability measure Q, under which the process for the
firm’s productivity shocks becomes (6). In addition, if a change of state in the Markov chain
corresponds to a jump in the SDF, then the corresponding large shock also carries a risk
premium, which leads to an adjustment of the transition intensity under Q:


                                      ζ̂ ij = eκ(i,j)ζ ij , i 6= j.                               (30)



A.2        Solutions for the n-state model

Under the first best, the HJB equation for the n-state model can be generalized from (8) as
follows,

for each state s = 1, · · · , n and the average q in state s is given by with

                                                               
                                     qsF B = 1 + θs iFs B − ν s .                                 (32)


While there are no closed form solutions for n > 2, it is straightforward to solve the system
of nonlinear equations numerically.
   With financial frictions, the HJB equation is generalized from (11) as follows:

                                                                                 σ2K 2

 for each state s = 1, · · · , n, and W s ≤ W ≤ W s . We conjecture that firm value is
homogeneous of degree one in W and K in each state, so that


                                       P (K, W, s) = ps (w)K,                                     (34)


where ps (w) solves the following system of ODE:

                                                                             σ2
          rs ps (w) = max [(rs − λs ) w + µ̂s − is − gs (is )] p′s (w) + s p′′s (w)
                       is                                                    2

The boundary conditions in each state s are defined in similar ways as in Equation (14-21).



B       Beta Representation

As indicated by the SDF Λt in (28) with n = 2, in state s, the price of risk for technology
shock (risk premium for a unit exposure to the shocks) is λTs = η s , whereas the price of risk
for financing shock is λFs = − (eκs − 1). Thus, we can rewrite the risk premium using the
Beta representation:

                                             T     T     F     F
                                  µR
                                   s (w) = β s (w)λs + β s (w)λs ,                                (36)


where

                                                    p′s (w)
                                    β Ts (w) = ρs σ s                                             (37)
                                                    ps (w)
                                                  ps− (w) − ps (w)
                                   β Fs (w) = ζ s                                                 (38)
                                                        ps (w)

are the technology Beta and financing Beta respectively for the firm in state s. The tech-
nology Beta will be large when the marginal value of cash relative to firm value is high; the
financing Beta will be large when the probability that the financing condition will change is

                                                   46
high, or when the change in financing condition has large impact on the firm value.

   Since there are two sources of aggregate shocks in this model, the CAPM does not hold.
Instead, expected returns can be explained by a two-factor model. We assume that there
are two diversified portfolios T and F , each only subject to one type of aggregate shocks,
i.e. technology shocks or financing shocks, respectively. Suppose their return dynamics are
as follows:


                   dRtT = (rs + µTs )dt + σ Ts dBt ,                                       (39)
                                           F           F     
                   dRtF = (rs + µFs )dt + eκ1 − 1 dMt1 + eκ2 − 1 dMt2 .                    (40)


Then, the stochastic discount factor (28) implies that


                                 µTs = σ Ts η s ,                                          (41)
                                                F
                                 µFs = ζ s (eκs − 1) (eκs − 1) .                           (42)


   We can now rewrite the risk premium in (39) and (40) using Betas as follows:

                                          T           F
                               µR               T           F
                                s (w) = β s (w)µs + β s (w)µs ,                            (43)


where

                                             ρs σ s p′s (w)
                                  β Ts (w) =                                               (44)
                                              σ Ts ps (w)
                                             ps− (w) − ps (w)
                                  β Fs (w) =                                               (45)
                                             ps (w) (eκFs − 1)

are the technology Beta (Beta with respect to Portfolio T ) and financing Beta (Beta with
respect to Portfolio F ) for the firm in state s. The technology Beta will be large when the
marginal value of cash relative to firm value is high; the financing Beta will be large when the
probability that the financing condition will change is high, or when the change in financing
condition has large impact on the firm value.


                                                    47
C      Dynamic Hedging

We now derive the optimal hedging policy in detail for Section 7. The firm’s cash holding
thus evolves as follows:


 dWt = Kt [µ(st )dAt + σ(st )dZt ]−(It + Γt ) dt+dHt −dUt +[r(st )) − λ(st )] Wt dt+ψ t Wt σ m dBt , (46)


where |ψt | ≤ π(st ). To avoid unnecessary repetition, we only consider the case with positive
correlation, i.e., ρ > 0. We consider the more interesting case where the absorbing state is
the crisis state and the firm is currently in the transitory state G. We first summarize the
risk management rules in the absorbing state, effectively the results from BCW. Then, we
analyze the hedge ratio in the transitory state G.


In the absorbing state B. After reaching the absorbing state, the firm faces the same
decision problem as the firm in BCW does. For simplicity, in the crisis state, as in the
previous section, the firm has no external financing but can enter index futures contract.

    BCW show that the optimal hedge ratio (with time-invariant opportunities) is given by
                                                                    
                                                         −ρσ B
                                  ψ ∗B (w)   = max             , −π B .                             (47)
                                                         wσ m

Intuitively, the firm chooses the hedge ratio ψ so that the firm only faces idiosyncratic volatil-
ity after hedging. The hedge ratio that achieves this objective is −ρσ B σ −1
                                                                           m /w. However, this

hedge ratio may not be attainable due to the margin requirement. In that case, the firm
chooses the maximally admissible hedge ratio ψ ∗B (w) = −π B . Equation (47) captures the
effect of margin constraints on hedging. Because there is no hair cut (i.e., ǫ = 0), the hedge
ratio ψ given in (47) is independent of firm value and only depends on w. We next turn to
the focus of this section: hedging in the transitory state G.


In the transitory state G. Before entering the crisis state, the firm has external financing
opportunity. Moreover, the margin requirement may be different (i.e., π G > π B ). In the


                                                     48
transitory state G, the firm chooses its investment policy I and its index futures position
ψW to maximize firm value P (K, W, G) by solving the following HJB equation:


 rG P (K, W, G) = max [(rG − λG ) W + µG K − I − Γ (I, K, G)] PW + (I − δK) PK                 (48)
                    I,ψ
                    1 2 2                                  
                +     σ G K + ψ 2 σ 2m W 2 + 2ρσ m σ G ψW K PW W + ζ [P (K, W, G) − P (K, W, B)] ,
                    2

subject to |ψ| ≤ π G .

   When firm value is concave in cash (i.e., PW W (K, W, G) < 0), we have the same solution
as in the absorbing state with margin π G , i.e. ψ ∗G (w) = max {−ρσ G σ m −1 /w, −π G } . However,
market timing opportunities combined with fixed costs of equity issuance imply that firm
value may be convex in cash, i.e., PW W (K, W, G) > 0 for certain regions of w = W/K.
With convexity, the firm naturally speculates in derivatives markets. Given the margin
requirement, the firm takes the maximally allowed futures position, i.e. the corner solution
ψ G (w) = π G . Note that the firm is long in futures despite positive correlation between its
productivity shock and the index futures. Let w
                                              bG denote the endogenously chosen point at
which PW W (K, W, G) = 0, or p′′G (w
                                   bG ) = 0. We now summarize the firm’s futures position in
the transitory state as follows:
                          
                           max {−ρσ σ −1 /w, −π } , for    w≥w  bG ,
                                    G m         G
               ψ ∗G (w) =                                                                      (49)
                                    πG ,            for w G ≤ w ≤ wbG .

Note the discontinuity of the hedge ratio ψ ∗G (w) in w. The firm switches from a hedger to a
speculator when its cash-capital ratio w falls below w
                                                     bG .
