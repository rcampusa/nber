                                          ABSTRACT

We study how heterogeneity in performance evaluations across supervisors affects employee and
supervisor careers and firm outcomes using data on the performance system of a Scandinavian
service sector firm. We show that supervisors vary widely in how they rate subordinates of
similar quality. To understand the nature of this heterogeneity, we propose a principal-agent
model according to which supervisors can differ in their ability to elicit output from subordinates
or in their taste for leniency when rating subordinates. The model also allows for variation in how
informed firms are about this heterogeneity. Within the context of this model, we can discern the
nature of the heterogeneity across supervisors and how informed firms are about this
heterogeneity by relating estimated supervisor heterogeneity in ratings to worker, supervisor, and
firm outcomes. We find that subordinates matched to a high-rating supervisor are paid
significantly more and their pay is more closely aligned with performance. We also find that
higher raters themselves are paid more and that the teams managed by higher raters perform
better on objective performance measures. This evidence suggests that supervisor heterogeneity
stems, at least in part, from real differences in managerial ability and that firms are at least
partially informed about these differences. We conclude by quantifying how important
heterogeneity in supervisor type is for workers' careers. For a typical worker, matching to a high
rater (90th percentile) relative to a low rater (10th percentile) for just one year results in an
increase in the present discounted value of earnings equivalent to 6-12 percent of an annual
salary.

1    INTRODUCTION
Subjective performance evaluations are a ubiquitous and controversial feature of the modern workplace.


Firms use these evaluations as indicators of worker performance and skills. They aect employee compensa-


tion, task assignment, promotions and retention (Frederiksen, Lange, and Kriechel, 2017). However, ratings


are also aected by the identity of the rater: the worker's supervisor.    For one, performance evaluations


are inherently subjective, so supervisors might dier widely in how they rate equivalent behavior. Further-


more, supervisors have been shown to dier in their ability to manage subordinates, thus aecting how their


subordinates perform on the job (Bertrand and Schoar, 2003; Lazear, Shaw, and Stanton, 2015).             These


dierences in the ability to manage will plausibly inuence the performance ratings subordinates receive.


Little is known, however, about the extent and nature of ratings heterogeneity across supervisors, the degree


to which rms are informed about such heterogeneity, and how it impacts workers' careers.


    If supervisors give dierent ratings for the same underlying performance, then this will undermine the


performance management system.       It will burden workers with unneccesary risk and limit rms ability


to use performance evaluations for setting incentives.    As a consequence, rms may desire to counteract


any heterogeneity with forced curves or other rules restricting the discretion supervisors have when rating


subordinates. However, such policies may unintentionally interfere with how supervisors manage their teams


if heterogeneity in ratings instead stems from real dierences in a manager's ability to elicit output.


    In this paper, we strive to estimate the magnitude and understand the nature of the heterogeneity


in subjective ratings across supervisors.   Using an exceptionally rich data set containing the performance


management system of a Scandinavian service sector rm, we uncover substantial heterogeneity in ratings


across supervisors: we estimate that a worker receives a 30 percent boost in ratings when assigned to a one-


standard-deviation higher-rating supervisor. This heterogeneity is economically important: being assigned


to a high rater (at the 90th percentile of the ratings distribution) for just one year is associated with an


increase in the present discounted value of lifetime earnings at the rm equivalent to 6 to 12 percent of


annual earnings, relative to being assigned to a low rater (10th percentile). The evidence strongly suggests


that supervisors have important impacts on workers' careers inside the rm.


    We develop a simple analytic framework to guide our empirical analysis.       This framework allows su-


pervisors to dier both in managerial ability and in their preferences for leniency when giving ratings.


Furthermore, the model allows the degree to which rms are informed about dierences across supervisors


to vary. In the context of this model, we interpret how supervisor heterogeneity in ratings correlates with


outcomes of subordinates, supervisors, and teams inside the rm. Both subordinates and supervisors earn-


ings are higher and teams perform better on objective output metrics when the supervisors are high raters.




                                                      3
Because of these ndings, we conclude that heterogeneity in ratings is driven primarily by real dierences in


managerial ability that rms are at least partially informed about.


    We follow a long tradition in personnel economics and postulate that the central human resource challenge


facing the rm is to incentivize workers to exert eort (Holmstrom, 1979; Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1987;


Lazear, 2000). The three actors in our model are the workers without supervisory function, the supervisors,


and the rm. Neither rms nor supervisors directly observe the eort workers exert. Supervisors observe


worker output and report on this output to the rm. Supervisors dier along two dimensions. First, they


vary in how much weight they place on reporting ratings truthfully as opposed to favorably. We refer to


this heterogeneity as leniency bias.
                                             1 Second, they dier in their managerial ability, which aects their

subordinates marginal costs of eort (or, equivalently, the output per unit eort).                      Given this setup, we


consider the optimal linear compensation contracts of workers as well as salary contracts for supervisors.


Our model also allows us to ask how the optimal contracts depend on how informed rms are about the


dierences between supervisors.          This model yields comparative statics that we can take to the data to


disentangle whether ratings heterogeneity is largely driven by leniency or ability and whether rms are


largely informed or uninformed about such heterogeneity.


    In our empirical analysis, we rst estimate how much dispersion there is in ratings across supervisors using


the observed dispersion in supervisor xed eects from a regression of performance ratings on supervisor and


worker xed eects, as well as controls. This estimate adjusts for the well-known correlated measurement


error problem inherent in double xed eects models (see Andrews, Gill, Schank, and Upward (2008),


Card, Heining, and Kline (2013), and Kline, Saggio, and Solvsten (2018)).                       We then estimate how rater


heterogeneity correlates with outcomes of subordinates, supervisors, and teams. In this analysis, we use a


variety of approaches to account for measurement error in the key explanatory variable, rater heterogeneity:


we use a split-sample instrumental variables approach that is robust to misspecifying the contemporaneous


error structure as well as estimates based on either the xed eects directly or the bias correction discussed


above.
         2

    We nd that subordinates of high raters are paid more than subordinates matched to low raters. This


nding could be explained, in the context of our model, as being driven by heterogeneity in managerial

   1 Guilford (1954) introduced leniency bias to describe stable dierences across raters in how they rate others that are unrelated
to productive dierences among ratees.
   2 Attemps to estimate the variation in unobserved heterogeneity in wages across workers and rms using xed eects estimates
commonly run into the problem that the latter are estimated with error (e.g., Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis, 1999). In our
analysis, we estimate the variation in worker and supervisor eects in ratings (the unobserved eects) using the heteroskedasticity
robust estimator of Kline, Saggio, and Solvsten (2018). We then worker outcomes such as earnings onto the unobserved worker
and supervisor eects. To correct for bias here, we adapt the Andrews et al. (2008) approach (which requires homoskedasticity)
to a stacked system of equations with a double xed eect structure.        This allows us to estimate a bias-adjusted variance-
covariance matrix of the unobserved eects in performance ratings and earnings, which we then use to compute regression
coecients.




                                                                 4
ability, or by heterogeneity in leniency about which the rm is uninformed.          However, we also nd that


teams managed by high raters tend to outperform those managed by low raters on a set of objective criteria


available at the branch level; we nd a similar eect when we examine individual nancial performance


measures available for a small subsample. These ndings are consistent with heterogeneity in ability across


managers - more capable managers lower the eort costs and increase the output of their team members. Two


further ndings corroborate this interpretation. First, higher raters earn more themselves, suggesting they


are more valued by the rm. Second, pay of subordinates working for higher raters tends to be more closely


aligned with their performance, as implied by our model if high raters are also better managers. Finally,


workers matched to higher raters self-report that they are more satised with their immediate supervisors


and we nd suggestive evidence that they are less likely to change supervisors or quit the rm, though these


latter results are less robust. This suggests workers benet from being matched to a high rater, even though


they also exert more eort.


   Within the context of our model, our empirical ndings have a consistent and clear interpretation:


higher raters tend to be better managers and the rm has some but not perfect information on who the


better managers are. That higher raters are better managers explains why their teams perform better on


objective criteria.   Furthermore, subordinates of better managers/higher raters tend to exert more eort,


which explains why they are paid more. When the rm is at least partially informed about who the better


managers are, they reward better managers with higher compensation. In addition, they optimally expose


subordinates of better managers to stronger incentives since better managers reduce the marginal cost of


eort of their subordinates. We also nd evidence that suggests that employees earn economic rents from


working for higher raters: their jobs are more stable and they report higher work satisfaction when working


for high raters. This leads us to conclude that the rm is not fully informed about the ratings heterogeneity


across supervisors, since it would otherwise extract these rents. Consistent with this notion, we nd that


rents attenuate for supervisors with higher tenure, about whom the rm presumably has more information.


   We go beyond the connes of our static model to quantify how much rather heterogeneity aects the


careers of workers. We allow dierences across supervisors to dynamically impact worker pay, both directly


and through promotion probabilities. We nd that assignment to a higher rater has lasting positive eects


on individual compensation. This arises because the eects on pay persist for some time and because being


matched with a high rater increases the odds of a promotion. We thus conclude that better managers have


large and real impacts on the careers of their subordinates: for a typical worker, matching to a high rater


(90th percentile) relative to a low rater (10th percentile) for just one year results in an increase in the present


discounted value of earnings equivalent to 6 to 12 percent of an annual salary.


   Our work contributes to several important literatures in personnel and labor economics. The literature on



                                                        5
productivity eects of managers predominantly studies upper management and CEOs (Bennedsen, Perrez-


Gonzales, Wolfenzon 2007; Bertrand and Schoar, 2003; Kaplan, Klebanov, and Sorensen 2012). Ours is one


of the few papers to explore productivity eects of supervisors lower in the rm hierarchy. Lazear, Shaw, and


Stanton (2015) exploit the daily rotation of line managers to estimate how productivity of subordinates in a


low-skilled service task (transactions per hour) varies across these managers.
                                                                                       3 Consistent with their work, we

nd that supervisors dier in their ability to elicit output from subordinates. In contrast to their setting, we


study workers performing complex tasks for whom objective measures of performance are intrinsically hard


to come by. To do so, we must estimate a model of behavior when information is imperfect. Our analysis


exploits both objective and subjective measures of productivity, as well as worker and supervisor pay and


career outcomes within the rm.         We conclude that subjective evaluations and objective performance are


closely related and that the rm is at least partially informed about the dierences in productivity across


supervisors. Our paper thus complements Lazear, Shaw, and Stanton (2015) in nding large productivity


dierences across supervisors in a very dierent setting than the simple service sector jobs they consider. We


go beyond their analysis and provide an approach for understanding variation in manager behavior in a more


typical setting where objective performance metrics are dicult to craft and rms instead rely on subjective


ratings. Our analysis sheds light on the crucial role lower and middle managers play in the wide-spread and


growing use of subjective ratings systems.


   We contribute to a small literature in economics on the role and use of subjective performance measures


by directly addressing whether the key subjective component of ratings, the supervisor eect, contains bias.
                                                                                                                           4

The question of bias in subjective evaluations has been taken up in an extensive literature in personnel


psychology.     This literature, however, rarely goes beyond documenting the presence of bias and tends to


think of the rm as passive in the face of any reporting biases.              Our approach is economic in the sense


that we allow the rm to actively respond to the presence of bias in subjective ratings in designing its


performance systems. Integrating the behavioral responses of the various actors improves our understanding


of performance management inside the rm.


   Even though we allow for bias related to supervisors in subjective evaluations, our approach emphasizes


that subjective evaluations are informative about dierences in skills across workers.                 This is important


for an inuential literature in labor and personnel economics that emphasizes the importance of employer

  3 Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) show substantial heterogeneity in management practices across rms.   More recently, Homan
and Tadelis (2018) nd evidence that manager people skills are an important driver of subordinate retention.
  4 Concerns   over how to interpret subjective performance ratings go back to Medo and Abraham (1980, 1981), at least. An
overview of this literature can be found in Frederiksen, Lange, and Kriechel (2018). They summarize empirical patterns in the
data on subjective performance evaluations from six of the more prominent papers in this literature, including Baker, Gibbs,
and Holmstrom (1994a, 1994b), Flabbi and Ichino (2001), Dohmen (2004), Gibbs and Hendriks (2004), Frederiksen and Takats
(2011), and Frederiksen (2013). Theoretical papers on the topic include Tirole (1986), Milgrom (1988), Prendergast and Topel
(1993, 1996), and MacLeod (2003).

learning in the labor market, but abstracts away from how this learning takes place.
                                                                                                      5 Despite the presence

of supervisor bias, rms can learn about worker productivity using subjective performance evaluations even


when, as it is true in most modern workplaces, good objective measures of individual performance are not


available.


     Overall, our paper demonstrates that rater heterogeneity is an important feature of the employment


relationship at this rm and has sizable impacts on the careers and outcomes of employees and supervisors,


as well as for the rm itself. Rater heterogeneity cannot simply be interpreted as dierential leniency bias.


Instead, it is part and parcel of dierential ability of managing and eliciting eort from subordinates. This


nding is true in the rm we study and naturally may depend on the setting, but the concept that managerial


heterogeneity in ratings should be taking seriously and can be diagnosed with observable data is novel and


important.        On a practical level, thisour ndings suggest caution in addressing rater heterogeneity using


practices such as forced scales or disincentivizing deviations from rating norms. Such practices might well


interfere with the ability of supervisors to eectively manage their teams.
                                                                                         6

     The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.                 Section 2 introduces the rm and the data at our


disposal and presents new stylized facts on heterogeneity across managers in subjective performance ratings.


In Section 3 we develop the model and show what it implies for how earnings and performance are related to


rater heterogeneity. Section 4 contains the empirical analysis proposed by our model. Section 5 investigates


the dynamic eects of supervisors on pay. Section 6 concludes.




2      FIRM AND DATA

2.1 Firm Overview
We rely on personnel data covering the domestic workforce of a large Scandinavian service sector rm


between 2004 and 2014. The performance management system was introduced just prior to 2004, when our


data begins. At any given time, the rm employed about 13,000 workers. This number uctuates slightly


over the years but does not exhibit a discernible trend. The workforce at this rm is highly educated and


the rm is known to be an attractive employer. We briey summarize the rm and data here, and provide


more detail in Appendix A.


     The rm consists of a central corporate oce and an extensive branch network with several hundred

    5 See   Altonji and Pierret (2001), Farber and Gibbons (1996), Gibbons and Waldman (1999, 2006), Lange (2007), and Kahn
and Lange (2014).
    6 For   theoretical work on the trade-o between rules and discretion inside rms, see Bolton and Dewatripont (2012), Dessein
(2002), Alonso and Matouschek (2008), Aghion and Tirole (1997), and Li, Matouschek, and Powell (2017). On the empirical
side, Homan, Kahn, and Li (2018) nd that managers perform worse than an algorithm when choosing hires in a low-skilled
service sector setting. This contrasts our own nding and suggests the value of managerial subjective assessments varies across
settings.




                                                                 7
branches.
            7 The workforce is roughly equally split across the central oce and the branch network. Tasks

within the branch network are fairly uniform and involve close contact with clients, while workers in the


central oce serve a variety of functions.         Branches vary in size but the median employee in the branch


network works in a branch with 17 employees. Our analysis covers all employees of the rm, regardless of


whether they work in a branch or in the central oce.


   There are 11 identiable job levels. The typical branch has a branch manager (levels 911), a deputy


branch manager (levels 89), 69 senior (level 6) and 5-7 junior (levels 3-5) workers in client-facing roles, and


sometimes a trainee (level 1). In the central oce, the distribution of jobs tends somewhat more towards


higher level jobs. Churn is fairly low at this rm and there is some movement between the branch network


and the central oce.


   Our data contains compensation measures, positions within the rm, and demographics. In addition, as


part of the performance management system, each worker receives a rating from a supervisor. We observe


these ratings, as well as a link to the supervisor responsible for the rating. The rating is meant to describe


overall performance in a given year. In the branches, ratings are typically provided by the branch manager


or by a deputy branch manager. In the central oce, the titles are dierent, but ratings usually come from


the immediate supervisor.


   Compensation decisions at this rm are made roughly once a year  timed to follow the performance


review period  and involve input from actors all along the hierarchy.            Workers receive salaries and are


eligible for bonuses. In any given year, only a fraction of employees will however receive a bonus (see Table


2.) The overall pay pool is set at the top of the rm. It is then broken down to divisions below, cascading


down to managers at lower levels of the hierarchy.            Typically a pay pool will be set for 10-15 employees


either in a branch or subdivision of corporate. From there, managers have a fair amount of discretion to


allocate both raises and bonuses from these set pay pools. The pay pool for a given branch or division is set


based on historical patterns, nancials, other performance indicators, union negotiations, and macroeconomic


conditions. Lower level managers also provide input into the process of determining the pay pool for their


units. For example, a manager might argue that unit A outperformed unit B and request a larger pool for


the former. Managers also report upwards that individual workers or teams require larger raises/bonuses, for


retention reasons, because they performed extraordinary tasks, or because a promotion cannot immediately


be accommodated.


   This compensation system might be described as a exible hybrid between a top-down and bottom-up


system. The top-down structure allows upper level management to keep control of the total wage bill. At


the same time, lower level managers do report on the conditions and needs of their units and inuence how

  7 Upon   request of the rm, we can not disclose the exact number.

pay is broken down within the rm. The magnitude of their inuence can vary across branches, divisions and


job levels. Such a system strikes us as common across a wide range of rms.
                                                                                            8 Importantly, managers retain

some ability to give one worker a bit more without necessarily taking away from another team member.


The rm is aware that rigid constraints on compensation choices for small groups of workers would make


cooperation in teamwork settings dicult.




2.2 Estimation Sample and Summary Statistics
Our estimation sample consists of 85,269 full-time worker-year observations. Appendix A.2 details our sample


restrictions. The most important is the requirement that an observation has a performance rating. About a


quarter of workers lack a performance measure, largely because the performance system took a few years to


be fully rolled out. In 2004, 43 percent received performance ratings but the system spread rapidly; by 2008,


83 percent of the employees were covered. The coverage stayed at that level or slightly above throughout the


remainder of the sample period (through 2014). Workers are also less likely to have a performance review


during their rst and last years at the rm, simply because they may not be present during the review


period.
           9

    This estimation sample serves to identify the supervisor eects central to our analysis.                       Within this


sample, we have 77,682 observations with a compensation measure (compensation is not available in our


nal year of data, 2014), stemming from 14,214 unique workers.                    We also take advantage of information


from worker satisfaction surveys, nancial performance, and branch-level objective performance measures.


As detailed below, availability of these variables is often limited to subsets of the data, which implies that


the number of observations sometimes varies across empirical specications.


    The performance ratings range from 1 (unsatisfactory) to 5 (outstanding). The distribution of the perfor-


mance score is shown in Table 1. As is common among companies using subjective evaluations (Frederiksen,


Lange, and Kriechel, 2018), the ratings are concentrated in a small subset of the support: 91 percent of


ratings are either a 3 or a 4.
                                      10   For this reason, our empirical investigation is built around a pass-fail

   8 For   example, in a university setting, the provost will set the pay pool for divisions, such as Arts and Sciences, and then
deans will distribute this pay pool to academic departments, where nally a chair might have some discretion in allocating
raises and bonuses within their department. In this process, there is feedback up the hierarchy as well. For example, members
of the individual academic departments will have an easier time assessing performance of its professors, and determining who
might need a retention raise or who should be brought up for a promotion case, etc. This feedback would naturally impact the
overall compensation received by members of the department.
   9 There     is some systematic variation in who receives ratings in that more stable workers (e.g., those with higher tenure
and those outside of the lowest job levels) are more likely to be rated. However, after controlling for year eects, remaining
observables such as tenure or job level have little power in predicting whether an individual will be missing a performance
rating.
  10 The   rm does not restrict the distribution of performance ratings a manager can give, but it does encourage supervisors
to use the full scale, and holds training meetings every so often to help supervisors calibrate their ratings. The distribution of
ratings at this rm is consistent with that observed in other rms we are familiar with (see Frederiksen, Lange, and Kriechel
(2018)).

    Table 2 provides summary statistics for the estimation sample. We report earnings (and its components)


relative to average per capita earnings in this country. Earnings average 185 percent of the national mean,


consistent with this being a sought-after rm with skilled workers. Roughly 30 percent of the workers receive


a bonus, and the bonus pool has historically been close to 6 percent of the wage pool.


    Next, 83 percent of workers remain in the sample in the next year, and most of these also stay in the same


business unit (dened as either the branch or the function in the central oce).
                                                                                                        12 Of those employees present

in consecutive years, 11 percent are promoted and 1 percent are demoted annually.                                Finally, 1 percent of


workers are laid o in the next two years.
                                                      13 Supervisor relationships are somewhat sticky; 65% of employees

who work at the rm in consecutive years and are neither promoted nor demoted keep the same supervisor.


Overall, about 50 percent of workers remain with the same supervisor from one year to the next.
                                                                                                                               14 We

describe this mobility in more detail in Appendix A.3.


    Our data contain two measures of objective performance. During 20072010, we have rankings of branches


within peer-groups dened by the rm.                  The rankings are based on a set of Key Performance Indicators


(KPIs) and include measures of nancial performance of the branches, as well as other metrics (for example,


customer satisfaction). The set of KPIs changes from year to year as the rm's focus evolves. Branches are


placed into peer groups based on size and customer base, and these peer groups vary from year to year. The


average peer group has 17 branches. We call these branch rankings KPI rankings hereafter. As reported


in Table 2, the average rating (ranking divided by number of branches in the peer group) was 0.53.


    Our second measure of objective performance refers to nancial performance of a subset of individual


employees working in the branch network. We cannot reveal the precise content of these nancial measures,

  11 We   adopt this terminology for ease of exposition. Naturally, the rm does not report to workers that they have failed
their review, and their interpretation may be more nuanced.
  12 About   half of exits from the sample are due to quits or layos and half are workers who temporarily do not meet our criteria
for having non-missing performance. Among the latter are many who are exiting the rm in the following business year just
prior to receiving a performance rating.
  13 We   take a two-year perspective because workers are less likely to receive a performance review in their last year at the rm.
Worker exit rates are higher in the unrestricted sample, which includes workers who do not receive ratings. We believe this is
because, as noted, more stable workers are somewhat more likely to receive ratings.
  14 None   of these variables are dened in the last year of data, since they are right censored.

Note: The summary statistics are reported for the sample used to estimate the fixed effects in the ratings equation (see section
2). Not all variables are available for all observations in this sample. "Pass" is our constructed performance measure that equals
1 if the subjective performance evaluation was 4 or 5, and equals 0 if it was 1, 2, or 3. Stay in firm, in business unit, with
supervisor, promotion and demotion refer to any change in the worker's status over the next year. Business unit is the branch
or function in the central office. KPI rating is the branch-level ranking divided by the number of peer branches in the
comparison set. Financial performance is the year-over-year growth rate of the individual's financial portfolio. Bottom-up
evaluation is the average of seven questions workers answer regarding their satisfication with their supervisors. Responses
range from 1 to 10; we average answers on all responses and norm the variable to have a standard deviation of 1. "In
Branches" equals 1 if the worker was in the branch network and 0 if in the central corporate office.
1) Divided by average earnings in the country. Income variables not available in last year of data, 2014. 2) Restricted to not
right-censored obs, excluding the last year of data (last two years for layoff rate). "Stay in sample" denotes the probability of
being retained in the estimation sample in the following year. By far the most common reason for leaving the sample is to leave
the firm within 2 years. 3) Restricted to not right-censored obs that did not quit or get laid off in respective year.

but one way to think about them is the following: Employees in client-facing roles administer a portfolio


of clients and over the year these portfolios produce returns. We have information on these returns for the


years 2014 and 2015. The measure we use is the year-over-year growth rate of the value of the portfolio.


We refer to these measures as nancial performance hereafter. In these years, the average growth rate was


-0.07, though this is only for a subset of the rm's overall nancial performance.


    We also have access to job satisfaction surveys. These surveys include questions about the employees'


perceptions of supervisor performance.
                                                15 These questions are answered on a 10-point scale and we use the

average across the seven questions related to the supervisor.                    The minimum score is 1 and the maximum


score is 10. Our outcome measure, hereafter bottom-up evaluations, takes an average across these questions,


normed to have a standard deviation of 1. The average of this measure is 4.7.
                                                                                                  16

    In our analysis, we control for both worker and supervisor characteristics. Supervisors are on average


only about one year older than the average employee (45.2 vs. 44 years), and have one and a half more years


of tenure in the rm (19.6 vs. 18 years).


    In summary, we have unusually rich panel data with information on the vertical and horizontal structure


of the rm, the careers of individuals, subjective performance evaluations and the identities of the raters,


measures of objective performance and survey responses from worker satisfaction surveys. We know of no


equivalent data set in the literature.




2.3 Variation in Performance Measures
We now demonstrate that supervisors dier substantially in how they rate their subordinates. In equation


1, the indicator variable      pit   denotes whether individual       i at time t receives a 4 or 5 on his or her performance

evaluation. We relate this event to an individual eect               Î±i ,   a supervisor eect   Ïs(i,t) ,   as well as time-varying

  15 The   employees are asked to respond to 7 items: 1) The professional skills of my immediate superior, 2) The leadership skills
of my immediate superior, 3) My immediate superior is energetic and eective, 4) My immediate superior gives constructive
feedback on my work, 5) My immediate superior delegates responsibility and authority so I can complete my work eectively, 6)
My immediate superior helps me to develop personally and professionally, and 7) What my immediate superior says is consistent
with what he/she does.
  16 It   is unusual to have employee satisfaction data merged with personnel les (Frederiksen, 2017). Employers  including
our rm  usually contract with outside consulting companies to conduct employee satisfaction surveys. This is done with the
primary purpose of maintaining the employees' anonymity. By collecting the data at arm's length, the rms hope to induce
truthful reporting by employees. The consulting rms then typically report to the rm the average employee satisfaction scores
at the branch/unit/department level. As researchers we were able to obtain individual survey responses and merge them onto
the personnel records. Hence, we know how a given employee evaluates his or her superior, even though the rm itself was
not able to make this link. Supplements to surveys such as the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the German
Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), and the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) sometimes do contain employee satisfaction
data, but, naturally, such data is not linked to employer or supervisor data.




                                                                 12

                                                                     17

    Estimating such a double xed eects model requires sucient variation generated by worker mobility


across supervisors. In our data, workers frequently move between supervisors. In the unbalanced 20042014


panel, the average employee had 3.3 (s.d. of 1.5) dierent supervisors. Only 10% of those observed for at


least 2 years are rated by the same supervisor during their entire time at the rm. Employees who were with


the rm throughout all of 2004-2014 had on average 4.25 dierent supervisors. Similarly, supervisors manage


many dierent employees over time, with some employees joining or leaving their teams almost every year.


The average supervisor manages 10.38 (s.d. of 6.74) employees in a given year and 27 dierent employees


over the full time period they are recorded as supervisors in our data. In fact, the workforce in this rm is


so well connected that the largest connected set covers the entire rm. This rm is thus characterized by


frequent moves between workers and supervisors, helpful for estimating the xed eects that we require (see


Appendix A.3).


    Even though supervisor moves are common, the double xed eects specications requires an exogeneity


assumption regarding this mobility. In particular, we are worried that sorting based on time-varying perfor-


mance might bias our estimates of equation 1. Following Card, Heining, and Kline (2013), we present an event


study of performance for workers who change supervisors (gure 1) to help evaluate whether non-random


sorting is present in our data.


    We split the set of supervisors into quartiles based on their average propensity to pass subordinates. We


use pass probability of co-workers (the leave-out mean) to avoid selecting on a worker's own performance. We


then plot average ratings of workers in the two years before and two years after they move across supervisors


as a function of origin and destination supervisor category.
                                                                          18 For simplicity, the gure focuses on people

leaving quartile 4 supervisors (those with the highest likelihood of passing their subordinates) and quartile


1 supervisors (those with the lowest likelihood).


    Figure 1 makes several important points. First, in the two years before moving, workers currently matched


to a high rater have similar (high) performance, regardless of whether they are about to move to a dierent

  17 The   controls include for the worker (Xit ) indicators for ve-year age and tenure groups, gender, and job level.   For the
supervisor (Ys(i,t),t ) the controls include indicators for ve-year age groups, gender and job level. We do nd some variation
in average ratings across supervisor characteristics. In particular, older supervisors and supervisors that are higher up the job
hierarchy tend to give higher ratings. We also control for an indicator for whether or not the worker is in a branch network,
and year xed eects. The latter help control for dierences in usage of performance ratings as they become more common in
the rm.
  18 There   are about 1,500 to 2,000 worker-year observations in each mobility pair. The pass probabilities used to dene types
of moves and plotted in the gure have been residualized on the same controls specied above, except for the worker and
supervisor xed eects.

                              Notes: Figure shows mean pass rate of workers who change supervisors. Supervisors are
                              classified into quartiles based on their propensity to pass co-workers (leave-out mean).
                              Pass probabilities are residualized on our standard controls.




                                                                        14
high rater or to a lower rater. Similarly, workers matched to a low rater have fairly similar (low) performance


regardless of their destination. This lack of pre-trend in performance alleviates some of the concern about


worker sorting. For instance, we do not observe that workers who are already on a decline move towards


lower raters.


    Second, transitioning across supervisor type has important consequences for performance. Workers mov-


ing across supervisor type experience large changes in performance, while workers who change supervisors


within quartile experience little change in performance. That is, average ratings fan out for the dierent


types of moves only after the move occurs.


    Third, the eects of mobility on performance are symmetric across dierent types of moves and of roughly


similar magnitude. A worker moving from a high to a low rater experiences a sizable drop in pass probability,


while a worker moving from a low to a high rater experiences a sizable increase of comparable magnitude.


    The three ndings documented in Figure 1 suggest that the basic specication with additively separable


worker and supervisor eects characterized the data well.


    We would now like to estimate the variation in the unobserved eects                     {Î±i , Ïs }   using the variation in the
                             n          o
estimated xed eects         Î±Ìi , ÏÌs     from equation 1. However, we run into a well-known incidental parameters


problem. The time dimension of the panel is xed and relatively short (11 years at most) so that we have


only a few observations to estimate each employee and supervisor xed eect  the average supervisor rates


in 3.7 years and the average worker is present in 7.3 years. These xed eects are unbiased but inconsistent


estimates of the unobserved eects. The variance of the xed eects will therefore overstate the variance in


the unobserved eects because it contains an estimation error. Also, the estimation error can be expected


to correlate across worker and supervisor eects.
                                                             19

    Andrews, Gill, Schank, and Upward (2008) show how to address this problem by adjusting the variance-


covariance matrix of the estimated xed eects using the variance-covariance matrix of the estimation error


for these same xed eects. In double-xed eect models, this adjustment will tend to reduce the size of the


estimated variances compared to a naive estimator. The Andrews et al. (2008) approach however requires


that the unobservables are homoskedastic, an assumption that is necessarily violated in our context since


our outcomes are binary.           We follow Kline, Saggio, and Solvsten (2018) to estimate the variation in the


unobserved eects while allowing for heteroskedasticity.
                                                                         20 Hereafter, we refer to the estimates obtained with

this procedure as the bias-adjusted estimates.

  19 This correlated estimation error will likely be negative.   To see this, note that the model is saturated in worker and supervisor
eects so the predicted value from the xed eect regression necessarily goes through the sample mean for each worker and
supervisor. If a worker eect is estimated with positive error, the supervisor eect will tend to be estimated with negative error
to bring the predicted values for observations associated with that worker back through the mean.
  20 See   also Card, Heining, and Kline (2013) and Gaure (2014). To arrive at our estimates we rely on the matlab code helpfully
provided by Kline, Saggio, and Solvesten (2018) at https://github.com/rsaggio87/LeaveOutTwoWay.




                                                                    15
    Table 3, Panel A shows both unadjusted (column 1) and bias-adjusted (column 2) estimates of the second


moments of       Î±, Ï,   and   p .   The adjustment for sampling error has a fairly strong eect on the moments, reduc-


ing their magnitude by about a third.
                                                     21 Either way, we nd that   Ïs   varies substantially across supervisors.


Using the bias-adjusted moments in column 2, we nd that the variance of                      Ïs   is 0.019. This means that a


one-standard-deviation increase in the supervisor ratings eect amounts to a 13.7 percentage point (30%)


increase in the probability of receiving a passing grade. Thus, a move from the 10th to the 90th percentile


in the distribution of         Ïs ,   assuming that    Ïs   is normally distributed, is associated with a 35 percentage point


increase in the probability of receiving a passing grade. The heterogeneity at the worker level is even larger


 a standard deviation increase in              Î±i   amounts to a 25.9 percentage point increase (56%) in the probability


of receiving a passing grade.


    We also nd substantial idiosyncratic variation in ratings, holding constant these xed eects and a rich


set of time-varying controls. This residual variance is an input into the bias adjustment and must also be


adjusted. We use a within-transformation of the error term, demeaning by team (worker-supervisor pairs)


to obtain an unbiased and consistent estimate of this variance. This dierences out unobserved eects that


are not consistently estimated. In practice, this adjustment has only a small eect on our estimate of the


variance in the idiosyncratic component of ratings.


    Finally, we estimate the covariance between worker and supervisor eects to be quite small (-0.0093 using


the bias adjustment).            Thus any systematic worker sorting across supervisors based on xed performance


dierences is likely small.
                                      22 This is plausible given the high degree of churn between workers and supervisors

described above, and the rich set of controls also included in the performance regression.


    Panel B of Table 3 reports the variation in ratings explained by the dierent components in equation


1. We provide R-squares and F-statistics for: the controls alone, controls plus worker xed eects, controls


plus supervisor xed eects, and the full model. We nd that both sets of xed eects explain a substantial


amount of the variation in ratings.               Given that we have signicantly more worker eects than supervisor


eects, the R-squared with the worker eects (column 2) is quite a bit larger than that with supervisor


eects (column 3). However, the F-statistics show that per xed eect the variation explained by each set is


nearly identical. Furthermore, from column 4, we observe that the F-statistics on the combined restrictions


is nearly identical to those in columns 2 and 3. This means that the variation explained by the two sets of


xed eects is close to orthogonal, which follows from the nding in Panel A that the estimated eects are

  21 The   problem for which we need to adjust arises because of estimation error in the xed eects. An ad-hoc, non-technical
approach to this problem is to estimate the variance of the unobserved eects employing only xed eects from workers and
supervisors that we observe a minimum number of times. We implement this approach allowing the minimum cut-o on the
number of observations to increase. As the cut-o increases, we nd that the variances of the xed eects converge towards
those found using the Kline, Saggio, and Solvesten (2008) approach. This increases our condence that the bias-adjustment
succeeds in identifying the actual variation in unobserved eects across workers and supervisors in this rm.
  22 Naturally   the covariances between the unobserved eects and the error term are 0.

only weakly correlated. Overall, we nd that both worker and supervisor eects have substantial explanatory


power for ratings.




3       MODEL
In the previous section, we saw that there is substantial heterogeneity in ratings behavior of supervisors. In


this section, we develop a model with testable predictions that allows us to distinguish between the sources


of ratings heterogeneity and to determine how informed the rm is about such dierences across supervisors.


We allow for two types of heterogeneity.                  First, supervisors might dier in terms of their leniency bias:


observing the same performance, some supervisors are simply more inclined to give high ratings than others.


Second, supervisors may dier in managerial ability: some supervisors elicit higher performance from their


workers. These two hypotheses have dierential implications for worker, supervisor, and rm outcomes that


can be tested using our detailed data on subjective and objective performance as well as data on worker and


supervisor career outcomes. See Appendix B for more detail and proofs of the propositions.




3.1 Basic Setup
We consider a static model where the marginal product of an employee,                              i,   who is not in a supervisory role


(a worker) is     qi .   As expressed in equation 2, we assume that this marginal product (output) depends on


eort   ei ,   which is not directly observed by the supervisor or by the rm. Worker productivity also depends


on the worker's productive type              Î±i   and a random component              Îµqi .   This component is normally distributed


with mean 0 and variance           Ïq2   and is independent of       (ei , Î±i ).   For simplicity, we assume that             Î±i   is observed by


all parties (workers, supervisors, the current rm, and prospective rms).
                                                                                                   23




                                                            qi = ei + Î±i + Îµqi                                                                (2)




The rm does not directly observe             qi ;   however, the supervisor assigned to worker                  i (denoted by the subscript

s)   does.     Having observed      qi ,   supervisors report a rating         ri    to the rm.        Below we introduce two dimen-


sions of heterogeneity across supervisors: (a) heterogeneity in supervisors' abilities                              (Âµs ),   which impacts the


workers' costs of eort, and (b) heterogeneity in the supervisors' willingness to report generously on worker


performance       (Î²s ).   From now on we suppress individual subscripts unless necessary for clarity. We retain the


supervisor subscripts to indicate that a variable varies across supervisors.

 23 In this static setup,   imperfect information about    Î±i   is simply absorbed in the noise term     Îµqi .   As long as the noise surrounding
Î±i   is uncorrelated with the other elements of the model it has no implications for the derived results. For a dynamic setting
with career concerns, see Gibbons and Murphy (1992).




                                                                      18
       The timing of the model is as follows:



   1. Workers and the rm sign contracts that specify the wage function contingent on known supervisor                                           (s)

         characteristics.



   2. Workers match to supervisors, observe their supervisor's type, exert eort                                   e,   and produce    q.

   3. Supervisors observe              q   and provide ratings      r.

   4. Workers are paid according to their contracted wage function.



As is common in the literature, we assume that workers have Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA)

Able supervisors reduce the marginal cost of eort and                          Âµs      parameterizes this idea: better supervisors have


higher       Âµs .   Workers take      Âµs   as given when they choose their eort level. All else equal, workers for better


supervisors will exert more eort. We term                   Âµs    managerial ability.

Supervisors have preferences for accuracy in reporting                         (Î³Ës )   and they dier in terms of their preferences for
                

Firms compete for supervisors in a competitive labor market. In expectation, any realized


supervisor-employee match therefore needs to earn zero-prot. Thus, the compensation of supervisors                                          ws

will be equal to the value of the expected output of the match net of the compensation going to the


employee.



Maximizing supervisor utility with respect to                  r   yields:



                                                                         Î²Ës

  24 The     above formulation normalizes the marginal product of eort in equation                  (2)   to one and allows the marginal costs of
eort in equation        (3)   to vary across supervisors. An observationally equivalent formulation would normalize the marginal cost
of eort and allow for variation in the marginal product of eort across supervisors. What is important is only the ratio of the
marginal product to the marginal cost of eort so that it is irrelevant whether we allow for heterogeneity across supervisors in
eqs.   (2)   or   (3).




                                                                          19

       Hence, supervisors report observed output                      q   plus a supervisor-specic parameter        Î²s =   Î³Ës which we refer

to as leniency bias as it measures the strength of the motive to report favorably relative to the motive to


report truthfully.


       Substituting       (2)    in   (5)   and denoting by      es   the equilibrium eort level that subordinates of supervisor           s

exert, we get:


                                                      rit = Î±i + (es + Î²s ) + Îµqit = Î±i + Ïs + Îµqit                                       (6)



       The parameter         Ïs       summarizes how ratings vary with the supervisor. As discussed above, this variation


can arise either because supervisors dier in their managerial ability                      Âµs or because they dier in their leniency

Î²s .25

       We now consider contracts that specify all payo-relevant aspects of the employment relationship, includ-


ing the assignment              (Âµs , Î²s )   and the mapping of observed ratings to wages. At the contracting stage, agents


(workers, supervisors, and the rm) share information about supervisor types, though this information may


be imperfect.
                       26 We discuss the empirical implications of variation in worker ability                       Î±,   supervisor leniency


Î²s ,   and managerial ability               Âµs   using two propositions. The rst presents results for the case where agents are


perfectly informed about                 (Âµs , Î²s )   and the second for the case when agents are only imperfectly informed.
                                                                                                                                           27

       As is common in the literature, we restrict attention to wage contracts that are linear in the ratings.


Thus, we consider contracts of the form                      wi = ais + bis ri .28   The parameters   (ais , bis )   of these wage contracts


are allowed to vary with information on worker and supervisor types available at the contracting stage. The


term      bis   represents all components of pay that covary with contemporaneous performance.                                  We hereafter


refer to        bis   as the piece-rate, following a common practice in the literature on linear pay-for-performance


schemes.


       We assume that the rm competes for workers and supervisors in a perfectly competitive market so that


outside options equal expected productivity and compensation is set to make agents indierent across rms.


We assume subordinate ratings do not directly enter into supervisor pay.

  25 Eq.      6 retains the individual index i to emphasize the connection to the double-xed eect specication estimated above.
We also retain the index in the discussion of the wage contract that follows to be clear about how individual variation across
types    Î±i   aect contracting.
  26 Regarding        the assignment of workers to supervisors, we note that worker type      Î± enters additively in the production function
and does not aect the risk-eort trade-o so that there are no complementarities between              Î± and (Âµs , Î²s ) . Thus, in equilibrium
any assignment is viable and both positive and negative assortative matching are entirely consistent with our set-up.
  27 While       we allow for imperfect information about supervisor type, we assume this information is common to all market
participants so that supervisors are paid their expected marginal product.                  This deviates from an important literature on
asymmetric learning whereby the incumbent rm retains an information advantage over competing rms (Greenwald (1986),
Gibbons and Katz (1991), Acemoglu and Pischke (1998), Schonberg (2007), Pinkston (2009), Kahn (2013), Waldman (1984)).
However, in these models, worker pay is still correlated with their ability, so we believe our assumption does not aect the
qualitative implications of the model.

3.2 The Informed Firm
We begin by assuming that rms (both the current employer and competing rms), supervisors, and workers


are perfectly informed about           (Âµs , Î²s ).    The rm oers workers an assignment to a supervisor with character-


istics   (Âµs , Î²s )   and a wage contract that maps observed signals                 r   onto wages. The terms of the wage contract


are allowed to vary with          (Âµs , Î²s , Î±i ).   Thus, wage contracts are:




                                                     w = a (Âµs , Î²s , Î±i ) + b (Âµs , Î²s , Î±i ) r


     Proposition 1 states properties of the wage contract and how expected compensation of employees and


supervisors vary with         (Âµs , Î²s , Î±i ).

   5.Workers do not earn economic rents; that is, worker surplus S = U (w â c(e)) = 0.
     The optimal piece rate is familiar to students of principal agent models. Greater uncertainty                                       Ïq2   or risk


aversion        Ï lowers the piece rate as the rm shields the employee from risk.                         On the other hand, if the marginal


cost of eort declines (Âµs increases), then the piece rate increases as the trade-o between eort provision


and risk improves.


     Expected eort and output thus increase in                     Âµs     because eort becomes less costly on the margin and


because the piece rate increases and thus induces higher eort.                               Furthermore, the surplus from a worker-


supervisor match increases in           Âµs   because, holding eort constant, the cost of eort declines in                      Âµs .   Since rms


compete for supervisors, supervisor compensation must also increase in                               Âµs .   By denition output,        q , increases

one-for-one with worker ability,             Î±,   and, since rms compete for workers, so does worker compensation.


     The nding that may be least intuitive is the last part of point 3, which establishes that there is no global


relationship between worker compensation and marginal cost of eort                                 Âµs .   Two countervailing eects bear on


expected compensation when              Âµs   increases. On one hand, the cost of providing any given eort level declines


in   Âµs .   This will lower compensation, since rms will use the intercept of the wage equation to extract all


surplus from employees. On the other hand, the optimal piece rate increases in                                  Âµs   and so does the risk borne


by workers. Thus, compensation will have to increase on average to induce workers to bear this risk. When




                                                                           21
                                             1
incentives are low-powered (b          <     2 ), then little eort is provided and consideration of risk dominates that of

eort cost and total pay increases in              Âµs .   The opposite is true when incentives are high-powered (b              > 21 )    and


workers exert a lot of eort. In that case, better managers reduce the eort cost born by workers signicantly


and wages decline with        Âµs .

   Proposition 1 states that neither output nor compensation vary with                         Î²s when rms are perfectly informed.

The intuition is straightforward. Optimal risk sharing induces the rm to remove any source of variation from


employee compensation unless it can be used to incentivize eort. Since                        Î²s   does not enter into the eort cost


function and does not correlate with the signal noise, the rm will neutralize any variation in                        Î²s   when setting


employee compensation. This also implies that eort choice and expected output are independent of                                  Î²s     and


so the surplus obtained from a given employee does not vary with                        Î²s .    Therefore supervisor compensation


does not vary with      Î²s   either.


   We also note that when             (Âµs , Î²s )   are known, the surplus going to the employee does not vary with the


supervisor type since, as we have just noted, worker pay does not vary with                              Î²s   and the rm sets pay as


a function of    Âµs   to extract the entire surplus for each employee (point 5). Thus, we expect workers to be


indierent to their supervisor assignment.




3.3 The Partially Informed Firm
We now consider the situation when agents are imperfectly informed. To begin, assume that                                    (Âµs , Î²s )   are


independent normally distributed random variables with variances                         ÏÎ²2    and   ÏÂµ2 .   To capture the idea that


agents are imperfectly informed we assume that rms (both the current employer and competing rms) and
                                         
employees hold beliefs        Î²sE , ÂµE
                                     s       about the supervisor characteristics such that




                                                                 Î²s   = Î²sE + ÎµÎ²

   where the errors      (ÎµÎ² , ÎµÂµ )   follow a normal distribution and are independent of each other.

terize the share of total variation in             Î²   and   Âµ   unknown to agents as   Î¸Î²   and    Î¸Âµ   so that

 29 The   normality assumptions ensure that the exponential in the utility function is normally distributed both before and after
the contracting stage, and we can thus use standard techniques to solve the worker's problem.

     A work contract consists of an assignment of a worker                                       Î±i      to a supervisor with                         ÂµE    E

choosing eort. As before, the optimal level of eort conditional on the piece rate                                                          b   is thus:           eâ = bÂµs .

     It is instructive to compare the piece rates under partial and full information.                                                                 Besides replacing                Âµs

with   ÂµE
        s ,    there are two dierences. First, the signal becomes less informative, and thus the optimal loading

                                                                                                                                     2
declines, as the share of the variation in                    Î²s   that is unknown to the rm (Î¸Î² ÏÎ² ) increases. Second, the piece


rate declines in the share of variation in managerial ability that is unknown during the contracting stage

       2
(Î¸Âµ ÏÂµ ). This is because after the contract is entered into and workers are assigned to supervisors, workers


observe the actual eort cost                    Âµs .   At that point, they can game the performance system by exerting


more eort when            Âµs   is high and less when it is low.                      Therefore, the usefulness of setting incentives using


performance signals declines in                  Î¸Âµ ÏÂµ2   and so does the optimal loading.

   A second notable dierence is that the rm is only able to neutralize the variation in                     Î²s   that it is informed


about. Thus, it will absorb any variation in            Î²sE   when compensating workers to remove any risk that is not


of use in setting incentives. However, expected compensation will increase with                     Î²s .   And, workers earn rents


that are increasing in both       Î²s   and   Âµs .

   Finally, expected output does of course still increase in             Âµs   but not in    Î²s .   Workers observe a lower cost


of eort, even when the rm only imperfectly observes this, and work harder.




3.4 Leniency Bias vs. Managerial Ability  Perfect vs. Imperfect Information?
Our primary goal is to identify the source of heterogeneity in supervisor ratings,                  Ïs , and whether or not rms

are informed about such heterogeneity. From the ratings equation (6), above, it follows immediately that


panel data on performance ratings alone does not allow to separate heterogeneity in managerial ability and


leniency bias. However, propositions 1 and 2 provide diverging predictions for how output and compensation


vary with   Î²s   and   Âµs   for both fully informed and imperfectly informed rms, respectively. These allow us to


identify the sources of heterogeneity and whether the rm is informed or not.


   It is useful to consider extreme cases to build intuition about how the fundamentals of the model map


into the data on ratings, compensation, and output.                   In particular, we contrast rms that are perfectly


informed    (Î¸Î² = Î¸Âµ = 0)                                           (Î¸Î² = Î¸Âµ = 1). We also distinguish the
                                with rms that are completely ignorant
                                                                          
                                                               2      2
case when supervisors dier solely in how lenient they are ÏÎ² > 0, ÏÂµ = 0 from the case when supervisors
                                                                                   
                                                                        2      2
dier solely in their ability to elicit eort from their team members ÏÎ² = 0, ÏÂµ > 0 . Table 4 summarizes


these four cases and what they imply for the relationships between supervisor heterogeneity in ratings,                           Ïs ,

and compensation and productivity.


   Table 4 reveals that the data indeed allows us to dierentiate between the four cases.



                                                                 24
    To start, we observe that if the rm is informed, then heterogeneity in leniency does not covary with


any of the outcomes we consider (top left quadrant). Compensation contracts in this case are structured to


simply undo the heterogeneity in leniency for both workers and supervisors. Eort is not directly aected


by leniency, and therefore productivity and supervisor earnings are likewise unaected. We also note that


variation in leniency that the rm is uninformed about (bottom left quadrant) does not aect the incentive


component of the contract.    It therefore does not lead to variation in productivity or supervisor earnings


even if the rm is uninformed of it. However, if the rm does not know who the lenient managers are, then


assignment to a lenient manager entails rents to the worker and higher earnings.


    By contrast, variation in managerial ability generally leads to increases in productivity. Should the rm


know about the variation in managerial ability across supervisors (top right quadrant), then supervisor wages


and employee piece rates will both increase in the ability of the supervisor, but the worker will not be able


to earn any surplus from this variation in ability. If instead, the rm is uninformed about who the good


supervisors are (bottom right quadrant), then workers earn higher wages and receive rents from working for


better supervisors.


    Combined, these diering predictions allow us to test the model and we turn to this task now.




4     TESTING THE MODEL
The model's predictions contingent on the nature of supervisor heterogeneity (ability and leniency) and the


information structure are listed in Table 4. In this section, we empirically evaluate these predictions using


detailed personnel data. Specically, we explore the relationship between supervisor ratings heterogeneity


(estimated in section 2.3) and wages, piece rate strength, objective output (as measured by KPI rankings


and nancial performance), worker surplus (as measured by job stability and bottom-up evaluations), as


well as supervisor pay and mobility outcomes.




4.1 Wages
A key comparative static from Table 4 is the relationship between supervisor ratings heterogeneity (Ïs ) and


worker wages. We evaluate this relationship using the following model:




                      log(wit ) = Î²0 + Î²1 Ïs(i,t) + Î²2 Î±i + Î²3 pit + Î² 0 Xit + Î³ 0 Ys(i,t)t + Î½it                        (7)



where the dependent variable    log(wit )   is log earnings for a worker     i   in year   t.   The unobserved supervisor


eects in performance are captured by       Ïs ,   worker eects in performance are denoted           Î±i ,   and the idiosyn-




                                                           25
cratic performance shock is denoted              pit .   We also include the rich set of controls for supervisor and worker
                                     
characteristics     Xit , Ys(i,t)t       applied when estimating equation 1. These absorb systematic variation in per-


formance and pay that is outside the scope of the model (for example, job function). Finally, we assume


that the error term,       Î½it ,   is uncorrelated with the variables preceding it.


     We use three strategies to estimate the parameters                 (Î²1 , Î²2 , Î²3 )   in equation 7 and report these in Table 5.
                                                                                                                                                
We rst present results using a naive strategy: simply regress log earnings on the xed eects                                ÏÌs , Î±Ìi , Ëit

obtained from the xed eects specication of equation 1 in Section 2.3.                            We cluster standard errors by


supervisor, the level of variation underlying our main dependent variable. Results are summarized in columns


1-3 of Table 5, labelled OLS.


     In column (1) we nd a sizable and statistically signicant relationship between                      Ïs   and log earnings. Our


estimate implies that moving from a supervisor who never passes subordinates to one who passes all of them


increases earnings by about 10 percent. In Section 2.3, we found the bias-adjusted standard deviation of


Ïs   to be 0.137. Thus, a move from a 10th percentile rater to one at the 90th percentile of                         Ïs   is associated


with an increase in earnings of about 3.3 percent. We also nd that worker eects correlate positively with


earnings. A one-standard-deviation higher                   Î±   is associated with earnings increases of 2.6 percent. Finally,


having an idiosyncratically high rating in the current period () gives workers a positive but modest earnings


boost.


     In column (2) we add business unit xed eects as additional controls.
                                                                                                     30   One may be worried that


dierences across units due to, say, size or client base give rise to a positive correlation between ratings and


earnings. We do not have enough mobility of supervisors across business units to separately identify unit


xed eects from supervisor xed eects in ratings.                     However, including business unit xed eects in the


earnings regression takes the conservative approach of assigning any common component in ratings to the


unit itself, and not, say, to unusually better or worse idiosyncratic supervisors or workers. The coecient


on   Ïs   falls by about half with the inclusion of this control, but remains signicant at the one percent level.


This specication also helps rule out a reverse causality story: that business units that tend to receive large


salary pools must give out high ratings to rationalize spending of the salary pool. The fact that our results


hold within branch xed eects suggests this is not the case.
                                                                                31

     Up to this point, we have leveraged worker switches across supervisors to estimate supervisor hetero-


geneity in performance ratings (section 2.3), but we are not explicitly using this variation to understand


the impact of such heterogeneity on worker earnings. The worker xed eects specication in column (3)

  30 We include a separate xed       eect for each branch as well as each function in the central corporate oce.
  31 Though not shown, we also        nd similar results when we control for branch-by-year xed eects, estimated o of location-
years with at least two supervisors. This helps alleviate concerns that idiosyncratic productivity shocks at the unit or location
level drive our results.




                                                                      26
identies the coecient on            Ï explicitly from workers who switch supervisors.               Here we nd the point estimate


is quite a bit attenuated, to 0.025, but still signicant at the one percent level. This attenuation is partly


because we must identify over 14,000 worker xed eects, which absorbs quite a lot of the variation in log


earnings. But also, eects in columns 1 and 2 might indeed be at least in part driven by sorting as opposed


to causal eects of supervisors. However, even here, a move from a 10th to 90th percentile rater is associated


with an earnings increase of about 0.9 percent.                        That is non-trivial and, as we discuss in section 5, can


compound over time.
                                32

     Another way to see the eect of switching supervisors is with an event-style analysis, summarized in gure


2. Here we regress log(earnings) on the change in                       Ï   associated with the supervisor switch interacted with


indicators for event time before or after the switch. The omitted category is the year before the supervisor


switch. Regressions also control for worker xed eects and typical controls. We nd that the impact of


a change in           Ï   becomes apparent only after the worker actually makes the switch and impacts earnings at


about the magnitude of column 3 in table 5.


     The naive estimator in columns 1-3 has the virtue of being extremely transparent, but unfortunately is


biased for the reasons discussed before: the worker and supervisor xed eects in ratings are contaminated by


correlated measurement error. Our second strategy is therefore to pursue an instrumental variables approach.


We split the sample into two separate periods and obtain two distinct sets of estimates for                            Î±0 s   and   Ï0 s,   one


from each subsample. These two sets of xed eects will be highly correlated because they are estimates


of the same underlying unobserved eects. At the same time, the estimation errors across the two sets of


estimates are uncorrelated. We can thus correct for the incidental parameter problem by instrumenting xed


eects estimated from one subsample with the xed eects from the other subsample, and vice versa.


     Our preferred way of splitting the sample is by even and odd years because it maximizes the overlap


of workers and supervisors across the two samples.
                                                                       33 Because of the low turnover in our sample, we retain

almost all observations (74,641 out of 77,692) when requiring this overlap. We hereafter term this the split-


sample IV estimation.
                                34 Results are reported in columns 4-5 of Table 5. This approach allows us to estimate

Î²1   and   Î²2 .   However, we cannot estimate              Î²3 ,   the coecient on the ratings residual. The reason is that the


error term from one subsample is uncorrelated with the unobserved eects (Î± and                               Ï)   in that subsample as

  32 In   Appendix A.3, we present estimates using only individuals after they have had a supervisor switch and restrict even
further to specic supervisor moves that are plausibly more exogenous. Rather than leveraging the change in outcomes as a
function of the change in      Ï, as in the worker xed eects specications, this strategy explores the eect of a plausibly exogenously
allocation of     Ï   on worker outcomes. Our results (see Table A4) are consistent across such moves. Most notably, we nd very
similar results when we restrict ourselves to individuals assigned to a new supervisor whose supervisor in the previous period
left the rm.
  33 We    have experimented with splitting the sample in other ways  for instance, into an early and late period (pre- and
post-2009). The results are fully consistent with those reported here but typically the overlap in the samples is much smaller
and the estimates are therefore noisier.
  34 The   rst stage regressions, using     Î±'s   and   Ï's   estimated on odd years to predict those estimated on even years and vice
versa, are highly predictive. The F-statistic on the instruments is 186 for predicting         Ï   and 3,572 for predicting   Î±.

well as the unobserved eects in the other subsample. Consequently the rst stage will fail when attempting

                           Ëp
to instrument for (it ) in one subsample with           Î±'s   and   Ï0 s   obtained from the other subsample. The split-


sample IV also does not lend itself well to the worker xed eects specication because the rst stage with


worker xed eects is not conceptually correct. We want to predict one noisy estimate of                      Ï   with another


noisy estimate of      Ï   and in any given year, we would not have within-worker variation in these.


    Our third strategy is to expand the Andrews et al. (2008) correction  our conceptual framework for


obtaining bias-adjusted estimates of variances in ratings components (section 2.3)  to a joint system of two


double xed eects regressions (one for ratings and one for earnings).
                                                                                     35 Once the second moment matrices

of the unobserved eects are obtained they can be transformed into implied regression coecients. Results


are reported in columns 5-6 of Table 5. This estimator is computationally intensive and we therefore only


implement it for worker earnings (and not the other dependent variables explored below). The methodology


also requires strong distributional assumptions regarding the error terms that are not immediately applicable


for some of our outcome variables such as those aggregated to the supervisor or branch level. However, this


methodology does have the advantage that it can be applied to almost the entire estimation sample, not only


the one consisting of workers and supervisors present in both even and odd years. It only requires that we be


able to estimate worker and supervisor xed eects in log(earnings), which applies for 77,583 observations.
                                                                                                                                36

    Across all specications, we nd that working for a high-rating supervisor is associated with substantially


higher earnings. The unadjusted estimates are a bit smaller in magnitude, compared to the split sample IV


and bias corrections, as we would expect if the estimation error is interpreted as measurement error. Recall


from Table 4 that these results are consistent with either heterogeneity being driven primarily by supervisor


ability, or by supervisor leniency if rms are uninformed about supervisor heterogeneity. By contrast, the


informed rm would undo any variation driven by leniency in compensation. Our ndings in Table 5 thus


reject the joint hypothesis that (1) the heterogeneity in ratings across supervisors is driven by leniency bias


and (2) the rm is informed about this heterogeneity.




4.2 Piece Rates
A key dierence between high-ability supervisors and lenient supervisors in our model is that high-ability


supervisors lower the marginal cost of eort for workers. Consequently, informed rms will raise piece rates


for subordinates who are matched to better managers while piece rates will not vary across supervisors


that dier only in their leniency bias. Hence, one way to disentangle supervisor ability from leniency is to

  35 We   have not succeeded in adapting Kline, Saggio, and Solvsten (2018) to the two-equation setting and thus rely on Andrews
et al. (2008). For ratings, adjusted estimates are very similar using either the Andrews et al. or the Kline et al. approach.
  36 Recall,   our estimation sample is already restricted to observations for whom we can identify supervisor and worker xed
eects in ratings. However, earnings data are not available in our last year of data, and this restriction results in the loss of
identication for a small number of worker and supervisor xed eects.

determine if variable pay components are sensitive to supervisor heterogeneity.


    To shed light on this relationship, we augment our earnings regression 7 by interacting supervisor het-


erogeneity       (Ïs )    with performance                 (pass)     in a given period. The interaction measures whether performance


ratings have a stronger eect on earnings when the supervisor is a higher rater. We also take a more direct


approach and use as dependent variables the probability of receiving a bonus and the log of the size of the


bonus, conditional on receiving one. For these models we only present OLS results because we do not know


how to adapt the split-sample IV and or the bias correction method to identify the coecient on                                                                            Ï â pass.

Table 6 contains the results.


    We nd that total earnings and bonuses, conditional on receiving one, are more strongly related to the


worker's performance when assigned to a high rater. All else equal, passing the performance review is worth


an additional 7 percent in wages when working for a high rater (the coecient 0.075 on                                                                  Ï â P ass       in column


1). The main eect of passing the performance review can be obtained by summing coecients on all the


components: 0.20 (=                 0.067 + 0.108 + 0.031).                    Therefore, matching with a high rater increases the strength


of pay for performance by about a third.                                     The magnitudes on both the main eects and the interaction


between      Ï   and pass fall with the inclusion of business unit xed eects in column 2 or worker xed eects


in column 3, but the story is still qualitatively similar: workers earn an extra 2-3 percent when they pass


their performance review if they also work with a higher rater, or about 20 to 50 percent of the main eect


of passing (the sum of the coecients on                              Ï, Î±,    and     ).    Thus the dierence in incentive strength across raters


is primarily not due to dierences across units in general performance, norms, or job functions and holds up


to variation that explicitly takes advantage of supervisor switches. From columns 4-9, much of the eect is


due to the size of the bonus, conditional on receiving one. This is consistent with our understanding that


supervisors have discretion over allocating salaries, but especially bonuses.




                                                                                          30
    These ndings are consistent with the hypothesis that supervisor heterogeneity is driven by heterogeneity


in managerial ability that the rm is informed about.




4.3 Productivity
As pointed out above, our model implies that more able supervisors lower the marginal cost of eort and raise


productivity. In contrast, lenient supervisors do not alter productivity. These associations hold irrespective


of whether the rm is informed about supervisor heterogeneities. Hence, as long as we have an independent


measure of productivity (separate from performance ratings), we can use the correlation between supervisor


heterogeneity and productivity to disentangle supervisor ability from leniency.


    We have access to two such measures of objective performance. During the years 20072010 the company


ranked branches within a set of peers along a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that reect


nancial outcomes, customer relations, etc.
                                                        37 For the years 2014 and 2015 we have information on individual

nancial performance. This latter metric is available for about half of the workers in the branches, primarily


among senior workers with client facing roles.                  For both KPI performance and nancial performance we


investigate their relation to worker and supervisor xed eects using OLS and our split-sample IV approach.


For power reasons, we use xed eects estimated on the sample as a whole, not the restricted sample where


objective performance measures are available. For the nancial performance regressions, it is worth noting


that our personnel records end in 2014, while the nancial performance measure covers the years 2014 and


2015. Hence, in practice, we regress our nancial performance measures on the xed eects associated with


the supervisor the employee was assigned to in 2014 , and, as usual, cluster standard errors by supervisor.
                                                                                                                                        38

    Table 7 presents the OLS (Panel A) and the split-sample IV (Panel B) estimates for both sets of measures.


The KPI regressions (columns 14) relate the branch rankings to averages of employee and supervisor xed


eects within the branch-year.
                                         39 Analogous to the split-sample IV on individuals, we correct for estimation

error by instrumenting for the branch averages based on the average                         Î±'s       and   Ï's   at the branch-level from


even years with those from the odd years and vice versa.
                                                                           40 In these aggregated regressions, we control for a

limited set of variables, either averaged to the branch-year level or at the individual level.
                                                                                                                       41 For the nancial

performance regressions (column 5), the xed eects pertain to the individual workers and their supervisors

  37 We    have reestimated all results presented in this paper on the subsample restricted to branches and years where KPIs are
available, and found them to generally be quite robust to this sample restriction.
  38 This   is likely to induce some downward bias because supervisors change over time. The degree of downward bias will depend
on how persistent     Ï   is. At the branch level, we observe that   corr(Ït , Ït+1 ) = 0.852   and   corr(Ït , Ït+2 ) = 0.766.
  39 If   there is only one supervisor in a given branch-year, as is often the case, the average supervisor eect is the ratings eect
for that supervisor. In cases where there is more than one rater, the average supervisor xed eect is obtained by averaging
across supervisors, weighted by the number of subordinates each rated this period.
  40 The    rst-stage of the IV is naturally estimated on the same sample and at the same level as the second-stage: branch-years
for branches with KPI data.
  41 These include year eects,     the average worker age, tenure, and share female, as well as the average of each job-level indicator.




                                                                      31
and we include our typical individual-level controls (see Table 3). We include branch size as a control in all


specications to account for dierent patterns in productivity based on local demand, the client base, etc...


. Unfortunately, we do not have enough variation to allow for branch xed eects given that we only have


data from 2007 to 2010 and that average supervisor eects by branch vary slowly. .
                                                                                                        42 Also, our measures

themselves control for baseline heterogeneity since KPI rankings are relative to a peer group of branches that


the rm denes, and nancial performance is the individual's year-over-year growth rate in their portfolio.


    Our general nding from Table 7 is a positive relationship between higher rating supervisors and objective


performance of subordinates and branches. We explore a range of functional forms for the KPI rankings.


Using our IV estimates, we nd that a branch with a one-standard-deviation higher                         Ï   has a 0.05 higher


inverse rank score (â1 times the branch's ranking divided by the number of branches in the peer group), or 9


percent, is 1.9 percentage points (31 percent) more likely to be the top-ranked branch, is 6 percentage points


(20 percent) more likely to be ranked among the top 5 branches in the peer group, and 6.4 percentage points


(13 percent) more likely to be ranked in the top half. These magnitudes are economically large. We also


nd positive eects for individual nancial performance. IV estimate implies that a one-standard-deviation


higher rating supervisor is associated with a 1 percentage point (13 percent) larger growth rate.


    The results in Table 7 indicate a positive relationship between supervisor heterogeneity and performance.


Unfortunately, we only have performance measures for a small number of years and branches, which at


times challenges the statistical signicance of the point estimates.                    The evidence we do provide, however,


suggests that there is a positive relation between supervisors ratings heterogeneity and team performance.


This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that we have two distinct performance measures that occur at


dierent points in time. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that manager ability (Âµs ), rather than


leniency bias (Î²s ), drives supervisor heterogeneity.
                                                               43




4.4 Supervisor Outcomes
The fourth comparative static relates supervisor heterogeneity in ratings to the supervisors' own pay. Su-


pervisor compensation would not correlate with supervisor heterogeneity if rms were uninformed about                        Ïs .

Nor would rms compensate supervisors for being more lenient.                         Only if supervisor heterogeneity reects


managerial ability about which the rm is informed will                  Ïs   and supervisor compensation correlate positively.


    To investigate this relationship we regress supervisor outcomes on their own ratings xed eect, as well

  42 Similarly   the table does not include worker xed eects specications. These are not apt for the KPI regressions that are
aggregated to the branch-year level, and, with only two years of individual nancial performance data, we do not allow enough
variation for identifying worker xed eects in column 5.
  43 The   estimated impacts of   Î±   on objective performance in Table 7 are statistically insignicant. However, the 95 percent
condence intervals for the point estimates typically include large positive eects. The results are thus consistent with worker
quality that correlates positively with branch performance, though too noisy to be conclusive.

as the average worker xed eect for the group of subordinates the supervisor rated in that year. We present


OLS and split-sample IV results.
                                       44 These regressions control for the characteristics of the supervisor and

the average characteristics of the group of workers being supervised, as well as branch size. Standard errors


are clustered by supervisor.


   Results are reported in Table 8. Supervisor earnings are strongly positively correlated with their own


ratings style (as well as the quality of the team they supervise). This is true for log earnings overall and


for the size of the bonus conditional on receiving one. For example, using the IV estimates, we nd that


supervisor earnings increase by 2 percent for each standard deviation in              Ïs .   Much of this increase comes


through an increase in the size of the bonus received, conditional on receiving one. Furthermore, supervisors


who are high raters are substantially more likely to pass the performance review they receive from their


own supervisor. A one-standard deviation higher rater is 6 percentage points more likely to pass their own


performance review.


   Supervisor earnings also positively correlate with the quality of the team they supervise,               Î±.   This result


is intriguing, even though our model cannot rationalize it. One possibility is that perhaps the rm cannot


perfectly separate the ability of supervisors from the ability of workers.


   We nd little evidence that ratings heterogeneity correlates with mobility in either direction. The point


estimates on promotion probability are positive and large, but those on staying with the rm or in the


business unit are negative. Standard errors related to these outcomes are simply too large to say anything


denitive.


   Consistent with our earlier ndings, the positive relationship between supervisor ratings behavior and


their own compensation and ratings provides support for the hypothesis that supervisor heterogeneity reects


ability dierences that the rm is informed about rather than dierences in leniency.




4.5 Worker Surplus and the Information Structure
The last comparative static we consider is whether worker surplus is related to supervisor heterogeneity.


This relationship is particularly informative about the information structure. In our model, fully informed


rms will always hold workers to their participation constraint, eliminating any variation in surplus resulting


from supervisor characteristics. Evidence that worker surplus increases in supervisor heterogeneity indicates


that the rm is not fully informed about dierences across supervisors in            Ïs .

   We use worker mobility and worker satisfaction surveys to look for evidence regarding rents associated

 44 As   in the branch-year regressions of table 7, we include branch size but not branch or worker xed eects.   For the IV
specications, we obtain supervisor and worker xed eects for the full odd- and even-year samples. We then instrument for
supervisor eects and the average worker eect to a given supervisor in a given year using the estimates from the opposite
subsample.

Notes: Observations are at the supervisor-year level. Ï is how the supervisor rates their own subordinates, and Î± and Îµ are the averages of the subordinates rated that year. In Panel
B, we estimate supervisor and worker fixed effects on odd and even years separately. We instrument for the supervisor effect and supervisor-year-level average worker effects in odd
years with those obtained in even years and vice versa. Outcomes are supervisor pay, performance, and mobility variables in the given year. Pass is whether the supervisor passed
their own performance review; promotion probability is restricted to observations that did not leave the firm in the next year. Controls are listed in table 3; worker controls are the
average for characteristics. We also include the average branch size of subordinates rated in the given year in all specifications. Significance levels are represented using stars: ***
p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.




                                                                         35
with   Ïs .    Worker satisfaction surveys provide direct evidence on how workers perceive their supervisors.


These surveys are taken by an independent consulting rm and anonymized before being returned to the


rm, which should encourage workers to report their answers truthfully. Fortunately for us, we have access to


the survey responses prior to anonymization. For the other outcomes, workers can, to some extent, inuence


their assignments across units within the rm, and can likely control whether they stay with the rm.


    Table 9 presents OLS (panel A) and split-sample IV estimates (panel B). For each outcome we present


our base-line specication as well asseparate specications with branch and worker xed eects. The latter


leverages only worker switches for identifying the coecient on                   Ï.   It turns out that the results are robust


across these specications, but we should note that estimates become unstable and imprecisely estimated


when we use the supervisor leave-out mean in performance ratings as the key regressor.


    Column 1 shows that workers are more likely to stay in the rm in the next year if working for a


higher-rating supervisor.
                               45 This eect is marginally signicant in the base specication and becomes larger

in magnitude and signicance when we add business unit xed eects in column 2 or worker xed eects


in column 3.        Columns 4-6 show that workers are more likely to stay in the same business unit in the


next year when assigned to a higher rater. In columns 7-9, workers are not any more likely to stay with


their particular supervisor, though, as we have noted, many supervisor switches are driven by moves of the


supervisors themselves, which would be outside the control of the worker.


    Finally, the results in columns 10-12 are based on data from the employee job satisfaction survey. The


dependent variable is the average across seven survey questions relating to the supervisor, normed to have a


standard deviation of 1. The results show that subordinates tend to be more satised with their supervisors


when their supervisors are higher raters. While this eect is statistically signicant, its economic importance


is modest as an assignment to a one-standard-deviation higher rater is associated with a modest 0.034


increase in the bottom-up rating a worker ascribes to his or her supervisor (the mean of that variable is 4.7).


The magnitude is fairly similar in the worker xed eects specication, which explicitly leverages supervisor


switches and also controls for dierences in average ratings behavior across workers.


    Together, these ndings indicate that workers earn rents when assigned to high rating supervisors, even


though it is dicult to ascertain the magnitude of these rents. Nevertheless, while the evidence presented


so far suggests that supervisor heterogeneity reects ability dierences that the rm is informed about, the


results in Table 9 suggest that the rm is not perfectly informed about such dierences.
                                                                                                              46

    If the rm is unable to perfectly distinguish between worker and supervisor eects, it may still learn

  45 We   have estimated the probabilities of quit and layo separately and nd that being matched to a higher rater has similar
negative impacts on both, though estimates are noisier than the combined probability shown in the table.
  46 Table    9 also reveals that workers with higher   Î±   may earn rents; they are less likely quit, more likely to stay with their
current supervisor, and report being more satised at their job.

Notes: Column 1â3 estimate the probability that the worker stayed in our sample between t and t+1; columns 4â6 estimate the probability that the worker stayed in the same branch or business unit (if in corporate); columns 7â9 estimate the probability that
the worker stayed with the same supervisor; columns 10â12 reports the worker's selfâreported satisfaction of their supervisor. All regressions include timeâvarying worker and supervisor controls (see Table 3), and, where indicated, branch or worker fixed
effects. Standard errors clustered by supervisor. Significance levels are represented using stars: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.




over time. In that case, benets accruing to a worker who is matched to a high rater should attenuate with


supervisor tenure. We explore this in Table 10. We specify tenure as the number of years the supervisor has


been rating subordinates. We augment our main specication (equation 7) to include an interaction between


Ï   and an indicator equaling 1 if the supervisor has above median tenure, dened as the length of time they


have been rating subordinates.
                                                                  47

      Beginning with log(earnings) in columns 1, we consistently nd that the benet of a high rating supervisor


on worker earnings is smaller when the supervisor has more tenure. Magnitudes are especially large for the


split-sample IV, where we nd that osets are about half to three-quarters of the main eect.
                                                                                                                                                                                                               48 Eects for

the remaining variables are noisy. However, the mobility variables (stay in rm, stay in unit, and stay with


supervisor) all have the opposite sign of the main eect                                                                  Ï,    and magnitudes are sizable. This is suggestive of


the same attenuation as seen in earnings, but of course not conclusive.


      Overall, Table 10 provides suggestive evidence that the benets workers experience when associated with


a high rater are indeed partially undone for supervisors with more tenure. This is consistent with the idea


that there are rents associated with being matched to certain supervisors, but that these rents are driven by


imperfect information. However, the bottom-up evaluations indicate that subordinates still enjoy working


for a better manager, even if they accrue fewer economic rents. Of course the evidence is far from conclusive,


given the large standard errors.

    47 We    also include the main eect for the supervisor tenure variable, which is essentially subsumed in our controls. We have
explored a range of dierent functional forms, all yielding consistent results. We also nd similar results when dening tenure
as the overall length of time the supervisor has been with the rm.
    48 We    instrument for               Ï â tenure           with the interaction of                    Ï   in the alternating even or odd year times the tenure variable.

4.6 Discussion
We have presented results on how the heterogeneity in ratings associated with supervisors            Ïs   relates to


outcomes for employees, supervisors, and the rm. We found that (1) individual earnings increase with             Ïs ,

(2) piece rates increase in   Ïs , (3) team productivity as measured by the KPI ranking increases in the average

Ïs   within a branch, (4) individual nancial performance increases in   Ïs ,   (5) supervisor pay increases in   Ïs ,

and (6) workers appear to earn (moderate) rents from being matched to higher raters, that are attenuated


for raters with longer tenures about whom the rm is presumably more informed.               These ndings speak


to the nature of the heterogeneity associate with supervisors and whether the rm is informed about this


heterogeneity. Consulting Table 4, our evidence suggests that supervisor heterogeneity in ratings is driven


mainly by dierences in managerial ability and that the rm is partially informed about this heterogeneity.


     There are three pieces of evidence that support the interpretation that heterogeneity in managerial ability


drives at least some of the variation in ratings across supervisors. First, we nd that objective performance


increases when individuals or teams are managed by a high rater (Table 7), which directly supports the


managerial ability hypothesis.      Second, high-rating supervisors earn signicantly higher salaries (Table 8)


suggesting that rms value them, as would be the case when high raters are also better managers. Third,


subordinates of higher raters tend to face stronger incentives (Table 6), which is rationalized in our model


by the fact that better managers lower the marginal cost of worker eort (an equivalent assumption is that


better managers increase output per additional unit of eort).


     The observation that the strength of incentives for employees and that average compensation of su-


pervisors vary with   Ïs   suggests that the rm is informed about the heterogeneity in ratings styles across


supervisors. However, it seems a priori plausible that rms will not be perfectly informed. This notion is


consistent with the observation that subordinates earn (moderate) economic rents when working for higher


rating supervisors.   The perfectly informed rm would extract all rents from its employees by adjusting


their base salaries to place them on their participation constraints, and we do see evidence consistent with


this behavior for supervisors with longer tenures. The rm also appears to reward supervisors for the xed


quality of their subordinates (Table 8), which may also be indicative of a lack of ability to perfectly discern


what drives performance.


     Of course, outside our model there are other reasons why rms might share rents with higher raters or


with employees.    This rm may purposely do a better job fostering a feeling of satisfaction for desirable


workers and supervisor-worker matches.


     Finally, while these results have a clear interpretation within the context of our model, one could write


down other models of compensation and bonuses that might generate similar predictions. Regardless of the




                                                        39
model used to interpret these results, we have shown that there is substantial heterogeneity in performance


ratings across supervisors and that this heterogeneity is indeed associated with heterogeneity in objective


output.        Firms should therefore think twice before imposing forced curves or other rules that limit the


variation in subjective performance ratings as it may undermine supervisors' ability to manage.




5        HOW INFLUENTIAL ARE HIGH RATERS FOR CAREERS?
In Section 4.1, we established that working for a high-rating supervisor is associated with higher contempora-


neous earnings. Next, we consider how longer-term career outcomes vary with supervisor type. This requires


us to think about dynamic eects in relation to                          Ïs   and thus forces us to step outside of the static model


presented in Section 3. In particular, we are interested in how ratings aect earnings in subsequent years,


even after a worker has left the high-rating supervisor. This could manifest because pay raises are persistent


but also because high-rating supervisors may aect the progression of a worker along the job hierarchy.


     We begin by estimating the persistence of                      Ïs    on pay. We base our estimates on the following dynamic


equation relating current log earnings to several lagged supervisor eects:




                         w l, Ït , et = g1 (lit ) + h1 (Xi,t ) + Î£kÏ=0 Î²Ï Ïs(i,tâÏ ) + Î£kÏ=0 Î¸Ï Îµi,tâÏ + ei,t
                                     
                                                                                                                                                      (8)




Equation 8 includes            k   lags in supervisor eects as well as the contemporaneous value                                Ïs(i,t) .49   These lags


allow     Ïs   to inuence earnings for up to                 k   periods.       Estimates from equation 8 do not represent the full


dynamic eects of being assigned a higher rater                          (Ïs )   for two reasons. First, we control for job-level eects


(lit )   to account for any variation in ratings style across job levels.                                   However, part of the eect of ratings


heterogeneity on future earnings arises through promotions and we will explore that eect below. Second,


we control for ratings type of supervisors in other periods. This removes any eect of the current supervisor


that can be attributed to persistence in the supervisor match. Estimates of                                           Î²Ï   thus yield the impact of a


one-time match to a higher rater               Ï   periods ago on earnings today over and above any promotion eects and


eects attributable to persistence in supervisor ratings styles.


     Results are summarized in Table 11. Column 1 replicates the earnings eect from Table 5, the impact of


Ïs   on contemporaneous earnings. Once we include lagged supervisor eects in the regression, the sample size


naturally begins to drop. To understand any dierences across samples, column 2 shows the main earnings


specication from column 1, restricted to workers who are present for at least ve periods in the rm, that

  49 Equation       8 also includes controls for   k   lags in the ratings residual   Îµi,t ,   for   Î±i ,   and for the typical constant and time-varying
controls   Xi,t .

                                                              50 The coecient is a bit smaller in magnitude for the sample

of more stable workers,         0.068    compared to      0.095,   but still qualitatively similar.


    Column 3 presents results including all four lags of supervisor eects. The coecient on the contempora-


neous earnings eect drops to            0.029.   This is because part of the supervisor eect on earnings comes through


persistence of supervisors across periods (as shown at least qualitatively in Table 9). Furthermore, we nd


that impacts of supervisor's           Ï   on pay are quite persistent. The coecients on the lagged                       Ï   range between


0.014 and 0.021. This suggests that roughly half to two-thirds of the contemporaneous pay increase associ-


ated with having a high-rating supervisor persists several periods later. While the eect of being assigned


to a higher rater is somewhat transitory, the large fraction that remains could indicate direct salary impacts


that amortize over time (as opposed to eects driven solely by transient bonuses), or perhaps because of


lasting eects on human capital.


    These coecients are estimated holding constant job level.                          This means that they do not include any


impact of   Ïs    on earnings through promotions and demotions. We do not estimate regressions omitting job


level controls because supervisor types vary systematically across job levels  higher raters tend to be further

  50 Balancing   the desire to understand the lag structure of earnings eects against the need to maintain sample sizes in a panel
of only 11 years, we choose to focus on 5 years of lags. Appendix Table A5 explores robustness to more and less restricted
samples, based on number of available lags, and we nd results to generally be quite similar, quantitatively.

up the hierarchy. Instead, to account for how raters aect earnings through mobility in the job hierarchy,


we also estimate equations predicting mobility at the rm.


    We nd that     Ïs   does indeed accelerate movement up the job hierarchy. Table 12 shows that a higher                                    Ïs

makes promotions more likely (column 1) and negative career moves in the form of demotions (column 2) and


layos (column 3) less likely.
                                      51 Using the split-sample IV estimates, we nd that a one-standard-deviation

higher rater increases the probability of promotion by 0.5 percentage points (5 percent). It decreases the


probability of a demotion by 0.1 percentage point (13 percent, though this eect is not statistically signicant)


and a layo by 0.2 percentage point (19 percent), for these already rare outcomes. Thus faster progression


through the job hierarchy may be an important channel through which a high-rating supervisor raises


earnings in the long-run.


    Next, we engage in the following thought experiment: how does an increase in                                  Ïs   in one period aect the

  51 Columns   1 and 2 estimate the probability of promotion or demotion between years                t   and   t+1    for workers present in both
years. Column 3 estimates the probability of a layo between            t   and   t + 2;   we estimate the two-year rather than the one-year
layo probability because ratings are less likely to be taken in the nal year.




                                                                      42
present discounted value (PDV) of earnings, keeping all other supervisor eects in all other periods constant?


This incorporates three components: (1) the persistence of the contemporaneous impact of                                Ïs   on pay, (2) the


impact of        Ïs   on promotions in the current and subsequent periods, and (3) the impact of promotions on pay.


We consider these three components separately, rather than estimating the full earnings stream associated


with a given          Ïs    because this allows us to control for job level in (1) while still allowing job level to impact


earnings. As explained above, this is important because supervisor heterogeneity                                Ïs   varies systematically


across the job hierarchy. To simplify the analysis, we abstract from demotions and rm exit, both fairly rare


events.

    The rate of impact of a given supervisor eect in period                      t (Ïs(i,t) )   on earnings in period    t+k    is given in


equation 9. It equals the persistent component of the within job-level pay eect,                         Î²k   (from equation 8, above),


plus the impact of            Ïs(i,t)   on the probability of promotion,        Î³,   times the average pay increase associated with


a promotion           (g1 (li,t + 1) â g1 (li,t )).

                                                             = Î²k + Î³ (g1 (li,t + 1) â g1 (li,t ))                                      (9)

                                                                1   dWt+k
    To aggregate these over time, we obtain
                                                               Wt+k dÏs(i,t) for each      k â¤ 20    (assuming careers last another 20


years) and aggregate them using a discount rate of 5 percent. For lags                           k â¤ 4, the parameter estimates needed

to perform these calculations are taken from Table 11. For lags                           k > 4,   we make two dierent assumptions


about     Î²k .    First, we conservatively set          Î²k   in all future periods      k>4       to zero, since we have not estimated


these eects. However, Table 11 does not indicate any diminishing eect over time, within the four estimated


lags, so a reasonable alternative assumption is a permanent                          0.02 â Ïs   impact on wages for    k > 4.

    We obtain          Î³,   the impact on promotion probability, from the split-sample IV estimate in Table 12. Since

                              1   dWt+k
our calculation            ( Wt+k dÏs(i,t) )   depends on the job level of an individual, we average the promotion gains


(g1 (l + 1) â g (l))          using the observed distribution of wages and of workers across job levels.                       In our data,


the average earnings increase associated with moving up adjacent job levels is 16 percent.
                                                                                                                        53 We allow this

impact of promotion on earnings to persist for the full 20 periods. When we estimate dynamic promotion


equations, we nd that the contemporaneous promotion eect is persistent. In unreported results, we see


no evidence that workers assigned to low raters catch up in terms of promotions and also no evidence that


a one-time assignment to a high-rater results in multiple promotions.


    Using our estimated standard deviation of                     Ïs ,   0.137 (Table 3), we determine that a one-period, one-


standard-standard deviation increase in                  Ïs   is associated with an increase in the PDV of earnings of 2.2 to

  52 We    also abstract away from any path dependence in           Ï.    We do nd that the correlation between the supervisor ratings
eect in   t    and that in   t+1   is 0.75 overall and 0.25 when there is a supervisor change between periods. Assigning causality to
this correlation and taking it into account would raise the PDV of a one-period assignment to a high rater.
  53 Due   to condentiality issues, we are unable to provide the disaggregated inputs to this estimate.




                                                                         43
4.7 percent of average annual earnings, corresponding to the more and less conservative assumptions on the


persistence of      Î²k   for   k > 4.   The direct wage eect,   Î²k ,   amounts to 1.2 to 3.8 percentage points of this, while


the return associated with being promoted to a higher job level accounts for the remainder. If instead we


assume, more conservatively, that the promotion eect dissipates after ve periods, then the PDV estimates


are   0.6   percentage points smaller.


      These eects are quite large.           When comparing workers assigned to supervisors at the 90th and 10th


percentiles of the ratings distribution, the former can expect an increase in the PDV of earnings equivalent


to 6 to 12% of an annual salary.




6       CONCLUSION
In this paper we provide evidence that supervisors dier widely in their ratings behavior. A worker matched


to a one standard deviation higher rater is 13.7 percentage points (30 percent) more likely to receive a passing


score (a performance score in the upper half of the performance scale). To understand this variation, we


provide a theoretical framework that allows for two sources of heterogeneity in ratings behavior: leniency


bias and managerial ability. We also allow the degree to which rms are informed about the heterogeneity


to vary.


      Within the context of this model, we conclude that dierences in managerial ability are an important


component of the heterogeneity in supervisors' ratings behavior.
                                                                                 54 This conclusion is based on the empirical

nding that worker pay, pay for performance, supervisor pay, and individual and team-level objective per-


formance measures are all increasing in the supervisor's propensity to give passing ratings to subordinates.


Workers also appear to enjoy working with higher raters since they are less likely to voluntarily move away


from them (by quitting or switching supervisors) and give them better ratings on bottom-up evaluations.


This suggests that rms are unable to fully extract the surplus produced in the match between a worker


and a high-rating supervisor, possibly because they are not fully informed about the heterogeneity in super-


visor's ratings behavior. Consistent with the latter, we nd that this surplus is attenuated for supervisors


with higher tenure, about whom the rm is presumably more informed.


      These results all have a clear interpretation within the context of our model. However, one could develop


other models of compensation and bonuses that would generate the same predictions. For example, if bonuses


are distributed based on a threshold rule, rather than linearly, a lenient supervisor will cause workers to exert


more eort if they are close to the threshold margin. Or, supervisors may dier in their propensity to make


subordinate pay vary with performance; those applying stronger incentives should get more output out of

  54 We     can not rule out that leniency bias contributes to the heterogeneity in supervisor' ratings behavior, but we can rule out
that heterogeneity in leniency bias alone sustains the variation in ratings across supervisors.




                                                                   44
their workers and give them higher ratings. We do not know enough about how bonuses are set inside this


rm to speak to these hypotheses. It may also be that a lenient supervisor generates a warm glow among


his or her team that in and of itself generates higher output. Disentangling these and other stories is beyond


the scope of this paper. Instead, our goals have been to (1) highlight the surprising and sizable variation


in ratings across supervisors, and, (2) disciplining ourselves to one plausible model, which allowed us to


dig deeper into the nature and information structure of this heterogeneity. Regardless of our model we can


conclude that heterogeneity in ratings is indeed reected in objective output measures suggesting that how


supervisors rate and manage their employees interact in important ways.


    Subjective performance reviews are controversial because workers may worry they are vulnerable to


managerial biases.       As a result, rms may desire to impose rules designed to correct for biases.
                                                                                                                    55   They


might, for instance, force supervisors to grade their employees on a curve.                  However, our work cautions


against such practices. At the rm we study, supervisor heterogeneity in ratings reects, at least in part,


real dierences in the ability to elicit output from subordinates.              Hence, rms should exercise care when


they consider introducing forced curves or other guidelines restricting supervisors in how they can rate their


subordinates.

A     Data Appendix

A.1 Firm Structure
The rm consists of an extensive branch network, as well as a central corporate oce. We take advantage


of both.


    Figure A1 depicts the ow of employees between the branch network and the central oce as well as ows


for employees entering and exiting the rm. Churn is fairly low at this rm: about 10 percent of employment


at the central oce enters and exits each year, while roughly 6 percent of employment in the branch network


enters and exits. There is also some movement between the branch network and the central oce.


    Table A1 provides summary statistics separately for the branches and the central function. Salaries are


on average higher for employees in central functions. This is especially true for the bonus pool which is much


larger for workers in the central functions. Other variables are fairly similar across the two samples, though


we do not have KPI ratings or nancial performance for workers in the central oce.


    Figure A2 provides some detail on the ows across dierent job levels in the rm.      There is plenty of


mobility up the hierarchy of the rm, and less mobility down, consistent with other personnel datasets


(Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom 1994a and 1994b). Workers enter and exit from all levels of the hierarchy,


though the lowest levels have much more churn.


    Figure A3 zooms in on the branch network and provides both these same ows across job levels within


the branch system, and also describes how workers move between the branches and the central corporate


oce. Promotion and demotion rates are relatively similar within the branch system, compared to the rm


as a whole. There is also a modest amount of movement to and from the central oce (bottom arrows at


each level).




A.2 Data Construction
Performance reviews take place in March of a given year, and are meant to evaluate performance over


the preceding 12 months.    We associate performance in a given period with earnings over the 12 months


immediately following that period.   For example, performance in 2012 is the review corresponding to the


period April 2011-March 2012, and earnings in 2012 are the sum of earnings from April 2012 to March


2013. This implies that in the last sample year (2014) we observe performance data but not compensation


measures.


    In the performance management system, we begin with a sample of 153,984 employee-year observations.


After dropping 5,677 observations for which we lack basic control variables we retain 148,107 employee-year




                                                     50
observations from roughly 24,000 unique workers. Next, we drop 24,055 observations that are part-time and


3,068 employees that are low-level sta such as cleaners or apprentices.                  From there, 32,554 observations


lack a performance measure. As noted in the text, this is largely because the performance system took a


few years to be fully rolled out.         In 2004, 43 percent of the sample received performance ratings but the


system spread rapidly; by 2008, 83 percent of the employees were covered. The coverage stayed at that level


or slightly above throughout the remainder of the sample period.                   The next most important reason why


observations lack performance ratings is in their rst and last year at the rm employees are less likely to


be present during the performance review period.
                                                            56 Dropping those without a performance measure leaves

us with 88,430 observations.


    In Section 2.3, we described the double xed eects regression used to understand heterogeneity across


supervisors and employees in the performance ratings that they give and receive, respectively. To create our


estimation sample, we drop 3,161 observations for whom we cannot econometrically identify their employee


xed eect or associated supervisor xed eect. The bulk of these dropped observations (2,765) come from


employees who are only in the rm for a single year and thus the employee xed eect absorbs the entire


variation. The other 396 observations are dropped because some supervisors do not have enough variation


once worker xed eects, supervisor controls, and worker controls are included in the empirical specication.


    These restrictions result in an estimation sample of 85,269 worker-year observations, corresponding to


57.6 percent of the full data set and 70.5 percent of the full-time sample.                   Within this sample, we have


77,682 observations with a compensation measure  in our last year of data, 2014, we have only performance


measures and not yet a full year of compensation data.




A.3 Worker mobility
For identifying supervisor and worker xed eects it ratings, we require that the temporary variation of


performance is exogenous to the matching of workers to supervisors.                    This is more likely to be the case


if there is no explicit process in place matching workers at particular junctions of their careers to specic


supervisors.     It is also more likely the case if there is a lot of mobility of workers and supervisors in the


rm that is unrelated to individual variation in performance. From conversations with the rm, we know


that there is no xed procedure matching workers to supervisors nor are there any a priori reasons why


temporarily low (or high)-performing workers might be matched with specic supervisors. In addition, we


note that moves across supervisors are very common in this rm. In this subsection, we describe this mobility


in more detail.
  56 There   is some systematic variation in who receives ratings in that more stable workers (e.g., those with higher tenure and
those outside of the lower job levels) are more likely to be rated. However, once the system becomes stable in 2008, observables
such as tenure or job level have very little power in predicting whether an individual will be missing a performance rating.




                                                                51
      Table A2 describes employee moves in the rm conditional on being observed in adjacent periods (t and


t + 1).      Column 1 gives the distribution of moves across job levels and business units.
                                                                                                         57 Column 2 gives

the probability that workers with a given type of move (dened by the row) changed supervisors. Columns


3-5 restrict to observations where a supervisor switch actually occurs. Column 3 gives the distribution of


supervisor switches across worker transition type. Column 4 gives the average change in                 Ï (supervisor ratings

eect) upon supervisor switch, while column 5 gives the average change in                    (the transitory component of


ratings), conditional on the type of worker transition dened in the row.


      The rst thing to note is that, even while 77% of workers remain in the same position, the remainder


move across job levels and/or business units. Further, such moves typically entail a supervisor switch. For


instance, 66% of workers making a lateral move to another business unit switch supervisors as well. If they


are also promoted, then they switch supervisors 85% of the time. Even for workers who do not move job


levels or business units, we observe that supervisor switches are relatively common (30%).                      Because the


majority of individuals remain at their position in any given year, supervisor switchers are much more likely


to come from this group (64%, column 3). The next table explores these changes, showing they are primarily


driven by dierent types of supervisor moves.


      The remaining columns of Table A2 describe the change in performance components following a supervisor


switch. In column 4, we show that workers do not face a systematic change in                  Ï when switching supervisors.

The average change overall (bottom row) of -0.006 is only 4 percent of a standard deviation in                  Ï   (see Table


3). This, to some extent, helps to allay concerns about endogenous sorting. If workers seek supervisors based


on their ratings behavior, we would expect to see more systematic changes in                  Ï.   The nal column explores


changes in      ,   the transient component of performance ratings. If the rm sorted workers to new supervisors


at a moment when they expected the worker's performance to change, that should show up in the epsilon.


Yet, for the most part, we see only small magnitudes here, especially compared to the standard deviation


of   ,   0.35. The one exception is we see negative eects for workers newly promoted. This is consistent with


some regression to the mean after an unusually positive performance generated a promotion.


      Table A3 narrows in on the group of workers who remain in the same business unit and job level but still


switch supervisors. In this table, we describe the destination of the outgoing supervisor and the change in


performance components following the switch. Conditional on employees remaining in the same position in


the rm, many supervisor switches are due to variation in the position of the supervisors. That is, for half of


these switches (one minus 0.48 in the 6th row, column 1), the old supervisor leaves their current situation.


These moves are primarily driven by supervisors exiting the sample (23 percent), but also come from lateral


moves to other business units (12 percent), and internal promotions (8 percent). Smaller fractions of outgoing

 57 We     dene a business unit move as a move to another branch or to another function within corporate.




                                                               52
supervisors are demoted or promoted across business units. Again for most of these moves the changes in                           Ï

and      are small in magnitude.
                                    58

   The table probably understates the rm's need to make reassignments following such moves because


there might be ripple eects within a unit. For example, someone leaving the business unit might necessitate


reorganizing all the teams within.


   The general message of Tables A2 and A3 is that movement of employees and supervisors across job


levels and across business units constantly requires reshuing of teams and supervisory relationships. The


frequency of this reassignment should alleviate concerns that endogenous mobility threatens our inference.


We can take this a step further by focusing on moves that are more plausibly unrelated to worker trends in


performance. In Table A4, we present log(earnings) results, akin to those in Table 5, restricting the sample


to those associated with various supervisor switches.               Column 1 reproduces the baseline model relating


log(earnings) to ratings components (column 1 of Table 5). Column 2 restricts the sample to observations


immediately following a supervisor switch and the worker stays put (the sample in Table A3). Column 3


further restricts to situations where the supervisor switched because of a move across levels, units or exit.


Finally, column 4 is restricted to a sample of supervisor exits. Reassuringly, we nd fairly similar results


across these subsamples, chosen so that the supervisor switch is, as best we can tell, outside the control of


the worker.




 58 For   supervisor demotions within the same business unit, subordinates experience a relatively large increase in      of 0.063.
This again could be regression to the mean, as a supervisor may have been demoted for unusually bad team performance.




                                                               53
B         Model Details
This appendix lls in details related to the model. We restate some of the material developed in the paper


itself.   Many results follow immediately from known results in the literature (see for example Holmstrom


[1979]) and in those cases we do not present detailed derivations.




B.1 The Basic Setup
As above and repeated here in equation 10, we assume that employee output,                             q,    depends on eort,        e,

productive type,      Î±,   and a random component        Îµq    .   Îµq    is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance            Ïq2

and independent of         (e, Î±).

                                                         q = e + Î± + Îµq                                                             (10)



We assume that the rm observes neither eort,                e,   nor output,    q,   supervisors observe   q   but not   e,   and both


parties observe     Î±.


Workers have CARA preferences              v (w, e) = âexp (âÏ (w â c (e))),           with a coecient of absolute risk


aversion   Ï.   Their preferences are additively separable in wages and eort cost                 c(e),   dened as:



                                                                          1 2
                                                        c(e) = â             e                                                      (11)
                                                                         2Âµs

The parameter       Âµs   parameterizes the notion of heterogeneity in managerial ability: better supervisors have


higher    Âµs   and reduce the marginal cost of eort.



Having observed       q,   supervisors report a rating   r    to the rm. Supervisors trade o the conicting goals of


being lenient and reporting truthfully on their employee's productivity. We embed this trade-o in


supervisor preferences in equation 12:



                                                                                  Î³Ës         2
                                          u(ws , q, r) = ws + Î²Ìs (r â q) â           (r â q)                                       (12)
                                                                                   2

Supervisors will choose        r   to maximize their utility, resulting in the following reporting function:



                                                                   Î²Ës
                                                     r=q+          Î³Ës   = q + Î²s .                                                 (13)




    The timing of the model is as follows:



    1. Workers and rms sign contracts that specify the known characteristics of the supervisors that workers




                                                                    54
       are assigned to and the linear wage function.               wi,s = ai,s + bi,s ri   . Here we explicitly index the contract


       terms with both i and s, since they can depend on both the worker and the supervisor.



     2. Workers meet with the supervisors they are assigned to, exert eort                     e,   and produce   q.

          (a) When we allow for incomplete information about supervisor types at the contracting stage, we


              assume that workers observe the actual managerial ability                Âµs upon matching with their supervisors

              and before deciding upon eort.



     3. Supervisors observe         q   and provide ratings   r.

     4. Workers are paid according to their contracted wage function.




B.2 The Informed Firm and Proposition 1
We begin by assuming that rms and workers are perfectly informed about the supervisors and workers


types :   (Âµs , Î²s , Î±).

     Thus, wage contracts are:




                                                 w = a (Âµs , Î²s , Î±) + b (Âµs , Î²s , Î±) r


     Substituting    (10)    into   (13)   and denoting by    es   the equilibrium eort that subordinates of supervisor              s

exert, we get:


                                               r = Î± + (es + Î²s ) + Îµq = Î± + Ïs + Îµq                                           (14)



The parameter       Ïs     summarizes the variation in ratings that can be attributed to the supervisor.


     The only uncertainty faced by workers at the contracting stage is about                    Îµq , which is normally distributed.

We use well-known results on the expectation of log normal random variables (deGroot, 1970) to represent


worker preferences using the certainty equivalent and express the participation constraints as follows, where


IC   represents the information available during the contracting stage and                    eâ   is the optimal eort level chosen


by the worker.
                                                                            
                                              1 â2        1          1 â2
                                    E[w â        e |IC ] â Ïvar w â     e |IC â¥ u (Î±)                                          (15)
                                             2Âµs          2         2Âµs

     Maximizing worker expected utility subject to the linear contract delivers the optimal eort choice                       eâ :


                                                              eâ = bs Âµs                                                       (16)




     Worker type     Î±     enters additively in the production function and does not aect the risk-eort trade-o.



                                                                    55
There is thus no advantage from assigning particular workers to particular supervisors. Thus, in equilibrium


any assignment is viable and both positive and negative assortative matching are entirely consistent with


our set-up.


    Substituting the optimal eort               eâ   from eq.   16      into the certainty equivalent         (15)    and simplifying, we


obtain the participation constraint:



                                                              1       Ï

    We next reproduce Proposition 1 from above, followed by the derivation.

    This results is the standard solution familiar from the literature and stated in point 1 of the proposition:

                                                                      Âµs + ÏÏq2

    Substituting the optimal eort (equation 16) and piece rate (equation 19) into the output equation 10

                                                                                       Âµs
results in     E [q|Î±, Âµs , Î²s ] = Î± + E [e|Âµs , Î²s ] = Î± + bs Âµs = Î± +             Âµs +ÏÏq2 Âµs . This establishes point 2: expected

output increases onefor-one with               Î±,   does not vary with       Î²s   and increases with   Âµs .

    Competition in the labor market implies that prots from any worker-supervisor pair are zero:




                                      Î± + bÂµs â ais â bs (Î± + Î²s + bÂµs ) â ws (Âµs , Î²s ) = 0                                          (20)

  59 For   this, set up the prot maximization of the rm subject to the participation constraint. The rst-order condition with
respect to the intercept can be used to show that the Lagrange multiplier on the participation constraint equals 1, from which
the statement in the text follows.




                                                                         56
where   ws (Âµs , Î²s )       is the wage paid to a supervisor with characteristics                            (Âµs , Î²s ).

   For expected compensation of workers (point 3), note that solving equation 20 implies that the rm


will set worker pay so that their certainty equivalent exactly equals the outside option:                                            E[w|IC ] = u (Î±) +
 1 â2   1
2Âµs e + 2 Ïvar (w|IC ). From the equation 16, the optimal eort choice does not vary with the generosity of

the supervisor       Î²s ,   so none of the terms in expected compensation vary with                                   Î²s .   The reason is that the rm


extracts the entire surplus using base compensation                         a(Âµs , Î²s , Î±i )       workers with more generous supervisors


simply see their base pay reduced. Competition also implies that expected compensation increases one-for-


one with    Î±.

   To determine the eect on average compensation, we set the derivative of the certainty equivalent with


respect to   Âµs     equal to zero since we know the entire surplus is extracted from workers:

   Workers maximize the certainty equivalent by choice of                                e.   We can thus apply the envelope condition and


ignore any variation in eort in response to variation in                           Âµs .      However, as        Âµs   varies, so will the piece rate   bs

   Expected worker compensation is thus increasing in                               Âµs   when     bs <       2 and is otherwise decreasing.

   Regarding the compensation of the supervisor (point 4), note that the zero prot condition (equation 20)


implies that worker wages will be set at their outside option. Since eort and worker compensation do not


vary with    Î²s ,   neither does the surplus across worker-supervisor pairs. Thus supervisor compensation will


not vary with       Î²s   either. Furthermore, worker ability,                  Î±i ,   is given entirely to the worker so it will not enter


the supervisor's pay. In contrast, the surplus generated by any supervisor-worker match increases in                                            Âµs .   As


rms compete for supervisors, any dierences in the surplus across                                   Âµs      are paid to the supervisor. Thus the

                                                                    âws (Âµs )
compensation of the supervisor increases in her managerial ability:
                                                                      âÂµs                                          > 0.
 60 The   piece rate is not chosen to maximize the certainty equivalent, so no envelope condition applies here.

    During the contracting stage, uncertainty now includes uncertainty about the signal noise                                                          Îµq   as well as

    Given the distributional assumptions made and using the CARA preferences, we can rewrite the partic-

    This certainty equivalent depends on how much is unknown about                                                    (Âµs , Î²s )   which is parameterized by


Î¸Î² ÏÎ²2   and   Î¸Âµ ÏÂµ2 .   The unknown variation in                 Î²s   and     Âµs     represents risk from the point of view of the worker


since it will aect her compensation and eort costs. The certainty equivalent                                                  (21)   accounts for this risk.


    Upon meeting a supervisor, employees observe the marginal cost of eort                                                 Âµs .   As before, we can solve for


the optimal eort choice, which again is                      e = bs Âµs .      The rm's problem is to maximize expected prots from

     The optimal loading is implicitly determined by the FOC of eq. 22:

                                                                                                                !!
                                                                                                     Î¸Âµ ÏÂµ2

                                                   s   = bs    ÂµE
                                                                s   +Ï   Î¸Î² ÏÎ²2   +    Ïq2   +   b2s                                                                (23)
                                                                                                       2

     The right-hand side of this expression increases monotonically in                                      b   and there is thus a unique loading


that solves the rm's problem (point 1). Furthermore, as is apparent from equation 23, the optimal piece


rate declines in     Î¸Î² ÏÎ²2   and      Î¸Âµ ÏÂµ2 .

     We can still write expected output as                    q = bÂµs + Î± + Îµq     (where            bÂµs   is still the optimal eort choice). And


this still increases one-for-on with                  Î±,   does not vary with     Î²s   (or   Î²sE ),        and is increasing in            Âµs   (and        ÂµE
                                                                                                                                                             s ).   This


establishes point 2.


     For expected compensation of workers, we can again rely on similar arguments for Proposition 1.                                                                 As


before, the rm extracts any surplus from workers during the contracting stage. Again, competition in the


labor market implies that expected compensation increases one-for-one withÎ±.                                                    And, as before, expected


compensation does not depend on the known variation in leniency bias                                                Î²sE .   This is because it enters the


workers participation constraint (eq. 21) only through the expected wage. The rm can extract any variation


in   Î²sE   using the intercept of the wage contract and thus make the expected wage independent of                                                      Î²sE .

     We thus rewrite expected compensation as (24), which is additively separable in                                               Î±   and a function that


depends on      ÂµE
                 s   only, and the pay for performance piece (a function of optimal eort and the unexpected

   By the same logic as before, we cannot sign how expected employee compensation relates to                       ÂµE
                                                                                                                    s .   Expected


compensation increases in     Î²s ,   where the coecient on     Î²s   is given by the product of the optimal piece rate


multiplied by the proportion of the variation of supervisor heterogeneity that is unknown to the rm. Finally,


since output increases in   Âµs ,   compensation also increases. This establishes point 3.


   For point 4, supervisor compensation, we note that, as before, expected output of a worker-supervisor


pair net of worker compensation does not vary with          Î²sE   or   Î²s ,   and increases in   ÂµE
                                                                                                  s   and   Âµs .   Thus, earnings


of the supervisor are independent of      Î²sE   and increase in   ÂµE

The diagram shows ows across dierent parts of the rm  the central oce and the branch network. The rectangles
are proportional to the number of employees in each part. On the left are the percentages of the employees at an
indicated part entering the rm. On the right are those leaving. For example, 9.8 percent of employees working at
the central oce entered in the preceding year; 10.6 percent left the rm. Flows between branches and central are
expressed as a percent of the origin part. For example, 2.4 percent of the employees in the central oce switch to
the branches. The numbers are averages over our sample period.

The diagram shows ows across dierent job levels for the rm as a whole. The rectangles are proportional to the
number of employees at each level. On the left are the percentages of the employees at an indicated level entering the
rm. On the right are those leaving. For example, 5.2 percent of employees working at level 4 entered the rm into
that level in the preceding year. 8.7 percent quit or were laid o from that level in a given year. The ows between
job levels are expressed as a percent of the origin level. For example, 9.6 percent of workers in level 4 are promoted
to level 5 in a given year; 0.2 percent are demoted. The numbers are averages over our sample period. Flows across
job levels not indicated in the graph (for example a move from level 4 to level 6) are rare.

The diagram is restrict to the branch network of the rm. It is similar to Figure A2, except we also include ows
between the branch system and the central oce. The rectangles are proportional to the number of employees at
each level. On the left are the percentages of the employees at an indicated level entering the branches, either from
outside the rm (top arrow), or from the central oce (bottom arrow). The arrows to the right analogously show
exits from the rm (top) or to the central oce (bottom). For example, 2.7 percent of employees working at level 4
in the branch network entered the rm into that level in the preceding year; 3 percent of employees entered level 4
in the branch network from the central oce; 6 percent of workers in level 4 of the branch network leave the rm in
a given year and 8.2 percent move to the central oce. The ows between job levels are expressed as a percent of
the origin level, and restrict to moves within the branch network. For example, 11 percent of workers in level 4 are
promoted to level 5 in a given year; 0.2 percent are demoted; the level receives 9.2 percent of those working in levels
1-3 in a given year. The numbers are averages over our sample period. Flows across job levels not indicated in the
graph (for example a move from level 4 to level 6) are rare.

Stay in firm, in business unit, with supervisor, promotion and demotion refer to any change in the worker's status over the next year. Business unit is the branch or functio
the central office. KPI rating is the branch-level ranking divided by the number of peer branches in the comparison set. Financial performance is the year-over-year growth
of the individual's financial portfolio. Bottom-up evaluation is the average of seven questions workers answer regarding their satisfication with their supervisors. Response
range from 1 to 10; we average answers on all responses and norm the variable to have a standard deviation of 1. "In Branches" equals 1 if the worker was in the branch
network and 0 if in the central corporate office.

Notes: Table is restricted to workers present in the firm in t and t+1. Column (1) shows the distribution of moves by business units and job
levels (shares sum to 1); column (2) shows the share changing supervisor, conditional on the transition type. Columns 3-5 restrict to
observations where a supervisor switch did occur (as well as the indicated type of worker transition); column (3) shows the distribution
across transition types, conditional on superisor switch; column (4) shows the change in Ï (the supervisor fixed effect in ratings),
conditional on switching; column (5) shows the change in Îµ (the transitory ratings component), conditional on switching. For row 1, for
example, column (1) shows that 3% of all observations present in the firm in adjacent years are promoted and switch to a new business
unit. Among this group (promoted and changed business units), 85% change supervisors (column 2). These supervisor changes make up
6% of all supervisor switches (column 3). The supervisor change results in an average change in phi (the supervisor ratings effect) of -
0.004 (column 5) and an average change in Îµ (the transitory ratings component) of -0.128 (column 6).

Notes: The table shows where supervisors of workers in the prior period moved conditional on a worker experiencing a
supervisor switch. The table is restricted to workers present in the firm in t and t+1 who remain in the same job level and
business unit but switch supervisors (11,639 worker-year observations). Column (1) shows the distribution of moves of the
supervisor, by business units and job levels (shares sum to 1); column (2) shows the change in Ï (the supervisor fixed effect in
ratings), conditional on the type of supervisor move; column (3) shows the change in Îµ (the transient component of ratings),
conditional on the type of supervisor move. For row 1, for example, column (1) shows that for 4% of all employees who switch
supervisors between t and t+1 (while remaining in the same job level and business unit), their supervisors are promoted and
move business units. At the same time, these workers experience an increase in Ï of 0.038 (column 2) and an increase in Îµ of
0.02 (column 3) upon switching supervisors.

Notes: Column 1 presents OLS regressions of log earnings on ratings components for the full sample (see table 5). Column 2 restricts to
observations where the worker remained in the same job level and business unit between t and t-1 but experienced a change in supervisor.
Column 3 further restricts to observations where the t-1 supervisor moved job levels, business units, or left the sample. Column 4 further
restricts to observations where the t-1 supervisor left the sample. The split-sample IV estimates supervisor and worker effects in even and odd
years, separately, and use estimates in even years as instruments for estimates in odd years and vice versa. All regressions also include
controls listed in Table 3. Standard errors are clustered by supervisor. Significance levels are represented using stars: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, *
p<0.1.
