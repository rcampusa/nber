                                            ABSTRACT

In several markets, firms compete not for consumer expenditure but instead for consumer
attention. We model and characterize how households allocate their scarce attention in arguably
the largest market for attention: the Internet. Our characterization of household attention
allocation operates along three dimensions: how much attention is allocated, where that attention
is allocated, and how that attention is allocated. Using click-stream data for thousands of U.S.
households, we assess if and how attention allocation on each dimension changed between 2008
and 2013, a time of large increases in online offerings. We identify vast and expected changes in
where households allocate their attention (away from chat and news towards video and social
media), and yet we simultaneously identify remarkable stability in how much attention is
allocated and how it is allocated. Specifically, we identify (i) persistence in the elasticity of
attention according to income and (ii) complete stability in the dispersion of attention across sites
and in the intensity of attention within sites. We illustrate how this finding is difficult to reconcile
with standard models of optimal attention allocation and suggest alternatives that may be more
suitable. We conclude that increasingly valuable offerings change where households go online,
but not their general online attention patterns. This conclusion has important implications for
competition and welfare in other markets for attention.

1. Introduction

        “…[I]n an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of
        something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What
        information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.
        Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate
        that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that
        might consume it.” (Simon, 1971).




        Herb Simon brought attention to the economic importance of attention, first articulated
about information systems, which applies to any situation with abundant information. The
observation remains relevant today, even more so for the information supplied by the
commercial Internet. A scarce resource, users’ attention, must be allocated across the Internet’s
vast supply of web sites. Firms compete for user attention.

        At first glance, competition among Internet sites has much in common with other
competitive settings. Users make choices about where to allocate their time, and in any
household there is only a finite amount of such time to allocate, which translates into a finite
budget of time for which firms compete. In some cases (e.g., electronic commerce), the firms try
to convert that attention into sales of products. At over $360 billion per year, e-commerce
comprises eight percent of total US sales in 2016. 1 In other cases (e.g., most media), firms try to
convert that attention into advertising sales, which amounts to $67 billion of spending. 2 Firms
compete for users by investing in web page design, in internal search functions, and in other
aspects such as the speed at which relevant information loads. Over time, new firms enter with
new offerings, and users can respond by making new choices, potentially substituting one source
of supply for another.

        However, first impressions mislead. Competition among web sites lacks one of the
standard hallmarks of competition. Relative prices largely do not determine user choice among

options, nor do prices determine competitive outcomes. Most households pay for monthly
service, then allocate online time among endless options without further expenditure. Unless a
household faces a binding cap on usage, no price shapes any other marginal decision. Instead,
choice depends on the non-monetary frictions and the gains of the next best choice. Present
evidence suggests only a small fraction of users face the shadow of monetary constraints while
using online resources (Nevo, Turner, Williams, 2015). Relatedly, subscription services also play
little role. As we will show below, only one of the top twenty sites (Netflix) is a subscription
service, i.e., where the price of a web site plays an explicit role in decision making.

       In this study, we use extensive microdata on user online choice to help us characterize
demand for the services offered online. The demand for services by a household is the supply of
attention for which firms compete. The study characterizes household heterogeneity in allocation
of attention at any point in time, and how households substitute between sources of supply over
time. We ground the analysis in a specific time period, the allocation of US household attention
in the years 2008 and 2013, which was a time of enormous change in the supply of online
options for the more than 70% of US households with broadband connections to the Internet.
During this five-year period, US households experienced a massive expansion in online video
offerings, social media, and points of contact (e.g., tablets, smartphones), among other changes.

       Our dataset contains information for more than forty thousand primary home computers,
or “home devices,” at US households in 2008 and more than thirty thousand in 2013. These data
come from ComScore, a firm that tracks households over an entire year, recording all of the web
sites visited, as well as some key demographics. The unit of observation is a week’s worth of
choices made by households. We calculate the weekly market for online attention (total time), its
concentration (in terms of time) for sites (our measure of breadth, or “focus”), and the weekly
fraction of site visits that lasted at least 10 minutes (our measure of depth, or “dwelling”). In
addition, we measure shares of attention for different site categories (e.g., social media). Using
these measures of online attention, we analyze how they vary both horizontally (across
demographics) and vertically (over time, 2008-2013).

       We find that demand is comprised of a surprising mix of discretionary and inflexible
behavior. First, we find strong evidence that income plays an important role in determining the
allocation of time to the Internet. This finding reconfirms an earlier estimate of a relationship

                                                  2
between income and extent of Internet use (Goldfarb and Prince, 2008), but does so using a more
expansive and detailed dataset, and for later years when broadband access is more prevalent. We
find that higher income households spend less total time online per week. Households making
$25,000-$35,000 a year spend ninety-two more minutes a week online than households making
$100,000 or more a year in income, and differences vary monotonically over intermediate
income levels. Relatedly, we also find that the amount of time on the home device only slightly
changes with increases in the number of available web sites and other devices – it slightly
declines between 2008 and 2013 – despite large increases in online activity via smartphones and
tablets over this time. Finally, the monotonic negative relationship between income and total
time suggests online attention is an inferior good, and we find that this relationship remains
stable, exhibiting a similar slope of sensitivity to income. We call this property persistent
attention inferiority. There is a generally similar decline in total time across all income groups,
which is consistent with a simple hypothesis that the allocation of time online at a personal
computer declines in response to the introduction of new devices.

       We also examine how breadth and depth changed with the massive changes in supply
(i.e., video proliferation and Internet points of contact) between 2008 and 2013. Our casual
expectation was that depth would increase, and more tentatively, that breadth would increase as
well, but the findings do not conform to such expectations. Rather, breadth and depth have
remained remarkably stable over the five years. While there is a statistical difference in the joint
distribution of breadth and depth, it is just that – statistical and driven by our large sample. The
size of the difference is remarkably small, with little implied economic consequence. We call this
property persistent attention distribution. Despite the evidence that income and other economic
variables affect total time online, demographics – perhaps surprisingly – predict little of the
variation in breadth and depth. For one, breadth and depth are not well-predicted by income and
there is only a limited role played by major demographics, such as family education, household
size, age of head of household, and presence of children.

       This stability of breadth and depth contrasts with substantial volatility in the types of sites
households visit. Between 2008 and 2013, households substitute online categories such as chat
and news for social media and video. In addition, demographics again are predictive of the
outcome – household characteristics such as income strongly predict the category of sites that are


                                                  3
visited. For example, higher income households prefer services that examine credit history, offer
educational services, support games, provide news, support online banking, offer online
shopping, provide online sports services, and supply online video services. To summarize: new
offerings did alter where households went online, only mildly altered how much total time they
spent on their machines, and did not meaningfully alter their general breadth and depth – as if the
determinants of total time, and which sites to visit, are distinct from the determinants of breadth
and depth.

       These findings have important implications for competition for online attention. Our
results imply that reallocation of online attention takes place in the presence of inflexibility of
breadth/depth decisions. Reallocation of online attention comes almost entirely in the form of
changes in how households select from a portfolio of different web sites, but not in the form of
changes in total time or breadth and depth. Altogether, these findings are inconsistent with some
models of attention allocation, especially those models lacking any frictions, such as setup costs.
They are consistent with a theory that is behavioral in its foundations. This model suggests
households are endowed with a fixed set of “slots” of attention to allocate to sites, as if
households typically have fixed amounts of time. These amounts of time do not vary but are
switched between different categories of web sites. As discussed below, these observations lead
to many open questions about online competition.




1.1.Contribution to prior literature

       The commercial Internet supports enormous amounts of economic activity, and it has
experienced increases in online offerings throughout its short existence. Starting from modest
beginnings in the mid-1990s, this sector of the US economy today supports tens of billions of
dollars of advertising revenue and trillions in revenue from online sales. Not surprisingly, that
phenomenon has spawned an extensive literature, and it has grown so much that it merits
handbooks to cover the research (Peitz and Waldfogel, 2012). These handbooks organize the
literature around many sub-topics, such as the supply and demand for infrastructure, online and
offline competition (Lieber and Syverson, 2012), and the supply and demand for online
advertising (Anderson, 2012).


                                                  4
       One theme cuts across many of these topics: all households get their time from some
other non-Internet leisure activity, and different online activities compete with each other in the
household’s budget for time. While researchers recognize that users pay an opportunity cost
during online time by withdrawing from other leisure activity or household production activity
(Webster, 2014, Wallsten, 2013), the household’s time for, and attention to, its online activities
remains incompletely characterized. No work has characterized the three basic types of online
attention measurements – how much attention is used, how is it allocated, and where is it
allocated? Hence, there is no widely accepted baseline model of aggregate demand for online
activity (and supply of attention) built from a common understanding of online behavior.

       Such a characterization can inform research about the economic allocation of time in
general. Below we will present a standard economic model of time allocation, which follows the
prior literature (Hauser et al. 1993, Ratchford et al. 2003, Savage and Waldman 2009) and finds
its roots in Becker (1965). Prior research has used this approach to demonstrate the demand for,
and market value of, for example, speed in broadband access, which users spread over a vast
array of content (Rosston, Savage, and Waldman, 2010, Hitt and Tambe, 2007). We take this
approach in a different direction, highlighting theoretical ambiguities regarding predicted
changes in online attention with increased online offerings, ambiguities which highlight the role
of frictions in user allocations. We create novel measures of online attention allocation designed
to capture the total time allocated to online offerings and the breadth and depth of a household’s
online attention, and then ask whether user patterns of online behavior are consistent with the
predictions of a basic theoretical model of the allocation of time without frictions.

       This new direction will also have implications for prior work about the consumer surplus
generated by online activity. Prior research has, again, taken the standard model of time
allocation in a frictionless labor/leisure framework and estimated a specification for the
parameters characterizing demand for time on all households (Goolsbee and Klenow, 2006,
Brynjolfsson and Oh, 2012). In contrast, because we can see more about the user’s allocation of
time, we can use that additional information to characterize the entire time spent online, and the
distribution of online time. That will focus on behavior inconsistent with a frictionless model of
the labor/leisure tradeoff.



                                                  5
       This theme also can inform research into disputes, which, until now, leave aside
examination of how the specific dispute fits into the larger household allocation decision. For
example, search engine competition has motivated some studies on competition for attention
(Athey, Calvano and Gans, 2013, Gabaix, 2014). In addition, there has been some formal
statistical work on the competition for attention in the context of conflicts for very specific
applications, such as, for example, conflicts between news aggregators and news sites (Chiou
and Tucker, 2015, Athey and Mobius, 2012), and conflict between different search instruments
(Baye et al. 2016). Each of these disputes contrasts implications from settings in which frictions
are a large or small factor in user choice. Our results will be consistent with models that stress
the transaction costs of user online activity.

       The focus of this study contrasts with the typical focus in the marketing literature on
online advertising. As the Internet ecosystem increases the availability of online offerings,
consumers can adjust their online attention to gain value in several ways. Specifically,
consumers can: 1) Increase the total amount of attention they allocate to the Internet, 2) Re-
allocate their ad-viewing attention to better targeted ads, and/or 3) Re-allocate their attention to
more and/or higher value sites. Much of the prior work pertaining to online advertising has
focused on #2, namely, the principles of targeting ads. This is largely driven by firms tapping
into “big data” and extensive information about users’ private behavior, which was previously
unobserved and merits study for marketing purposes. The marketing literature on targeting tends
not to focus on why behavior changes by consumers as supply changes. In contrast, our analysis
centers on the reaction of households to changes in supply, which focuses on the determinants of
#1 and #3, which are generally under the control of the consumer, and as of this writing, have
been less studied and are less understood. This leads to a different conceptualization about
competition for attention.

       As we conducted this study, we were surprised to learn that the findings (partially)
overlap with conclusions drawn from field work conducted by economic anthropologists and
researchers on user-machine design. That line of research also collects microdata and uses it to
characterize features of demand. It has documented the periodic – or “bursty” – use of many
online sources, consistent with some of our findings concerning breadth (Lindley, Meek, Sellen,
Harper, 2012, Kawsaw and Brush, 2013). It also documents the “plasticity” of online attention,


                                                  6
as an activity that arises from the midst of household activities as a “filler” activity (Rattenbury,
Nafus and Anderson, 2008, Adar, Teevan, Dumais, 2009), which provides an explanation for the
consistency of breadth and depth patterns within a household in spite of large changes in the
available options. We make these links in the discussion of the findings. Hence, we view our
work as a bridge between economic analysis and conversations within other sites of social
science.




2. Dynamics of the Internet Ecosystem: 2008-2013

       The era we examine is one characterized by rapid technical advance and widespread
adoption of new devices. Continuing patterns seen since the commercialization of the Internet in
the 1990s (Greenstein, 2015), new technical invention enabled the opportunity for new types of
online activity and new devices. For example, the cost of building an engaging web site declined
each year as software tools improved, the effectiveness of advertising improved, and the cost of
microprocessors declined. In addition, the cost of sending larger amounts of data to a user
declined each year as broadband network capacity increased. By the beginning of our sample
many online suppliers and startups had begun experimenting with applications that made
extensive use of data-intensive video.

       The start of our time period is near the end of the first diffusion of broadband networks.
By 2007, close to sixty-two million US households had adopted broadband access for their
household Internet needs, while by 2013 the numbers were seventy-three million. The earlier
year also marked a very early point in the deployment of smart phones, streaming services, and
social media. The first generation of the iPhone was released in June 2007, and it is widely
credited with catalyzing entry of Android-based phones the following year. By 2013, more than
half of US households had a smartphone. Tablets and related devices did not begin to diffuse
until 2010, catalyzed, once again, by the release of an Apple product – in this case, the iPad in
April, 2010.

       Also relevant to our setting are the big changes in online software. Streaming services
had begun to grow at this time, with YouTube entering in February, 2005, and purchased by
Google in October 2006. Netflix and Hulu both began offering streaming services in 2008.

                                                  7
Social media was also quite young. For example, Twitter launched in March 2006, while
Facebook launched in February 2004, and offered widespread public access in September 2006.
By 2013, social media had become a mainstream online application, and, as our data will show,
was widely used. In summary, the supply of options for users changed dramatically over the time
period we examine.



3. A Model of Online Attention

       In this section we present a standard model of attention allocation applied to households’
online attention allocation decisions. Subsequently, we use the model to examine the predicted
effects of two shocks and evaluate the assumptions needed for the model to rationalize our
empirical findings.




3.1. The Standard Model with Setup Costs

   As pertains to attention allocation, we could propose a number of different models. Our
model of online attention is standard and follows the basic structure of the seminal work by
Becker (1965) on the allocation of time, which has been adapted by others in various ways to
examine household demand for broadband (e.g. Savage and Waldman 2009). Alternatives
include a number of different search models (e.g., Gabaix 2014) that develop intuition for length
and variety in the allocation of time. In either case, these models fix ideas and help guide the
dimensions of analysis, but yield only simple predictions. We develop the standard approach and
then make references to a behavioral approach with similar predictions.

   Critical to any model is that visits to online sites do not carry a price; rather, the cost of a site
visit is the opportunity cost of that attention which could be allocated elsewhere. Further, we
suppose that there is a setup cost to visiting each site. The setup cost can be interpreted as either
a necessary minimum time cost to absorb the information at a site, a cognitive cost of switching
sites, a time cost of waiting for a new site to load, or so on. The existence of any such cost will
generate continuous visits to sites that end only when the marginal utility from additional time



                                                   8
spent at the site falls below the marginal utility of visiting some other site (or choosing some
offline activity) net of the switching cost.

    In this setting, household i chooses the amount of time to spend at each Internet site (tij) on
its “home device” to maximize its standard continuous, differentiable utility function net of setup
costs:

                                                                             ���⃗ � - ∑𝐽𝑗 1(𝑡𝑖𝑗 > 0)𝐹
                  (1) 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡𝑖1 ,…,𝑡𝑖𝐽 𝑈�𝑡𝑖1 , … , 𝑡𝑖𝐽 , 𝑇𝑖 − �𝑡𝑖1 + ⋯ + 𝑡𝑖𝐽 �; 𝑊

                                s.t. 𝑡𝑖1 ≥ 0, … , 𝑡𝑖𝐽 ≥ 0, 𝑇𝑖 ≥ (𝑡𝑖1 + ⋯ + 𝑡𝑖𝐽 )

                                                               ���⃗ represents all relevant features
where F is the setup cost of visiting a site. In equation (1), 𝑊
(i.e., content, subscription fee – if any, etc.) for the available web sites. Further, Ti represents all
time available to household i in, say, a week, and the final argument of U(.) is the equivalent of a
composite good; in this case, it represents all other activities for which household i could be
using its time (e.g., sleep, work, exercise, and time on other devices). Hence, this formulation
implicitly assumes household i fully exhausts all of its available time.

                                                                                      ∗
         For the moment, we place no structure on the utility function, so we define 𝑡𝑖𝑗 =
𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 (1) as the attention allocation function that solves this problem. A natural way of
characterizing this function is in terms of total time, and the breadth and depth of that allocation
of time online. We start with total time on the device over a “representative” period. For
illustrative purposes, think of this as a week of time. 3 The model produces the following identity
for time online for household i (TOi) when there are J sites:

                                                                 ∗
                                                   (2) 𝑇𝑂𝑖 = ∑𝑗 𝑡𝑖𝑗
         Next, we consider measures for breadth and depth of online time allocation. That is, how
is attention allocated across sites, and how intensely is it allocated within a site? Our measure of
breadth stems from the classic literature in industrial organization. Specifically, we measure



3
  In the data section below, we have experimented considerably with alternative units of analysis, such as a day,
week, month and year. Consistent with many available measures of the Internet and, more broadly, leisure time
(e.g., Wallsten, 2013), we have found considerable variability in household online use day to day, and hour to hour.
However, in preliminary work not shown here, we have found considerable stability in weekly patterns of online
behavior, and that the same households differ from one another in much the same way week after week. Hence, in
this study, we focus exclusively on characterizing one “representative” week for a household.

                                                          9
breadth using a Herfindahl-Herschman index for time spent at sites visited by household i,
denoted Ci. We define Ci as:

                                                              𝑡 ∗2
                                         (3) 𝐶𝑖 = ∑𝐽𝑗 (𝑡 ∗ +⋯+
                                                            𝑖𝑗

                                                         𝑖1    𝑡∗    𝑖𝑁 )



       Defined this way, our measure of breadth captures the level of concentration (in terms of
time at sites) household i exhibits in its site visits. This measure works equally well in the cross-
section and over time. At any point in time it measures heterogeneity across households: a high
value for Ci indicates a breadth of visits that is highly concentrated at a small number of sites,
whereas a low value for Ci indicates a breadth of visits that is unconcentrated, i.e., spread out
across relatively many sites. It also can measure changes over time: Ci gets larger as a household
substitutes a larger fraction of its time into fewer web sites.

   Our measure of depth takes inspiration from an early constraint on YouTube, specifically the
cap on video length of ten minutes, which lasted until mid-2010. We measure depth as the
fraction of site visits by household i that lasted at least ten minutes, denoted Li. If the setup cost
is strictly positive, the standard model suggests households spend all of their time at each site
continuously. Hence, the depth of households’ visits can be summarized by the fraction that
exceed a given threshold of time, 𝑡̅:

                                                ∑𝐽𝑗 1(𝑡𝑖𝑗 > t)̅
                                         𝐿𝑖 =
                                                ∑𝐽𝑗 1(𝑡𝑖𝑗 > 0)

       To calculate Li in practice, we must decompose the optimal time spent at each site during
                                                            ∗
the given time period (e.g., a week). To see this, suppose 𝑡𝑖1 = 30. Hence, time spent at site #1
during the observed week was thirty minutes. However, this measurement does not distinguish
between a thirty-minute block that consists of six separate visits lasting five minutes each and
one visit lasting thirty minutes. Our measure of depth would account for such a difference.

       In order to construct Li, we first define ����⃗
                                                 𝑆𝚤𝚥 as the vector of session lengths (i.e., segments

of continuous time) at site j for household i. Hence, the length of ����⃗
                                                                    𝑆𝚤𝚥 is the number of separate
                                                 ∗
visits made by household i to site j. Next, let 𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑘 be the optimal time spent by household i at site



                                                   10
                                ∗
j during session k; therefore, 𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑘                            ����⃗
                                    is simply the kth entry in 𝑆               ∗      ∗
                                                                  𝚤𝚥 , and ∑𝑘 𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝑡𝑖𝑗 . Given these

additional definitions, we define Li as:

                                                               ∗
                                                      ∑𝑗 ∑𝑘 1(𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑘 >10)
                                           (4) 𝐿𝑖 =            ∗ >0)
                                                      ∑𝑗 ∑𝑘 1(𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑘

        As defined, Li is the proportion of total site visits that lasted more than ten minutes for
household i. Again, this measure works equally well in the cross-section and over time. At any
point in time it measures heterogeneity across households in the fraction of time spent in longer
sessions, with higher L indicating a higher fraction. It also measures changes over time in a
household, with an increase in L indicating that a household has substituted some of its time into
longer sessions.

        An illustration can help build intuition for how these measures characterize cross
sectional heterogeneity in online attention. We consider our first metric (Ci) to be a measure of
focus – households with a high value for Ci focus their attention on a relatively small number of
sites, and vice versa for households with a low values for Ci. We consider our second metric (Li)
to be a measure of a household’s propensity to dwell at the sites it visits – households with a high
value for Li tend to dwell at sites, while households with a low value for Li behave more like a
tourist, visiting for a brief stint. Building on this intuition, we envision the very simple 2x2
classification of households using these two metrics in Table 1 as a conceptual benchmark of
heterogeneity across households.

                                           [Table 1 about here]

Now that we have detailed our measures of online attention in terms of “how much?” and “how
is it allocated?,” we consider one last measure: “where is it allocated?” For this measure, we
calculate shares of total time online on the home device for different site categories (we list the
specific categories for our analysis below). Thus, we define TSc as the share of total time across
all households spent at sites in category c. Formally, we have:

                                                                 ∗
                                                        ∑𝑖 ∑𝑗∈𝑐 𝑡𝑖𝑗
                                           (5) 𝑇𝑆𝑐 =      ∑𝑖 𝑇𝑂𝑖

        Again, this measure works equally well for characterizing heterogeneity at a point in
time, and changes in a household over time. That said, we think this measure suggests one


                                                   11
approach to measuring changes in the extent of competition among sites. We expect new site
entry to lead to turnover when users direct their attention to new categories of web sites. One
measure of competition is the fraction of total attention that moves to these new categories.




Section 3.2. Effects of Two Model Shocks

        Over the time period of our data, two important shocks occurred. First, a wave of new
sites entered the worldwide web, and many of these new sites offered large amounts of video
content. For example, Netflix and Hulu both began offering streaming online video during the
earliest year of our data, and YouTube began allowing videos longer than ten minutes within the
span of our data. While some sites exited during the time we analyze, the net change in sites was
positive, with a notable increase in online video available. This influx of sites manifests as an
increase in J to J* and a change in the full list of sites – and their characteristics – comprising the
J* total sites.

        The second shock to our model was due to the release of a new batch of connected
devices – in particular, tablets and smartphones. Because our model and data focus on the
primary personal computer at the home, this shock essentially altered the composition of the
composite good within the model.

        An increase in the number of sites from J to J* and the introduction of alternative devices
affects the household utility maximizing problem as follows.

    (6) 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡               𝑑𝑒𝑣    𝑑𝑒𝑣

    0)𝐹

                                        s.t. 𝑡𝑖1 ≥ 0, … , 𝑡𝑖𝐽 ∗ ≥ 0, 𝑇𝑖 ≥ (𝑡𝑖1 +. . . +𝑡𝑖𝐽 ∗ )



        The household faces more site choices and the option to consume them on an alternative
device. We assume setup costs affect the alternate device as they do the home device, which
suggests the model’s insight about the household allocation closely mirrors that without
additional sites or an additional device. We ask how these two changes impact three key



                                                             12
outcomes within our model: total time, breadth, and depth. That is, we ask how these changes
impact how much time and how it is allocated.

           Without more information about the utility function and size of setup costs, the model
could predict either an increase or decrease in the household’s total time online and its breadth
and depth of browsing on the home device. Here we place some structure on the household’s
maximization problem to generate simple predictions about the response of households’ attention
allocation decisions to the two shocks.

           If the utility function is symmetric among sites, quasilinear in an unchanging offline
outside option, and the setup costs are small, then an increase in the number of sites weakly
increases the total amount of time online, and decreases the concentration of time spent across
sites on the home device. 4 The standard model with small setup costs does not make a prediction
about the depth of browsing because, without setup costs, a given amount of time spent at a site
can be split in any way and still yield the same total utility. The introduction of an alternative
device is predicted to weakly decrease the total amount of time spent on the home device, and to
have no effect on the breadth of browsing on the home device.                        With small setup costs, the
model again does not make a prediction about the depth of browsing.

           When setup costs are large, then the household may have already been constrained to
visit fewer than J sites before the shock and will continue to visit the same number of sites after
the shock, so that the concentration of time across sites is unchanged. If the household was not
constrained by setup costs before the shock, then concentration of time across sites will fall.
Additionally, the marginal effect of the introduction of an alternative device is to weakly
increase concentration: site visits on the alternative device increase the time share of the sites
viewed on the home device.




                                                [Table 2 about here]

           Table 2 summarizes the effect of the two shocks on the household’s time online (𝑇𝑂𝑖 ),
breadth of browsing (𝐶𝑖 ), and depth of browsing (𝐿𝑖 ) under the standard model with small and

4
    The appendix contains the details of the microeconomics behind this prediction and those that follow.

                                                           13
large positive setup costs. The standard model predicts an ambiguous effect on 𝑇𝑂𝑖 whether
setup costs are small or large, while the model predicts a decrease in 𝐶𝑖 , if setup costs are small,
and an ambiguous change in 𝐶𝑖 , if setup costs are large. The predicted effect on 𝐿𝑖 is 0, if setup
costs are large and there is no prediction for small setup costs. However, it is worth noting that
the standard model with setup costs and symmetric utility suggests the level of 𝐿𝑖 is either 0 or 1:
all sessions are the same length in equilibrium, so they all are either above or below any
specified threshold. Since we do not explicitly model different categories of sites, our model is
silent with respect to how households will reallocate attention across different types of site
categories in response to the two model shocks. This limitation also constrains our ability to
generate a predicted response to the growth in video and social media sites in a formal sense,
although informally, the high time demands of such sites suggest a predicted increase in Li.

       A behavioral approach to the same problem leads to similar forecasts. For example,
Gabaix (2014) considers an agent facing a decision problem which requires the agent to
incorporate information from a large number of variables. In practice, an agent cannot pay
attention to all variables; Gabaix formalizes this notion by requiring the agent to incur a “psychic
cost” for each variable to which the agent chooses to pay attention. In this setting, Gabaix’s agent
will decide to pay attention to only a subset of variables that deliver a marginal benefit (of
importance) greater than the psychic marginal cost and will ignore all others. Gabaix’s
environment and theoretical predictions parallel ours: a user simply cannot pay attention to all
sites and continues to visit additional sites until the marginal benefit of an additional site (net of
the opportunity cost of offline activities) reaches the marginal setup cost.

       In the following sections, we take our measures of households’ depth and breadth of
online browsing to the data to examine how these measures changed over our sample period and
to evaluate the standard model’s predictions. We will not provide standard economic measures
of substitution because there are no prices with which to measure cross-price elasticities and
related values. Instead, we use our measures of “how much,” “how is it allocated,” and “where is
it allocated” with regard to online attention on the home device – as defined in equations 2
through 5. By doing so, we can observe if households altered their behavior with respect to these
outcomes over the timespan of our data and, if so, how.



                                                  14
3.3. Hypothesis development

        Our hypotheses distinguish between distinct determinants originating at the supply-side
and demand-side in the attention economy. We postulate that supply determines the menu of
available choices, and a different set of factors, such as household characteristics, determines the
final allocation.

        What determines the shock to the menu of choices available to users? Since these
inventions become available to all market participants, such technical advance induces three
responses of relevance to competition for attention: (1) Existing web sites improve their
offerings in a bid for user attention; (2) entrepreneurial firms conceive of new services to offer
online in a bid for user attention; and (3) new devices enter to attract user attention. Collectively,
these determine the “supply” of web sites bidding for the attention of users in time t, which we
summarize as St.

        As for demand, we further postulate every household i in time t has a set of demographic
characteristics – education and income – that allocate their attention among the available menu
of options. We call these variables Xi. Together with supply, an allocation for a household can be
characterized as three relationships:

        Total time: TOit = TO(St ,Xit)

        Concentration (breadth): Cit = C(St ,Xit)

        Length (depth): Lit = L(St ,Xit)

        What are the properties of this allocation? Goldfarb and Prince (2008) have shown that
households with high income are more likely to adopt the dial-up Internet, but they do not use
the Internet as intensively as those with a lower income. They hypothesize that this is due to the
outside option value of leisure/work time. In this setting, if Xit is income, the Goldfarb-Prince
effect would treat online time as an inferior good, and appear as:

        H1. TOx(St ,Xit) < 0.

        We seek to learn whether this income effect holds in our measures of online attention,
and on very different data at a much later period, when broadband dominates connections. A

                                                  15
further question is whether time online on the home device has changed over time. That is, has
the improvement in devices attracted user attention away from the improving web sites on PCs,
or were web site improvements substantial enough to increase time on the home device, despite
the advent of alternative devices? The null hypothesis specifies no change in total time:

       H2. TO(St ,Xit) - TO(St-1,Xit-1) = 0.

       The alternative to the null hypothesis could be a decrease in total time if households
substitute into other devices. If we reject H2, then an interesting question focuses on whether the
income effect has changed over time. That is, despite declines in the level of total time online,
has the rate of the relationship between income and time online remained the same? Again, the
null is no change:

       H3. TOx(St ,Xit) – TOx(St-1 ,Xit-1) = 0.

       We can also ask whether greater online time leads to greater breadth and depth? If so,
then – once again, assuming X is income – we would expect a larger X to lead to a lower total
time and less breadth and less depth. Initially we seek to test the null hypothesis in a one tail test,
where the null is:

       H4. Cx(St ,Xit) = 0 and Lx(St ,Xit) = 0, and the alternative is:

       H4A. Cx(St ,Xit) < 0 and Lx(St ,Xit) < 0.

       Once again, and parallel to the discussion for H2 and H3, if we reject H4 for H4A, then
the next question concerns changes to the determinants of breadth and depth.

       We also can test the reaction of households to growth in supply of options. As has been
widely reported, social networking applications and streaming have become more available over
time. We expect users to substitute some of their time to these new applications. Did this
substitution change the measured breadth and depth? We expect new sources of supply to
increase depth and breadth, so we set up a test to reject the null, where the null is for no change,
expressed as:

       H5. C(St ,Xit) - C(St-1,Xit-1) = 0, and L(St ,Xit) - L(St-1,Xit-1) = 0.



                                                    16
       Similar to the above discussion about H2 and H3, after testing H5, we can further test
whether breadth and depth are sensitive to demographics.

       We stress that the longer the time period between t and t-1, the more likely the null
hypothesis is rejected. That is because the null defines household stability in the allocation of
breadth and depth in spite of changes in options available to households. In addition, options
grow much larger with the passage of longer time. In our case, five years is a substantial amount
of time for changes in Internet supply. Substitution can arise from a vast array of endless
possibilities, either splitting up a large unit of time into many smaller units of time, or from
taking many small units and putting them together into one long unit. After years of dramatic
changes in supply we would not expect similar patterns to arise.




4. Data

       We obtained household machine-level browsing data from Comscore for the years 2008
and 2013. We observe one machine for each household for the entire year, either all of 2008 or
all of 2013. Here, the machine should be interpreted as the household’s primary home computer.
The information collected includes the sites visited on the machine, how much time was spent at
each site, and the number of pages visited within the site. We also observe several
corresponding household demographic measures including income, education, age, household
size, and the presence of children. For simplicity we consider only the first four weeks of a
month and do not consider partial fifth weeks, so the maximum number of weeks for a household
cannot exceed forty-eight. Importantly, we delete households that have fewer than six months of
at least five hours of monthly browsing. We also delete the very few households with more than
the 10,080 maximum number of minutes online per week, the result of a defective tracking
device. For 2008, we are left with 40,590 out of 57,708 households, and for 2013 we are left
with 32,750 out of 46,926 households. In both years, this amounts to over one million machine-
week observations. We observe an average of 42.1 and 41.5 (medians 45 and 44) machine weeks
per household (s.d. = 6.9 both years) for 2008 and 2013.


                                                  17
       Summary statistics of our demographic measures are presented in Table 3. These
demographics include household income categories, educational attainment of the head of the
household, household size, the age of the head of the household, and an indicator for the
presence of children. Comscore’s sampling of households is known to target towards higher
income households, and we observe that those income levels are comparable across the 2008 and
2013 data. Unfortunately, the education identifiers are mostly missing in 2008, and only
available for roughly half of all households in 2013. While there do not appear to be any major
differences in the sample composition across years, the 2013 heads of households are mildly
younger. In addition, Comscore provides no information on the speed of the broadband
connection except to indicate that virtually all of them are not dial-up.

                                        [Table 3 about here]

       Table 4 presents summary statistics, such as the concentration of time across sites and the
fraction of sessions that exceed ten minutes. If a household is online in a given week, it spends
roughly fifteen hours online per week on average in 2008 and fourteen hours online in 2013.
Perhaps surprisingly, our measures of browsing behavior are virtually identical across years, with
75% of sessions lasting over ten minutes and households’ allocation of time across sites being
quite concentrated with an HHI of approximately 2,900. We discuss these similarities in greater
detail in the next two sections after associating the variance in them with demographic
characteristics of households.

                                        [Table 4 about here]

       We face two concerns with the measurement of household time online, biasing the
measurement in opposite directions – one upward and the other downward. First, Comscore does
not know if a user is watching calmly or left the room with the browser open, possibly biasing
our measure upward. It ends the timing for sessions after a fixed period of inactivity, but not
until additional time has been added to a session. While we observe some correlates with this
mismeasurement (such as multitasking) – and that will help in testing for its importance – there
is no practical way to fully eliminate it. In contrast, another factor can bias the length of sessions
downward. Many content firms typically use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to put content
at the edge of the network, which reduces the delay experienced by users (e.g., Akamai provides


                                                  18
such services to many content firms). In some cases, when the user is switched to a CDN, the
name of the CDN (e.g., Akamai) will show up in the browser (e.g., instead of the name of the
web site which hired Akamai to host the content on its CDN), even though the user has not
discontinued their session. In this case a session will appear shorter than it actually is. Most firms
try to retain their brand name in the URL so as not to confuse users, but close inspection of the
data shows that this is not always the case. Again, there is no foolproof strategy to detect this
bias.

        Our approach will recognize these biases, treat them as a source of error, and compensate
our analysis when feasible. Fortunately, Comscore did not fundamentally alter its data collection
processes between 2008 and 2013 in these dimensions, so our analysis assumes a similar
distribution of the biases in the two years of the data. We also do not expect these to differ
systematically across application or demographics except in a few instances which we describe
below. We also will test this assumption in the analysis when we examine the sensitivity of
inferences to multitasking.




5. Empirical Analysis

        In this section, we present three types of results that shed light on three corresponding
basic questions pertaining to online attention: how, how much and where? In the first
subsection, we present findings concerning total time online (how much). In the second
subsection, we present findings concerning our measures of fundamental browsing behavior
(how). In the third subsection, we present findings on the shares of attention garnered by
different online content categories (where). For each of these sets of findings, we analyze how
they vary both horizontally (across demographics) and vertically (over time, 2008-2013). We
discuss key insights from these comparisons in Section 6.




5.1 Total Time Online

        Our first set of analyses concern total time online on the PC. We are limited in our ability
to draw conclusions about the total time spent online by a household across all devices, and we

                                                 19
possess no information about which household member spent time on the PC in multi-dweller
households.

       First, our summary statistics show that the average household spends approximately two
hours per day on the Internet. When considering vertical changes in total time, our theory
predicted that time on the PC could go up or down over the years. We see, in fact, that total time
online on the primary home device declined by approximately 5% between 2008 and 2013,
which rejects the null on H2. If we assume total time online across all devices increased during
this time (see Allen 2015, which supports this assumption), this suggests at least a minimal
amount of substitution of online attention across devices. Nonetheless, the decline we observe is
rather small, suggesting that much of the increased online attention on tablets and smartphones is
in addition to, and not in place of, online attention on the home PC. We will come back to this
hypothesis with further analysis below.

       Next, we examine cross-sectional differences in total time online on the home device, and
whether and how this relationship may have changed between 2008 and 2013. The existing
literature studying Internet technology has found that adoption of most Internet technology
frontiers is predicted by more income and more education, and (up to a point) younger ages and
larger families. Most standard models of the adoption of new products presume that the same set
of factors predicts both adoption and the extent of use of new technology. However, we observe
the Internet many years after most households first used it. The Internet also holds the potential
to respond to a different set of forces because it generally consumes leisure time and not money.

       We present the results of a simple OLS regression of time online per week on
demographics, and show the results in Table 5. These results show that total time is sensitive to
income. For example, in 2008, looking at the income endpoints, those with incomes greater than
$100,000 spend 835 minutes of time online per week while those with incomes less than $15,000
spend 979 minutes of time online. A similar monotonicity appears in 2013. This confirms H1,
namely, total time online declines with increased income. In Figure 1, we show how this
relationship compares across our two years of 2008 and 2013. Although we get a statistical
rejection of H3, it is clear that there is no important qualitative change in the relationship
between time online and income over this period. Hence, in spite of different access technologies
and extensive changes in patterns of use in later years, the role of income as a determinant of

                                               20
total time online for the home device is consistent with what has been previously identified in the
literature. 5

                                              [Table 5 about here]

                                              [Figure 1 about here]

         While our data do not provide information on non-adopters, information about household
adoption of the Internet is readily available for this time period from other sources. 6 Household
use of the Internet increases monotonically with income (using slightly different aggregate
income categories). That is, adoption of broadband is a normal good. In 2008 the percentage of
adults who use the Internet is 54%, 78%, 88%, and 95% for income levels of, respectively, less
than $30,000, $30,000 to $50,000, $50,000 to $75,000, and greater than $75,000. In 2013 these
rates are, respectively, 72%, 86%, 93%, and 97%. At this aggregate level, and qualitatively
similar to what Goldfarb-Prince observed, we also observe “attention inferiority,” decline in the
amount of online attention with higher income. The contrasts with prior observation are
worthwhile to highlight. Prior observations were based on use of the dial-up Internet, while the
recent observation reflects adoption and use of broadband, a great deal more activity and time
devoted to online activity, and two distinct years of data. This finding reinforces the conclusion
that this effect is a stable relationship; hence, we find yet more evidence of “persistent attention
inferiority.”

         Other demographic determinants of time online are generally weak and inconsistent over
the two years. We see a positive relationship between more education and total time in 2013, but
the relationship is not monotonic in 2008. The finding in 2008 likely resulted from the poor
measurement of education in 2008. However, other inconsistencies are more difficult to explain.
Large households also spend more time online, but the relationship is only strong in 2008. In


5
  Note that the levels of hours are higher than reported in prior surveys, such as Brynjolfsson and Oh (2015), which
uses Forrester surveys of households’ self-reported number of hours online. In their 2008 data, the average per
household is 8.79 hours per week. In contrast to this prior work, here we report active weeks online. That imparts a
slight upward bias, but not enough to account for the difference. On average, households are active approximately
83% of the weeks. Moreover, we observe only one device, rather than all devices in a household, which should
impart a downward bias in our estimate. We suspect the main issue is measurement. Our data is measured with a
number of defaults and not self-reported.

2013 only the presence of children captures this effect. Total time also declines with the age of
head of household in 2008, but no such monotonicity appears in the coefficients for 2013.

        These findings support an interesting puzzle. Consider the stability of the relationship
between income and total time and the inconsistency in the relationship between age of head of
household and total time. They contrast with findings – from surveys done by the Pew Charitable
Trusts – about smartphone and tablet ownership, which show (unconditional) monotonicity in
adoption of these devices in income (increasing) and age of households (decreasing). 7 If tablets
and smartphone ownership caused users to substitute time online on devices for the time online
on PCs, then we would expect younger and higher income households to adjust their total time
more, and that is not observed in these data. (While we do see the expected monotonicity in the
education of households in 2013, the baseline in 2008 is poorly measured, and provides no useful
information.) Overall, therefore, we observe a puzzle – namely, a decline in time online on the
PC, as expected if outside devices caused it, but not the demographic associations that would be
indicative of such a cause. Hence, the adoption of tablets and smartphones may have had little to
do with even the small decline we observe in time online for the home device.

        A back-of-the-envelope calculation can illustrate the implications of the estimates for the
predominant role of income. Though ComScore does not seek to compile a representative sample
of US households, they do select from a wide range of income, regional, and demographic
backgrounds. As long as the error in measurement from within each income category is random,
then the conditional estimates for each category can be projected to the US household
population. So we ask, if the US household population behaves like our sample, what does this
imply for the scale of total time online for users from different income groups? Conditional on
this assumption, we make such a calculation.

        As noted above, other sources (Pew) provide estimates for the adoption of the Internet for
four mutually exclusive income categories. We combine the Pew survey with standard US
Census estimates of the fraction of households from each income group. Aggregating the total
estimates for time use (from our study) into these four income groups, 8 we calculate total time

 See, for example, http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/the-demographics-of-device-ownership/.

 The estimate for under $30,000 take a weighted average from three groups, under $15k, $15k-$25k, and half of
group making $25k to $35k. The estimate for $30k-$50k take a weight average from the $35k to $50k and half the

                                                      22
online from all US household PCs for all users as 24.4 million hours per week in 2008, and 25.5
million hours in 2013.9 That makes for a total size of 1.26 billion hours in 2008 and 1.32 billion
hours in 2013. Despite the decline in online time per household, the online total time from PCs
went up between 2008 and 2013 due to increasing adoption of the Internet, especially among
lower income groups.

        These estimates about income also imply what type of customer suppliers compete for.
The majority of total time online seen by online suppliers reflects higher incomes. In 2008 the
estimate of total time divides into four categories: 20.6% of the time comes from the lowest
income group (under $35,000), 18.2% come from the next group ($35,000-$50,000), and 19%
from the next ($50,000-$75,000), while 42.2% come from the highest income group (above
$75,000). The percentages for 2013 are, respectively, 25.0%, 17.9%, 17.8%, and 39.3%. In both
cases, we note a similar qualitative pattern, with more time coming from high income
participants. The fraction of time from the highest income category declined mildly between the
two years due to higher adoption rates by low income households. 10

        How is that time divided among different interests, and how does its breadth and depth
appear to suppliers? That depends on the distribution among the population of users. We turn to
this next.




5.2. Online Attention Allocation Patterns

        In this subsection, we present findings concerning our measures of fundamental browsing
behavior (how), in terms of breadth and depth. Figure 2 presents the unconditional joint density
of our measures of breadth and depth for 2008 and 2013, using all the observed machine weeks


$25-$35k. The estimate for over $75,000 takes a weighted average for the estimates for the two income levels above
$75,000 (i.e., for $75,000-$100,000, and for $100,000 and up). In all cases, the weights come from number of
households, and the estimates for total number of households comes from 2010 US Census.
9
  The number in the text is the sum across all groups (indexed by i) in the total time online. Total time online for
group i = (Total US households in income group i)*(adoption rate for group i)*(Point estimate for total time for
group i).
10
   The cross-sectional differences in adoption rates alter the composition of user attention for which a supplier of
content potentially competes in 2008 and 2013. Though higher income households each have lower total PC time
per household, more such households use the Internet in high percentages. In 2013 the composition changes due to
increasing adoption, again, especially, among lower income groups.

                                                        23
of data. Here, we see a very well-behaved joint distribution that strongly resembles a joint
normal. However, it is the comparison of the graphs over time that generates a particularly
striking finding – the distribution of these measures of online attention allocation is essentially
unchanged during this five year time period! The summary statistics in Section 4 showed that
the means of each measure were very similar and the features of the demographics in each
sample also resembled one another, but Figure 2 clearly indicates that the similarity goes well
beyond just the means – the entire distributions are nearly identical, a property we call
“persistent attention distribution.”

                                        [Figure 2 about here]

       Despite the striking visual similarity, we can reject the null hypothesis that the breadth
and depth are statistically indistinguishable, likely because our combined sample size is over
three million. Tables 6a and 6b present statistical tests of the means of our measures of breadth
and depth across years and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the equality of distribution functions
across years, respectively. While not statistically identical, these differences are economically
insignificant. The mean of household breadth is 3.5% greater in 2013 and household depth is
greater by 1%.




                                       [Table 6a, 6b about here]




       A possible concern about our finding of persistent attention distribution is that the
measures of online attention allocation may be strongly driven by a household’s total time online
on the home device. For example, we may worry that households spending the most time online
would have greater depth and perhaps more breadth. In short, we are concerned that a
household’s location within the distribution presented in Figure 2 arises merely from income’s
influence on total time. To address this concern, we break total time online on the home device
into quartiles, and recreate our joint distribution for each quartile. The results are in the
Appendix (Figure A.1). Here we see that, while not statistically identical, the joint distribution
of our measures of a household’s browsing behavior is strikingly consistent across the quartiles.


                                                  24
Further, we see that within quartile, this joint distribution is again highly stable between 2008
and 2013.

       Another concern with this finding centers on multitasking. Specifically, when browsing
online, households can simultaneously visit multiple sites, e.g., via multiple tabs on a browser or
even multiple open windows on the PC. We worry that changes in multitasking behavior
mask/negate changes in breadth and depth over time. We address this concern in two ways.
First, we note that time spent multitasking only changed negligibly between 2008 and 2013 in
our data. The percentage of time spent multitasking is 19.3% in 2008 and 19.7% in 2013.
Second, we break time multitasking on the home device into quartiles, and recreate our joint
distribution for each quartile. The results are also in the Appendix (Figure A.2). It is not
surprising that within a given year the level of multitasking correlates with distinct distributions
of breadth and (especially) depth. For this exercise we are more interested in the comparison
across years. Here we see again that, while not statistically identical, the joint distribution of our
measures of a household’s browsing behavior is strikingly consistent across the quartiles.
Further, we see that within a quartile, this joint distribution is again highly stable between 2008
and 2013.

       As shown in our summary statistics in Section 4, there are some differences in the
demographic profiles between our sample in 2008 and 2013. Another concern could be that
online attention allocation behavior, conditional on demographics, did change over this time
period, but, by some lucky coincidence, the changes in behavior offset the demographic changes
in the samples from the two years. To address this possibility, we assess if and how our
measures of online attention relate to our demographics, namely: income, age, education,
household size, and presence of children. This analysis not only addresses a potential concern
with our vertical finding, but also directly shows if and how our measures of breadth and depth
vary horizontally, i.e., with respect to demographics.

       Table 7 presents a set of seemingly-unrelated-regressions (SURs) for our measures of
breadth and depth. We do not observe monotonic estimates with respect to income. Indeed, both
depth and breadth are virtually independent of income levels after controlling for total time
online. The demographics that meaningfully correlate with breadth are education (in 2013), age
of head of household, and household size. In particular, more educated households, larger

                                                 25
households, and younger households visit a larger variety of sites in both 2008 and 2013. In
contrast, depth is largely independent of demographics.

                                       [Table 7 about here]

       These estimates do not help much in explaining why the two figures from 2008 and 2013
look so similar. Broadly speaking, demographics explain less than 15% (for depth) and less than
3% (for breadth) of the variation in our household classifications. Households that are larger and
have more education and income are less likely to be classified as dwellers (i.e., someone who
stays at a web site for a long period), but the economic significance of these effects is modest.
Households with older heads of household and more education are less likely to be classified as
focused, but the economic significance of these effects is also modest, therefore insufficient to
shape the ultimate outcome by much.

       Demographics have a modest role in causing changes in breadth and depth, and even the
total amount of time online. While income’s impact is monotone and consistent for time online,
demographics as a whole explain a very limited amount of variation in all three of these
dependent variables. As far as income’s relationship to breadth and depth is concerned, a
household’s income mildly shapes its total time online and mostly through this channel, its
breadth and depth. Since breadth and depth do not appear to have the same measured
determinants as total time online, we note an interesting implication that builds on our earlier
observations about adoption rates across income groups. Because households’ depth of use is
orthogonal to income and the changing rates of adoption across income had no consequence for
depth, suppliers have observed little change in the depth of their users over our sample period.




5.3. Online Attention Category Shares

       As noted above, the period spanning 2008 to 2013 saw large changes in the supply of
web sites, particularly with regard to online video. Consequently, we may see notable changes in
where households allocate their time, despite remaining stable in how they allocate their time.

       We classified the top 1000 sites from both 2008 and 2013 by categories established by
Webby and measured the share of attention garnered by each category for both years. We

                                                 26
present these shares in Figure 3. Here we see that, in 2008, Chat is by far the largest category,
attracting over 25% of households’ attention; however, this category saw a dramatic shift by
2013, dropping to less than 2% in 2013. Other sites imitated similar functionality, especially in
social media. Attention allocated to News sites also decreased, from roughly 10% down to 5%,
again, because Social Media tended to offer News. We observe that Social Media and Video
have the largest increases of attention, to 26% and 16%, respectively. Interestingly, three-
quarters of the drop in share for Chat and News is reflected in the increased shares of Social
Media and Video. Some of this is not surprising, since popular social media sites, such as
Facebook, attempted to offer functionality that replicated what chat and news services used to
provide as stand-alone services.

                                        [Figure 3 about here]

       Table 8 contains the top 20 sites of 2008 and 2013. A quick glance at these rankings and
the change between 2008 and 2013 further confirms what we see in Figure 3. Particularly
noteworthy is the mass exodus of Chat users and the rise in Video use.

                                         [Table 8 about here]

       While Figure 3 and Table 8 suggest a large vertical change in where households went
online, at least on the home device, a possible concern is that little changed at the very top sites,
which garner a large share of time online. In particular, it could be that category shares changed,
but top sites did not, and it is top sites that largely drive our measures of time allocation.
Revisiting Figure 3, it appears this is not the case. In that figure, the dark bars represent the
share of top 5 sites from 2008 within each category. In 2008, the top 5 sites accounted for 42.5%
of all browsing, but in 2013 these same sites account for only 20%. Here, we see significant
turnover, as only web services show any persistence in this share between the two years. Hence,
it appears high usage and the persistence of the very top sites do not drive our findings.

       Our analysis of where households go online more closely follows that of total time
online, in that demographics do appear to be predictive in both years. Table 9 contains
multinomial logit results that show higher income consistently predicts some preference for
online services in both years. Higher income households prefer services that examine credit
history, offer educational services, support (online and web-based) games, provide news, support

                                                  27
online banking, offer online shopping, provide online sports services, and supply online video
services. Nonetheless, demand for several online services does not appear to be sensitive to
income, including chat, credit history, social media, and pornography.

                                       [Table 9 about here]

       This is further evidence that online user behavior contains a mix of fixed determinants,
while also varying in the cross section. The latter variance follows measureable differences in
demographic determinants. We also observe changes in website choice over time, again
following measureable differences in demographics. In the face of such predictable variance in
behavior, the stability of breadth and depth seems all the more surprising.




5.4. Evaluating the Predictions of the Standard Model: Is a Behavioral Component
Missing?

       Between 2008 and 2013 we see a remarkable lack of change in both the breadth and
depth of households’ browsing habits. These results are difficult to rationalize in the context of
the standard model with negligible setup costs. Such a model predicts an increase in the breadth
of household browsing when supply increases, and makes no prediction about the depth of
household browsing. The standard model with setup costs more easily rationalizes the results: the
supply of new sites increases breadth on the home device, while alternative devices decreases
breadth on the home device, resulting in an ambiguous net effect. With respect to the depth of
household browsing, the standard model without setup costs is agnostic about depth, while the
standard model with positive setup costs predicts no change in the depth of household browsing.

       While the standard model with setup costs can rationalize the lack of change in the depth
of household browsing between 2008 and 2013, that model also predicts that all sessions be the
same length. Consequently, all sessions either fall above or below a given threshold. Our data do
not exhibit anything close to constant session length; rather, we see a wide mix of sessions of
different lengths, where the proportion has not changed across years.

       An asymmetric utility function that captures how a household values each site differently
can explain the mix of sessions of different lengths that we observe. However, we believe that

                                                 28
our empirical findings point toward a static theory of household browsing behavior. In part, this
is because the demand side did not react to a massive change in the environment of supply. For
example, the vast change in the menu of supply from 2008 to 2013 did not change the breadth or
depth of household browsing. The vast change in supply altered only where households allocated
their online time.

        To summarize, there is a discrete nature to households’ site choices and a limit to the
number of sites that can be visited. The continuous utility function of the standard model without
setup costs ignores these features and is at odds with our empirical results. We do not observe
households splitting time into more numerous and shorter site visits, as predicted by the standard
model without setup costs. The standard model augmented with positive setup costs performs
better: it predicts that even with increasing supply, there will be a finite number of sites visited.

       The standard model augmented with setup costs does fall short, however, due to the lack
of a clear prediction: it offers no guidance as to whether household breadth of browsing will
increase or decrease. The unchanging breadth and depth of household browsing patterns invites
an alternative theory of household browsing behavior, one that can explain this constancy.

       What would such a theory contain? Our results do not settle the question. Theory might
be behavioral or hierarchical, where a household receives exogenous “slots” of time that are
allocated to brief leisure activities such as watching television, reading, or browsing online. If,
for example, online behavior is largely driven by a constant and exogenous nature of offline
activities, then that would explain the remarkable stability of household browsing behavior over
time, despite vast changes in the amount and type of supply over the same period.

       Field work conducted by anthropologists and researchers on user-machine design has
shown behavior consistent with exogenous offline activities determining the time spent in online
activities. Such researchers have documented the periodic – or “bursty” – use of many online
sources (Lindley, Meek, Sellen, Harper, 2012, Kawsaw and Brush, 2013). This work also
documents the “plasticity” of online attention, as an activity that arises in the midst of other
household activities as a “filler” activity (Rattenbury, Nafus and Anderson, 2008, Adar, Teevan,
Dumais, 2009). This type of field work provides an explanation for the consistency of breadth
and depth patterns within a household in spite of large changes in the available options. It


                                                  29
explains the consistency as a result of unchanging household habits, which shape availability of
time, and shape the availability of slots of time. These theories would hypothesize that the slots
do not change much, because they cannot change much, even as the supply of online web sites
does change.




6. Implications for Online Competition

       In this paper, we complete the first characterization of the aggregate supply of online
attention. We believe our findings speak to a number of important questions across several fields
of research. For example, how do these findings change the approach for valuing online
consumer surplus in a labor-leisure framework? How does this approach reconcile household
aggregation of time and activity into demand for Internet access with competition between online
activities? How does heterogeneity in the breadth and depth of activities translate into demand
for more speed? In this section, we summarize our findings in Section 5 and discuss their main
implications.

       We summarize our findings in Table 10, and state the results as follows. First, total time
online at the primary home device has only modestly declined, and the decline is generally
consistent across income groups. This decline is not sufficient to change the predominant role
played by higher income users, which arises because adoption rates for the Internet as of 2013
were still notably higher for this group, compared to lower income groups. Second, the way in
which households allocate their online attention, as measured by the concentration of sites visited
(breadth) and time spent in “long” sessions (depth), has remained remarkably stable. In addition,
neither of these measures is well-predicted by total time online or major demographics. Lastly,
the period between 2008 and 2013 saw major changes in online category shares, with social
media and video experiencing significant increases while chat and news experienced significant
declines. These choices of application are predicted by exogenous factors, such as income.

                                       [Table 10 about here]

       Our findings suggest that new points of contact – in the form of additional computers,
tablets and smartphones – are substituting time from the primary home device, but only


                                                30
modestly. Consequently, as total time across all devices strongly increased during this time (e.g.,
Allen 2015), it appears this increase manifested as time online at additional devices, largely in
addition to the relatively stable use of the home device. Hence, any new value stemming from
additional time online appears to be largely coming from time on new, alternative devices.

       This adds up to a surprising characterization of the supply of attention by households and
the demand for online activities. The amount of time spent online varies with income and largely
not the menu of supply of online websites.

       We find the stability of online attention patterns over this time period to be especially
striking, given the explosion of online video content and the growth of secondary devices during
this time. In this context, we highlight three key takeaways. First, this finding shows that any
changes in value households received from these developments did not arise from a change in
the way households allocated their online attention. Therefore, even if many households shifted
their attention to more sites with video offerings, which tend to demand more time, it appears
these shifts are at the expense of attention at other sites, at which the household was already
spending significant time. Second, this result suggests that household online attention via
secondary devices has not altered the basic pattern of online attention for the primary home
device. This implies that households are not systematically distributing their attention across
devices in a way that, e.g., shifts “touristy” or focused sessions to secondary devices. Lastly, this
result implies that, despite a large influx of new sites and content offerings, households are not
increasing the spread of their attention in response, at least at the device level, and not altering
the time focused on online consumption.

        Taken together, our results add up to a striking model of competition for attention. As
expected, there were large changes in the supply of web sites for households to visit, and many
households responded to that expanded choice. Presumably existing websites also improved, as
they fought to keep the attention of current users. However, the competition for users was
constrained by a virtually unmovable feature of demand – the breadth of sites households are
willing to visit, and the length of slots households were willing to sustain at a given site.

       What model of demand is consistent with these properties? We speculate that hierarchical
models of sequences of decision making – where households first choose devices for access and


                                                  31
then choose how to allocate it, facing setup costs and other non-price frictions – will be a fruitful
avenue for further developments. While there certainly will be debate about the proper, specific
modeling features, our empirics are the first to identify these fundamental patterns of online
attention, which future models should be capable of producing.

        We also speculate that these findings will place an important constraint on models of
household substitution between competing online activities. Competition for attention imposes a
costly bottleneck on supplier behavior, and suppliers are competing for a finite supply of user
time. Household substitution determines this competitive situation. In other words, the size of the
market for online competition should be thought of as segmented along length of time, and so
too should entry and related entrepreneurial behavior. This segmentation arises in addition to
more familiar notions of differentiated competition, such as the function and application of the
online site.

        We also believe research should test between models that impose static specifications on
labor/leisure substitution and models consistent with the microdata of household decision
making. Lastly, these findings place important constraints on models of online/offline
substitution, and raise several open questions. What is the appropriate model of heterogeneity in
consumer surplus for demand for online access, when online activity involves heterogeneity in
frictions? What type of model of labor/leisure online/offline substitution is consistent with
persistent attention distribution and persistent attention inferiority? How much does of the desire
to reduce frictions – e.g., by improving the operation of search tools – motivate household
demand for more broadband speed, in addition to the performance improvements in specific
applications, such as gaming? We leave these questions for future work.




7. Conclusions

        This study uses extensive microdata on user online activity to characterize the links
between user allocation of attention and online competition in the absence of prices. We
characterize household heterogeneity in allocation of attention at any point in time, how
households substitute between sources of supply over time, and develop implications for
aggregate demand changes in the face of an increasing supply of options.

                                                 32
       Our findings suggest that aggregate demand mixes fixed properties with flexible choices.
First, income plays an important role in determining the allocation of time to the Internet. We
find further evidence for persistent attention inferiority, namely, that higher income households
spend less total time online per week. Relatedly, we also find that the level of time on the home
device only mildly responds to the menu of available web sites and other devices – it slightly
declines between 2008 and 2013, despite large increases in online activity via smartphones and
tablets over this time. Most surprising, breadth and depth of online use have remained
remarkably stable over the five years, namely, persistent attention distribution.

       These findings can serve as an important guide for future modeling of demand for online
attention as competition for that attention. We observe little user substitution of time or
concatenation of time. That pattern is consistent with unchanging household habits, which shape
availability of time and shape the availability of slots of time.

       Our results also raise questions about the competition for user attention. If slots of time
do not change much, then firms have strong incentives to respond to this feature of the market
with products and services tailored to this feature of demand. But that raises an open question
about the costs of delivering services tailored to that feature. Many observers have noticed that
the costs of web site development have fallen dramatically, and technical improvement have
enabled new services based on video delivery over the Internet. However, changes in supply
conditions will not, nor ever has, created its own demand, and we would expect markets to
equilibrate accordingly. Competition for attention imposes a costly bottleneck on supplier
behavior, and, to put it simply, suppliers are competing for a finite supply of user time, but
generally lack the ability to use price discounts as an instrument for attracting user attention.
Models of online competition should accommodate these features and investigate how they
shape online supplier behavior.

       Finally, given our discovery of remarkable stability in how households allocate their
scarce attention, we hypothesize that such stability in behavior may also exist as changes occur
in other markets for attention, such as in television and radio. For example, increases in the
supply of television content and devices through which to consume that content will likely cause
households to switch to that new content (a change in “where?”), may cause a modest decline in
the amount of attention allocated to the original device used for consumption (a change in “how

                                                  33
much?”), but may not change how households fundamentally choose to disperse attention across
content and how households choose their intensity of attention to content.
