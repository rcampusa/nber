                         U.S. INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS:
                    PERSPECTIVES FROM RATIONAL MAXIMIZING MOOELS


                                       ABSTRACT




     This paper examines several aspects of the debate about the causes of

the U.S. current account deficit in the 1980's.      It surveys several popular

explanations   before developing two theoreticsl models of international

capital flows.     The first model is Ricardian,   and it extends the analysis of

Stockman and Svensson (1987):      The second model is an overlapping

generations    framework.   The major difference in predictions of these two

models involves the effects of government budget deficits on the exchange

rate and the current account.      An update of the empirical investigation of

Evans (1986) suggests that his VAR methodology      is completelyuninformative

with additional data.       Some empirical results on the importance of risk

aversion in modeling international capital market equilibrium are also

presented.

for discussion of the policy issues that are inherent in the analysis.              Is


the current account deficit a major policy problem that must receive high

political   priority?       Has the U.S. become unable to compete abroad, or is the

current account merely reflectingnormal fluctuations           associated with

                                                           countries?            Are we
cyclical fluctuations and differential growth rates across

impoverishing    future generations by acquiring a massive amount of net foreign

liabLtties?      Should we adopt protectionist policies that will cut the inflow

of imports?     Must we have either further depreciation of the dollar or
                                                                  if we are
protection of our industries, as Rudiger Dornbusch (1987) argues,

to achieve external balance without inducing a recession?

   These are important        and difficult questions, and I will return to them

briefly in the conclusion of the paper.            My primary purpose, though, is to

ask how we should attempt to model these ideas, and to examine two approaches

that place other research in perspective.

   I first examine the data in a graphical way to summarize           the issues.    I

next discuss some conventional wisdom that is often cited in policy

discussions     and the popular press as explanations       of U.S. capital flows.

This analysis focuses on differential growth rates of real income and demand

in the U.S. and abroad, on the real value of che dollar in foreign exchange

markets,    and on the federal budget deficit of the Reagan administration,

which is seen as one of the driving forces in the appreciation of the dollar.

This, in turn, is thought to be a major cause of the deterioration            in the

balance of trade.       I    then discuss two types of dynamic economic theoretical

models that could provide explanations           of the phenomena.

    The first theoretical model is a version of the Lucas (1982) model that

has become a workhorse of international financial asset pricing.             I extend

the analysis of Stockman and Svenaaon            (1987) who first explored capital flows
Explanations of Larse Econometric Models

   The deterioration of the current account has been the focus of a number of

recent studies employing large econometric models, and these studies support

the hypothesis that less has changed than one might have thought from a

casual glance at Figure   1.   The results of several forecasting experiments

are reported in Bryant, Holtham and Hooper (1988).     Bryant and Holtham (1988)

report the results of forecasting experiments from eight large models, and

Helkie and Hooper (1988) report the results of a partial equilibrium analysis

that is essentially based on the U.S current account sector of the Federal

Reserve Board Multicountry Model.

   Given the Lucas (1976) critique of the prectice of building econometric

models without explicit consideration of the maximizing problems of economic

agents, it seems unlikely to me that the large econometric      models are

capturing the true economic structure in the economy.       Nevertheless,    the

models do incorporate income and substitution effects of current and lagged

variables,   and it is interesting to ask how well the models predicted the

current account deficit of the 1980's given their historical parameter values

estimated until 1980 and the out-of-sample values of real GNP in the U.S. and

abroad, the respective rates of capacity utilization,       and the course of real

exchange rates.    This is the experiment reported in Bryant and Holtham (1988)

who conclude (p.59), "past macroeconomic    relationships    can successfully

predict the deterioration of the U.S. external imbalance... (since) the

predictions were often within a few billion dollars of the actual deficit in

1986, more than five years after the start of the dynamic simulations."

   One major reason why large econometric models are not considered

structural is that the distributed lags in their decision rules often can be

shown to be a confounding of the equilibrium dynamic distributed lag
                                           6

responses   of agents due to various costs of adjustment with the distributed

lags necessary to forecast relevant state variables.         If the large

econometric    models continue to track the current account in dynamic

simulations,    one reason may be that the forecasting problem has not changed.

In this sense the structure of the economy is not different.

   Similarly    successful out-of-sample   forecasting   results are reported by

Helkie and Hooper (1988).     Their model breaks the current account into a

nineteen equation system with the major component, merchandise trade, being

comprised of an eight equation system.         Four equations are for the volumes of

imports and exports     of agricultural and nonagriculturalcommodities.      A   fifth

models U.S. oil consumption, and three equations         are for the relative prices

of exports of agricultural and nonagriculturalcommodities and of nonoil

imports.    The specificatioti has been subject to considerable search, as

evidenced by the differences across the lag lengths of relative price

variables in the various equations.        The authors also admit that some of the

variables are sd hot adjustments included becsuse of deficiencies in the

data.   Nevertheless,   Helkie and Hooper (1988) find that the post-sample

(1985-86) performance of their model has smaller root mesn squsred prediction

errors than the average in-sample     errors.

   Given that large econometric models with ex post values of real incomes

and relative price variables can track the current account, is it fair to

conclude that the structure of the world has not changed?          It seems that the

answer is yes, and the interesting issue becomes what sre the sources of the

fluctuations in these variables.

   The 1987 Economic Reoort of the President states (p. 9?), "Underlying

these developments are several macroeconomic imbalances,         including the
deterioration of the U.S. saving-investment       balance that has resulted from

where the long-run levels are not constant.        The long-run level of net

foreign assets depends upon the discounted present value of target foreign

assets,   and the long-run level of the real exchange rate depends both upon

the long-run level of net foreign assets and upon the discounted present

value of the exogenous excess demand shifts that are both domestic and

foreign in origin as in


              — (1   -                                                         (10)

   Although the relationship between the current account and the real

exchange rate is simple, if one knows            there need not be a well defined
                                            z,
relationship between the level of the real exthange rate that clears the

balance of payments at a particular point in time and the magnitude of the

current account when that real exchange rate is at that same level at some

other point in time.

   The inadequacy of the model of this section is highlighted by its

inability to address interesting policy issues.        Although it is a rational

expectations model, it does not have firm microeconomic foundations for its

expenditure   and excess demand functions.       We also need information on

expected future values of exogenous variables that shift excess demand

functions   toward and away from U.S. goods.

   Adequate economic models of the current account and capital flows should

be based on maximizing behavior,        should be explicitly stochastic so that they
                                             14

may be addressed to data, and ahould account for growth of real income and

for the role of the government sector in the economy.              Given the importance

of expectations of the future in equation           (11),   current modeling strategies

dictate      that the model should also have rational expectations.                I therefore

turn to the discussion of such models.

                                      A Ricardian Model

   The purpose of this section is to lay out an explicitly maximizing

rational expectations model that has been used to address issues of exchange

rate determination,       international   financial     asset pricing,   and capital flows.

The section builds heavily on Stockman and Svensson (1987).                   My basic purpose

here is to add government sectors to their frsmework.5

Countries      and Production Possibilities

   There are two countries,' denoted country one and country two, that each

produce a distinct good denoted lt and             "2   respectively.     The goods are

produced with the following production functions:


               Y. —
                it     1 it c.it )
                      Y.(K. ,             i — 1,   2,


where          is the capital stock employed in country i, i —           1,   2,   at time   t,
        K.t
and          LS a stochastic productivity shock.         The capital stocks are
       Lit

predetermined at time       t.    The productivity shocks are in the time t

information set and are assumed to be independently and identically

distributed.

      The arrangement of markets for goods and assets follows the original

timing of the Svensson (1985) model with the goods market open in the

beginning of a period after the realization of the state.                Agents are

constrained to purchase goods with monies csrried into the period from the

time t-l asset market.          After the closing of the goods market, the asset
                                         17

values of assets and prices and the equilibrium decisions of agents are not

altered by changes in the timing of debt and taxes.         Hence, budget deficits

cannot affect capital flows in this model.

Preferences   and Budget Constraints

   The preferences of agents in each country are assumed to be homothetic and

identical.    Agents trade in a number of different assets including the monies

and government bonds of the two countries,         the titles to the outputs of the

firms in the two countries,   and tax-related assets that facilitate the

discussion of an equilibrium.

   The objective function of the representative         consumer of either country is

to maximize expected lifetime utility as in



         {                 C)}         0 < $   <   1,                                (15)



by choice of consumption of the good of country one,              and consumption of
                                                            C1t
the good of country two,          In equation (15),       is the expectation
                         Cpu.                       E0(•)

operator conditional on initial information in period zero, and $         is   the

subjective discount factor.     The period utility function, U(•,•),      is

sufficiently concave that the Inada conditions are satisfied and an internal

equilibrium is guaranteed.    Agents are assumed to receive either no utility

from government purchases of goods or utility that is separable from the

utility of other goods.

   I follow Stockman and Svensson (1987) and assume that the purchase of an

equity share carries with it the commitment to purchase a pro rats share of

the investment of the representative     firm in capital next period.      If         is

the ownership of share i, i — 1, 2, the commitment is to purchase
                                                                          Z.K.t÷1
units of output of good i for the firm at the time t goods market.

   Information relevant to the decisions for the period is obtained at the
                                                        18

beginning of the period.               At that tine the representativeconsumer faces two

cash-in-advanceconstraints that dictate the quantities of each good that can

be consumed.       In the period t-l asset market the representative agents

                 of currency      i.    The cash-in-advanceconstraints are
acquire    M?
                        +
                                                M,                                                              (16)

     The agent's budget constraint during the asset market requires that the

value of the purchases of assets be less than or equal to wealth at that

time.      Sources of wealth are the values of the existing shares in the firms,

any unspent monies from the goods markets, any state-contingentpayoffs on

government bonds, and the payoffs on the tax-related assets.

     Let          denote the amount of money i that the consumer of country 1
           8(x)
purchased at the time c-i asset market for delivery at the time t asset
market conditional on the state being
                                                        x.       Let                and   Z       be the holdings of

the consumer of country i of the tax-related                             assets of country one and

country two respectively.               The uses of wealth include tax liabilities and

purchases of new assets.

     The budget constraint in period t of the agent of country one is therefore

that state being realized.    These equations must hold for all possible future

states.

Investment Decisions of Firms

   The values of the fins depend on the capital stocks and the optimal

investment decisions, K.t+. for i —        1,    2 and j — 1,   2,..,   that are

functions    of the state at time t+j-1.        The firms are assumed to pay out all

of their revenue as dividends; hence Dlt —                 and D2t —

Maximization of    the values of the firms requires them to have contingency

that must be sacrificed if an additional unit of investment             is made in the

capital stock to the discounted expected marginal utility gains from having

an additional unit of the oapital stock.

Definition of an Equilibrium

   Given the setup of the model at this point, it is now possible to define

an equilibrium.     The only equilibrium I consider is the perfectly pooled

stationary equilibrium of Lucas (1982) who noted that if agents have the same

preferences    and if preferences are homothetic, the ratios of consumptions of

the goods will be identical across countries.           The perfectly pooled

equilibrium arises when agents have identical wealth as well, and therefore

their consumption is the same.     If the agents in each country are endowed

initially with the ownership of the production process of their country and

are liable for the taxes of their country, the perfectly pooled equilibrium

requires that at initial prices, the wealths of the two countries happen to

be the same.     Different levels of wealth will result in different equilibrium

consumption levels, but with the homothetic preferences, asset prices will be

identical.
                                                         22

   In the pooled equilibrium agents share equally the available outputs of

the two goods net of government consumption of the two countries                        and of the

endogenous investment decisions of the firms, and they hold half of the

outstanding stocks of the fins and the monies with the outstanding number of

shares in the fins normalized to be one.                      The tax-related assets are in zero

net supply in the world.                  Since each citizen is liable for the taxes of his

country,    the agent of country one holds an asset that is the
                                                                liability of the

agent of country two, and the asset provides contingent                     deliveries of dollars

equal to half of the country one contingent tax liability.                      The agent of

country two also holds a similar asset that is the liability of the agent of

country one.

Net Foreign Assets and Capital Flows

   The total dollar value Of world assets in
                                             positive aupply consists of the
dollar value of the two production processes,                   the dollar value of the money

stocks, and the dollar value of outstanding                   government   bonds.   In the pooled

equilibrium,       the representative agent of each
                                                    country owns half of each of
these assets.           In addition, the agent of country one owns the tax-related

asset that is the liability of the agent of country two;
                                                         similarly, the agent
of country two owns the tax-related asset that is the
                                                      liability of the agent
of country one.

   Net foreign assets of country one in the asset market at time t are

denoted                 They sre defined to be the value of country two assets owned

Although it appears from the definition of Alt+l in equation      (20)    that the

current account ought to depend on government bonds and taxes, one major

point about the equilibrium of this model is that the values of net foteign

assets do not depend directly on the financing of the government sector.

   To see why, consider the dollar value of the tax-related asset whose

payoff is perfectly correlated with the taxes of country one.       The


equilibrium price of the asset is found from discounting the value of its

payoffs,   which is

where the left-hand side of equation (23) is what appears in the definition

of Alt+l in equation (20) and the right-hand side of equation (23) is the

present value of nominal government spending beginning in period t+1 in

excess of what is financed by money creation.       The time pattern of taxation

and bond financing of country one does not enter the value of net foreign

assets and cannot be a determinant of capital flows.      A   similar argument

would apply to the government financing policies of country two.          The next

section exsmines a model in which the financing of government debt does
                                                 24

affect the equilibrium of the world economy.

   The model of this section is a logical extension of the real business

cycle models that are the focus of much macroeconomic research.6 Capital

flows in this economy are simply the response to equilibrium risk sharing.

Things that increase the value of country one's technology will lead to a

measured capital outflow because they increase the wealth of the foreigner.

Stockman and Svensson (1987) demonstrate how additional covariances of

capital    flows and other endogenous          variables    can be calculated from the

model.     I   do not undertake any of these exercises because of the simplicity

of the driving processes.              Solving the model with more realistic driving

processes      appears to require numerical methods.

                      A Two-Country Overlapping Generations Model

   This section develops a'model of maximizing rational agents in a

stochastic environment.            Because agents have finite lives and do not form

intergenerational          families,    the time pattern of government        debt does matter

in a fundamental way in this equilibrium.

Preferences      and Technologies

   Consider a two country model of a one good economy.                     The world is

populated with overlapping generations of agents who live for two periods,

working only in the first.             Labor and capital are used to produce a good that

may be consumed or invested to become capital that is employed the following

period.     Each country's government buys some of the consumption good, taxes

the young and issues government bonds.

   The preferences of agents born at time t are identical                   across countries

and are given by

                            ÷                              1 —   1,   2.

is consumption of the old agent of country i at time t+l.                                   The population of

the generation born at time t in country                         i   is denoted             1 — 1, 2.

Population growth is assumed to be an exogenous stochastic process.

   Assume that an agent supplies a unit of labor inelastically when young and

consumes his savings when old.                  The first period budget constraint is

where W.      is the real wage rate in country i, r.  is the head tax of
         it                                        it
government i paid only by the young, and Sit is the savings of the young.

   I assume that there is a world rental market for capital.                                    If the atate of

the world is known before capital has to be allocated,                                the rate of return to

capital,      denoted             will be identical across countries.                      Since there are
                             rt
stochastic elements in the production process,    will be stochastic when
                                               rt
viewed from periods before the allocation of capital.

   I also assume a world bond market for government                                debt.    The government

bonds of countries will only be held if they offer a common competitive rate

of return,
           tbt that will be determined in equilibrium at time t-l when the
bonds are issued.                I assume that the government bonds are default free and

riskless in terms of consumption goods.

   Let             be the share of savings in either country at time t that is

allocated to risky capital.                  Since preferences           are the same, the portfolio

shares of the two agents are the same.                          The budget constraints of the old are


     C.÷1          —   [(1   ÷

   The technology is assumed to be constant returns to scale with stochastic

productivity.          The parameters of the production function are the same across

countries,     but the productivity shocks are not common.                             I follow King,

Plosser, and Rebelo (1988) and specify the technology as
                                              26

representing an overall productivity shock, K.t is the amount of capital

allocated to the ith country, and full employment is assumed.

   Competition for capital across the countries produces a rate of return to

capital that is its marginal product of capital.                The two wage rates will be

different,    though, since labor is not mobile across countries                and technology

is not identical at a point in time.          The wage rates will be the marginal


products of labor.

Covernznent Budget Constraints

    Covernment purchases of goods are financed through taxation of the

working young and issuance of government bonds.                Let        be the purchases of
                                                                     Gt
goods and    B     be the bonds issued by government i at time t.               Then, the

government budget constraint in period t is

             C.it + rbt 8.it — N.it r.it + B.it+l — B.              i — 1, 2.               (28)
                                                     it

   If government expenditures are an exogenous stochastic process, taxation

must be endogenous to keep government debt bounded.                   One process that does

this and that is consistent with the stylized facts that government debt

tends to decline over time after large expenditures is


                         —
                             T. +                  i       1, 2.                            (29)


In equation (29) T.t is an exogenous part of the aggregate tax system, but

     makes aggregate taxes endogenous. Since there is population growth and
pB
 technological     change, government bonds can grow over time, but the value of p

can be chosen to be sufficiently large that appropriately deflated debt

declines over time if the required tate of return on debt and the deflated
                                                27

levels of exogenous      spending and taxes are at their unconditional expected

values with debt above its unconditional             mean.

Eouilibrium Conditions

   Three markets must clear each period.                 In asset markets, the capital

created in the previous period must be fully employed and the new stocks of

government debt must be demanded by the savings of the young.                     Equilibrium in

the goods market requires that the supply of goods from production in the two

countries   and from previous capital stocks be purchased for conaumption of

the young and the old, for the government                sectors and for investmenta in

capital goods.       When any two of these markets clear, the third is in

equilibrium when agents satisfy their budget constraints.

   The balance of payments also tan be derived from these conditions.                        The

trade account surplus of câuntry one,                      is the excess of production in

The Allocation of Caoital

     Let the aggregate amount of capital in period t be denoted Mt.                               The four

production efficiency conditions relating the marginal products of the

factors of production to the wage rates and the common rental rate on capital

can be combined with the capital market equilibrium condition to determine

the allocation of capital across countries and the returns to the factors of

production as functions of the Mt and the productivity shocks.                              The stock of

capital employed in country one is


                      —            +                                                                     (34)

is   detemined by °lt —
     The technology and population shocks affect the allocation of a given

amount of capital by shifting capital to the country that is relatively more

productive,       either because there are more workers for a given unit of capital

or because labor is more productive.

Consumption.          Savings and Portfolio          Decisions

     Given the wage rates in the two countries,                     consumption,       savings,    and

portfolio allocations are found as the first order conditions of the agents'

maximization problems.             With logarithmic preferences consumption is a

   Discussion of the equilibrium dynamics of the capital stocks requires

linearizations,         the linearized version of equation (36) is simply
                                                                                            rb+l
              The required return on the government bond must adjust to be equal

to the expected return on the capital stock in period t+l, which will depend

on the amount of investment and on the expected productivity of capital.

Equilibrium Dynamics

   The evolution of the stocks of capital and bonds provides the dynamics of

the model.    The capital stock depends on the share of savings in the risky

asset snd on the total amount of savings.                         The share of savings in bonds is

dictated by the requirement that the government bonds be willingly held as

part of saving, with the result that

From equations (28) and (29) the total stock of government debt depends upon

Linearization and Stochastic Trends

   When populations grow and technological change is nonstationsry,                                there is

no unconditional mean value or stochastic steady state to the system of

equations    (38) and (39).    If common trends are removed, as in King, Plosser

and Rebelo (1987), by deflating the variables by an appropriate permsnent

component,    s stochastic steady state in the deflated variables                             exists.

   Population is assumed to be driven by a common stochastic trend, Nt                                    such

dominate the other country eventually, the permanent component in labor

augmenting technological       change,               also must be the same.                 The variables

    —
         (r./r)    i — 1, 2, are therefore                stationary.          If there is to be a

stochastic steady state, the exogenous government spending and taxation

policies must also share the permanent components of population growth and

technological    change such that                —

productivity of either type in either country or of higher than average

population in either country increase the expected rate of return to capital

   The state of the ayatem is defined to be the values of the capital stock

the two types of productivity shocks and the population growth rates of the

government bond stock does not depend on the unanticipated productivity

shocks or population growth rates because the tax system is not dependent on

current income.

premised on cs1 >             0.     If country one is in surplus in the steady state, it

experiences         a transitory current account surplus whenever there is a

transitorily high growth rate of either stochastic trend.                                      Also,   things that

increase the share of country one savings in world savings increase                                        the

current account surplus of country one.                              Finally, increases          in the resort of

country two's government                  t    financing deficits with bonds lead to current

account surpluses             for country one, and symmerricslly,                        increases     in the resort

of country one's government to financing deficits with government bonds lead

to current account deficits of country one.

      Expressing the current account as a true reduced form requires an

expression for the percentage deviation from the steady state of the share of

savings of country one in world saving.                              Since the expression is long, the

coefficients         are presented in Table                   3.    Transitory     increases      in working age

population or the productivity of country one improve the current account

while the converse is true of changes in these variables for country two.

Tax increases in country one cause a decrease in the savings rate of the

private sector, but they decrease                         the resort of the government sector to bond

finance which improves the current account.

that are explicitly stochastic.      As such,    they are potentially directly

testable.     Unfortunately,   they are not sufficiently well formulated that I

think they deserve to be examined empirically.         Rather than formally test and

reject the models, I examine some of their implications empirically in this

section.    I view the theory and empirical      sections of. this paper as


complementary avenues of investigation that are leading toward a well

designed theory that will eventually not be rejected by the data.

An Uodate of Evans (1986)

   One of the most striking differences        across the two models is the

implication    that government budget deficits do not affect real allocations

and relative prices such as the real exchange rate in the Ricardian model

whereas they do affect the consumption and savings decisions in the

overlapping generations model.       Budget deficits also figure prominently in
the explanation of the movement in real exchange rates in the popular press,

in neo-Keynesian frameworks, and in the writings of Feldstein (1986).         Budget

deficits are thought to appreciate the dollar in nominal and real terms

leading to an overvalued currency and a current account deficit.

   One way to investigate      the influence of budget deficits on the economy is

to adopt the reduced form methodology of Plosser (1982).         The idea is to

assume that one knows the return generating process for an asset or an

exchange rate from a rational expectations model.         This supplies an

observable unexpected component to the return or the change in the exchange

rate.   The unexpected change in the exchange rate is then regressed on

innovations    in government policy variables and other exogenous variables that

are presumed to be exogenous      and that are generated from a vector

autoregression (VAR).      One must assume that the VAR is sufficiently well

specified that the true structure of the economy is captured by the
                                          36

regressions.     If it is, the results of Psgan (1984) indicste thst the two-

step procedure produces consistent and asymptoticallyefficient estimators of

the influence of the policy variables on the returns.           If the VAR is

misspecified,    as it will be if the agents of the economy have more

information than is attributed to them by the econometrician,          the approach is

suspect and nay be bankrupt in the sense that the parameter estimates will be

inconsistent.

   Evans (1986) used this approach in an investigation of exchange rates

using quarterly data for the period 1973:11 to 1984:111.           Stockman (1986), in

his comment on Feldstein (1986), cites Evans (1986) as providing evidence in

opposition to the conclusions of Feldstein (1986) that budget deficits of the

U.S. appreciate the dollar.      Stockman (1986,   p.L+O4)   states:

   When changes in real go'ernment spending and the deficit are

   simultaneouslyincluded in an equation for the exchange rate, his

    (Evans's) estimates   show a sizable and statistically       significant    effect of

   higher government spending, leading to real appreciation (of the dollar),

   and a coefficient on the budget deficit that is oooosite in sign from

   Feldatein's    estimates   and sometimes statistically     significant.     Evans's

   results     show a larger U.S. deficit, given real government spending,

   leading to a dollar depreciation.       When Evans included foreign variables

    in his equations,   he found that greater foreign government spending leads

   to dollar depreciation and greater foreign deficits lead to dollar

   appreciation,    with the estimated effects of U.S. government spending and

   deficits remaining essentially unchanged.

Stockman (1986) recognized that additional data might be very useful in the

debate about the effects of deficits on the dollar, since the dollar

depreciated by a substantial amount from its peak in February 1985.             Because
                                         37

Evans's evidence has figured prominently in the debate on the determinants of

the dollar with its attendant   influence     on the balance of payments,   I updated

his analysis with available data.

   The results are presented in Table 4.       The dependent variable is

              with exchange rates measured as the value of currency i in terms
log(S1/F)
of the U.S. dollar.   The exchange rate data were obtained from the OECD Main

Economic Indicators and are end-of-quarter rates for the spot and the three-

month forward exchange rates.     The currencies   are the Belgian franc, the

British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Deutsche mark, the Dutch guilder, the

French franc, and the Swiss franc.     Since several of these currencies     are

members of the European Monetary System, it is unlikely that the results are

independent information across all currencies.

   The motivation for the ependent variable is the unbiasedness hypothesis

that links forward rates to expected future spot exchange rates under a

presumption of risk neutrality.     Evidence on the validity of this

specification is presented below.    Here I merely note that previous research,

surveyed in Hodrick (1987), suggests that the specification is questionable.

Since unanticipated changes in exchange rates are so large,
                                                            though, it may be

reasonable to conclude that nothing particularly critical in the

interpretation of these results hinges on the failure of the unbiasedness

hypothesis.   This is certainly not true as a general rule.

   The regressors in Table 4 include a constant and the residuals from a VAR

that are the unanticipated changes in the logarithm of real federal

government purchases, UG; in the real federal government deficit relative to

trend, UD, measured by deflating nominal deficits by the product of trend

real GNP and the GNP deflator; in the logarithm of real balances, UN,

measured as the Ml money supply for the last month of the quarter divided by

the GNP deflator;    and in the logarithm of the GNP deflator, UP.8            I   followed

Evans (1986) and estimated    a fourth-order VAR on seven variables that

included a constant,    the four variables described above, the discount rate of

the Federal Reserve,    and the logarithms of real GNP and the monetary base.

The VAR was estimated from 1962:11 to 1987:IV, and the results of Table 4 are

for 1973:111 to 1987:IV due to availability of exchsnge rate data.

   Before I discuss my extension of Evans (1986)     ,    I present a    typical

equation from his Table 1 with the coefficients and standard errors in

parenthesis.     The currency is the Deutsche mark, and the constant is

suppressed:


      log[SiFl(1)]      — -l.005U0   + 5.96UD   + 2.6OUM     + 7.99UP +    £           (50)
                          (0.320)     (1.55)     (1.18)       (2.59)

                             R2 — 0.323; S.E. — 0.0543; OW. — 1.87

Since the exchange rates are U.S. dollars per Deutsche mark,           a depreciation

(appreciation)    of the dollar is a positive (negative) movement in the

dependent variable.     Hence, Evans found that an increase in federal

government spending causes a statistically      significant       appreciation of the
dollar relative to the mark, while increases in federal budget deficits,

which are measured positively, cause a statistically significant depreciatior

of the dollar, as do unanticipated increases in U.S. real balances and in the

U.S. price level.     One possible explanation of the coefficient on budget

deficits is that they are substantially endogenous and are merely reflecting

bad news about the performance of the U.S. real economy, which depreciates

the dollar.    Another explanation is that budget deficits are eventually

financed by printing of money, and an increase in the budget deficit creates

expected inflation which depreciates the dollar.          Evans    (1986) examined

cyclically adjusted budget deficits and found similar effects which tends to
                                        39


support the latter interpretation.

   The results in Table 4 indicate that extension of the sample period to

l987:IV completely eliminates   the statistical significance of the variables.

The magnitudes of the coefficients are reduced and are often of the opposite

sign of Evans's estimates.    The standard errors of the coefficients have

increased dramatically which eliminates the statistical significance of the

variables. In particular,     the effects of the government purchases      and

deficit variables are now no longer significantly different from zero.           The

reduction in the explanatory power of the variables in the larger sample is

now reflected in negative adjusted R2's.

   I have not attempted to determine why the results deteriorate in the

longer sample, but I have attempted to replicate Evans's results over his

sample period with my versIons of the variables.     My results are not as

strong as Evans's even over his sample period.     Apparently,   Evans's

measurements of the GNP deflator as the last month of the quarter is one

source of difference between the two estimations.     The results also appear to

be somewhat sensitive to the starting date.

   A complete explanation for the differences across periods would require

more space than can be used here, but one thing stands out.       If the VAR

methodology were correct, in the sense of capturing the exogenous forces of
the economy,   and there were no changes in regimes, the results would not be

so dependent on the sample.     Hence, the dependence I find must indicate that

the VAR methodology is very suspect and cannot be used to interpret         causal

influences on exchange rates and capital flows.

   In the next section I discuss additional evidence that suggests the

importance of risk aversion in developing international    financial    models to

guide our interactions with the data.

International    Caoitaj.   Market Equilibrium

   Correct analysis of current accounts and international        capital flows an

appropriate    description of equilibrium expected returns in international

capital markets.      Frenkel (1985) and Krugman (1986, 1988) have used an

argument,    premised on the appropriateness     of risk neutrality,   to address   the

issue of the sustainebility exchange rates.         Unsustainable rates are thought

to be pert of a "bubble" or possibly en irrationality        in the foreign exchange

market.9

   A basic building block of the sustainebilityexplorations is the

assumption that the expected rate of change in the real exchange rate is the

reel interest differential across countries.         The level of the real exchange

rate is deemed to be wrong or unsustainable        if this calculated rate of change

implies too much accumulation of external debt over the future.           The rate at

which the U.S. accumulates external debt is modeled in a simplistic fashion

similar to equation (1), but with constant domestic and foreign growth rates.

I find this approach wrong for at least two reasons.

   First, it is inappropriate       to hold other things constant.     Growth rates of

countries    ought to be allowed to differ over time, and there are other

determinants of the current account other than the current real exchange

rate.    Secondly,   the assumption of risk neutrality is not well supported by
                             10
the available evidence.           In Hodrick (1987) I discuss a considerable body of

evidence that indicates the inappropriateness        of an assumption of risk

neutrality.     In this section I present some new results that are

representative of the previous findings of myself and others.

ImDlications of Risk-Neutrality

   Let
         S denote the spot exchange rate of dollars       per foreign currency, and

let   F be   the forward price at which one can contract at time t for purchase

of   foreign currency in one period.                The nominal dollar profit from a long

position in the forward foreign currency market is 5t+l                                           Ft).    If         is the

purchssing power of a dollar, the real value of the profit is 5t+l                                               -




            Since there is no opportunity cost to making the forward contract,
F)ir÷i.
risk neutral preferences imply that the expected value of the real profit on

the forward contract is zero,

     The standard way that a hypothesis such as (51) is tested is to regress

realizations       of the real profit at time t+l on information in the time t

information set.11 Since the stationarity of the regressors is a factor in

the derivation of the asymptotic distribution theory of the estimators,                                               I

first divided the real profit at time t+l by the product of the exchange rate

and the purchasing power of the dollar at time                              t.       The specification of the

regression allows a small number of different instruments across currencies:

     An alternative derivation of the deflation in equation (52) recognizes

that its left-hand side, when multiplied by one plus the foreign nominal

interest rate, is the difference in two real rates of return.                                            Investing        a

units of foreign currency.                Each unit of foreign currency can be invested to

give one plus the foreign interest rate in foreign currency at time t+l.                                                  If

the investment is uncovered,               the agent sells the accumulated foreign currency

for dollars in the future spot market at       while if the investment is

covered to remove the uncertainty of repatriation at a random exchange rate,

the agent contracts        to sell the interest plus principal on the foreign

currency at Ft.         In either case the dollar proceeds of the investment are

valued at             in terms of real goods.    If agents are risk neutral, the
                c÷l
expected real rate of return on all investments should be equal, and the

left-hand       aide of equation (52) should have expected value of zero.

     The motivation for the instruments on the right-hand aide of equation               (52)

is the following.        As Fama (1984) noted, the forward premium,
                                                                                 S)/St

                                                                       (F
can be defined to be the market's assessment of the expected rate of

depreciation of the home currency plus an adjusted risk premium.            Therefore,

it should be a useful instrument if risk is actually present. If expected

real returns are not the same across assets, the lagged
                                                        dependent variable
should capture aerial correlation in the difference of the two returns if it

is   present.

     Teats of equation (52) were conducted using the same OECD data on exchange

rates described above.        I examined the hypotheaia from two perspectives:           a

U.S. investor using U.S. dollar per foreign
                                            currency exchange rates and a
U.K. investor using British pound per foreign currency exchange rates.               The

purchasing powers of monies were measured as the reciprocals of the U.S.

National Income and Product Accounts deflator of consumer nondurablea plus

services and the U.K. deflator for nondureblea.

     I examined two types of estimation of the
                                               system of equations.             In the

first I constrained the three parameters         of each equation to be the same

across the aeven equations and estimated the system with Hansen's (1982)

Generalized Method of Momenta (GMM) without imposing the auxiliary
                                                                   aaaumption
of conditional homoacedasticity.        I employed three orthogonality conditions

for each currency requiring that the expectation error be orthogonal to the
                                        43

three right-hand side variables.

   For the U.S. dollar system, the constrained value of           is -1.722 with a

standard deviation of 0.793; the constrained value of            is -0.458 with a

standard deviation of 0.122, and the constrainedvalue of             is 0.140 with a

standard deviation of 0.061.     The value of the chi-square statistic with

three degrees of freedom that tests the hypothesis that the three

coefficients are zero is 16.483, which corresponds        to a marginal level of


significance   of .0009.   This is strong evidence that the expected real

returns to speculationby a U.S. investor in the forward foreign exchange

market are not constant.     The value of the chi-square statistic with eighteen

degrees of freedom that tests the hypothesis that the constraints         on the

coefficients across equations are inappropriate      is    15.322, which corresponds

to a marginal level of sigt\ificance of .640.

   For the U.K. pound system the constrainedvalue of             is 1.799 with a

standard deviation of 1.632; the constrained value of            is -0.325 with a
                                                             l
standard deviation of 0.107, and the constrained value of            is 0.157 ;ith s

standard deviation of 0.056.     The value of the chi-square statistic with

three degrees of freedom that tests the hypothesis that the three

coefficients are zero is 15.517, which corresponds to a marginal level of

significance smaller than .001.     The chi-square   statistic with eighteen

degrees of freedom that tests the hypothesis that the constraints on the

coefficients are inappropriate    has a value of 19.319 which corresponds        to a

marginal level of significance of    .372.

   The other system estimation that I performed was seemingly unrelated

regression under the auxiliary assumption of homoscedasticity.           The results

of this estimation for the U.S. dollar system are presented in Table         5   and

for the U.K. pound system in Table 6.        The test of the hypothesis that the

expected real returns are zero in this case is a chi-square statistic with

twenty-one degrees of freedom.     For the U.S. dollar system,    the value of

52.267 corresponds    to a marginal level of significance of .0002, which is

quite strong evidence against the null hypothesis.         For the U.K. pound

system,    the value of 77.816 corresponds    to a marginal level of significance

   Should the above analysis be taken as evidence against risk neutral asset

pricing for U.S. and U.K. based investors,    or is there reason to think that

the time series properties of the data are not consistent with the ergodicity

assumption implicit in the derivation of the test statistics?    These are

questions that have been answered differently by different researchers, and       I


refer the interested reader to Hodrick (1987) for a survey of the opinions.

Risk-Averse Models

   If risk neutrality is not a correct measure of international capital

market equilibrium, what is?     One natural direction to proceed is to examine

models of risk averse behavior are capable of reconciling the pattern of time

variation in expected returns.    Although there has been considerable

investigation of intertemporal    asset pricing equations derived from

representative agent Euler'equations since the publication of Hansen and

Singleton (1982)     there is not as yet a consensus on the appropriate

intertemporal asset pricing model.     Here I merely inquire how well two simple

versions work.     The first model is in the spirit of the original analysis of

Hansen and Singleton (1982).     The second is related to the Ricardian model

derived above.

   If agents are averse to risk, expected returns depend on nature of the

risk-aversion and the opportunities that they have for trading assets.       In

simple intertemporal asset pricing models, such as Hansen and Singleton

(1982),   the portfolio decisions require equality between the marginal utility

foregone when the asset is purchased and the expected discounted marginal

utility of the payoff on the asset.     The early empirical tests of the

intertemporal asset pricing used the cost of the asset in real terms times

the marginal utility of consumption goods as the opportunity cost of the

investment,   and the tests used the real payoff on the asset times the
                                       46

marginal utility of consumption in the future as the realization of the

marginal gain on the investment.

   With this timing the difference between the uncovered and covered foreign

money market investments is given by



          E          -F]rt+lU'(Ct±l)        0                                   (53)
              t
                     S1rU'(C)
where U'(C) is the marginal utility of consumption at time      t.   If marginal
utility is parameterized by ca, and consumption   is taken to be the

consumption of nondurables plus services per household for the U.S. investor

and the consumption of nondurables for the U.K. inveator,     the Euler equations

(53) can be estimated for the seven currencies.   This specification was

tested with monthly data for the U.S. dollar over the sample 1973:3 to 1983:7

by Mark (1985).

   I estimated the two seven equation systems for the U.S. data and the U.K.

data separately.   Each system contains one free parameter,   a, and   I   used the

same set of three instruments per equation as above.     For the U.S. data the

estimated a is 60.918 with a standard error of 22.208.    Although thia

estimate seems wildly high, in the sense that it implies extremely risk

averse behavior, and consequently probably ought to be taken as evidence

against the specification of the model, the chi-square statistic that tests

the twenty overidentifying restrictions has a value of 22.656, which

corresponds to a marginal level of significance of .329.      Hence, while the

instrumental variablea were powerful enough to provide a strong rejection of

the risk-neutrality hypothesis, the orthogonality conditions implied by the

risk averse model are not rejected by the data.   Similar results with monthly

data are reported by Mark (1985).   He found very high estimates of a, and the
                                                  47

overidentifying restrictions of the model did not indicate rejection of the

specification.

   For the U.K. data, the estimated a is 2.1513 with a standard error of

3.0488.    The chi-square statistic        that tests the twenty overidentifying

restrictions has a value of 24.593, which corresponds to a marginal level of

significance of .217.         The U.K. data do not produce a coefficient of relative

risk aversion that is significantly different from zero, but the very atrong

evidence against the risk neutral model also is not present when consumption

is allowed to vary.

   One reason the above specifications of the intertemporal asset pricing

model might be incorrect is that the timing of the marginal utility of

oomsumption is incorrect.          In cash-in-advance models such as the one above,

the dollar proceeds from an investment can only be used in the next available

goods market,    and the value of the return in terms of goods is not certain.

If this alternative timing is followed,                the specification of the Euler

equation becomes


                 [51     -   Fhllrt÷2 U'(Ct+2 )
                 L t+1        tj                   — 0

                         S1rU'(C)
   I estimated equation (54) for the same seven currencies and with the same

set of instrument as employed in equation (53)12                 The results for both

currencies are similar in that the estimated a for the U.S. system is 53.652

with a standard error of 16.880, and the chi-square statistic with 20 degrees

of freedom is 21.656, which corresponds to a marginal level of significance

of .359.    For the U.K. system the results are an estimate of a of 3.037 with

a standard error of 2.876, and a chi-square statistic of 24.463, which

corresponds to a marginal level of significance of .222.

Alternative Interpretations

   One puzzling aspect of the above regression analysis is the
                                                               persistent
statistically significant negative coefficient on the forward premiums.        This

suggests that high values of the forward premium (high forward prices of

foreign currencies in term of dollars relative to spot prices) are associstec

with less depreciation of the dollar relative to the foreign
                                                             currency than       is

predicted by the forward premium.    Probably,   the smaller depreciation is

actually an appreciation of the dollar relative to foreign currencies.

   A   potential explanation of this phenomenon is that the data are simply not

reflecting all of the possible events that concern agents when they are

setting asset prices.   Fama (1984) credits Mussa for advancing the following

hypothesis explaining why the sample statistics might not be consistent with

the true underlying probability distributiona that
                                                   agents assess rationally.
   Since the forward preaium is directly related to the nominal interest

differential across countries from covered interest rate
                                                         parity, a large

positive value of the forward premium indicates that the U.S. nominal

interest rate is high relative to the foreign nominal interest rate.     Mussa

suggested that periods of high expected inflation in either country may also

be periods of highly skewed distributions of possible inflation rates.     One

reason would be because the privete sector is worried that the
                                                               public sector
may lose control of the economy. This skewed distribution of possible

inflation rates raises the expected rate of inflation,    which would raise thai

country's nominal interest rate, and increase the absolute value of the

forward premium.   If the sample size is insufficiently large, the

realizations of high inflation and large depreciations of currencies that

concern the private sector may be occurring with less

   Bates (1987) examines the evidence from option prices on Deutache mark

futures, which provide additional information about the subjective

distributions of future exchange rates implicit in market pricea.     He finds a

lack of symmetry in the ex ante distribution of the dollar-OH rate.     Perhaps

use of additional data such as option prices will allow a better

understanding of the phenomenon in future work.

   Additional data in the form of surveys of expected future spot rates have

also been employed by Frankel and Froot (1987).   Their findings with

relatively short sample peiods indicate that rationality of the survey data
can be rejected.

   One possible explanation of the above empirical work is that the market is

assessing more possible events than have occurred during the sample period.

If this is the case, econometric analysis of the determination of

 international capital flows and real exchange rates is probably also suspect.

                                   Conclusions

    In this paper I discuss alternative reasons for the current large U.S.

 capital flows and attempt to provide some perspectives that can guide future

 modeling of these issues.   One major findings is that movements of U.S. real

 income growth relative to that of the rest of the world and movements in the

 U.S. real exchange rate do a reasonable job of "explaining" the U.S.   current

 account, when allowance is made for lags in responses.   Given this, it seemed

 reasonable to develop models of the current account as a rational equilibrium

 response of competitive agents to the stochastic forcing processes of their
                                             50

economies.

   I examined two sggregative dynamic models that have strong microeconomic

foundations. Both models explicitly develop the savings and investment

decisions of the private sector, and both consider rudimentary government

sectors.     Neither model   is,   at this point, sufficiently well posed to be

consistent with the data.          Solution of the Ricardian model required a number

of strong assumptions such as serially uncorrelated driving processes, and

separability of the utility function.         Solution of the overlapping

generations model required that there is one good in the world economy,           that

the capital stock can be allocated costlesaly across countries after the

realization of productivity, that the government bonds of the two countries

are perfect substitutes,      and that there is no money.    Explicit solution for

the flow of capital    across'countriesalso required a linearization which

imposed an assumption of risk neutrality.         Both models allowed for perfect

capital mobility across countries with the Ricardian model impoaing a

perfectly pooled equilibrium.         Little work has been done on alternatives to

this idea in which the reasons why countriea        do not accumulate large claims

on each other are endogenous)3

   One different prediction of the two models involves the role of government

budget deficits.     Both models predict that movements in productivity across

countries and in the sizes of the government sectors affect the real

equilibrium, but the Ricardian model predicts that the financing of the

government sector does not matter as long as the taxation is

nondiatortionary.

   This difference in predictions was then examined empirically. The highly

significant empirical analysis in Evans (1986) that was interpreted as

evidence that U.S. budget deficits do not appreciate the dollar is not
                                         51


supported with an additional two and a half years of data.       The specification

deteriorates very badly.    While it is certainly possible that inference from

the VAR approach is worthwhile, one suspects that agents have additional

sources of information about future deficits not captured by the regressions.

Developing a model of the alternative way that agents forecast is necessary

before scientific inquiry can proceed.

   I next explored two simple models of international capital market

equilibrium. The results of these risk premium studies have several

alternative interpretations. One may be that international capital markets

function poorly and allow exchange rates to be excessively volatile.          Another

is that risk aversion is an important attribute of our economic environment

that interacts with changes in the environment to produce substantial changes

in required expected returns and asset prices.14      A   third is that the

reported statistics are not appropriate because agents are assigning

probabilities to events that have not occurred with sufficient frequency.

The sample statistics are poor measures of the subjective probability

distributions implicit in the calculations that lead to the decisions of

agents.   If this is the case, such problems will infect any analysis of

exchange rates, and any regreasions purporting to explain capital flows will

no doubt be misspecified.

   Understanding capital flows across countries requires an understanding of

the savings and investment decisions of economic agents and of the sources of

business cycles and of economic growth.       Equilibrium models of theses dynamic

aspects of the economy are still being developed.      Understanding capital
flows also requires an understanding of the determination of exchange rates

and other asset prices, which requires knowledge of expectations formation of

the private sector and of the influence of the government sector on the
                                      52

economy.   The models of this paper may prove useful in the development of

future economic models of these phenomena.

   In the introduction I outlined several important questions         that have been

posed because of recent U.S. current account deficits.          I now provide a

simple answer to the questions based more on the style of model that I have

developed than on the validity of the actual models.       The basic answer to all

of the questions is that the recent experience of the current account can be

thought of as a normal response of the economies of the world to variations

in the shares of government spending in the world economy, to cyclical

fluctuations and to diversities in rates of growth across countries.             People

who want government protection often think that foreign exchange and other

asset markets are not working correctly.     I   do not share    this opinion.     I


think that the stability of government policies and coordination of policies

across countries would help ease the forecasting problems that agents face.

appreciated in real terms by 40% from January 198D until February 1985, and

that by May 1987 it had reversed three-fourths of the appreciation.

sufficient to justify the volatility of stock prices is an open question.         A

 similar argument can be applied to the exchange rate literature that has
