    Models of rare macroeconomic events, denoted RE, provide one approach to understanding

the high average equity premium and other asset-pricing puzzles. Another approach, called

long-run risks or LRR, emphasizes variations in the long-run growth rate and the variance of

shocks to the growth rate (stochastic volatility). An extensive literature has studied the separate

roles of RE and LRR in asset pricing but has not considered them jointly. This simultaneous

perspective is important because the two approaches are complementary for analyses of asset

pricing. In addition, the joint approach allows for a conceptual and empirical distinction between

RE and LRR. Moreover, although we prefer a model that incorporates both features, we can

assess the relative contributions of RE and LRR for explaining the average equity premium, the

volatility of rates of return, and other patterns in asset prices.

    One finding is that the joint model with RE and LRR does well in explaining the average

equity premium and risk-free rate. In this part of the analysis, RE is the main contributor, but the

inclusion of LRR produces a moderate improvement in the results. Further refinements of the

model would likely produce better results, and we think that a key element is the allowance for

incomplete current information about the nature of the shocks hitting an economy. For volatility

of rates of return, the joint model with RE and LRR falls short of a satisfactory explanation.

Modifications of the model to include time variation of disaster probabilities may improve this

part of the analysis.

    Similar to previous research, this study treats rare events, RE, and long-run risks, LRR, as

unobserved latent variables. Our specification views RE as comprising sporadic, drastic, and

jumping outbursts, whereas LRR exhibits persistent, moderate, and smooth fluctuations. Our

formalization of this distinction provides the basis for separately identifying the two forces in

long-term panel data.       The results show that periods labeled as RE (based on posterior



                                                    1
probability distributions) typically correspond to familiar historical events, such as the world

wars and the Great Depression. The evolution of variables corresponding to LRR is harder to

identify with historical events. However, there is some correspondence with commonly held

views about moderation (reduced volatility) in some decades and with persistently low or high

rates of economic growth in some non-disaster periods.

   To estimate the model, we extend the long-term annual national-accounts information from

Barro and Urs√∫a (2010) to include the period up to 2012. We use observations on per capita

consumer expenditure (henceforth, called C) for 42 economies for up to 160 years. We use these

data to estimate the time-series structure of consumption. This structure reflects the underlying

elements of rare events, RE, and long-run risks, LRR. The resulting macroeconomic patterns for

individual countries are of interest for their own sake and for other applications, and they also

provide the basis for asset-pricing results.

   To carry out asset pricing, we embed the estimated time-series process for C into an

endowment economy with a representative agent that has Epstein-Zin-Weil (EZW) preferences

(Epstein and Zin [1989] and Weil [1990]). This analysis generates predictions for the average

equity premium, the volatility of equity returns, and so on. Then we compare these predictions

with averages found in the long-term data for a group of countries.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I relates our study to the previous

literature on rare macroeconomic events and long-run risks. Section II lays out our formal model,

which includes rare events (partly temporary, partly permanent) and long-run risks (including

stochastic volatility). Section III discusses the long-term panel data on consumption, describes

our method of estimation, and presents empirical results related to the time evolution of

consumption in each country. The analysis includes a detailed description for six illustrative



                                                2
countries of the evolution of posterior means of the key variables related to rare events and long-

run risks. Section IV presents the framework for asset pricing. We draw out the implications of

the estimated processes for consumption for various statistics, including the average equity

premium and the volatility of equity returns. Section V has conclusions, focusing on further

refinements that seem promising for resolving remaining issues.

I. Relation to the Literature

       Rietz (1988) proposed rare macroeconomic disasters, particularly potential events akin to

the U.S. Great Depression, as a possible way to explain the ‚Äúequity-premium puzzle‚Äù of Mehra

and Prescott (1985). The Rietz idea was reinvigorated by Barro (2006) and Barro and Urs√∫a

(2008), who modeled macroeconomic disasters as short-run cumulative declines in real per

capita GDP or consumption of magnitude greater than a threshold size, such as 10%. Using the

observed frequency and size distribution of these disasters for 36 countries, Barro and Urs√∫a

(2008) found that a coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ≥, around 3.5 was needed to match the

observed average equity premium of about 7% (on levered equity).           Barro and Jin (2011)

modified the analysis to gauge the size distribution of disasters with a fitted power law, rather

than the observed histogram. This analysis estimated the required Œ≥ to be around 3, with a 95%

confidence interval of 2 to 4.

       Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Urs√∫a (2013), henceforth NSBU, modified the baseline

rare-disasters model in several respects: (1) the extended model incorporated the recoveries

(sustained periods of unusually high economic growth) that typically followed disasters;

(2) disasters were modeled as unfolding in a stochastic manner over multiple years, rather than

unrealistically occurring as a jump over a single ‚Äúperiod;‚Äù and (3) the timing of disasters was

allowed to be correlated across countries, as is apparent for world wars and global depressions.



                                                 3
          The empirical estimates indicated that, on average, a disaster reached its trough after six

years, with a peak-to-trough drop in consumption averaging about 30% and that, on average, half

of the decline was reversed in a gradual period of recovery. With an intertemporal elasticity of

substitution (IES) of two, NSBU found that a coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ≥, of about 6.4

was required to match the observed long-term average equity premium. Although the NSBU

model improved on the baseline rare-disasters models in various ways, the increase in the

required Œ≥ was a negative in the sense that a value of 6.4 seems unrealistically high. The main

reason for the change was the allowance for recoveries from disasters; that is, disasters had a

smaller impact on asset pricing than previously thought because they were less than permanent.

In the present formulation, we improve in several respects on the NSBU specification of rare

events.

          The notion of rare macroeconomic events has been employed by researchers to explain a

variety of puzzles and phenomena in asset and foreign-exchange markets; see, for example,

Gabaix (2012), Gourio (2008, 2012), Farhi and Gabaix (2015), Farhi et al. (2015), Wachter

(2013), Seo and Wachter (2015), and Colacito and Croce (2013). Barro and Urs√∫a (2012)

provide a review of this literature.

          Bansal and Yaron (2004), henceforth BY, introduced the idea of long-run risks. The

central notion is that small but persistent shocks to expected growth rates and to the volatility of

shocks to growth rates are important for explaining various asset-market phenomena, including

the high average equity premium and the high volatility of stock returns. The main results in BY

and in the updated study by Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2010) required a coefficient of relative risk

aversion, Œ≥, around 10, even higher than the values needed in the rare-disasters literature. (BY

assumed an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of 1.5 and also assumed substantial leverage



                                                   4
in the relation between dividends and consumption.) In our study, we incorporate the long-run

risks framework of BY, along with an updated specification for rare macroeconomic events.

         The idea of long-run risks has been applied to many aspects of asset and foreign-

exchange markets. This literature includes Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013); Bansal, Dittmar,

and Lundblad (2005); Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2008); Malloy, Moskowitz, and Vissing-

Jorgensen (2009); Croce, Lettau, and Ludvigson (2015); Chen (2010); Colacito and Croce (2011);

and Nakamura, Sergeyev, and Steinsson (2015). Beeler and Campbell (2012) provide a critical

empirical evaluation of the long-run-risks model.

         There is a large literature investigating separately the implications for asset pricing of

rare events, RE, and long-run risks, LRR. However, our view is that‚Äîdespite the order-of-

magnitude increase in the required numerical analysis‚Äîit is important to assess the two core

ideas, RE and LRR, in a simultaneous manner. 1 This study reports the findings from this joint

analysis.

II. Model of Rare Events and Long-Run Risks

         The model allows for rare events, RE, and long-run risks, LRR. The RE part follows

Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Urs√∫a (2013) (or NSBU) in allowing for macroeconomic

disasters of stochastic size and duration, along with recoveries that are gradual and of stochastic

proportion. We modify the NSBU framework in various dimensions, including the specification

of probabilities for world and individual country transitions between normal and disaster states.

Most importantly, we expand on NSBU by incorporating long-run risks, along the lines of

Bansal and Yaron (2004). The LRR specification allows for fluctuations in long-run growth

1
 Nakamura, Sergeyev, and Steinsson or NSS (2015, section 3) filter the consumption data for crudely estimated disaster effects
based on the results in Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursua (2013) or NSBU. Thus, NSS do not carry out a joint analysis of
rare events and long-run risks. This joint analysis was also not present in NSBU (which neglected long-run risks). In their
analysis of asset pricing, NSS consider only the role of long-run risks (applied to their disaster-filtered data), whereas NSBU
allowed only for effects from rare events. Thus, neither NSS nor NSBU carried out an asset-pricing analysis that allows for both
rare events and long-run risks.

                                                               5
rates and for stochastic volatility.

            A. Components of consumption

            As in NSBU, the log of consumption per capita for country i at time t, ùëêùëñùëñ, is the sum of

three unobserved variables:

            (1)                        ùëêùëñùëñ = ùë•ùëñùëñ + ùëßùëñùëñ + ùúéùúÄùúÄ ùúÄùëñùëñ ,

where ùë•ùëñùëñ is the ‚Äúpotential level‚Äù (or permanent part) of the log of per capita consumption and ùëßùëñùëñ

is the ‚Äúevent gap,‚Äù which describes the deviation of ùëêùëñùëñ from its potential level due to current and

past rare events. The potential level of consumption and the event gap depend on the disaster

process, as detailed below. The term ùúéùúÄùúÄ ùúÄùëñùëñ is a temporary shock, where ùúÄùëñùëñ is an i.i.d. standard

normal variable. The standard deviation, œÉŒµi, of the shock varies by country. We also allow œÉŒµi to

take on two values for each country, one up to 1945 and another thereafter. 2 This treatment

allows for post-WWII moderation in observed consumption volatility particularly because of

improved measurement in national accounts‚Äîsee Romer (1986) and Balke and Gordon (1989).

            B. Disaster probabilities

            We follow NSBU, but with significant modifications, in assuming that rare

macroeconomic events involve disaster and normal states. Each state tends to persist over time,

but there are possibilities for transitioning from one state to the other. The various probabilities

have world and country-specific components.

            For the world component, we have in mind the influence from major international

catastrophes such as the two world wars and the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Additional

possible examples are the Great Influenza Epidemic of 1918-20 and the current threat from

climate change. 3 However, the recent global financial crisis of 2008-09 turns out not to be


2
    When the data for country i begin after 1936, ùúéùúÄùúÄ takes on only one value.
3
 See Barro (2015) for an application of the rare-events framework to environmental issues.

                                                               6
sufficiently important to show up as a world disaster.

        We characterize the world process with two probabilities‚Äîone, denoted p0, is the

probability of moving from normalcy to a global disaster state (such as the start of a world war or

global depression), and two, denoted p1, is the probability of staying in a world disaster state.

Thus, (1 ‚àí ùëù1 ) is probability of moving from a world disaster state to normalcy (such as the end

of a world war or global depression). Formally, if ùêºùë§ùë§ is a dummy variable for the presence of a

world event, we assume:

                                                 ùëù0 if ùêºùëä,ùë°‚àí1 = 0,
        (2)            Pr(ùêºùë§ùë§ = 1|ùêºùëä,ùë°‚àí1 ) = ÔøΩ
                                                 ùëù1 if ùêºùëä,ùë°‚àí1 = 1.

We expect p1 > p0; that is, a world event at t is (much) more likely if the world was experiencing

an event at t ‚àí 1.

        For each country, we assume that the chance of experiencing a rare macroeconomic event

depends partly on the world situation and partly on individual conditions. We specify four

probabilities‚Äîreflecting the presence or absence of a contemporaneous world event and whether

the country experienced a rare event in the previous period. Formally, if Iit is a dummy variable

for the presence of an event in country i, we have

                                             ùëû00 if ùêºùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 = 0 and ùêºùëäùëä   = 0,
                                          ‚éß
                                             ùëû01 if ùêºùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 = 0 and ùêºùëäùëä   = 1,
        (3)     Pr(ùêºùëñùëñ = 1|ùêºùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 , ùêºùëäùëä ) =
                                            ‚é®ùëû10 if ùêºùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 = 1 and ùêºùëäùëä   = 0,
                                            ‚é©ùëû11 if ùêºùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 = 1 and ùêºùëäùëä   = 1.

We expect q01 > q00 and q11 > q10; that is, the presence of a world event at time t makes it (much)

more likely that country i experiences an event at t. We also expect q10 > q00 and q11 > q01; that

is, an individual country event at t is (much) more likely if the country experienced an event at t

‚àí 1.

        In the present specification, the various disaster probabilities‚Äîp0, p1, q00, q01, q10, and


                                                   7
q11‚Äîare constant over time. The q-parameters also do not vary across countries. In subsequent

research, we plan to allow the disaster probabilities to vary over time and space.

       C. Potential consumption

       The growth rate of potential consumption includes effects from rare events, RE, and

long-run risks, LRR. The specification for country i at time t is:

       (4)              ‚àÜùë•ùëñùëñ = ùúáùëñ + ùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ + ùúíùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 + ùúéùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 ùë¢ùëñùëñ ,

where ‚àÜùë•ùëñùëñ ‚â° ùë•ùëñùëñ ‚àí ùë•ùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 , ùúáùëñ is the constant long-run average growth rate of potential

consumption, ùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ picks up the permanent effect of a disaster, ùúíùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 is the evolving part of the

long-run growth rate, ùúéùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 represents stochastic volatility, and ùë¢ùëñùëñ is an i.i.d. standard normal

variable.

       D. Rare events

       The RE part of equation (4) appears in the term ùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ , which operates for country i at

time t when the country is in a disaster state (Iit = 1). The random shock Œ∑it determines the long-

run effect of a current disaster on the level of country i‚Äôs potential consumption. If Œ∑it < 0, a

disaster today lowers the long-run level of potential consumption; that is, the projected recovery

from a disaster is less than 100%. We assume that Œ∑it is normally distributed with a mean and

variance that are constant over time and across countries. In practice, we find that the mean of

Œ∑it is negative, but a particular realization may be positive. Thus, although the typical recovery is

less than complete, a disaster sometimes raises a country‚Äôs long-run level of consumption (so

that the projected recovery exceeds 100%).

       E. Long-run risks

       The LRR part of equation (4) appears in the terms ùúíùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 and ùúéùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 ùë¢ùëñùëñ . These terms

capture, respectively, variations in the long-run growth rate and stochastic volatility.         Our


                                                   8
analysis of these variables follows the specification in Bansal and Yaron (2004, p. 1487,

equation [8]). 4

         We think of the sum of Œºi and ùúíùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 as a country‚Äôs long-run growth rate for period t. The

ùúíùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 term is the evolving part of the long-run growth rate and is governed by:

         (5)                 ùúíùëñùëñ = ùúåùúí ùúíùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 + ùëòùúéùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 ùëíùëñùëñ ,

where ùúåùúí is a first-order autoregressive coefficient, with 0 ‚â§ ùúåùúí < 1. The shock includes the

standard normal variable eit, multiplied by the stochastic volatility, ùúéùëñ,ùë°‚àí1, and adjusted by the

positive constant, k. Hence, k is the ratio of the standard deviation of the shock to the long-run

growth rate, ùúíùëñùë° in equation (5), compared to the standard deviation of the shock to the growth

rate of potential consumption, ‚àÜùë•ùëñ,ùë°+1 from equation (4). The assumption that k is constant

means that a country‚Äôs volatility of these two shocks moves over time in tandem‚Äîin accordance

with the evolution of ùúéùëñùëñ .

         F. Stochastic volatility

         Stochastic volatility, ùúéùëñùëñ , enters in equations (4) and (5). We follow Bansal and Yaron

(2004, p. 1487) in modeling the evolution of volatility as an AR(1) process for the variance:

         (6)                 ùúéùëñùëñ2 = ùúéùëñ2 + ùúåùúé ÔøΩùúéùëñ,ùë°‚àí1
                                               2
                                                     ‚àí ùúéùëñ2 ÔøΩ + ùúéùúîùúî ùúîùëñùëñ ,

where ùúéùëñ2 is the average country-specific variance, and ùúåùúé is a first-order autoregressive

coefficient, with 0 ‚â§ ùúåùúé <1. The shock includes the standard normal variable ùúîùëñùëñ multiplied by

the country-specific volatility of volatility, ùúéùúîùúî . In the estimation, we use a method similar to

Bansal and Yaron (2004, p. 1495, n. 13) in constraining ùúéùëñùëñ2 to be non-negative (see

Appendix A.3).

         G. Dynamics of event gaps
4
 The main difference in specification is that Bansal and Yaron (2004) exclude rare-event components. Another difference,
important for asset pricing, is that they assume a levered relationship between dividends and consumption.

                                                              9
        Returning to equation (1), we now consider the event gap, ùëßùëñùëñ , which describes the

deviation of ùëêùëñùëñ from its potential level due to current and past rare events.         We assume,

following NSBU, that ùëßùëñùëñ follows a modified autoregressive process:

        (7)             ùëßùëñùëñ = ùúåùëß ùëßùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 + ùêºùëñùëñ ùúôùëñùëñ ‚àí ùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ + ùúéùúàùúà ùúàùëñùëñ ,

where ùúåùëß is a first-order autoregressive coefficient, with 0 ‚â§ ùúåùëß < 1. The shock includes the

standard normal variable ùúàùëñùëñ multiplied by the country-specific constant volatility ùúéùúàùúà .

        The direct effect of a disaster appears in equation (7) as the term ùêºùëñùëñ ùúôùëñùëñ . We assume that

ùúôùëñùëñ is negative, and we model it as a truncated normal distribution (with mean and variance for

the non-truncated distribution that are constant over time and across countries). Thus, in the

short run, a disaster lowers ùëêùëñùëñ in equation (1). However, as the event gap vanishes in accordance

with equation (7), this effect on ùëêùëñùëñ gradually disappears. That is, the short-run disaster shock,

ùúôùëñùëñ , does not affect ùëêùëñùëñ in the long run.

        The long-run impact of a disaster involves the term ‚àíùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ in equation (7), which

operates in conjunction with the term +ùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ in equation (4). The combination of these two

terms means that the short-run effect of ùúÇùëñùëñ on ùëêùëñùëñ in equation (1) is nil. However, if ùúÇùëñùëñ < 0 (the

typical case), the effect on the potential (or long-run) consumption level in equation (4) is

negative. Therefore, the event gap, ùëßùëñùëñ (corresponding to the difference between actual and

potential consumption), must fall. Over time, as the event gap vanishes (in accordance with

equation [7]), ùëêùëñùëñ tends to fall in equation (1). Therefore, the long-run disaster shock, ùúÇùëñùëñ ,

determines the effect on ùëêùëñùëñ in the long run.

        If we had assumed ùúÇùëñùëñ = ùúôùëñùëñ , the long- and short-run effects of a disaster would coincide;

that is, disasters would have only permanent effects on ùëêùëñùëñ . If we had assumed ùúÇùëñùëñ = 0, the long-

run effect of a disaster would be nil; that is, disasters would have only temporary effects on ùëêùëñùëñ .


                                                     10
We find empirically, as do NSBU, that recoveries tend to occur but are typically only partial.

This result corresponds to a mean for ùúÇùëñùëñ that is negative but smaller in magnitude than that

for ùúôùëñùëñ .

III. Data, Estimation Method, and Empirical Results

            We use data on annual consumption (real per capita personal consumer expenditure) for

the 42 economies covered in the Barro-Ursua (2010) data set. These data go back as far as 1851

and have been extended through 2012. There are 4814 country-year observations. Appendix

A.1 provides details.

            We follow NSBU in estimating the model with the Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo

(MCMC) method.            Our application features nearly flat prior distributions for the various

underlying parameters. See Appendix A.3 for details. We focus our discussion on the posterior

means of each parameter.

            A. Estimated model

            Table 1 contains the posterior means and standard deviations for the main parameters of

the model. These parameters apply across countries and over time.

            1.   Transition probabilities.   The first group of parameters in Table 1 applies to

transition probabilities between normal and disaster states. With respect to a world event, we

find that p0, the estimated probability of moving from a normal to a disaster state, is 2.9% per

year. Once entering a disaster, there is a lot of persistence: the estimated conditional probability,

p1, of the world remaining in a disaster the following year is 65.8%.

            The probability of a disaster for an individual country depends heavily on the global

situation and also on whether the country was in a disaster state in the previous year. If there is

no contemporaneous world disaster, the estimated probability, q00, of a country moving from a



                                                  11
normal to a disaster state is only 0.66% per year. The estimated conditional probability, q10, of a

country remaining in a disaster from one year to the next is 71.9% (if there is no

contemporaneous world disaster).

         In the presence of a world disaster, the estimated probability, q01, of a country moving

from normalcy to disaster is 36.0% per year. Finally, if there is a world disaster, the estimated

conditional probability, q11, of a country staying in a disaster state from one year to the next is

85.7%.

         The matrix of transition probabilities determines, in the long run, the fraction of time that

the world and individual countries spend in normal and disaster states. Specifically, the world is

estimated to be in a disaster state 7.8% of the time, and each country is estimated to be in a

disaster state 9.8% of the time. The average duration of a disaster state is 4.2 years for a country

(2.9 years for the world).

         As a comparison, Barro and Ursua (2008, Figure 1, p. 285) found a mean duration for

consumption disasters of 3.6 years.         That study used a peak-to-trough methodology for

measuring disaster sizes and defined a disaster as a cumulative contraction by least 10%. If we

restrict our present results to condition on a disaster cumulating to a decline by at least 10%, we

get that a country is in a disaster state 8.6% of the time and that the duration of a disaster

averages 5.0 years.

         We can also compute for each year the posterior mean of ùêºùë§ùë§ , the dummy variable for a

world disaster event. This value, plotted in Figure 1, exceeds 50% for 14 of the 162 sample

years (which covers 1851 to 2012): 1914-19, 1930, and 1939-45. In many of these years, the

posterior means exceed 90% (1914-15, 1930, 1939-40, 1943-45). These results accord with

Barro and Ursua (2008), who noted that the main world macroeconomic disasters in the long-



                                                  12
term international data (in that study since 1870) applied to World War I, the Great Depression,

and World War II, with the possible addition of the Great Influenza Epidemic of 1918-20.

       Aside from 1914-19, 1930, and 1939-45, the only other years where the posterior mean

of ùêºùë§ùë§ is at least 10% in Figure 1 are 1867, 1920, 1931, and 1946. In particular, the recent global

financial crisis of 2008-09 does not register in the figure (although it does show up for Greece).

Specifically, the posterior world event probability peaks at only 0.001 in 2008.

       We can similarly compute for each year the posterior mean of ùêºùëñùëñ , the dummy variable for

a disaster event for each country. Not surprisingly, many countries are gauged to be in a disaster

state when the world is in a disaster. Outside of the main world disaster periods (1867, 1914-20,

1930-31, 1939-46), the cases in which individual countries have posterior means for ùêºùëñùëñ of 25%

or more are shown in Table 2. Examples are the collapse of the U.S. dollar regime in Argentina

in 2001-02, the Chilean coup and aftermath for 1972-85, the German hyperinflation and

aftermath in 1921-27, the Great Recession in Greece for 2009-12, the period 1947-50 in India

following independence, the Asian Financial Crisis for Malaysia and South Korea for 1997-98,

the Mexican financial crisis of 1995, the violence and economic collapse in Peru for 1985-89, the

Portuguese Revolution of 1975, effects from the Russian Revolution and civil war for 1921-24,

the extended Great Depression in Spain and Spanish Civil War for 1932-38, the Korean War for

South Korea up to 1952, the Russo-Turkish War in Turkey for 1876-81, and the extended Great

Depression in the United States for 1932-33.

       2. Size distribution of disasters. The next group of parameters in Table 1 relates to

temporary versus permanent disaster effects and to the size distribution of disasters.         The

parameter ùúåùëß is the AR(1) coefficient in equation (7); this coefficient determines how rapidly a

country recovers from a disaster. The estimated value, 0.30 per year, indicates that only 30% of



                                                13
a temporary disaster shock remains after one year; that is, recoveries are rapid. Note, however,

that recovery refers only to the undoing of the effects from the temporary shocks, ùúôùëñùëñ in

equation (7). The economy‚Äôs consumption approaches, in the long run, a level that depends on

the permanent disaster shocks, ùúÇùëñùëñ in equation (7). This channel implies that there can be a great

deal of long-run consequence from a disaster‚Äîdepending on the realizations of ùúÇùëñùëñ while the

disaster state prevails.

        The estimated mean of the temporary disaster shock, ùúôùëñùëñ , is ‚àí0.079; that is, consumption

falls on average by about 8% in the first year of a disaster. (Note that this mean applies to a

truncated normal distribution; that is, one that admits only negative values of the shock.) The

estimated standard deviation, ùúéùúô , of the temporary shock is 0.057. Hence, there is considerable

dispersion in the distribution of first-year disaster sizes. The dispersion in cumulative disaster

sizes depends also on the stochastic duration of disaster states.

        The estimated mean of the permanent shock, ùúÇùëñùëñ , is ‚àí0.028; that is, consumption falls on

average in the long run by about 3% for each year of a disaster. (In this case, the mean applies to

a normal distribution.) The estimated standard deviation, ùúéùúÇ , is 0.148. Hence, there is enormous

dispersion in the long-run consequences of a disaster.

         The final group of parameters in Table 1 concerns long-run risks, including stochastic

volatility. The parameter ùúåùúí is the AR(1) coefficient for ùúíùëñùëñ , the evolving part of the long-run

growth rate (equation [5]). The estimated value of 0.73 indicates substantial persistence from

year to year. Note that the shock to ùúíùëñùëñ in equation (5) has a country-specific standard deviation,

ùëòùúéùëñ,ùë°‚àí1. This standard deviation is allowed to evolve over time in accordance with the model of

stochastic volatility, which is specified in terms of the variance, ùúéùëñùëñ2 . The parameter ùúåùúé is the

AR(1) coefficient for ùúéùëñùëñ2 (equation [6]). The estimated value of 0.96 indicates that volatility has


                                                 14
very high persistence from year to year. 5 The baseline volatility, corresponding to the mean

across countries of the œÉi, is 0.024.

          In key respects, our estimated parameters for the long-run risks, LRR, part of the model

accord with those presented by Bansal and Yaron (2004) and in an updated version, Bansal, Kiku,

and Yaron (2010). Our estimated ùúåùúí of 0.73 compares to their respective values of 0.78 and 0.74

(when their monthly values are converted into annual values).                                 Our estimated ùúåùúé of 0.96

compares to their respective values of 0.86 and 0.99. Our estimated mean œÉi of 0.024 compares

to their respective values of 0.027 and 0.025.

          The combination of the various parameters determines the size distribution of disasters

and recoveries. Simulations reveal that the mean negative cumulative effect of a disaster on a

country‚Äôs level of per capita consumption is 22%. This effect combines the first-year change

with those in subsequent years until the transition occurs from a disaster to a normal state. If we

condition on a disaster cumulating to at least 10%, the mean cumulative disaster size is 28%. 6

As a comparison, Barro and Urs√∫a (2008, Figure 1, p. 285) found a mean size of consumption

disaster of 22% when conditioning on disasters of 10% or more.

          In our present analysis, the mean recovery turns out to cumulate to 44% of the prior

decline. That is, on average, 56% of the fall in consumption during a disaster is permanent.

Recoveries were not considered in Barro and Urs√∫a (2008). In Nakamura, et al. (2013, p. 47),

the typical recovery is estimated at 48%.

          Because the estimated standard deviation of the permanent shocks, ùúéùúÇ , is large, 0.15,

there is a great deal of variation across disasters in the extent of recovery. In fact, simulations of


5
  The estimated value of k is 0.71. This parameter determines the standard deviation of the shock in equation (5) compared to that
in equation (4).
6
  In Nakamura, et al. (2013, p. 47), the effect of a ‚Äútypical disaster is approximately a 27 percent fall in consumption.‚Äù This
typical disaster should correspond roughly to our assessment of disasters that cumulate to contractions by at least 10%.

                                                               15
the estimated model indicate that 42 percent of disasters have recoveries that exceed 100%. That

is, the estimated long-run effects of many disasters are positive for the level of per capita

consumption.     One possible explanation is the long-term ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù effects of wars and

depressions on the quality of institutions, wealth distribution, and so on. However, the estimated

long-run level effect is negative in the majority of cases.

        B. Six illustrative countries

        Figures 2-7 illustrate the dynamics of the model by considering the time evolution of the

key variables for six illustrative countries: Chile, Germany, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, and

United States. These figures show the evolution of each country‚Äôs posterior mean of the disaster

state, ùêºùëñùëñ , the temporary disaster shock, ùêºùëñùëñ ùúôùëñùëñ , the permanent disaster shock, ùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ , the variable

part of the long-run growth rate, ùúíùëñùë° , and the stochastic volatility, ùúéùëñùëñ . This volatility is expressed

as a standard deviation and is multiplied by ten to be visible in the graphs. The other variables

are expressed as quantities per year.

        A general finding is that variables related to rare disasters behave very differently from

those related to long-run risks. The temporary and permanent disaster shocks, ùêºùëñùëñ ùúôùëñùëñ and ùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ ,

operate only on the rare occasions where the posterior mean of the disaster dummy variable, ùêºùëñùëñ ,

is high. For example, for Germany (Figure 3), the posterior disaster probability is close to one

during World War I and its aftermath (including the hyperinflation) and during World War II and

its aftermath. Similar patterns hold for Russia (Figure 5) and in a milder form for the United

Kingdom (Figure 6). For Japan (Figure 4), World War II is the main event. For the United

States (Figure 7), the prominent times of disaster are the Great Depression of the early 1930s and

the aftermath of World War I (possibly reflecting the Great Influenza Epidemic). Chile (Figure 2)

has a much greater frequency of disaster, notably following the Pinochet coup of 1973.



                                                   16
       Figures 2-7 show that the disaster periods feature sharply negative temporary shocks,

ùêºùëñùëñ ùúôùëñùëñ , and these are particularly large in the wartime periods for Germany, Japan, and Russia.

For the United States, the main temporary disaster shocks are for the early 1930s and just after

World War I.

       The figures show that the permanent disaster shocks, ùêºùëñùë° ùúÇùëñùëñ , are also often large in

magnitude during disaster periods. However, these shocks are much more diverse than the

temporary shocks and are often positive‚Äîfor example, in Germany during much of the 1920s

and 1947, in Japan in 1945, and in Russia in the early 1920s and in 1943, 1945, and 1946. These

occurrences of favorable permanent shocks may reflect improvements in a country‚Äôs prospects

for the coming post-war or post-financial-crisis environment. An interesting extension would

relate these measured permanent disaster shocks to observable variables, such as military

outcomes or institutional/legal changes.

       In our approach, the permanent disaster shocks are classified as a dimension of rare

disasters, rather than long-run risks. We use this terminology because the permanent shocks

under consideration, ùêºùëñùëñ ùúÇùëñùëñ , arise only during the unusual times when rare events are occurring.

Moreover, these events can usually be identified with clear historical events, such as the world

wars and the Great Depression.       However, these permanent shocks surely have long-term

implications for the economy‚Äôs level of consumption and are, in that sense, a ‚Äúlong-run risk.‚Äù

More broadly, we view rare disasters and long-run risks as complementary ideas, and our results

reflect the combination of these forces.

       In contrast to the disaster variables, the long-run-risk variables, ùúíùëñùëñ and ùúéùëñùëñ , exhibit much

smoother, low-frequency evolution, as shown in Figures 2-7. The variable ùúíùëñùëñ indicates the

excess of the projected growth rate of per capita consumption (over a persisting interval) from its



                                                 17
long-run mean, which averaged 0.020 per year across the countries in our sample. For the

United States (Figure 7), the estimated ùúíùëñùëñ exceeds 0.010 for 1962-67, 1971, 1982-85, and 1997-

98‚Äîrecent periods that are typically viewed as favorable for economic growth. At earlier times,

this variable exceeds 0.010 for 1933-36 (recovery from the Great Depression), 1898, and 1875-

79 (resumption of the gold standard). On the down side, the estimated ùúíùëñùëñ is negative and larger

than 0.010 in magnitude for 2007-09 (Great Recession), 1990, 1979, 1910-13, 1907, 1882-93,

1859-65, and 1852-55.

       For the other illustrative countries, the estimated ùúíùëñùëñ is particularly high in Chile for

1986-96, 2003-06, and 2009-11; in Germany for 1945-71; in Japan for 1945-72; in Russia for

1999-2011; and in the United Kingdom for 1983-88 and 1995-2002. Bad periods for ùúíùëñùëñ include

Russia in 1989-97 and the United Kingdom in 2007-11.

       The estimated stochastic volatility, gauged by the standard deviation, ùúéùëñùëñ , is even

smoother than the estimated ùúíùëñùëñ . In the figures, the United States, Germany, and Japan exhibit

the frequently mentioned pattern of moderation, whereby the estimated ùúéùëñùë° reached low points of

0.0115 for the United States in 2000, 0.0106 for Germany in 1995, and 0.0117 for Japan in 1999.

In all three cases, ùúéùëñùëñ ticked up going toward 2012. As a contrast, Russia experienced a sharp

rise in the estimated ùúéùëñùëñ from 0.0142 in 1973 to 0.0343 in 2007.


IV. Asset Pricing

       A. Framework

       The asset-pricing implications of the estimated model are analyzed following Mehra and

Prescott (1985), Nakamura, et al. (2013) (NSBU), and other studies. To delink the coefficient of

relative risk aversion, CRRA, from the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, IES, we assume

that the representative agent has Epstein-Zin (1989)-Weil (1990) or EZW preferences. For these

                                                18
preferences, Epstein and Zin (1989) show that the return on any asset satisfies the condition

                            ùê∂ùë°+1 ‚àíùúÉ(1‚àíùõæ)/(1‚àíùúÉ)    (ùúÉ‚àíùõæ)/(1‚àíùúÉ)
          ùê∏ùë° ÔøΩùõΩ (1‚àíùõæ)/(1‚àíùúÉ) ÔøΩ        ÔøΩ           ùëÖùë§,ùë°+1         ùëÖùëé,ùë°+1 ÔøΩ = 1,       (10)
                                ùê∂ùë°


where subjective discount factor = Œ≤, CRRA = Œ≥, IES = 1/Œ∏, ùëÖùëé,ùë°+1 is the gross return on asset ùëé

from ùë° to ùë° + 1, and ùëÖùë§,ùë°+1 is the corresponding gross return on overall wealth. Overall wealth

in our model equals the value of the equity claim on a country‚Äôs consumption (which

corresponds to GDP for a closed economy with no depreciable capital and no government sector).

       Since the model cannot be solved in closed form, we adopt a numerical method that

follows Nakamura, et al. (2013, p.56, n.26). Specifically, Equation (10) gives a recursive

formula for the price-dividend ratio (PDR) of the consumption claim, and the iteration procedure

finds the fixed point of the corresponding function. Then the pricing of other assets follows from

equation (10).

       To analyze the asset-pricing implications of the model, we need the parameter estimates

from Table 1, along with values of CRRA (Œ≥), IES (1/Œ∏), and the subjective discount factor (ùõΩ).

The macroeconomics and finance literature has debated appropriate values for the IES. For

example, Hall (1998) estimates the IES to be close to zero, Campbell (2003) and Guvenen (2009)

claim that it should be less than 1, Seo and Wachter (2015) assume that the IES equals 1, Bansal

and Yaron (2004) use a value of 1.5, and Barro (2009) adopts Gruber‚Äôs (2013) empirical analysis

to infer an IES of 2. Nakamura, et al. (2013) show that low IES values, such as IES < 1, are

inconsistent with the observed behavior of asset prices during consumption disasters. Moreover,

as stressed by Bansal and Yaron (2004), IES > 1 is needed to get the ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù sign (positive)

for the effect of a change in the expected growth rate on the price-dividend ratio for an unlevered

equity claim on consumption. Similarly, Barro (2009) notes that IES > 1 is required for greater

uncertainty to lower this price-dividend ratio. For these reasons, our main analysis follows


                                                 19
Gruber (2013) and Barro (2009) to use IES = 2 (Œ∏ = 0.5).

       We determine the values of ùõæ and ùõΩ to fit observed long-term averages of real rates of

return on corporate equity and short-term government bills (our proxy for risk-free claims).

Specifically, for 17 countries with long-term data, we found from an updating of Barro and

Urs√∫a (2008, Table 5) that the average (arithmetic) real rate of return was 7.90% per year on

levered equity and 0.75% per year on government bills. Hence, the average levered equity

premium was 7.15% per year. Therefore, we calibrate the model to fit a risk-free rate of 0.75%

per year and a levered equity premium of 7.15% per year (when we assume a corporate debt-

equity ratio of 0.5). It turns out that, to fit these observations, our main analysis requires Œ≥ = 5.9

and Œ≤ = 0.973.

       We follow Nakamura, et al. (2013) and Bansal and Yaron (2004) by making the crucial

assumption for asset pricing that the representative agent is aware contemporaneously of the

values of the underlying shocks. These random variables include the indicators for a world and

country-specific disaster state, the temporary and permanent shocks during disasters, the current

value of the long-run growth rate, and the current level of volatility.          We think that the

assumption of complete current information about these underlying shocks is highly unrealistic

and likely to make a large difference for the asset-pricing results.         Therefore, we think it

important to extend the asset-pricing analysis to allow for incomplete current information about

the underlying shocks.


       B. Empirical Evaluation

       Table 3, column 1, shows target values of various asset-pricing statistics. These targets

are the mean and standard deviation of the risk-free rate, ùëü ùëì , the rate of return on levered equity,



                                                  20
ùëü ùëí , and the equity premium, ùëü ùëí ‚àí ùëü ùëì ; the Sharpe ratio; 7 and the mean and standard deviation of

the dividend yield. These target statistics are inferred from averages in the cross-country panel

data described in the notes to Table 3.

          Table 3, column 2, refers to our baseline model, which combines rare events (RE) and

long-run risks (LRR). Given the parameter estimates from Table 1, along with IES = 1/Œ∏ = 2

(and a corporate debt-equity ratio of 0.5), the model turns out to require a coefficient of relative

risk aversion, Œ≥, of 5.9 and a subjective discount factor, Œ≤, of 0.973 to fit the target values of ùëü ùëì =

0.75% and ùëü ùëí ‚àí ùëü ùëì = 7.15%. Heuristically, we can think of Œ≥ as chosen to attain the target equity

premium, with Œ≤ selected to get the right overall level of rates of return.

          As comparisons, Barro and Urs√∫a (2008) and Barro and Jin (2011) required a coefficient

of relative risk aversion, Œ≥, of 3-4 to fit the target average equity premium. In these analyses, the

observed macroeconomic disasters were assumed to be fully permanent in terms of effects on the

level of per capita consumption. In Nakamura, et al. (2013), the required Œ≥ was higher‚Äîaround

6.4‚Äîmostly because the incorporation of post-disaster recoveries meant that observed disasters

had smaller effects on the equilibrium equity premium. A required Œ≥ of 6.4 seems unrealistically

high, and one motivation for the present analysis was that the incorporation of long-run risks

(LRR) into the rare-disaster framework might substantially reduce the required Œ≥. In fact, there is

only a modest reduction‚Äîto 5.9‚Äîand, therefore, the required degree of risk aversion still seems

unrealistically high. We discuss later alternative specifications that might produce reductions in

the required Œ≥.

          Table 3, column 2, shows that the baseline model substantially underestimates measures

of volatility. Specifically, the model‚Äôs predicted standard deviation of ùëü ùëí (0.096) is substantially


7
 This value is the ratio of the mean of ùëüùëí ‚àí ùëüùëì to its standard deviation.

                                                                  21
lower than that observed in the data (0.245 in column 1). We had thought that the incorporation

of long-run risks, especially stochastic volatility, would help to improve the model‚Äôs fit with

respect to the volatility of ùëü ùëí . 8 However, even with the LRR component included, this volatility

is substantially underestimated. We think that a major gap here is the omission of time-varying

disaster probability, p. We plan to make this extension, but the numerical analysis will be

substantially more complicated.

          The Sharpe ratio in the baseline model, 0.83 (column 2), is substantially higher than the

value 0.29 found in the data (column 1). However, this result is essentially a restatement of the

model‚Äôs understatement of the volatility of the return on equity (or of the equity premium). That

is, the values of Œ≥ and Œ≤ are determined to match the average equity premium, which is the

numerator of the Sharpe ratio. Then the Sharpe ratio is too high because the model‚Äôs estimated

volatility of the equity premium (the denominator of the ratio) is too low (when evaluated using

the specified Œ≥ and Œ≤). This finding of an excessive Sharpe ratio applies also to the models

considered next.

          The remaining columns of Table 3 divide up the baseline model‚Äîwhich incorporates the

rare events, RE, and long-run risks, LRR, pieces‚Äîinto individual contributions to the

explanations of means and volatilities of returns. In all cases, we retain the parameter estimates

for the consumption process from Table 1, along with IES = 1/Œ∏ = 2 (and a debt-equity ratio

of 0.5). We then recalculate for each case the values of Œ≥ and Œ≤ needed to match the observed

averages of 0.75% for ùëü ùëì and 7.15% for ùëü ùëí ‚àí ùëü ùëì . Given these tailored parameter values, each

model matches the target averages of ùëü ùëì and ùëü ùëí .

          Table 3, column 3 (RE only), shows results with the omission of the long-run risks, LRR,


8
 In contrast, the observed volatility of ùëü ùëì involves the impact of realized inflation on the real return on a nominally denominated
asset. This consideration is not present in the underlying real model.

                                                                 22
parts of the model. In this case, the value of Œ≥ has to be 6.4, rather than 5.9, for the model to

generate the observed average equity premium of 0.072. From this perspective, the inclusion of

LRR in the baseline model (column 2) generates moderate improvements in the results; that is,

the lower required value of Œ≥ seems more realistic. Viewed alternatively, if we retain the

baseline parameter values of Œ≥ = 5.9 and Œ≤ = 0.973, the model‚Äôs average equity premium would

fall from 0.072 (column 2) to 0.057 (column 3).

         With regard to the standard deviation of ùëü ùëí , the model with rare events only (column 3)

has a value of 0.086, whereas the model that incorporates LRR has the higher value of 0.096

(column 2). In this sense, the incorporation of LRR improves the results on volatility of equity

returns. However, as already noted, the standard deviation of ùëü ùëí in the baseline model (column 2)

still falls well below the observed value of 0.245 (column 1).

         Table 3, column 4 (LRR only), shows the results with the omission of the rare-events, RE,

parts; that is, with only the long-run-risk part, LRR, included. In this case, the value of Œ≥

required to fit the target mean equity premium of 0.072 is 18, an astronomical degree of risk

aversion. 9 Hence, the omission of the RE terms makes the model clearly unsatisfactory with

respect to explaining the average equity premium. Viewed alternatively, if we keep the baseline

parameter values of Œ≥ and Œ≤, the model‚Äôs average equity premium would fall from 0.072

(column 2) to 0.023 (column 4). With regard to the standard deviation of ùëü ùëí , the LRR only

model has a value of 0.074, below the values of 0.086 from the RE only model (column 3), 0.096

from the baseline model (column 2), and 0.245 in the data (column 1).

         Table 3, column 5, shows the effects from the omission of only the stochastic volatility

part of the long-run risks, LRR, model. In this case, the value of Œ≥ required to match the


Bansal and Yaron (2004) argued that a value of Œ≥ = 10 was sufficient, although that value is still much too high to be realistic.
9

Our results differ mostly because Bansal and Yaron incorporate high leverage in the relation between dividends and consumption.

                                                              23
observed average equity premium is 6.0, not much higher than the value 5.9 in the baseline

model (column 2). Alternatively, if we retain the baseline parameter values of Œ≥ and Œ≤, the

model‚Äôs average equity premium would fall only slightly from 0.072 (column 2) to 0.069

(column 5). Therefore, to the extent that the inclusion of LRR improves the fit with regard to the

equity premium, it is the evolution of the mean growth rate, not the fluctuation in the variance of

shocks to the growth rate, that matters. With regard to the standard deviation of ùëü ùëí , the value of

0.0963 in column 5 is very close to the value 0.0964 in the baseline model (column 2). In this

sense, the incorporation of stochastic volatility contributes negligibly to explaining the volatility

of equity returns.

       Column 6 of Table 3 corresponds to using only the permanent-shock part of the rare-

events, RE, model. In this case, the value of Œ≥ required to match the observed average equity

premium is 6.9, not too much higher than the value 6.4 in column 3. This result shows that the

main explanatory power of the RE model for the equity premium comes from the permanent

parts of rare events. Recall in this context that earlier analyses, such as Barro and Urs√∫a (2008)

and Barro and Jin (2011), assumed that all of the rare-event shocks had fully permanent effects

on the level of per capita consumption. Alternatively, if we keep the baseline parameter values

of Œ≥ and Œ≤, the model‚Äôs average equity premium falls from 0.057 in the full RE model (column 3)

to 0.045 (column 6). Hence, the exclusion of the temporary parts of RE shocks has only a

moderate impact on the model‚Äôs average equity premium.

        Table 4 shows how the results from the baseline model change with differences in the

coefficient of relative risk aversion, Œ≥, or the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, 1/Œ∏. Table 4,

column 1, has Œ≥ = 4, instead of the baseline value of 5.9. In other respects, the parameters are

unchanged from those in Table 3, column 2. The reduction in Œ≥ lowers the model‚Äôs average



                                                  24
equity premium from 0.072 (Table 3, column 2) to 0.031 (Table 4, column 1). Conversely,

Table 4, column 2, has Œ≥ = 10. This increase in Œ≥ raises the model‚Äôs average equity premium to

0.221. Therefore, the average equity premium is highly sensitive to the value of Œ≥.

           Table 4, column 3, has IES = 1/Œ∏ = 1.5, instead of the baseline value of 2.0. This change

lowers the model‚Äôs mean equity premium to 0.054. A further reduction in the IES to 1.1

(column 4) reduces the model‚Äôs average equity premium further, to 0.029. Therefore, changes in

the IES matter for the equity premium but, in a plausible range, not nearly as much as changes

in Œ≥. 10

V. Concluding Observations

           Rare events (RE) and long-run risks (LRR) are complementary approaches to

understanding asset-pricing patterns, including the averages of the risk-free rate and the equity

premium and the volatility of equity returns. We constructed a model with RE and LRR

components and estimated this joint model using long-term data on aggregate consumption for

42 economies. This estimation allows us to distinguish empirically the forces associated with

RE from those associated with LRR.

           Rare events (RE) typically associate with major historical episodes, such as the world

wars and the Great Depression and possibly the Great Influenza Epidemic. In addition to these

global forces, the data reveal many disasters that affected one or a few countries. The estimated

model determines the frequency and size distribution of macroeconomic disasters, including the

extent of eventual recovery. The distribution of recoveries is highly dispersed; that is, disasters

differ greatly in terms of the relative importance of temporary and permanent components.




10
  In a pure i.i.d. model, as in Barro (2009), the equity premium would not depend on the IES. The dependence on the IES arises
in our model because of the dynamics of disasters and recoveries. See Nakamura, et al. (2013) for discussion.

                                                              25
       In contrast to RE, the long-run risks (LRR) parts of the model reflect gradual and

evolving processes that apply particularly at a country level to changing long-run growth rates

and volatility. Some of these patterns relate to familiar notions about moderation and to times of

low or high expected growth rates.

       We applied the estimated time-series model of consumption to asset pricing. A match

between the model and observed average rates of return requires a coefficient of relative risk

aversion, Œ≥, around 6. Most of the explanation for the equity premium derives from the RE

components of the model, although the LRR parts make a moderate contribution. A shortcoming

of the results is that the required degree of risk aversion seems too high to be realistic. We think

that this feature of the model will improve if we allow for incomplete current information about

the nature of the underlying shocks. In particular, uncertainty about how much of a disaster will

turn out to be temporary versus permanent effectively fattens the tail of potential outcomes and

leads, thereby, to a reduction in the required value of Œ≥. Similarly, it seems important to allow

for gradual learning about shocks to the long-run growth rate and to volatility.

       We had thought that the addition of LRR to the RE framework would help to match the

observed volatility of equity returns. However, the joint model still substantially understates the

average volatility found in the data. We think that this aspect of the model will improve if we

allow for stochastic evolution of the probability or size distribution of disasters. We plan to

undertake this extension, although the required numerical analysis will be challenging.

*For Russia in the 1990s, the posterior disaster probability peaks at 0.14 in 1991. Using data on
GDP, rather than consumption, Russia clearly shows up as a macroeconomic disaster for much
of the 1990s.

Note: This table reports years in which the posterior mean of the rare-event dummy variable, Iit
for country i at time t, exceeds 0.25. See equation (3) in the text.

Notes: ùëü ùëì is the risk-free rate (proxied by real returns on short-term government bills), ùëü ùëí is the
real total rate of return on corporate equity, œÉ values are standard deviations, Sharpe ratio is the
ratio of mean ùëü ùëí ‚àí ùëü ùëì to ùúé(ùëü ùëí ‚àí ùëü ùëì ), and div. yield is the dividend yield. A debt-equity ratio of
0.5 is assumed in the calculations for each model.

Data are means over 17 countries (Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K., U.S., Chile, and India)
with long-term returns data, as described in Barro and Ursua (2008, Table 5) and updated to
2014. The main underlying source is Global Financial Data. For the dividend yield, the means
are for 8 countries with at least 90 years of data (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Sweden, U.K., and U.S.). These data are from Global Financial Data and updated through 2014.

The third- and second-to-last rows give the values of Œ≥ (coefficient of relative risk aversion) and
Œ≤ (discount factor) required in each model to match the observed average values of the risk-free
rate, ùëü ùëì , and the equity return, ùëü ùëí . RE & LRR is the baseline model, which includes all the
elements of rare events (RE) and long-run risks (LRR). The other columns give results with
various components eliminated. RE only eliminates the LRR parts. LRR only eliminates the RE
parts. RE & LRR, no stochastic vol. eliminates only the stochastic volatility part of LRR. RE
perm. shocks only eliminates everything except the permanent-shock part of RE.

The last row gives the average equity premium of each model when Œ≥ and Œ≤ take on their baseline
values, i.e., Œ≥ = 5.89 and Œ≤ = 0.973.

Appendix


A.1 Data used in this study
This study uses an enlarged version of the Barro-Urs√∫a macroeconomic data set (2010). The
original data set contains annual consumption series for 42 economies up to 2009, and we
expand it to 2012. This data set covers the major economies in the world: Argentina, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Singapore, Spain, Sri
Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, Uruguay, United States, and
Venezuela.

The availability of uninterrupted annual data varies across economies. To best utilize the rich
information contained in the data set, we adopt the longest possible uninterrupted series between
1851 and 2012 for each economy, yielding a total of 4814 country-year observations. We
choose 1851 as the starting date because it is the earliest year when uninterrupted data are
available for at least 10 countries. The reason for this criterion is that the model incorporates the
correlation in the timing of rare events across countries through a world event indicator, and it is
undesirable if this indicator is estimated from data for only a few countries. The ten countries
with uninterrupted data since 1851 are Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The data set used in this study
is much larger than those in previous studies. For example, the total number of country-year
observations explored in NSBU is 2685, and that number is almost doubled here.


A.2 Missing data at the beginning of series
When t = 1851, i.e., for the first year in the data, the value of ùêºùëä,ùë°‚àí1 is missing. In this case, we
use the proportion of world event years in all the years in the simulation to simulate the value of
ùêºùëä,ùë°‚àí1 and then simulate the value of ùêºùëä,ùë° based on the simulated ùêºùëä,ùë°‚àí1 and other information.

Let ùë°ùëñ0 denote the earliest date when uninterrupted consumption data are available for country i.
When ùë°=ùë°ùëñ0 , Formula (3) is not directly applicable, because ùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 is missing. Following the
idea of (3), we calculate the following prior conditional probability instead
  PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 = 1ÔøΩùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 ÔøΩ
=PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 = 1ÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 0, ùêºùëä,ùë°,0 ÔøΩ PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 0ÔøΩùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 ÔøΩ
+PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 = 1ÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 1, ùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 ÔøΩ PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 1ÔøΩùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 ÔøΩ                            (A.1)
    ùêºùëä,ùë°   1‚àíùêºùëä,ùë°                              ùêºùëä,ùë°        1‚àíùêºùëä,ùë°
= ùëû01 ùëñ0 ùëû00 ùëñ0 PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 0ÔøΩùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 ÔøΩ + ùëû11 ùëñ0 ùëû10 ùëñ0 PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 1ÔøΩùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 ÔøΩ.
For simplicity, we further assume
                             PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 1ÔøΩùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 ÔøΩ = Pr(ùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 1),
where the prior probability Pr(ùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 ‚àí1 = 1) is estimated by ùëûùëñ , the fraction of event periods in all
the periods studied for country i. So
                                         ùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 1‚àíùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0                  ùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 1‚àíùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0
               PrÔøΩùêºùëñ,ùë°ùëñ0 = 1ÔøΩùêºùëä,ùë°ùëñ0 ÔøΩ = ùëû01    ùëû00       (1     ‚àí ùëûùëñ ) + ùëû11    ùëû10       ùëûùëñ ,   (A.2)

                                                      39
and we impose the restriction that ùëûùëñ ‚àà (0, 0.3].

For other cases of missing data, we also specify reasonable prior distributions to improve the
estimation accuracy.


A.3 Prior distributions of parameters and unknown quantities
Bayesian MCMC has two major advantages in estimating the model here: (1) necessary
information can be incorporated into prior beliefs, and (2) it is relatively easy to implement for a
model as complicated as the one proposed in this study. The prior distributions of parameters
and unknown quantities in the proposed model are listed in detail here.

In this study, a prior being ‚Äúuninformative‚Äù means that the posterior distribution is proportional
to the likelihood. With an uninformative prior, the mode of the posterior distribution
corresponds to the maximum-likelihood estimate. A typical uninformative prior for a parameter
is the uniform distribution on an infinite interval (e.g., a half-line or the entire real line).
Extending that idea, we also say that the uniform distribution on a finite interval is uninformative
if the finite interval contains the parameter with probability 1. More generally, we say a prior
distribution is ‚Äúalmost uninformative‚Äù (or more rigorously, ‚Äúnot very informative‚Äù) if it is close
to a flat prior. In this study, the general guideline for the specification of priors is to make them
as uninformative as possible (in certain regions). Thus, many priors are taken to be uniform.

Prior distributions of parameters. In this study, ùúÇùëñùëñ is assumed to follow the normal
distribution ùëÅ(ùúÇ, ùúéùúÇ2 ) , and ùúôùëñùëñ is assumed to follow the truncated normal distribution
ùëáùëá(ùúô ‚ãÑ , ùúéùúô‚ãÑ2 ; ‚àí‚àû, 0) , where ùúô ‚ãÑ and ùúéùúô‚ãÑ2 denote the mean and variance, respectively, of the
underlying normal distribution (i.e., the normal distribution before truncation). The mean value
and standard deviation of ùúôùëñùëñ are denoted by ùúô and ùúéùúô , respectively. Another possible choice
for the prior distribution of ùúÇùëñùëñ and ùúôùëñùëñ is the exponential distribution. Corresponding to Barro
                           1
and Jin (2011), if ùëß ‚âú 1‚àíùëè ‚àº power law distribution with (upper-tail) exponent ùõº, where the
disaster size b is the fraction of contraction in C, then ùúâ ‚âú ‚àíln(ùëß) ‚àº exponential distribution
with rate parameter ùõº. This relationship suggests exponential distributions for ùúÇùëñùëñ and ùúôùëñùëñ .

The prior distribution of the long-term average growth rate ùúáùëñ of country i is assumed to follow
ùëÅ(0.02, 0.3 ‚ãÖ 0.012 ), where the prior mean and variance are set to the mean values of the long-
term average growth rates of per capita consumption and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the
42 economies in the enlarged Barro-Urs√∫a data set. (More specifically, the corresponding mean
value and standard deviation are 0.0189 and 3.16‚ãÖ10‚àí5, respectively.) As a summary, the prior
distributions of the parameters are listed in the following table.

Conditional prior distribution of event gaps. It is intuitive that event gaps will gradually
diminish if no events occur in a country. Based on this notion, we specify the conditional prior
distribution of ùëßùëñùëñ as follows. When ùêºùëñ,ùë° = 1, i.e., country i is in a rare event at time t, the prior
                                            2
distribution of ùëßùëñùëñ is assumed to be ùëÅ(0, ùúéùëß0 ). We take ùúéùëß0 = 2, which is very large, so the prior
is fairly uninformative on a region local to 0. If year t is the first uneventful year after a rare
event in country i, equation (7) becomes
                                       ùëßùëñùëñ = ùúåùëß ùëßùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 + ùúéùúàùúà ùúàùëñùëñ ,
which implies
                                                       2
                  ùëâùëâùëâ(ùëßùëñùëñ ) ‚â§ ÔøΩùúåùëß ‚ãÖ ùëÜùëÜÔøΩùëßùëñ,ùë°‚àí1 ÔøΩ + ùúéùúàùúà ÔøΩ ‚â§ (0.9 ‚ãÖ ùúéùëß0 + sup(ùúéùúàùúà ))2 ,
i.e.,
                           ùëÜùëÜ(ùëßùëñùëñ ) ‚â§ ùúéùëß1 ‚âú 0.9 ‚ãÖ ùúéùëß0 + sup(ùúéùúàùúà ) = 1.82,
where ‚ÄúSD‚Äù stands for ‚Äústandard deviation.‚Äù When year t is the mth uneventful year after the
most recent rare event in country i, the upper bound ùúéùëßùëß of ùëÜùëÜ(ùëßùëñùëñ ) can be calculated recursively,
                                                                        2
and we assume that the prior distribution of ùëßùëñùëñ follows ùëÅ(0, ùúéùëßùëß          ). 11 Note that the above
specification of prior distributions of event gap ùëßùëñùëñ is intuitive and is conditional on when the last
event before year t happens in country i.

Conditional prior distribution of potential consumption. Based on the prior distribution of
ùëßùëñùëñ , we derive the conditional prior distribution of ùë•ùëñùëñ as follows. According to equation (1), the
upper bound ùúéùë•ùë• of ùëÜùëÜ(ùë•ùëñùëñ ) satisfies
                              ùúéùë•ùë• ‚â§ ùúéùëßùëß + sup(ùúéùúÄùúÄ ) = ùúéùëßùëß + 0.15,
when year t is the mth (ùëö ‚â• 0) uneventful year after the most recent event in country i. We
define
                                         ùúéùë•ùë• ‚âú ùúéùëßùëß + 0.15
                                                               2
and assume that the prior distribution of ùë•ùëñùëñ is ùëÅ(ùëêùëñùëñ , ùúéùë•ùë•      ). Figure A.1 shows the standard
deviation ùúéùëßùëß (ùúéùë•ùë• ) of the prior distribution of ùëßùëñùëñ (ùë•ùëñùëñ ) as a function of m. As m goes to ‚àû, ùúéùëßùëß
(ùúéùë•ùë• ) is decreasing and converges to 0.2 (0.35), which is very large (based on economic
common sense). Therefore, the prior distributions of ùëßùëñùëñ and ùë•ùëñùëñ are fairly uninformative.




11
  Here, m = 0 indicates that country i is in a rare event. In the simulation, if no event happens in year ùë°ùëñ0 for
country i, a simple simulation using probability qi is implemented to determine the number m. (See Appendix A.1
for the meaning of qi.)

Non-negativity of ùùàùüêùíäùíä . The method for excluding negative values of ùúéùëñùëñ2 is similar to that
employed by Bansal and Yaron (2004). Instead of ‚Äúreplacing negative realizations with a very
small number,‚Äù we assume that the prior distribution of ùúéùëñùëñ2 follows the truncated normal
distribution
                               ùúéùëñùëñ2 ~ ùëáùëá ÔøΩùúéùëñùëñ2 , 0.00042 ; 10‚àí8 , 0.042 ÔøΩ.
This treatment is natural from the Bayesian point of view, and it is similar to that in Bansal and
Yaron (2004), as both methods are using (variants of) truncated normal distributions to exclude
possible negative realizations of ùúéùëñùëñ2 .


A.4 Estimation procedure
The model is estimated by the Bayesian MCMC method, which has been applied to many
problems in economics and finance, e.g., Chib, Nardari, and Shephard (2002); Pesaran,
Pettenuzzo, and Timmermann (2006); and Koop and Potter (2007). Specifically, we use the
algorithm of the Gibbs sampler for the random draws of parameters and unobserved quantities
(see Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin, 2004 for a discussion of the MCMC algorithms).

The convergence of the MCMC simulation is guaranteed under very general conditions. In order
to accurately estimate parameters and unknown quantities, we run four simulation chains, similar
to the procedure in NSBU (see Appendix A.5 for details of the specification of the four
simulation chains). Besides simulating multiple sequences with over-dispersed starting points
throughout the parameter space and visually evaluating the trace plots of parameters and
unknown quantities from the simulation, we also assess the convergence by comparing variation
‚Äúbetween‚Äù and ‚Äúwithin‚Äù simulated sequences (see Chapter 11 of Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and
Rubin [2004] for a discussion of this method).


                                                    42
After a half million iterations, the simulation results from the four sets of far-apart initial values
stabilize and become very close to each other. So we iterate each chain 2 million times and use
the later 1 million iterations to analyze the posterior distributions of parameters and unknown
quantities of interest. The first million iterations are dropped as burn-in.


A.5 Specification of four simulation chains
In order to accurately estimate the model and assess convergence, we run four independent
simulation chains in a way similar to that of NSBU. We specify two extreme scenarios: one is
called the ‚Äúno-event scenario,‚Äù the other the ‚Äúall-event scenario.‚Äù For the no-event scenario, we
set ùêºùëäùëä = 0, ùêºùëñùëñ = 0, ùë•ùëñùëñ = ùëêùëñùëñ , and ùëßùëñùëñ = 0 for all i and t. For the all-event scenario, we set
ùêºùëäùëä = 1 and ùêºùëñùëñ = 1 for all i and t and extract a smooth trend using the Hodrick-Prescott filter
(see Hodrick and Prescott [1997]). Let ùëêùëñùëñùúè denote the trend component and ùëêùëñùëñùëê the remainder, i.e.,

                                           ùëêùëñùëñùëê = ùëêùëñùëñ ‚àí ùëêùëñùëñùúè .
We then let

                        ùëßùëñùëñ = min(max( ‚àí0.5, ùëêùëñùëñùëê ), 0) and ùë•ùëñùëñ = ùëêùëñùëñ ‚àí ùëßùëñùëñ .

For each scenario, we specify two sets of initial values for parameters: one is called the ‚Äúlower
values,‚Äù the other the ‚Äúupper values.‚Äù For the set of ‚Äúlower values,‚Äù the initial parameter values
are either close to their lower bounds or very low compared to their mean values. For the ‚Äúupper
values,‚Äù we have the opposite situation. Thus, the four sets of initial values of parameters for the
four simulation chains are far apart from each other.
