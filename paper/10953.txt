Has the Unified Budget Undermined the Federal Government Trust Funds?

NBER Working Paper No. 10953
December 2004
JEL No. H0

                                           ABSTRACT

In order to ease the burden on workers during the retirement of the baby boom generation, the 1983

Social Security Reforms set payroll taxes above the level needed to pay current benefits, thus

partially prefunding the baby boomers' retirement. The military and civil service retirement programs

followed suit in the mid-1980s and switched from pay-as-you-go financing to funded systems. The

excess income generated by these retirement programs was held in the federal trust funds, which

have accumulated almost $3 trillion since the reforms took place. However, this paper presents

evidence that the trust fund build-up may not help future generations due to the adoption of the

Unified Budget in 1970. The Unified Budget includes trust fund receipts as income and trust fund

payments as expenditures. The empirical evidence suggests that attempts to balance the Unified

Budget while the trust funds were generating surpluses has led to increased government spending

and personal and corporation income tax cuts within the rest of the federal government. There is no

evidence of increased government saving as a result of the trust fund accumulations. An alternate

theory of increased national saving is also explored, where increased payroll taxes accompanied by

decreased income taxes induces higher personal saving. This mechanism, suggested by Diamond,

also does not appear to have significantly enhanced the wealth of future generations.

         Has the Unified Budget Undermined the Federal Government Trust Funds?
                            by Sita Nataraj and John B. Shoven


   I.      Introduction

   The 1983 Social Security Reforms (sometimes referred to as the Greenspan Commission

reforms) were the most sweeping in the almost 70 year history of the system. They were

made under the threat of an almost immediate inability to pay full benefits to Social Security

recipients (Schieber and Shoven, 1999). One of the key elements of the 1983 reforms

involved setting the Social Security payroll tax rates above the level required to pay current

benefits. That is, the Greenspan Commission’s plan was for Social Security to depart from

pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing and to partially prefund the retirement costs of the baby

boom generation. The idea was to offer some relief to the workers in the 2015 to 2050 period

in supporting the enormous retired population forecast for that period. By forcing workers in

1984-2015 to pay higher payroll taxes than required to finance current retirement benefits, the

hope was that workers in the 2016-2050 era could pay lower than PAYGO taxes. The trust

fund buildup and subsequent spend down would spread the burden of the retirements of baby

boomers over 65 years rather than 30 years and somewhat even out the tax burden faced by

different generations of workers.

        While Social Security represents the largest federal trust fund (the retirement and

disability programs combined were estimated to hold $1.63 trillion in assets at the end of

fiscal 2004), the federal government also maintains trust funds for Medicare, unemployment

insurance, civil service and military retirement, and transportation. The reform of Social

Security financing during the 1980s was accompanied by a move towards funding the military

and civil service retirement programs as well, again with the intent to relieve the tax burden



                                                                                                 2
on future generations. Overall, the annual surplus across all trust funds increased, in constant

2000 dollars, from $16.6 billion in 1980 to $147.9 billion in 1990. Clearly, the 1980s were a

decade of change with respect to the operation of federal government trust funds. The biggest

ones went from PAYGO financing to full or partial funding. As a result of the sustained

surpluses of the trust funds, they accumulated almost $3 trillion in assets between 1985 and

2004.

        Despite this success in building up the assets of the trust funds, it is not at all obvious

that the intended intergenerational burden sharing will take place. In order for the trust funds

to actually assist future generations of workers, they must increase national saving,

presumably by raising government saving. The only way to assist future workers is to leave

them more wealth. However, current federal budget policies treat the surplus of trust fund

revenues over expenditures, and the interest received by the trust funds, as part of the unified

surplus. The focus on balancing the unified surplus may serve as an invitation for the rest of

government (referred to as the federal funds) to offset the trust fund surplus through increased

government spending and the reduction in other taxes. Thus, the budget process may

undermine the attempt to raise government saving and build resources for future workers.

        Alternatively, the increased payroll tax that accompanied the attempt to partially

prefund Social Security, and to fund the military and civil service retirement programs,

conceivably could increase national saving without increasing government saving. The

mechanism for this was suggested by Diamond (2003). If the higher than PAYGO-required

payroll tax permitted an offsetting reduction of the personal income tax (and perhaps the

corporation income tax); the composition of tax revenues was changed. If the marginal

propensity to save out of the payroll tax is low relative to the marginal propensity to save out




                                                                                                      3
of personal income taxes, then private saving might increase as the country moved to the new

revenue mix. The idea is that the payroll tax is borne by relatively low income workers, at

least in comparison to those who bear the personal income tax, and that these lower income

workers have a marginal propensity to consume of approximately unity. The higher payroll

taxes might not depress saving, whereas the lower personal and corporate income taxes could

increase it.

        This paper examines whether the shift from PAYGO to partially funded Social

Security (and the corresponding shift in the funding of military and civil service retirement

plans) resulted in a shift in national saving. We know that the attempt to partially prefund

Social Security benefits and to fund military and civil service pensions will tend to enlarge the

unified surplus numbers ceteris peribus. However, if the larger unified surplus projections

permit additional government spending and tax reductions, the saving by the trust funds may

be partially or even completely offset by reductions in federal funds saving. We also explore

whether larger trust fund surpluses resulted in increased personal saving through the channel

suggested by Diamond (2003).

        Elmendorf and Liebman (2001), Smetters (2003), Burtless and Bosworth (2004), and

Shoven (2003) examine related questions. Our methodology is most closely related to that of

Smetters, who empirically demonstrates that increases in the off-budget (Social Security)

surplus tends to be associated with reductions in the on-budget (non-Social Security) surplus.

However, the Smetters study focuses only on Social Security surpluses: the surpluses of the

other trust funds are included in the on-budget surplus. Burtless and Bosworth (2004) extend

Smetters’ analysis to other developed countries, as well as to state governments. We extend

the analysis by examining the impact of increases in the aggregate surplus of all federal trust




                                                                                                  4
funds on saving by the rest of the government (the federal funds). We believe this is the

appropriate way to address the question of whether the government’s attempts to save via the

trust funds have been successful. Since the assets in several trust funds were increased

simultaneously during the 1980s, an analysis of on- and off-budget surpluses will tend to

attribute the impact of the civilian and military retirement funds to the Social Security trust

fund.

        Our primary result is that increases in the aggregate surplus of the trust funds are

offset – perhaps completely – by reductions in the federal funds surplus. In fact, using words

that sound more familiar, the trust fund surpluses result in enlarged deficits for the rest of the

government. We maintain that it is the existence of a unified budget that produces this offset.

Again confirming Smetters’ (2003) results, we show that prior to the adoption of a unified

budget in 1970, an increase in the surplus of the trust funds did not reduce saving by the rest

of the government. To hammer the point home, the government appears to have had the

ability to save before the advent of the unified budget, but has lost that ability since. The $3

trillion of assets in the trust funds represent the cumulated surpluses of their operations with

interest. However, the money has been spent or returned to taxpayers and not saved, at least

not by the federal government.

        We also do not find empirical support for the Diamond hypothesis that increasing the

payroll tax to build up the trust fund results in increased personal saving. While we believe

that this argument is theoretically sound, we conclude that the effect is empirically negligible.

Thus, efforts to build up the trust funds are at least partially offset (and quite likely completely

offset) by reductions in government saving elsewhere, while having no discernable effect on

personal saving.




                                                                                                     5
         One implication of this argument is discussed by Bosworth and Burtless (2004): if the

government is unable to increase saving by building up its trust funds, then a system of

individual accounts for Social Security – rather than centralized investment of the trust fund

in equities – is more likely to produce an increase in national saving (since individual

accounts would not be included in the federal budget). However, our analysis suggests that

individual accounts are not necessary to remedy the situation. All that is required is a shift in

emphasis to the federal funds surplus as a measure of the government budget balance. This

number is already calculated and reported; however, attempts to balance “the budget” have

focused almost exclusively on the unified surplus.

         This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the history behind the

adoption of the unified budget. Section III presents our econometric model and results

pertaining to government saving. Section IV presents our empirical analysis of the

relationship between trust fund surpluses and personal saving. Section V concludes.



   II.      The Unified Budget: A Historical Perspective

         The unified budget was adopted in 1970 based on the recommendation of the 1967

President’s Commission on Budget Concepts. The idea underlying the Commission’s

recommendation was that the unified budget provides the best measure of the macroeconomic

impact of the public sector. Prior to 1970, three different measures of the budget surplus

existed. One measure came from the National Income Accounts. The other two measures

were derived from the administrative budget (which excluded the trust funds) and the

consolidated cash budget (which included the trust funds). Fiscal policy tended to focus on

the administrative budget.




                                                                                                    6
       The goal of the President’s Commission was to reconcile these various measures and

arrive at an appropriate definition of the budget. Regarding the trust funds, the Commission

argued: “The surplus or deficit in the administrative budget is a misleading guide for

measuring the fiscal impact of the budget on the economy.” (President’s Commission 1967, p.

27) Thus, the Commission strongly recommended the use of a unified budget. Since 1970

the main policy focus has been on the unified budget surplus (Elmendorf and Liebman 2000),

although federal funds surplus figures are also computed and published. The federal funds

numbers tend to be buried in the fine print of the massive budget documents.

       Prior to the 1980s, the important trust funds operated largely on a PAYGO basis. As a

result, during this period, the choice of surplus measure – unified or federal funds - did not

matter much. However, a $200 billion per year gap between the federal funds and unified

surplus measures has opened up since 1985 – that is, the annual federal funds deficit is now

roughly $200 billion larger than the unified deficit commonly emphasized (Shoven 2003). A

widespread belief – based on the unified budget figures – is that the government ran large

surpluses in 1998-2001. However, the federal funds budget has consistently run deficits since

1969 (the single exception being a very small – $1.8 billion – surplus in 2000). Thus, the

large surpluses of 1998-2001 were a result of federal funds deficits being hidden by the trust

funds surpluses.

       Conventional economic wisdom suggests that the government should attempt to

balance the budget at full-employment. Attempts to implement this approach have tended to

focus on the unified budget. For example, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, which

attempted to force a reduction in the federal deficit during the 1980s, established targets for




                                                                                                  7
the unified budget only. Moreover, in public debate, references to “the surplus” typically

mean the unified surplus. For example, according to a CNN story published in 2000:

       The federal budget surplus for fiscal year 1999 was $122.7 billion and $69.2 billion
       for fiscal year 1998. Those back-to-back surpluses, the first since 1957, allowed the
       Treasury to pay down $138 billion in national debt (Wallace 2000).

More accurately, however, the total federal debt did not fall in either 1998 or 1999. The

publicly held debt fell because the government was using the trust funds surpluses to finance

its operations. This resulted in an increase in debt held by the trust funds, which more than

offset the reduction in the publicly held debt. Which is the correct measure of the federal

debt? As discussed by Shoven (2003), if the trust fund assets are to be viewed as “real” assets

in any meaningful sense, then government debt held in the trust funds represents a real

liability for taxpayers. That is, from an accounting perspective, the trust funds cannot be

treated as assets by the programs they finance unless a corresponding liability is

acknowledged. The unified surplus fails to acknowledge such a liability by treating the trust

funds’ net income as money that is available to spend on other programs or rebate to

taxpayers.

       In addition to its recommendation of a unified budget, the Commission also

emphasized the importance of issuing separate reports of the trust fund finances side-by-side

with the unified budget:

       In many instances, in fact, [the Commission] sees merit in earmarking specific
       revenue sources for well-defined programs of a long-run character. The need to
       respect the integrity of trust funds, and the requirements of control and accountability,
       in turn require the continued availability of trust fund receipt and expenditure figures
       separate from those of other funds. (President’s Commission 1967, p. 27)

Thus, the Commission allowed for the continued earmarking of funds for Social Security and

other programs. An important question is whether such earmarking matters in any real sense.




                                                                                                8
Earmarked funds can be spent by the Treasury without explicit authorization (CBO 2002). In

a political economy framework, the earmarking of funds does matter (see, e.g., Bos 2000,

Marsiliani and Renstrom 2000), and we would certainly expect the buildup of the trust funds

to have real effects on the government’s spending priorities. However, the question with

which this paper is concerned is whether, in the aggregate, the trust funds can be used as a

vehicle for government saving; if so, then the buildup in the trust funds during the 1980s can

achieve its purpose of relieving the burden on future generations.

       Smetters (2003) provides a useful summary of the various perspectives on this issue

with regard to the Social Security trust fund. The key criterion for determining whether the

trust funds represent a real government asset is whether an increase in the trust funds results

in a lower level of publicly held debt than there would have been otherwise. If so, they

represent real saving. Smetters finds empirical support for the perspective that the focus on

the unified budget invites the government to increase its non-Social Security spending

whenever the Social Security surplus increases.

       We agree with this perspective, and we extend Smetters’ analysis to include all the

trust funds. Attempts to save in the trust funds treat the trust funds as real government assets.

But this is inconsistent with the use of a unified budget because the unified surplus treats the

trust funds surplus as money that is currently available to spend, rather than money that has

been earmarked for saving. The picture that emerges from our empirical analysis is that the

trust funds surpluses during the 1980s gave the government more flexibility to increase other

spending and cut taxes while still meeting Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, or other unified budget

deficit targets. In other words, when the government focuses on balancing the unified budget,

attempts to save in the trust funds are undermined. The higher than necessary payroll taxes




                                                                                                   9
permit more spending and lower rates on other taxes, but they do not make future generations

wealthier.



   III.      Econometric Analysis

We use macroeconomic time-series data from 1949-2003 to estimate the relationship between

the surpluses in the trust funds and federal funds. Our dataset excludes the transition quarter

in 1976-77 when the government changed the fiscal year. Our current-dollar trust fund and

federal funds surplus data come from Historical Table 1.4 of the FY 2005 Budget of the U.S.

Government; we convert these into constant (2000) dollars using the GDP deflator. Figure 1

shows the real trust funds and federal funds surpluses from 1949 through 2009, with the 2004-

09 figures being the OMB projections from the 2005 U.S. Budget. It is clear from the figure

that increasing trust fund surpluses during the 1980s were accompanied by larger federal

funds deficits.

          In order to determine whether this relationship holds up under formal econometric

analysis, we estimate the following equation:

                            FFSURPt = α + β ⋅ TFSURPt + γ ⋅ X t + ε t

where

FFSURPt = Real Federal Funds surplus in year t

TFSURPt = Real Trust Fund surplus in year t.

X t = a vector of control variables.

ε t = an independent, identically distributed error term.

          In the regressions, we consider two alternative specifications of TFSURP and

FFSURP. First, we use the standard surplus measures discussed above and depicted in Figure


                                                                                              10
1. The standard measures count as trust fund revenue interest credited on the special-issue

government bonds held in the trust fund. The interest is paid by simply issuing more bonds to

the trust funds. These interest payments are treated as an expenditure in computing the

federal funds surplus. However, as discussed by Smetters (2003), this treatment of interest

payments may not be appropriate. The underlying theory suggests that if the trust funds earn

additional income from an excess of contributions over expenditures, this income is then

spent by the rest of the government. This argument does not, however, apply to interest

income the trust funds receive from the rest of the government. To address this issue, we

proceed analogously to Smetters and construct “modified” trust funds and federal funds

surpluses. The modified trust funds surplus is computed by subtracting interest received on

trust fund assets from our previous measure of the trust funds surplus; these interest payments

are then added to our previous measure of the federal funds surplus to obtain the modified

federal funds surplus.1 Both surplus measures are divided by real potential GDP in order to

reduce the possibility of heteroscedasticity.

           The coefficient of interest is β . If β is close to 0, this suggests that the government’s

attempts to save in the trust funds have been successful: an increase in trust fund saving does

not affect saving by the rest of the government. On the other hand, if β is negative, an

increase in trust fund saving is offset by dissaving by the rest of the government; in particular,

if β = −1 , then an increase in trust fund saving has no impact on overall government saving.

This econometric model is analogous to that of Smetters (2003), who estimates the

relationship between the surplus in the Social Security trust fund and the surplus in the rest of

the budget (including the other trust funds).

    The interest payment data were provided by Bob Kilpatrick of the Office of Management and Budget on May



                                                                                                          11
        Our control variables include the ratio of actual to potential GDP, the ratios of real

capped and uncapped wages to potential GDP, the nominal interest rate paid on the special-

issue Treasury bonds held by the Social Security trust fund, and a quadratic time trend. Our

potential GDP data come from January 2004 Congressional Budget Office calculations, and

take into account factors such as the potential labor force and potential total factor

productivity. The potential GDP measure is adjusted for inflation using a factor provided by

the CBO; the actual GDP measure is adjusted for inflation using the GDP deflator. The ratio

controls for the fact that business cycle fluctuations are likely to have an impact on both the

federal funds and the trust funds surpluses.

        The capped wage measure comes from the Social Security Administrations’ Annual

Statistical Supplement (Table 4.B1), and the uncapped wage measure from the National

Income and Product Accounts (Table 2.1). We adjust both measures for inflation using the

GDP deflator. Capped wages are not available for 1949 and 2003, so we impute these

amounts by assuming that the ratio of capped to uncapped wages was the same as in the

adjacent year. These two variables are intended to capture the impact of a mean-preserving

spread in wages on Social Security payroll tax receipts. Since the payroll tax is regressive, a

mean-preserving spread in wages is likely to reduce the trust funds surplus by lowering

payroll tax revenue; it is also likely to increase the federal funds surplus through the

progressive income tax. Therefore, omitting these two variables might lead to a downward

bias in the estimate of β .

        The nominal special-issue interest rate data are from the Social Security

Administration. In each year, this variable is computed as the average of the 12 monthly

interest rates on new issues during the year. Including this variable is important for the


25, 2004.

                                                                                                  12
specifications that use the standard surplus measure. Because interest payments flow from the

federal funds to the trust funds, an increase in the nominal interest rate will increase the

standard measure of the trust funds surplus and reduce the standard measure of the federal

funds surplus. Therefore, the omission of this variable will tend to bias β downwards. Since

this issue does not arise with the modified surplus measures, the interest rate variable is not

included in these specifications. 2

        For each specification, we test for heteroscedasticity using the Breush-Pagan score test

against multiplicative heteroscedasticity. We also test for serial correlation in the error terms

using Durbin’s alternative test, in which the residuals from the original regression are

regressed on their lagged values (up to three lags) and all the independent variables. The p-

value for each of these tests (against the null hypothesis of no serial correlation or

heteroscedasticity) is reported in the results table for each specification. Our tests indicate

evidence of heteroscedasticity and first or second order serial correlation in several of the

specifications. The reader should note, however, that our test for heteroscedasticity is not

robust to the presence of serial correlation; thus, the heteroscedasticity test results may not be

valid for the specifications in which serial correlation is present. On the other hand, our serial

correlation test results are robust to heteroscedasticity because we use a heteroscedasticity-

robust estimate of the variance-covariance matrix for the test equations.3 To address the

potential presence of heteroscedasticity and serial correlation, we report Newey-West

standard errors with a lag of two periods.4

nominal interest rate.

 One guideline for determining the lag for computing Newey-West standard errors is the integer portion of n 4 ,
where n is the sample size (see Wooldrige 2002, p. 397). In our case, this guideline implies a lag of two
periods.


                                                                                                                13
       Our baseline results are reported in Table 1. In all of our specifications, the coefficient

on the trust funds surplus variable is negative and statistically significant at the 5 percent

level. Adding covered and uncovered wages does lower the magnitude of the coefficient, but

by a relatively small amount. The coefficient on the nominal interest rate is positive

(unexpectedly) but not statistically significant; its inclusion barely changes the coefficient on

the trust funds surplus. Our preferred specifications are the ones that include the full set of

controls (the last two columns in the table); even though the interest rate coefficient has an

unexpected sign and is not statistically significant, we believe that theory strongly supports its

inclusion in the standard surplus measure regression. These specifications suggest that a $1

increase in the trust funds surplus reduces the federal funds surplus by $1.54 (for the standard

measures) or $1.44 (for the modified measures). Both estimates are significantly different

from zero and not significantly different from 1. A 95 percent confidence interval for the

magnitude of the coefficient is .56 to 2.53 for the standard measures and .49 and 2.41 for the

modified measures. Even the lower end of both confidence intervals implies an offset that is

economically significant. Thus, our results suggest that an increase in government saving via

the trust funds is at least partially – and perhaps completely – offset by a decrease in

government saving outside of the trust funds.

       It is worth mentioning that our point estimates of the coefficient on the trust fund

variable differ considerably from those obtained by Smetters (2003). Smetters estimates that

a $1 increase in the Social Security surplus reduces the on-budget surplus by $2.76; this

estimate is statistically greater than 1, implying that an increase in off-budget saving actually

reduces overall government saving. A possible explanation for this difference is that the

government attempted to build up several trust funds simultaneously during the 1980s. Thus,




                                                                                                  14
the coefficient of the off-budget surplus is likely to pick up some of the impact of the other

trust funds.

        As discussed above, the unified budget was adopted in 1970. We have argued that it

is the focus on balancing the unified budget that gives rise to the government’s inability to

save in the trust funds. Thus, it is reasonable to split our time series into two periods – 1949-

1969 and 1970-2003 – and re-run our regressions. Theory predicts that the coefficient of the

trust funds surplus variable should be close to zero prior to the adoption of the unified budget

and negative afterwards. The split-sample regression results are reported in tables 2 and 3.

        As can be seen from Tables 2 and 3, the estimate of β over the 1970-2003 period is

negative and statistically significant; in this case, it is also significantly greater than 1 in

magnitude. However, in the pre-1970 period, the point estimates of β are not significantly

different from zero. This confirms our argument that the adoption of the unified surplus is the

factor that hinders the government’s ability to save in the trust funds. Smetters (2003) finds

the same qualitative result (no relationship pre-1970 and an inverse relationship post-1970)

for the on- and off-budget surpluses.

        Overall, our results suggest that government saving has not increased despite the

almost $3 trillion accumulated in trust funds since 1985. Future generations may have lower

payroll taxes than they otherwise would have, but they will not have more resources. They

themselves will have to finance their lower payroll taxes with higher income taxes (or lower

government spending). The intergenerational burden sharing envisioned by the Greenspan

Commission has been thwarted.

        Similar results emerge from cross country analysis. Bosworth and Burtless (2004)

estimate similar regressions for OECD countries and show that increases in Social Security



                                                                                                   15
trust fund surpluses are at least partially offset by reduced surpluses in the rest of the

government. Since these countries use unified budgets, this result is as expected. Bosworth

and Burtless also show that at the state level in the U.S., surpluses in employees’ retirement

trust funds are not offset by reductions in saving by the rest of the government. One

explanation they propose is that, unlike national governments, state governments use a system

of accrual accounting under which pension funds are kept separate from the rest of the budget.

       The issue regarding whether the unified budget affected the legitimacy of the trust

funds can be looked at another way. Consider a counterfactual situation where the excess

payroll tax receipts were used to fund individual accounts rather than to purchase government

bonds. In fact, to make the two cases almost identical, consider what would happen if the

individual accounts were 100% invested in U.S. government bonds. At first glance, the

money available to the rest of the government would be unchanged. However, the funding of

individual accounts would almost certainly be treated as an expense. The interest payments

on the government bonds in the individual accounts would also be treated as an expense. The

budget surplus would be lower by the amount of the cash flow surplus in social security and

the other trust funds (the new deposits into accounts) and the interest payments received on

existing bonds. That is, the surplus would have switched from what we now calculate as the

unified surplus to the much lower federal funds surplus. The saving in individual accounts

would not be treated as part of the surplus and thus less likely spent by the rest of government.

However, this accounting change could be adopted without individual accounts; what would

be required is separating the trust fund accounts from the rest of the budget and reporting the

federal funds budget as the primary assessment of the government budget and the target for

balancing at full employment.

   IV.      Trust Fund Accumulations and Personal Saving

         As discussed above, an increase in the trust funds surplus can raise national saving by

raising personal saving (Diamond 2003). According to this argument, increases in the

(regressive) payroll tax disproportionately affect low-income individuals, who tend to be

liquidity constrained. To the extent that the resulting trust funds surpluses are used to finance

income or other tax cuts, which disproportionately affect non-liquidity higher-income

individuals, they will tend to raise personal saving. This follows from the fact that higher-

income individuals – who tend not to be liquidity constrained – have a higher marginal

propensity to save out of disposable income than the liquidity-constrained poor. Historically,

most of the increases in the trust funds have resulted from increases in the payroll tax. Thus,

to test for the “Diamond effect,” we regress the National Income and Product Accounts

measure of personal saving on the trust funds surpluses and our other macroeconomic control

variables. The results from various specifications of this regression are reported in Table 4.

         The specifications that include all the controls suggest that a $1 increase in the trust

funds surplus may increase personal saving by between 56 and 66 cents. However, the

relevant coefficient is only statistically significant at the 5 percent level when using the

modified trust funds surplus measure. Given the sensitivity of the coefficient estimate across

our specifications, we conclude that we do not see strong evidence for the economic

significance of the Diamond effect.




                                                                                                    17
   V.      Conclusions

        The issues that this paper deals with are clearly important. The primary issue is

whether the assets in the federal trust funds will help future generations of workers finance the

retirements of the baby boom generation. Has the governmental policy of building up these

trust funds succeeded in transferring resources to the next generation of workers?

Unfortunately, the evidence of this paper suggests that the answer is “no.” Our empirical

analysis is consistent with the idea that the focus on the unified federal budget has

undermined the wealth accumulation aspect of the trust funds. The surplus revenues that the

trust funds have turned over to the rest of the government have been spent and not saved. As

a result, no extra wealth has been accumulated.

        If the focus had been on balancing the federal funds budget instead of the unified

budget and if the government had been equally successful with that balancing, the total debt

of the government and the publicly held debt would have been $3 trillion lower. Future

generations would have been $3 trillion wealthier and the vision of the Greenspan

Commission would have been at least partially fulfilled. Of course, the focusing on the

federal funds budget would have revealed a number of things. First, the large surpluses that

we enjoyed in 1998-2000 never really existed, at least according to the federal funds accounts.

Second, the 2004 budget deficit is roughly $200 billion higher than reported and, third, the tax

cuts, which may have been necessary for business cycle reasons, were not merely a rebate of

sizable surpluses.

        There is considerable debate as to whether the crisis in the financing of Social Security

occurs in roughly 2017 when payroll tax receipts are insufficient to finance benefits or in the

2040s when the Social Security trust funds are projected to be exhausted. From the




                                                                                               18
perspective of Social Security, the trust fund does represent real claims on the rest of the

government. Thus, the presence of the trust fund may prolong the life of Social Security

beyond the date at which tax receipts fall short of benefits payments. However, from the

perspective of future generations of workers, the trust funds do not represent incremental

wealth. Even if Social Security’s life is lengthened, workers 15 years from now will have to

pay off the obligations in the trust fund through increases in other taxes and cuts in other

government services. The trust funds themselves do not provide any assistance to future

generations of workers in coping with the inadequate income of Social Security to pay the

legislated benefits.
