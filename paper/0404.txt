                  The Investment Tax   Credit:   n Evaluation



                                   ABSTRACT


       Since   1954, the United States government has made numerous

adjustments in the tax     treatment   of corporate income with the aim

of influencing the level ani composition of fixed business investment.

The effects of these reforms, principally changes in the investment

tax credit, are evaluated using a macro—econometric model. We find

little evidence that the investment tax credit is an         effective   fiscal

policy   tool. Changes in    the credit have tended to destabilize the

economy,   and have yielded much less stimulus     per dollar of revenue

loss   than has   previously been assumed. The crowding out of

"non—favored"     investment has been sufficient to offset a large
percentage of the increase in the stock of equipment resulting from
the use of the credit. We are led to conclude that the reliance
on the investment tax credit and other investment tax incentives

should be reduced. If a credit is to be maintained, it is of the

utmost importance that its effect on all sectors of the economy

be considered. We analyse several possible neutrality criteria,

but conclude that no simple     rule   can guide the optimal structuring

of incentives.

I.   Introduction


      Since 1954, the U.S. government has made numerous adjustments

in the tax treatment of corporate income with the aim of influencing

the level and composition of business activity and, more specifically,

fixed capital investment. Although it comprises less than 1OZ of

gross national product,1 private investment in nonresidential

structures and equipment is considered a crucial determinant of

the dynamic behavior of the economy. There are two important reasons

for this. First, the level of production potentially available to

the economy in any given year depends on the size of the capital

stock, which is determined by the level of investment in the years

preceding. A prolonged period during which capital investment is

depressed may greatly reduce potential output. A second reason

for concern is that investment is more volatile than other components

of output.2 Since current investments affect a firm's output

capability many years hence, expectations of future demand conditions

and interest rates may have a large impact on the level of investment

today. Because the planned purchases of investment goods may be

postponed or speeded up, the instability of these expectations implies

that the demand for such goods may be subject to swings which, through
                                                                      2




effects on employment, feed back through the rest of the economy.

        Changes in the corporate tax structure designed to encourage

investment, generally referred to as tax Incentives, operate chiefly

by altering the profitability of given investment projects. Some

channels available for tax incentives are:

        Accelerated Depreciation. Over the life of a capital good,

firms are permitted to deduct a fraction of its purchase price each

year in calculating taxable income. Such deductions, referred to

as depreciation allowances, are meant to account for the asset's

annual decline in value. A deduction scheme which accurately mirrors

this decline is referred to as "economic depreciation." To the extent

that allowances in the years immediately following the asset's

acquisition exceed its true loss in value, the depreciation schedule

is "accelerated." By increasing the degree of acceleration,

government is, in effect, making an interest—free loan to the

corporate taxpayer. The greater the loan, the more attractive the

investment.

        Shortened Depreciation Lifetime. Effectively equivalent to

accelerated depreciation, measures which shorten the period over

which depreciation schedules are applied allow depreciation deducations

to be used more quickly after an asset's purchase.

        Investment Tax Credit. This measure permits a diminution of

tax   liability   equal to a certain fraction of capital investment

expenditures, subject to certain restrictions concerning the type

of investment eligible and the total amount of credit claimed.
                                                                   3




The effect of the credit is to lower the real cost of capital goods

to firms, without altering the returns from such capital. This

clearly increases the rate of return on investment.

      Investment Grant. Never instituted in the U.S., this measure

has been used in Great Britain and often suggested as an alternative

to the investment tax credit. It provides for a direct government

rebate to firms of a certain fraction of investment expenditures.

It therefore differs from a tax credit in that it is not restricted

to profitable enterprises with tax liabilities. This difference

may be deemed a weakness of the grant approach if government sees

the lack of current profits as indicative of inefficient operation

which should not be subsidized.

      Corporate Tax Cut. Seemingly the most obvious approach to

stimulating investment expenditures, a cut in the statutory tax rate

may actually discourage new investment when it occurs in the presence

of accelerated depreciation. This anomalous result is possible

because the tax savings from such excess deductions are reduced

when the tax rate is lowered, so that the effective rate of tax paid

by the firm may rise. Because interest payments are shielded from

corporate taxation, such an outcome is more likely to occur in a

highly levered firm, where savings on taxable profits are low relative

to the scale of operation.3

     A more certain disadvantage of a corporate tax cut is that

it applies to Income from all corporate assets, and so is likely

to be less cost—effective than, for example, a tax credit, which

subsidizes only new investment.

      Except for the investment grant, all of the above incentives

have been in effect for at least part of the period between 1954

and the present. As of 1954, the maximum marginal corporate tax

rate was 52%, and straight—line depreciation was essentially the

only method permitted for tax purposes. The Revenue Act of 1954

allowed firms to choose between straight—line and two other methods

of depreciation, known as sum—of—the—years digits and double—declining

balance. Both of the last two methods are more favorable to the

firm than straight—line in that they accelerate depreciation

allowances and thereby increase the present values of such allowances.

      In 1962, two additional measures were enacted to further

stimulate investment. First, lifetimes allowable for depreciation

were shortened for equipment by the introduction of more liberal

guidelines. Second, and more important, was the institution by the

Revenue Act of 1962 of the investment tax credit at a rate of 7%

of equipment purchases. The credit was accompanied by an appropriate

adjustment of the depreciation base, so that only the net cost of

assets could be depreciated. This provision, known as the Long

Amendment, was repealed by the Revenue Act of 1964, making the credit

even more generous. Also included in the act was a cut in the maximum

statutory corporate tax rate from 52% to 50% in 1964 and 48% starting

in 1965. As stated above, this policy cannot be viewed with certainty

as expansionary. The corporate tax was raised again, temporarily,

by the 10% tax surcharge which took effect in 1968, raising the

statutory rate to 52.8%. All but one fourth of the surcharge was

removed in 1970, the remainder in 1971.
                                                                   5




      By 1966, the economy was operating at unemployment rates of

under 4%, and measures were sought to restrain aggregate demand.

One of these was the suspension of the investment tax credit in

October, 1966. Although the suspension was originally to hold until

December 1967, it was removed in March, so that it was in effect

less than five months. Concurrent with the 1966 suspension was a

change in one of the depreciation options allowed for structures.

The double—declining balance method was replaced by the 150% declining

balance method. This change lessened the degree of acceleration

in depreciation allowances for structures. The credit remained in

effect until 1969, when it was repealed, again ostensibly permanently.

This situation lasted until the passage of the Revenue Act of 1971,

which reinstated the credit. Also introduced in the Revenue Act

was the "asset depreciation range" (ADR) which allowed firms to

raise or lower lifetimes used in depreciation calculations up to 20%,

for equipment.

      Because of the recession experienced beginning in 1974,

stimulative measures were desired, and included in the Tax Reduction

Act of 1975 was a "temporary" increase in the maximum rate of the

tax credit from 7% to 10%. This increase has already been extended

through 1980 by the Tax Reform Act of 1976, and proposals have been

made to make it permanent.

      Despite the frequent use of various investment incentives in

recent years, uncertainty remains about the best way to use such

policy tools. Indeed, it is problematic whether such. instruments

                                                                   6




should, be used at all. Even if they are to be used, unresolved

questions still remain, and fall into two categories: how to apply

the incentive, and when to apply it. The first type of question

is often associated with the concept known as neutrality. It is

argued that incentives should, naturally, encourage investment,

but should not bias the relative choice between investments. There

have been conflicting notions of what measures achieve neutrality,

the controversy arising in part from the imprecise nature of the

concept.

      The choise of when to apply tax incentives is an extremely

difficult one. The closer the economy is to what is referred to

as "full employment,"4 the less effect an incentive will have.

When most available resources are already in use, encouraging firms

to invest more will merely lead to higher interest rates and a

"crowding out" of other, non—subsidized investment sectors such as

residential housing and, to a lesser extent, the purchase of consumer

durables such as automobiles. Thus, incentives will be most effective

when there is sufficient slackness in the economy for expansion to

occur. This leads to two problems for the policy maker. First,

lags in the institution of an e.xpansionary policy may cause the

incentive to occur at the wrong time. There is evidence that this

was often true for past incentives.5 Second, by changing the

incentive over time, the government may actually induce cycles in

investment behavior and thereby further destabilize the dynamic path

of the economy.

      We consider the above issues in the following sections of

this paper. In the next section, we discuss neutrality and related

issues. In Section III, we present dynamic simulations of a

large—scale econometric model to illustrate the effects of various

policies with respect to the investment tax credit. Section IV

contains a brief discussion of how the temporary nature of incentives

may, when perceived by investors, further complicate the problem.

We draw some conclusions in the final section.




II. Neutrality and Incentive Design6


      Investment incentives are instituted when there is felt to

be insufficient investment. However, there is a general perception

that it is best not to disturb the relative incentives given to

different investments, that the expansion should be "neutral."

Because different criteria have been used to measure neutrality,

conflicting prescriptions have appeared as to which policies are

neutral. There are two particular conceptions of what constitutes

a neutral incentive, but each is subject to fundamental criticisms.

In the end, the policy maker must weigh the costs of violating the

different measures in order to come up with the system of incentives

most appropriate for a particular situation.

     One of the important considerations In implementing an

expansionary policy is the effect it will have on the rate of price

inflation. As aggregate demand increases as a result of expansionary
                                                                   8




 stimuli, different sectors must adjust to meet this demand. The

 more unbalanced this increase is, the more likely are bottlenecks

 and shortages to occur in strategic sectors. These dislocations

will not only hamper the expansion. They will also lead to a rise

 in the prices of the scarce goods, causing an increase in the overall

rate of inflation. This point has been recognized by government:

      In an effort to achieve continued progress toward full
      employment, we must not create inherently unstable and
      ultimately counterproductive conditions along the way.
      With a high inflation rate and many uncertainties still
      remaining- to hamper the economy, stimulus which aims
      for a balanced composition of demand and a steady
      will provide the safest and surest path of advance.pce

Several authors8 have described as neutral a tax incentive scheme

which induces a proportional reduction in what is known as the

"implicit rental cost" of different types of capital goods used by

corporations. Under rather general assumptions, such a policy will

lead to a balanced expansion of corporate capital investment. Assuming

that this expansionary policy does not lead to a rise in interest

rates, this kind of neutrality may be achieved by the institution

of a uniform investment tax credit on all investment, with an

adjustment to the depreciable base, as mandated under the Long

Amendment, equal to the amount of the credit.

      However, it is likely that interest rates will rise a certain

amount (see footnote 17). If they do, then neutrality in the above

sense would require the credit to be larger for longer—lived assets,

with the rate of increase being determined by the extent of the rise.

Furthermore, if, as in the U.S. there is a preexisting credit, the
                                                                9




foregoing analysis applies to changes in the level of the credit,

rather than to the level itself.

     Along with the desirability of a balanced expansion, economic

efficiency looms as a major consideration In incentive construction.

This concept dictates that it is generally in the public interest

that resources should be invested in those projects yielding the

greatest social return.9 Were there no corporate taxes, the social

return from a project would accure entirely to the investing firm.

Thus, it would be in the best interests of each firm to choose those

projects most profitable from the social viewpoint. In a system

with corporate taxation, the private and social returns from a project

are different because part of the social return is taken by government

in the form of taxes. It is desirable that projects that are preferred

from the social point of view are also more profitable to the firm

making the investment choice. In particular, if project A has a

higher social return than project B, the prospective profitability

of A should be h igher from the firm's point of view as well.

     This has been the motivation behind the second major approach

to neutrality)0 What is advocated is a tax system which

proportionally changes the private internal rate of return on different

investments. When no investment credit is present, the existence

of this condition depends on the structure of depreciation allowances.

If depreciation allowances correspond to "economic depreciation"

(see Section I), then two assets which would have the same social

rate of return were there no taxes would be of equal profitability
                                                                    10




 in the presence of them.11 There is no evidence that the currently

 used depreciation schedules bear any close resemblance to economic

 depreciation. Even if the depreciation allowances were appropriate,

 they are based on original cost and not replacement value. Thus,

 the real value of such tax deductions declines when there is an

 increase in the rate of inflation, with short—lived assets being

hit the hardest.

      Because of inflation, and because depreciation allowances tend

to be more accelerated for longer lived assets even in the absence

of inflation, the tax system, without the investment tax credit,

is currently biased toward investments in more durable assets.

Given the circumstances, how should the investment tax credit be

designed? The introduction of a uniform tax credit raises the

internal rate of return on all investments. However, a uniform

credit will generally favor those investments which are less durable.

To demonstrate this, we present a simple example.

      Consider a firm with two projects. In Project A, a machine

is purchased at the outset for $100, and yields a perpetual stream

of annual $10 receipts, after taxes. Project B also begins with

the purchase of a machine for $100. However, this machine lasts

only one year, yielding $110 after taxes. Of these receipts, $100

is spent on a new machine of the same type. This procedure is

repeated every year, giving an infinite stream of $10 per year,

just as in Project A. Now, suppose a 5% investment tax credit is

enacted. Since Project A entails no new purchases, its receipt




                      V
                                                                       11




    stream is unaffected. However, since $100 is annually spent on

    new machines in Project B, $5 is added to annual receipts. Whereas

    A and B were previously equally profitable, B now has a higher rate

    of return for the firm.
a


          If   the existing tax system were neutral, in the present sense,

    without a tax credit, the maintenance of neutrality in the presence

    of a tax credit would thus call for a smaller credit for less durable

    assets. In the present system, the answer is less simple. In

    Table 1, we illustrate this by comparing the internal rates of return

    on two different hypothetical assets, one with a service life of

    ten years, one of thirty years. Each asset is assumed to provide

    receipts, before taxes, which decline at a rate of l/T per year,

    where T is the service life, and then drop to zero in year T.

    Depreciation allowances are assumed to follow the sum—of—the—years—

    digits method. We take both assets to have an internal rate of

    return of l27 in the absence of all taxes.

          The results confirm the argument stated above. With the

    introduction of the current tax system without the investment tax

    credit, the more durable asset has a higher rate of return when

    inflation is zero, 7.2% versus 6.8%. With an inflation rate of 6%,

    this bias is increased, with the rate of return on the thirty—year

    asset being almost three times that on the ten—year asset. The

    introduction of a uniform 10% credit raises the return on the shorter

    lived asset substantially more. However, the total bias of the tax

    system remains uncertain, and depends on the rate of inflation.

At a zero rate of inflation, the bias remains in favor of the more

durable asset. In this case, a neutral credit would decrease with

asset life.

      Added to the limitation of the two approaches to neutrality

discussion in this section is the fact that they treat the corporate

sector in isolation. Various gross distortions exist In the tax

treatment of non—corporate investment, especially owner—occupied

housing.12 Removing biases among the choice of assets within the

corporate sector, while ignoring those between sectors, need not

even constitute a step in the right direction. Even if it does,

no one simple rule of thumb is likely to yield the best policy,

given the complexities of existing tax provisions such as a selective

tax credit, the acceleration of depreciation allowances, and the

failure to index such allowances for inflation.




III. Dynamic Simulations


      This section attempts an empirical evaluation of investment

incentives—— principally the investment tax credit. The discussion

focuses on the two main rationales offered for the use of investment

incentives. We first consider the impact of the investment tax

credit on the size and composition of the capital stock. Our results

suggest that further increasing the tax credit is not likely to

significantly increase the capital stock in the long run. Rather

the primary effect of credit hikes is to alter the composition of
                                                                    14




 the capital stock. Next, the viability of the tax credit as an

 instrument of countercyclical fiscal policy is assessed. We find

 that the credit is not a good stabilization tool. The long lags

 between implementation and effect and the extreme response of the

 economy to sharp changes make fine tuning impossible. Nor does it

 appear that the credit has a substantial effect on output per dollar

 of revenue loss.

       Perhaps the principal justification given for the credit is

 the need to increase the nation's productive capacity by enlarging

 the capital stock. It is argued that the credit encourages investment

by reducing effective cost of capital goods. At the same time,

as emphasized in Section II, the credit alters the composition of

investment. Firms are likely to substitute favored types of capital,

for varieties not subsidized. There is evidence that the credit

has induced a significant change in American investment behavior.

In 1962, the year the credit was enacted, equipment accounted for

56% of business fixed investment. By 1976, when the credit reached

10%, the share of equipment had risen to almost 70%.

      Proper evaluation of the impact of investment incentives on

capital accumulation cannot be based just on analysis of the

investment sector. While the credit raises firms' demand for

investment goods, and hence loanable funds, this need not increase

the level of investment. If the supply of loanable funds (savings)

is fixed, the quantity of investment cannot rise no matter what

happens to demand. In this case, the credit will serve only to
                                                                   15




raise the price of loanable funds—— the interest rate. Even when

savings are free to rise, the credit—induced increase in the demand

for investment goods will bid up interest rates. The increase in

interest rates will, by raising the cost of financing investment,

partially offset the credit's stimulus.

      While it is relatively clear that the credit will spur

investment in equipment, its effect on other forms of investment

is ambiguous. The credit will bid up interest rates, raising the

cost of investment and discouraging purchase of non—favored capital

goods, principally structures. The interest rate will rise until

enough investment has been "crowded out" to restore the balance

between the supply and demand for loanable funds. On the other

hand, when there is considerable slack in the economy, the credit

may raise national product, increasing the income available to save.

Increases in GNP also raise the demand for investment goods, as firms

recognize the need to produce extra output. Thus, the key factor

affecting the relationship between the credit and other investment

is the response of loanable funds. When the supply of loanable funds

can rise, the accelerator effect of more output will increase

investment in all sectors. Otherwise the stimulus of the credit

is likely to be significantly offset by "crowding out" in non—favored

investment sectors.

      Empirical evaluation of these issues requires a model of the

U.S. economy. We have employed the Data Resources Incorporated (DRI)

econometric model to "simulate" several different policy options
                                                                     16




for the investment tax credit. The model contains several hundred

statistically estimated equations relating important macro—economic

variables. It has been estimated using data from the period 1954—1976.

The equations have been adjusted to ensure that when historical values

of policy variables are assumed, the model traces two actual paths

of the economy very accurately. In the DRI model, as in most

econometric models, the level of each type of investment is primarily

determined by four factors: 1) the cost of capital, 2) the level of

GNP,   3) the   amount of capital becoming obsolete or wearing out, and

4) corporate cash flow. As the Cost of capital rises firms are

assumed to reduce investment. Increases in the credit, liberalization

of depreciation allowances, or decreases in the interest rate reduce

the cost of capital. The level of GNP     enters   the equation because

the demand for investment goods is assumed to be proportional to

the output firms' produce. The amount of capital which must be

replaced is an obvious determinant of investment. Finally, the

equation recognizes that corporations are likely to invest more when

they have more funds on hand.14 The other sectors of the model embody

relatively standard assumptions. The model is in the Keynesian

tradition embodying substantial effects of both monetary and fiscal

policies. While the level of output is determined primarily by

aggregate demand, the DRI model does include a rather elaborate

treatment of aggregate supply. Unlike some other macroeconometric

models, interest rates and equity returns are explicitly modelled

as adjusting to ensure portfolio equilibrium)5
                                                                  17




      Initially we focus on evaluating the credit as an instrument

for encouraging investment in the long run. So as to emphasize the

long—run effects of the credit, three hypothetical simulations with

a constant credit were performed. Simulations I, II and III set

the effective credit at a constant rate of 0, 5.6% and 12% respectively

for the 1964—76 period. The effective credit is less than the

statutory credit because of various provisions limiting firms' ability

to receive the full credit.16 The 5.6% effective rate corresponds

to the 7% statutory rate in effect through much of the 1960s.

A 12% effective rate is equivalent to about a 13% statutory rate

under current law. In all three simulations, all other policy

variables were set at actual historical values. Thus, we evaluate

the effect of a pure change in the credit, with no accommodating

or offsetting changes in other fiscal and monetary policies.17

      Table II presents the results of the three simulations. Levels

of output, investment and interest four, eight and twelve years after

the introduction of the credit are presented. It is easy to see

that the investment credit is expansionary. After twelve years,

investment in equipment is raised $6.2 billion by a 5.6% credit,

and $12.8 billion by a 12% credit. The increase in investment does

not, however, generate enough savings to prevent increased investment

demand from bidding up the interest rate. The 5.6% credit raises

the interest rate by about 35 basis points in the long run. A 12%

credit raises the interest rate by just over 1% within just four

years. These increases in the interest rate crowd out investment

in   other sectors in the long run. For example, in 1972 a 12% credit

reduces housing starts by almost 230,000 units relative to the

no—credit case. After twelve years the 12% credit raises investment

in equipment by $12.8 billion but increases total fixed investment

by only $7.3 billion. Hence more than 40% of the stimulus to equipment

investment is offset by reductions in other investment. Rising

interest rates do not only hurt investment demand.    GNP rises less

than does total investment as higher interest rates slighly reduce

consumption demand.

       It is noteworthy that, as the credit increases, the extent

of the crowding out effect also rises. A 5.6% credit raises real

GNP by $6 billion after twelve years. Further increasing the credit

to 12% generates only an additional $1 billion output. Virtually

all of the extra stimulus provided by the further increase in the

credit is crowded out. It follows that increases in the credit from

the current 10% rate may not have a substantial expansionary effect.

Since structures deteriorate much less rapidly than equipment,

comparison of annual investment may give a misleading picture of

the credit's effect on the size and composition of the aggregate

capital stock.

       Table III presents estimates of the change in the stock of

capital under each of the three policies discussed above. Historical

changes in capital stocks are also presented. The credit has had

a substantial effect on the stock of equipment. Had the credit never

existed we would today have $42.3 billion less equipment representing

about 9.5% of the current stock. However, the credit has reduced

 the stock of other business and residential structures. For example,

with no credit, we would today have 600,000 more housing units.

A constant 12% credit would have eliminated another one million

housing units. While a constant 12% credit would have raised the

equipment stock by $48.5 billion above historical levels, it would

have increased the total capital stock by only $0.8 billion. Hence

about 98% of the increase in equipment. is offset by declines in

structures investment. This reflects the "increasing crowding out"

phenomenon discussed in the previous paragraph. Comparing the

no—credit and 5.6% credit cases, one does find that total capital

accumulation is increased by $20 billion by the latter option.

However, raising the credit from 5.6% to 12% actually reduces total

net capital accumulation by almost $1 billion.

      While the investment tax credit may have potent short—run

effects on investment, we are skeptical of its long—run effect on

capital accumulation. The primary impact of the credit appears to

be the reallocation of investment towards equipment. Unless

policy—makers seek to shift the composition of investment towards

equipment, the credit does not seem like a useful policy instrument

for affecting long—run capital accumulation. Particularly, when

the credit is already at a high level, increases appear to have

costs in terms of reduced residential and nonresidential structures

which at least balance any benefits.
                                                                    22

      It may be desirable to shift the composition of investment
 towards equipment. The tax system substantially favors investment

 in owner—occupied housing because martgage interest is tax deductible

while imputed rental income is not taxed. This distortion may be

offset by the various other institutional interferences, most notably

Regulation Q, which pervade the mortgage mrakets. The credit was

originally limited to equipment because it was felt that structures

received much more favorable depreciation allowances. However,

policy—makers should recognize that increases in equipment do come

at a significant cost in terms of other forms of investment.

      The second rationale offered for the use of the investment

tax credit is that it is an effective countercyclical policy

instrument. By raising the credit when the economy is slack, and

lowering it in boom times, policy—makers can try to stabilize the

level of investment and output. This has been the objective of the

repeated changes in the credit in 1966, 1969, 1971 and 1973 detailed

in Section I. We first examine the efficacy of these policy changes

by contrasting the historical path of the economy with the path that

the economy would have followed had the credit been kept constant

at its initial 5.6% effective rate. The results are presented in

Table IV. They suggest that the credit has actually contributed

to economic instability. In every year, the unemployment rate along

the actual path exceeds or equals the rate along the constant credit

path. Unemployment, over the entire period averages about .1% higher

than the model predicts it would have with a constant credit. Output

over the twelve—year period is reduced $33.1 billion by the variable

credit. Not only are output and employment lower in the variable

credit simulation, they are also more variable. The standard

deviation of unemployment in the constant credit simulation is .33%

compared to .44% in the variable credit simulation. Nor is there

any evidence that the credit stabilizes volatile investment demand.

Investment is both lower and more volatile in the "historical"

simulation than in the hypothetical constant credit simulation.

      Careful examination of Table IV reveals the principal reason

for the credit's destabilizing effect—— the sharp immediate response

of the economy to policy changes. One year after the brief credit

removal of 1966, the economy is actually in worse condition, operating

at a lower level than it would have if the credit had never been

enacted. To better illustrate this point, Table V compares the path

of the economy from 1968 to 1976 with and without the 1969—1971 credit

moratorium. Three features stand out. First, the termination of

the credit exacerbated the small 1970—1971 recession. The removal

of the credit caused an additional .5% or 450,000 workers to be

unemployed in 1971 and reduced 1971's output by $11.9 billion.

Second, the restoration of the credit further fueled an overheated

economy in 1972 and 1973. The increased demand mostly led to higher

prices, as the restoration of the credit caused prices to increase

.4% faster in 1973 than they would have had the credit been maintained

at a constant level. Third, the overheating of the economy in 1972

and 1973, partially due to the credit, exacerbated the sharp 1975

     *In the "Constant Credit" simulation, the effective credit is
held constant at 5.6% from 1969 to 1971. In the "Actual" simulation
the credit is removed from 69:2 to 71:2 as actually took place.
In both simulations, the 1975 credit hike to 9% takes place.

decline.     Output fell in 1974 by an additional $5.4 billion because

of the 1969—1971 credit moratorium. The variable credit thus

depressed   both business cycle troughs and raised the peak during
the 1968—76 period. At    each   point, it   acted   in the wrong direction.
      Poor   timing of policy changes is not the sole cause of the

credit's disastrous stabilization record. Much of the problem can

be found in the lag structure of the economy's response. The credit,

when enacted, immediately spurs investment and output. But the

forces which ultimately crowd Out some of the stimulus are also

set in motion. When the credit is removed, these forces linger,

leaving the econony worse off than it would have been without the

credit, as the stimulative effects go away but the offsetting ones

remain. This phenomenon can be seen in Tables IV and V. In Table IV,

the removal of the credit in 1966 does not reduce significantly the

interest rate. En Table V, the removal of the credit in 1969 does

not lower the interest rate very much. Nor does its reimposition

raise the interest rate significantly until 1974. This pattern of

response makes successful control of the economy with the tax credit

very difficult. For within a few years after its adoption, the credit

itself generates a need for stabilization policy. Gordon and

Jorgenson (1976) use the DRI model to find the optimum timing of

credit changes. The conclude that a relatively stable policy is

superior to even an optimally chosen variable credit policy. Their

analysis assumed away any problems of lags in policy—maker recognition

or implementation. It follows a fortiori, that, in actual practice,

variable credit policies should be avoided.
                                                                  28




     While failures in the use of other stabilization instruments

are well documented, the cause is typically poor implementation

timing. Better executive and legislative decisions might be expected

to lead to improved results. On the other hand, our results suggest

that the failure of the credit as a countercyclical instrument is

inherent in the dynamic pattern of the economy's response. This

implies that countercyclical policy will be more successful if other

instruments, such as personal tax changes and monetary policy, are

relied on, rather than alteration of investment incentives.

     The credit is often advocated on the grounds that it provides

more "bang for the buck" than alternative tax incentive measures.

More generally, the revenue cost of the credit is of obvious concern

to policy—makers contemplating its use. Most estimates of the revenue

cost of alternative credit policies, notably those found in the

Concurrent Budget Resolution of the Congress make a fundamental error.

These estimates are made on the assumption that the credit has no

effect on output. They thus greatly overestimate its initial cost,

by neglecting the increased revenues from other taxes following an

increase in GNP. Calculations of revenue loss also frequently make

the error of comparing only short—run revenue and investment impacts

of the credit. Clearly the credit has substantial effects for several

years, even after it has been removed. These effects should also

be considered in assessing its true cost.

      In order to measure the true revenue cost over the long run

of the credit, we simulated the model starting in 1964 with a 5.6%
                                                                    29




 effective credit. The credit was removed permanently in the fourth

 quarter of 1966. Table VI presents estimates of the total revenue

 cost of the investment credit discounted at 5% and 10% rates. Both

 direct and net costs are calculated. Although the stimulus provided

 by the credit raises tax revenues initially, the direct cost is less

 the net cost because of the sharp downturn caused by the credit's

 removal. Table VI also contains impacts of the credit on total

 output, and investment. Per dollar of net revenue loss, the investment

 tax credit only raises output by between $0.51 and $0.85, depending

on the discount rate. The impact on Investment is even smaller,

 totally between $0.38 and $0.59. It is difficult to find a standard

with which to compare these estimates. However, most models estimzte

that a reduction of $1 in taxes will raise output by close to $2

over a several—year period.18 It seems unlikely, therefore, that

the credit is a particularly potent form of economic incentive.

This conclusion is strengthened by the results In Tables II and II

suggesting that increases in the credit above current levels would

be even less powerful.

      On balance, our examination of the empirical evidence leads

us to conclude that the investment tax credit has had and continues

to have an undesirable effect on the economy. The primary long—run

effect of the credit is to reallocate capital from structures to

equipment. The housing sector bears much of the burden of credit

increases. Raising the credit from 10% to 12% as has been widely

discussed would eliminate about 100,000 housing units by 1980.

Short—run variations in the credit have been uniformly counterproduc-

tive since its inception. The prolonged and uneven response of the

economy to changes in the credit make it unlikely that even the most

carefully planned future variations will have better results.

Finally, we find no evidence that the credit is a particularly useful

instrument for maximizing economic stimulus per dollar of revenue

loss. None of these considerations justify the credit's immediate

removal. However, they do imply that further increases are almost

certainly unwarranted, that temporary changes will be destabilizing,

and that gradual removal would probably be desirable.

      These conclusions can have no more validity than the model

which generated them. We recognize that this factor implies that

our results are somewhat tentative. While the DRI model is not

perfect for answering the questions this paper addresses, it seems

as suitable as any current alternative. Reliance on an imperfect

model strikes us as preferable to the partial equilibrium, single—

equation techniques used in most previous evaluations of investment

incentives..




IV. The Effect of Temporary Incentives


      The results of the previous section indicate that countercyclical

use of the investment tax credit Is ill—advised, because of the time

lags in the effect of such policies. A brief consideration of the

effect of temporary policies on anticipations by firms strengthens

the argument.



                      V
                                                                        32




          The assumption implicit in our analysis so far, and in all

 previous estimates of the effect of investment incentives, is that

 firms take the current tax law to be permanent; that is, no changes

 are anticipated. While this may    be   valid when considering "once

and for all" changes in the tax code, it is hardly so for policies

which are, by their design, intended not to be permanent. It is

more appropriate to assume that, if it isgovernment's avowed purpose

to use the investment tax credit as a countercyclical tool, firms

will take this into account in their investment plans. Such

anticipations may have strong and perverse results. In particular,

firms will attempt to concentrate their investment spending in periods

during which the credit applies. Thus, a mild recession may be

exacerbated by firms delaying investment in anticipation of a credit

increase. Symmetrically, an inflationary boom may be fueled by firms

trying to squeeze in additional investment before the credit is

removed.

      Not only will a flexible credit affect the timing of investment,

but also the distribution among assets of different durability.

The longer the service life of an asset, the more difference it makes

in firm profits over time whether a credit may be applied to the

asset's purchase. Thus, the bunching of investment spending during

the existence of a credit will be more pronounced for more durable

assets.

      The power of the anticipations effect may be emphasized by a

simply numerical example. Suppose there is no tax credit presently
                                                                   33




in effect, and that a firm must make a decision as to the timing

of a $100 machine purchase. Suppose also that, in the absence of

any change in the tax law, the firm would be indifferent between

investing now or waiting one year. Now, imagine that, because of

a government policy, explicitly stated or not, to use the tax credit

as a stabilization tool, the investment planner expects the institution

next year of a 10% tax credit. Then, by waiting one year to invest,

the firm may expect to gain 10% on the machine investment. If the

rate of return on the investment is also 10%, then the firm can

double its first—year profit on the investment by waiting one year,

if its anticipation is correct. It is plausible to speculate that

expected increases in the credit may be related to current investment

shortfalls.

      In sum, the already negative aspects of the investment tax

credit as a stabilization tool are augmented by the fact that, when

anticipated, it will perversely influence the timing of investment,

and destabilize the mix between different types of investment over

the cycle. The explicit announcement of future policy changes, as

has been recommended in the proposal of a flexible tax credit,'9

can only exacerbate this problem by making anticipations more certain.
                                                                   34

V.   Conclusions


       There is little evidence that a change in the investment tax

credit is an effective tool for exapansionary fiscal policy. We

find that it has tended to destabilize the dynamic behavior of the

economy, and that the "bang per buck" of incentive stimulus is much

smaller than has been assumed. The "crowding Out" of non—favored

investment has been sufficiently important to offset a large

percentage of the increase in the stock of equipment resulting from

the use of the credit. Because investment may be postponed or speeded

up, anticipations of policy changes with respect to the tax treatment

of investment may greatly exacerbate the destabilizing impact of

such changes. While we have focused our attention on the investment

tax credit, these conclusions may be applied also to other types

of investment incentive such as the acceleration of depreciation

allowances. There is no reason to believe that these other investment

incentives are superior in any way to the investment tax credit.

      To the extent that government deems investment incentives a

viable policy instrument, considerations of economic efficiency and

the desire for a balanced expansion must be taken into account.

Given th.e distortions in the current tax structure, no simple rule

of thumb is likely to dictate the best incentive structure. Of utmost

importance is that the impact of incentives to corporate investment

on investment in the rest of the economy should be recognized.
                                                                    35




                              Appendix



      In this appendix, we demonstrate a number of the propositions

stated in Sections I and II of the paper. The discussion presumes

a familiarity with the neoclassical investment model used in Hall

and Jorgenson (1971).

      Let T be the corporate tax rate and k the investment tax credit.

Without any loss of generality, we consider the case in which the

credit is accompanied by an appropriate basis adjustment, as was

the case under the Long Amendment (see text). The firm's debt—equity

ratio is b/(l—b). The nominal rate of return to equity—holders

is p, and the nominal rate of interest is 1. Since they do not

influence the outcome of any of the effects studied below, we ignore

personal income taxes. As shown in Auerbach (i979b), a wealth

maximizing   firm with debt and equity will strive to maximize the
present value of   the net revenues that would occur if it   were entirely
equity—financed,   using as its nominal discount rate


             r       bi(l—T) + (l—b)p .                             (Al)

      We assume that capital decays exponentially at rate 6, and

that prices inflate at rate Yr.   It then follows that firms invest

in capital as long as the marginal product of capital exceeds the

"user cost" or implicit rental rate:


             c =     q(r— Tr+tS)(1— Tz)(l—k)/(1— t)                 (A2)
                                                                             36




where q is the price ratio between capital goods and output, z is

the present value of depreciation deductions, D(t), allowed for a

unit of capital purchased for one dollar.



               z            jet D(t)dt .                                     (A3)



      At every point in time after its purchase, capital decays at

rate 5. Thus, the physical decay at time t is the decay rate times

the capital remaining, óet. For a unit of capital which originally

cost one dollar, replacement cost is                 at time t. Thus, the value

of z for economic depreciation is:




              ZE
                        =
                             jet 6et            etdt =        6/(r—+)    .   (A4)



If z > ZE depreciation is said to be accelerated.

      Using (Al) and (A4), (A2) may be rewritten:



                   q(l_k)[bi+(l_b)(1P) + {J(r_+)(zE_z) — (l:T)
      c   =                                                                         +


Clearly, if z =
                    ZE an increase in t must increase the user cost,
and will do so more the less levered the firm is. However, if

z > ZE this need not be so. As an extreme case, suppose immediate

expensing is permitted, so that z = 1.              Then (A5) reduces to:


              c     =       q(l — k) [bi(1—t)   + (l—b)p —   iT   + 6]       (A6)
                                                                             37




Unless the firm has no debt, its user cost will increase with a

reduction in T,       thereby   discouraging investment.

      It is evident that, were r fixed, a proportional reduction

in c for different assets would be provided by a proportional decline

in (1—k). Thus, if the existing credit applicable for different

assets were the same, a uniform increase in k would be called for.

However, suppose a one percent reduction in c for all types of

capital led to an           percent rise in the real cost of capital, r—ir.

Then, as shown in Auerbach (1978 ), the appropriate change in k for

each asset is:



            -
                 dc
                        —      11—k)
                               I c J L    r1 (r-7r)n(r—1r)
                                                      + (l-r)6                A7


Thus, the smaller the value of 6, i.e., the more durable the asset,

the larger the increase in k would be required for an equiproportional

decrease in c.

      Now, suppose that k =          0.   Let       be the real marginal product

of capital, which has relative price q. In the absence of corporate

taxes, the internal rate of return, x, on a unit investment satisfied:




            Jet GKe_6t dt                 =     q                            (A8)




or


                            q(x+d)
                                                                               38




With taxes and      depreciation   deductions, the real internal rate of
return, x'    satisfies:



                                                                       =
            JeCt(1_t)        GKe_tdt + j e_xttqD(t)e_lrtdt                 q        (A9)



which,    using (A8), yields:


               x'    =     (l—t)x ÷ T(x'+cS)[Z'—ó/(x'+ó)]                           (AlO)


where



                                   D(t)etdt                                         (All)




         Note first that if depreciation allowances follow economic

depreciation, then D(t) =       6ete'TTt,   so that z' =   6/(x'+rS)    and

x =     (1— T)x, so that the reduction in the internal rate of return

is independent of 5.

         If depreciation allowances are not indexed, but otherwise follow

true depreciation, then D(t) =        5et,   and (AlO) becomes:


              x'     =     (l—T)xrTr6/(x'+7r+c5)                                    (A12)


For positive rates of inflation, x' <         (l—T)x,   so that we may think

of the failure to index depreciation allowances as an additional

tax on corporate income. Further, it is easy to verify that, for


given x,       <    0,   so that the magnitude of this extra tax increases
                                                               39




with 6, i.e., decreases with asset life. •As stated in the text,

short—lived assets are the hardest hit. This is because depreciation

allowances represent a greater proportion of the total return from

short—lived assets.

      1. In 1976, gross private domestic investment, excluding residen-

tial investment, was $115.7 billion in 1972 dollars. Gross national

product was $1,265.0 billion.

      2. For the period from 1948 to mid—1977, investment averaged 14%

of GNP. However, absolute quarter—to—quarter changes in investment were,

on average, 28% of absolute changes in GNP. Thus, investment has con-

tributed more to the volatility of GNP than its share alone would indicate.

cash flow variable, which was omitted in the original Hall—Jorgenson

specification.

      15. A full discussion of the properties of the DRI model, as

well as its construction, may be found in Eckstein, Green, and Sinai

(1974).

      16. The most important of these are: 1) the credit applies

fully only to assets with a greater than seven—year life; 2) until

1975, utilities did not receive the full credit; 3) credits are limited

to 50% of the taxes firms pay, although limited carryovers are

permitted.

      17. It might be argued that it would be more reasonable to

assume that the Fed accommodates changed in investment incentives,

by increasing the money supply so as to keep interest rates constant.

Such an assumption appears inconsistent with historical evidence.

Feldstein and Summers (1978) estimate that increases in investment

incentives do have a significant impact on interest rates. Our

assumption of constant monetary policy is traditional in analyses

of fiscal policy effects.

      18. A good general discussion of the effects of fiscal policy

changes can be found in Blinder and Solow (1974).
