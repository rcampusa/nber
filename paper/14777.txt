                                            ABSTRACT

Do smaller classes boost achievement mainly by helping teachers impart specific academic skills to
students with low academic achievement? Or do they do so primarily by helping teachers engage poorly
behaving students? The analysis uses the grade 3 to 4 transition in San Diego Unified School District
as a source of exogenous variation in class size (given a California law funding small classes until
grade 3). Grade 1 report cards allow separate identification of low-effort and low-achieving students.
Results indicate that elicitation of effort or engagement, rather than the teaching of specific skills,
may be the dominant channel by which small classes influence disadvantaged students.

                                         I. Introduction

        Findings from the Tennessee STAR experiment raise fundamental questions

about the education production function. In the STAR data, mean test scores of students

exposed to small classes in kindergarten through third grade exceeded those of students

in large classes, and percentile gains appeared largest for disadvantaged students.1

However, percentile gains appeared to fade by the end of high school. Attitudinal

changes in minority students, as captured by a higher probability of taking college

entrance exams, appear to have been the major long-run effect of small grade-school

classes. The mixed quality of these findings—the differing effects on different kinds of

students—motivate an exploration of possible mechanisms by which class size may

influence education outcomes.

        Two distinct strands of thought—metaphors for education production—inform

recent work. In the first, the labor force consists of educators. Their purpose is to

communicate to students the knowledge of how to perform specific tasks. Students, then,

resemble material inputs. Teachers and administrators are the skilled workers whose

labor, combined with books, school buildings, and other factors, add value to the material

input. Students function as passive recipients of human capital. Call this the “students-as-

material” model of education production. In the second framework, the labor force

consists of both educators and students. Teachers resemble managers, and students, the

workers they supervise on the factory floor. Here, teachers contribute to education

production by eliciting high effort choices from their workers. The managers’ primary

task is to prevent shirking. They accomplish this by instituting the optimal production

and Whitmore (1999) for details on the empirical results summarized in this paragraph.

                                                 1
technology, monitoring techniques, and incentive structures. Call this the “students-as-

labor” model of education production.

         Both frameworks capture important aspects of education production. Educators

teach specific skills to students and they incentivize students. However, policy choices

may depend on which causal mechanism one believes to be dominant. If output on the

factory floor is low because workers lack incentives, then programs designed to raise skill

levels may be less effective at raising output than a restructuring of their pay schedules or

increased monitoring. Similarly, incentives do little for workers who simply lack the skill

or knowledge to accomplish tasks demanded of them. Which channel drives the

outcomes valued by policy-makers and which framework better explains patterns in the

data on class size and education outcomes?

         One way to shed light on these questions is to analyze a setting in which the

stylized predictions of the two frameworks diverge. If teachers lack time to transfer

knowledge to students in large classes, then small class sizes might benefit low-

performing students disproportionately, because low performers need more time to learn

the subject material. If, instead, teachers are middle managers whose task is to elicit

effort from workers, then a different outcome might be expected. How do teachers elicit

effort, and, more to the point, how might small classes facilitate this? It may be that some

students do not connect as strongly to the education setting when they are in large classes.

This can be thought of as the “school socialization” effect.2 Smaller classes may allow



2
  Recent work in the theoretical literature formalizes notions of “school socialization.” Akerlof and Kranton
(2002), for example, hypothesize that schools do not simply produce skills, but “impart an image of ideal
students, in terms of characteristics and behavior,” and that this affords schools the opportunity to elicit (or
discourage) effort. See also Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2000), and Carneiro and Heckman (2003) for
theoretical explorations of the “socialization” of students through the creation of incentive-enhancing
preferences or non-cognitive human capital, respectively

                                                       2
teachers to incentivize students whose connection to the educational institution would

otherwise have been tenuous. Although school socialization may operate in subtle ways,

the cost of incentivizing students—the time and effort of the teacher/manager—could be

expressed as a monitoring cost. If students are analogous to workers on fixed-rate as

opposed to variable-rate pay, then a factory with a high ratio of managers to workers may

improve outcomes because it is easier to monitor workers. Workers prone to shirking

would be the agents affected by additional monitoring. In the students-as-material

framework, effort elicitation is not the dominant channel through which class-size

influences outcomes. The prediction is that low-ability students might benefit most from

smaller classes. The students-as-labor framework, in contrast, suggests that students with

high disutility of effort—those most prone to shirking—would benefit disproportionately

from small classes. 3

         This paper uses a panel dataset containing achievement scores, Grade Point

Averages (GPAs), and a rich set of behavior measures for primary school students in the

San Diego Unified School District to test the divergent implications of the frameworks.

While the results from the Tennessee STAR Project show an apparent influence of small

class sizes in kindergarten through third grade on minority students’ decisions to take

college entrance exams, there is no direct evidence that this is because minority students

are less socialized to schooling. An obvious alternative would be that minority students

arrive at school with less human capital.4 What has been missing is an empirical design

that uses direct measures of behavior and attitude in grade school to identify disengaged

  We mean here that students “benefit” in the eyes of a social planner who wants to raise skill acquisition
outcomes, not necessarily that students’ utility rises.

  See Coley (2002) for evidence of inequality in human capital observed at the time of students’ entry into
kindergarten. He finds that cognitive development is positively linked to family income.

or low-effort students, rather than relying on race as a weak (and controversial) proxy for

disengagement. This paper attempts to fill that gap. In particular, the behavior measures

allow us to treat effort as an observable, and so to group students by effort types, as well

as grouping them by achievement.

       Investigations of the effect of class-size on student achievement outcomes are

common in the literature. We focus on a subtly different question here not only because it

may fill a gap in the literature, but because our data may be better suited for this question.

We believe class size to be endogenous. While our data offer a plausible source of

exogenous variation in class-size between grades (the implementation of California State

measure SB 1777 reduced class sizes in lower grades), endogenous class-size variation

within grade remains a significant problem. By focusing on differences in the effects of

the transition to large classes in higher grades for different subgroups of students, we are

able to difference out this source of endogeneity.

       Using this approach, we find evidence that larger class sizes disproportionately

lower the achievement of students who in grade 1 had relatively low behavior grades.

This result stands in contrast to our comparison between high and low ability students (as

measured by their academic GPA in grade 1). We found no difference between these two

groups when they were moved to large classes. We infer that smaller class size may do

more to engage low-effort students than to help low-achieving students.

                                 II. Data and Empirical Strategy

A. Data

         The dataset for the analysis consists of a panel of students from 127 elementary

schools, grades 1 through 5, in the San Diego Unified School District, for the school

years 1998-1999 through 2001-2002. Achievement outcome variables include Stanford 9

math and reading scores, and GPA in core subjects. Teacher evaluations of SDUSD

elementary school students include assessments of a broad range of potentially relevant

behavioral variables, including “begins work promptly,” “follows directions,” “classroom

behavior,” “practices self-discipline.” The average of these, the “behavior-GPA,” will be

interpreted as a measure of student effort.5 Table I shows descriptive statistics for

variables that will be used in the analysis. We use Stanford 9 test score gains for school

years 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002 (as the 1998-1999 school year is earliest for

which we have scores).

         The Stanford 9 test scores are available in several formats. We use the vertically

scaled scores—a format that facilitates the between-grade comparisons required in our

analysis. These are psychometrically scaled versions of the raw scores. Item Response

Theory is used to weight questions of varying difficulty. Scores that are scaled within a

grade have the property that a five-point gain represents the same amount of learning at

different points in the test-score distribution. Test scores like the Stanford 9 scores we

use that are also vertically scaled have the property that the scores are comparable across

grades. Thus, for example, a student with the same score in grades 3 and 4 has not

5
 We use a simple average of the behavior components to construct behavior-GPA. This specific choice of
weighting does not appear to drive the results in Section IV. (Likewise, weightings on the components of
academic-GPA do not appear to drive results.) Results are qualitatively similar given different weightings;
however coefficients on interaction terms involving behavior GPA are sometimes less precisely estimated
when components of behavior-GPA are excluded altogether.

                                                     5
progressed, while two students with gains of five points have improved by the same

amount. There is a large statistical literature behind this approach. Psychometrics is not

without critics, but the data suggest that within elementary schools average gains are

quite constant across most grades, which is what we would expect.

       Panel B, column 1 shows descriptive statistics for all students in either grade 3 or

4, the grades that will be the focus of the analysis here. Many of these students entered

grade 3 and 4 outside of the years that we will be using, as we focus on two cohorts of

grade 4 students who entered grade 4 in either 2000-2001 or 2001-2002. The second

column (labeled “potential sample”) shows the mean and standard deviation for students

who were ever in the district enrolled in one of these cohorts, and thus could potentially

have attended SDUSD continuously in grades 1-4 during the years for which we have

data. There is attrition and new entry, so we cannot compute test score gains for all of

these students. Specifically, we can measure gains in grade 3 and grade 4 only for

students who attended SDUSD for three straight years (in Grades 2,3, and 4.) This is the

sample referenced in Column 3. Although the sample size drops by about a third, the

means of key variables are very similar to those shown in column 2.

       Further, we will identify high types and low types based on performance in Grade

1 (as described in Section II.C). So the difference-in-differences analysis is possible only

for students who attended SDUSD in Grades 1,2,3, and 4. Descriptive statistics for this

sample are reported in column 4, the main subsample used in the paper. Inferences drawn

from the main regressions then relate to this subsample, and an important caveat is that

these students may differ from students who left or entered the district. Students who

attended SDUSD continuously from Grade 1 to 4 do appear to have slightly higher test



                                             6
scores than those who did not. However, their test scores and gains look similar to those

who attended in grades 2 through 4.

           Several factors complicate any analysis of the influence of class size on education

outcomes using non-experimental data. In non-experimental settings, there may be no

reason to believe that class size is randomly assigned. Administrators may place slower

students in smaller classes, in which case reduced-form regressions of achievement on

class size could show higher gains in larger classes. Motivated parents of unobservably

advantaged students may pressure administrators to place their students in smaller classes,

in which case the bias would go in the opposite direction. These effects occur within

schools, but between-school sources of endogeneity also exist. Lazear (2001) posits a

model in which class size is a choice variable and the optimal class size rises with the

attention span of the students. Areas in which students had longer attention spans would

then feature larger classes.

           Table II, a first pass at the data, displays results of regressions of math and

reading test-score gains on class size and grade dummies, with and without student fixed

effects.6 When there are no student fixed effects, in columns 1 and 2, the coefficient on

class size is positive for math and negative for reading, but is not significant in either case.

The coefficients from regressions with student fixed effects, in columns 3 and 4, are

significantly negative for math and insignificant, very small, and positive for reading.

Student fixed effects will mitigate all sources of endogeneity that do not change over time

for the individual student, but do not account for the possibility that the size of a student’s

class in a given year may be related to changes in that student’s performance or attitude

during the previous year (unobserved by the researcher.) We conclude that inferences

    The sample in Table II consists of all students in grades 3 through 5 for whom gains are available.

                                                        7
about the relationship between class size and test score gains drawn from these

regressions may be problematic.



B. Empirical Strategy

       The research design for this paper will use the transition from third to fourth grade

to proxy for a change in class size. In 1996, the California State Legislature passed and

began to implement Senate Bill 1777. The purpose of the reform measure was to reduce

class size in early grades from what had been an average of 28 students to a maximum of

20. The legislation funded class-size reduction from kindergarten through third grade

only. As a result of this legislation, the fourth grade classes have more students, on

average, than third grade classes for all school years in the SDUSD dataset (1998-1999

through 2001-2002). Table I, Panel A, shows class size by grade in San Diego Unified

schools. Average class size leaps by 10—from 19 students to 29 students—between third

and fourth grade. Class size could still be endogenous, of course, as the law does not

mandate exact class sizes. (For grade 3, the measure sets a maximum size but no

minimum, and in grade 4 the measure does not impose size requirements.) Thus, we do

not use class size as a regressor. We assume only that the transition from grade 3 to grade

4 captures a source of exogenous variation in class size.

       This paper will compare math and reading test score gains in third grade to gains

in fourth grade for different subgroups of students. If the students-as-material framework

captures the relevant causal channel, one would expect low-ability students to exhibit a

steeper drop-off in test score gains between third and fourth grade than high-ability

students. If the students-as-labor framework applies, then one would expect low-effort or



                                              8
disengaged students to exhibit a steeper drop-off in test-score gains between third and

fourth grade than high-effort students. The empirical strategy focuses on a difference in

differences. While neither the “high” group nor “low” group in these regressions will be a

control group, per se, we assume that any important explanatory factors in the transition

from third to fourth grade (other than class size) impact test scores for both groups in the

same way. The influence of possible confounding factors will be differenced out.

       To fix ideas, suppose the expectation of achievement gains in small classes

consists of a grade effect, constant across types, and an effect based on one’s type (high

or low), constant across grades. Suppose that these effects enter additively, so that the

conditional expectation may be written

        E[ΔYi S | g , T ] = β g + γ T

where ΔYiS is the achievement gain variable for student i in grade g in a small class (S), βg

is the grade effect and γT captures the effect of being a type T, which can be either “high”

or “low.” If big classes (B) alter test score gains of low types differently than they alter

test score gains for high types, we may write

        E [ ΔYigB | g , T ] = E [ ΔYigS | g , T ] + δ T .

Here, δT varies with type and is the mean difference in test score gains for big classes

(ΔYiB) relative to small classes. Because classes are big when g=4 and classes are small

when g=3,

        E [ ΔYigB | g = 4, T = L] = β 4 + γ L + δ L
        E [ ΔYigB | g = 4, T = H ] = β 4 + γ H + δ H
                                                            .
        E [ ΔYigS | g = 3, T = L] = β 3 + γ L
        E [ ΔYigS | g = 3, T = H ] = β 3 + γ H

Subtraction across types and grades yields

                                                                9
           {E[ ΔYigB | g = 4, T = L] − E[ ΔYi B | g = 4, T = H ]} −
                                                                                .
           {E[ ΔYigS | g = 3, T = L] − E[ ΔYi S | g = 3, T = H ]} = δ L − δ H

Here δL – δH represents the difference in the impact of moving to a large class in grade 4

for low types versus high types. If negative, this difference tells us that low types are

disproportionately hurt by the move to larger class sizes in grade 4. We will estimate δL –

δH by regressing test score gains on grade dummy, type dummy, and grade-type

interaction term.7



C. Defining Types

           We restrict the sample to students who attended schools in San Diego Unified in

grades 2, 3, and 4, so that for each student there are data on test score gains in grade 3

and grade 4. As will be described below, we further restrict the sample to students who

attended schools in SDUSD in grade 1, as well. If low types are defined as students with

low test scores in grade 3, a problem of regression to the mean arises. The dependent

variable is test score gains, (Yi4 - Yi3) or (Yi3 - Yi2). Students with high grade 3 test scores

(attributable to randomness) will experience systematically lower gains from grade 3 to

grade 4 and systematically higher gains from grade 2 to grade 3. If grade 2 test scores are

used to identify high types, a similar problem occurs: Students with high grade 2 test

scores will experience systematically lower gains from grade 2 to grade 3. A solution

would be to use first grade test scores to identify types. Unfortunately, Stanford 9

achievement tests were not administered in grade 1. Thus, we use the average letter grade

awarded to the student in academic subjects in grade 1, which we denote academic-GPA,



7
    The exposition here follows Angrist and Krueger (1999).

                                                         10
to define high-ability and low-ability types.8 We define high ability/low ability as

students with GPA above/below the district-wide average in grade 1.

         To identify high-effort and low-effort types, we use a first grade “behavior-GPA”

that is the average of the 4 measures of behavior shown in Table I.9 For each case, we

define high types as those whose measured outcome (academic-GPA on the one hand, or

behavior-GPA on the other) exceeds the school first-grade average.

         Our attempt to test whether small classes help primarily low-ability or low-effort

students is meaningful only insofar as these are distinct concepts. The plot of academic-

GPA against behavior-GPA in Figure I shows many off-diagonal points. Table III shows

a cross-tabulation of ability type by effort type for students in the sample. Thirty percent

of the students in the sample lie off the table diagonal, suggesting that effort and ability

are related but distinct. 10




8
  Academic-GPA is the average of core subjects: reading, written language, oral language, spelling,
handwriting, English as a Second Language, math, social studies, science, homework, home reading, book
reports. (Letter grades are mapped to the customary numerical values, 4 points for an A, etc.).
9
  We use a simple average of the behavior components to construct behavior-GPA. This specific choice of
weighting does not appear to drive the results in Section III. (Likewise, weightings on the components of
academic-GPA do not appear to drive results.) Results are qualitatively similar given different weightings;
however coefficients on interaction terms involving behavior-GPA are sometimes less precisely estimated
when components of behavior-GPA are excluded altogether.
10
   “Low effort” and “high effort” might seem to describe choices rather than types. We argue here that
effort grades enable us to identify types—students with low and high disutility of effort. We abbreviate,
then, when we use the labels “high-effort” and “low-effort” to describe these types. In particular, because
significant numbers of students lie off the main diagonal of the correlation table, we argue that it makes
sense to think of ability and attitude as separate endowments.

                                                 III. Results

A. Difference in Differences Estimates by Ability, Effort, Race, and Gender

         Given that measures of ability, effort, race, and gender are related, we expand the

model of Section II to include multiple grade-type interactions.11 Accordingly,

regressions in Table IV include academic-GPA, behavior-GPA, race, gender and grade

dummies, along with their associated cross-terms. The coefficients on the grade-type

interaction terms estimate differences in differences in test score gains between grades 3

and 4 for high and low types. In Row 1, Columns 1 and 2, high and low types are based

on “ability,” as captured by academic-GPA. Low-ability types have academic-GPAs

below the average academic-GPA in first grade. Test score gains were smaller in grade 4

than in grade 3, as indicated by the negative coefficient on the grade 4 dummy for

columns 1 and 2. In both math and reading, however, the decline in test score gains for

low-ability types did not differ significantly from the decline in test score gains for high-

ability types.12

         Row 2 shows difference-in-differences estimates when low types are those who

earned below average behavior grades in first grade. This particular metric is meant to

capture attitude rather than ability. Estimates for the cross-term in row 2, columns 1 and 2,

are negative and significant. Math score gains for low-effort types fell by 2.2 more points

between grades 3 and 4 than did the gains of the high effort comparison group. The



11
   Adding covariates introduces the possibility that correlation between regressors influences the results.
Results in this section do not appear to be driven by interaction between ability, effort, race, and gender
covariates. Main results persist in regressions based on the simpler model.
12
   It could be that the difference in gains in math scores in large and small class settings varies with abilities
specific to math, rather than with our broader measure of ability (academic-GPA). Similarly, the difference
in differences in reading gains may vary with initial reading ability. Regessions that use these subject-
specific measures (math letter grade and reading letter grade), available upon request, produce similar
results.

                                                       12
outcome for reading was similar: Gains of low-effort types fell by 2.15 points more than

gains for high-effort types.

         How large are these differences in differences? One way to get a sense of the

magnitude is to compare the differences in gains by type to district-wide standard

deviations in test scores. Grade 4 standard deviations in test scores are 40 and 43 points

for math and reading, respectively. So the increase in class size in grade 4 throws low

behavior-GPA students about .05 standard deviations further behind high behavior-GPA

students in both math and reading. These differences are of the same order of magnitude

as effects of small classes that have been reported in previous work.13

         Breakdowns of type by race and gender do not produce statistically significant

differences in differences (rows 3,4, and 5). Larger classes, then, appear not to reduce test

score gains of low academic-GPA students more than high academic-GPA students, of

black students more than non-black students, or of males more than females, but they do

appear to reduce gains of low-effort students disproportionately. The results lend support

to the students-as-labor framework, as opposed to the students-as-material framework.

Small classes may allow teachers/managers to monitor, motivate, and incentivize low-

effort students.

         One could argue that some other change between grades 3 and 4 drives the

observed difference-in-differences for math and reading gains. Perhaps teacher

qualifications or experience varies systematically between grades 3 and 4. To account for

this possibility we include measures of teacher characteristics as additional covariates in

the regressions of Table IV, columns 3 and 4. Dummies in these regressions indicate


13
  For example, using Project STAR data, Schanzenbach (2006) shows about a 0.1 standard deviation
difference between the test-score benefits of blacks and whites associated with exposure to smaller classes.

                                                    13
whether a students’ teacher in a given year possessed a master’s degree, whether she

possessed an emergency certificate, whether she possessed an intern certificate, and

whether she had 0-2 years, 3-5 years, or 5-7 years experience teaching. Addition of these

controls does not alter results significantly, evidence that systematic differences in

teacher characteristics between grades 3 and 4 do not drive the observed difference in

differences.

       Further, if class size is indeed endogenous, it could be that administrators assign

high-effort and low-effort students systematically to different-sized classes within grade 4

and within grade 3, and that differences in class size, within grade, drive the results above.

To account for this possibility, we include class size (in addition to the full set of controls

from columns 3 and 4) in the regressions of Table IV, columns 5 and 6. The coefficient

on class size is small and insignificant, and low-effort cross-terms do not change in this

specification. It would appear, then, that changes in within-grade differences in class size

for low-effort and high-effort types do not drive the findings in this section.



B. Behavior Gains

       Our main goal in this paper is to assess how academic achievement responds to

variations in class size, by type of student. However, our findings for low-effort students

raise the question of whether class size influences student behavior itself. Table V

reports difference-in-differences regressions in which gain in behavior-GPA is the

dependent variable. These specifications are analogous to those used in the SAT9 test

score gains regressions of Table IV. The estimate on the low-behavior-GPA cross-term is

negative, as expected, but small and insignificant. There is no strong evidence of



                                              14
disproportionate reductions in effort or behavior by low-behavior-GPA types in large

classes. The coefficient on the black-grade-4 interaction term, though small, is positive

and significant—apparently suggesting that small classes yield slightly greater behavior

gains for non-black students than for black students.

       However, there may be a problem of scaling in the behavior gains regressions.

Table VI shows summary statistics for behavior-GPA by grade. It would appear that

teachers set behavior norms every year so that the mean behavior-GPA is always about 3

and the standard deviation about .85. This does not pose a problem if behavior-GPA from

a single year is used to define high and low types. But if the gain in behavior-GPA is the

outcome variable, one might not expect to find differences in gains between grades 3 and

4 by type. The predicted greater dispersion in behavior grades in large classes would not

show up because of re-norming.

       We cannot rule out the possibility that behavior standards are dependent on age

and grade, and were simply not designed for between-grade comparisons. (To our

knowledge, the district has never attempted to use behavior evaluations for this purpose.)

For this reason, we are more confident drawing inferences from regressions in which test

score gains are the dependent variable. We hesitate to draw strong conclusions from the

behavior-gains regressions.

       The renorming suggested by Table VI motivates a closer look at behavior-GPA.

Might effort measures be subjective in other important ways? Might they be defined by

idiosyncratic norms and expectations of teachers, with little connection to any objective

standard? If this were the case--that is, if behavior-GPA were teacher-specific--one would

expect that the average measured behavior-GPA in schools attended by students from



                                            15
low-SES families would not differ significantly from measured behavior-GPA in high-

SES schools. Figure II, a scatterplot of average school-level behavior-GPA against the

percent of student population eligible for free lunches, shows a strong negative

correlation.14 Low behavior-GPA is observed more prevalently in low-SES schools.15

This would seem a strong indication that behavior-GPA, though normed by grade, is not

a strictly subjective or teacher-specific measure.



                                    IV. Alternative Explanations

A. Grade Trends

         Age or grade trends could explain the difference-in-differences estimates. If the

underlying trend in achievement were such that the gap between test-score-gains of low

behavior-GPA and high behavior-GPA students widened with each successive grade

level, then this fact alone would be enough to explain the results in Table IV. Do

differences in test score gains by effort-types widen between grades 4 and 5, despite the

fact that there is no significant change in average class size between these grades? A sub-

sample of students who attended SDUSD schools in third and fourth grade also attended

a school in SDUSD in fifth grade. For these students, it is possible to generate difference-

in-differences regressions (analogous to those in Table IV) that focus on the transition

from grade 4 to grade 5. These models, then, provide a type of falsification test, and the

results are reported in Table VII. The estimates in Table VII show that the difference in



14
   The associated regression of average behavior-GPA on “percent free lunch” and constant yields a
negative coefficient with t-statistic of -81. (Results in Tables IV, V, VII, and VIII are not altered
significantly by adding covariates for “percent free lunch” and “percent free lunch” interacted with grade.)
15
   This would appear consistent with findings that low-SES schools are more likely to report crimes. (See
Barton, Coley, and Wenglinsky, 1998.)

                                                     16
test score gains by behavior-GPA types did not widen significantly either for math or for

reading. 16 It would appear that the observed widening of the gap in gains by behavior-

GPA types between grades 3 to 4 is not due to an underlying trend that occurs outside of

the transition from grade 3 to 4.



B. Peer Grouping

         Many schools formally or informally group students by perceived ability. This

practice appears to be in use at SDUSD. Figure III shows patterns of peer grouping by

ability at 3 specific elementary schools in San Diego Unified. In the figures, each node

represents a student who attended the specific school in grades 2, 3, and 4. A line linking

nodes indicates that the two students shared a classroom in at least 2 out of the 3 years.

Black nodes represent high-ability students (students whose first grade GPA was higher

than the school median) and white nodes represent low-ability students. The figure

shows distinct clusters of high-ability and low-ability students. Very few high-ability

types appear to have shared classrooms twice with low-ability types (and vice versa.)

Similar patterns emerge when types are defined by high and low effort. Strong patterns of

ability grouping, as in Figure III, were visible in a majority of the large schools in

SDUSD.

         It could be that the transition from grade 3 to grade 4 leads to systematic changes

in peer groupings for low and high types, and if so, could bias our results. Some



16
   Further, the finding (of no significant difference in differences in test score gains for behavior-GPA types)
is robust to specifications that do not include multiple grade-type interaction terms. (See footnote 10.) In
Table VII, the difference in reading test score gains by academic-GPA type does appear to widen between
grades 4 and 5. But this result appears to be driven by correlation between the grade-type interaction terms,
and does not hold in the models that exclude multiple grade-type interaction terms. (Supporting regressions
available upon request.)

                                                     17
reflection, and further analysis, suggests that if anything, this confounding factor may be

leading us to understate the effect of large class sizes on gains of low-effort students. If

there is ability-grouping in classroom assignment, then high types will grouped with high

types and low types with low types. When class size rises in grade 4, there are more

students in the typical class and fewer classes in the school-grade. When there are fewer

classes, administrators group by ability into fewer divisions. As an extreme example, if

there were two classes in grade 3 and class sizes rose so that there was only 1 class in

grade 4, then ability grouping would disappear altogether in grade 4. Average peer

quality would have fallen for high types and risen for low types. If peer effects go in the

expected direction, then the merging of classes would increase test score gains for low

types relative to high types and decrease the dispersion of outcomes. The observed

increase in the dispersion of outcomes for high types and low types, then, obtains in spite

of peer effects. The magnitude of the difference in differences estimate could be

interpreted as a lower bound.

         In the data, peer groups evolve as predicted: The evidence suggests that from

grade 3 to grade 4 peer quality declined for high-ability types and increased for low-

ability types. However, the observed changes are small.17 Given evidence that in grade 4

the peer groups of low-ability and low-effort students improved by a small amount, it is

worth testing whether these changes in peer groups might have led to an understatement

of our main results in earlier tables. Regressions in Table VIII include controls for

average first-grade academic-GPA and average first-grade behavior-GPA of classroom


17
  Specifically, in Grade 3, high-ability types (as defined by academic-GPA in first grade) were in
classrooms with 71% high-ability types. The percentage of high-ability classroom peers fell to 69% in
grade 4 for high-ability types. Between grades 3 and 4, low-ability types saw an increase in the percentage
of high-ability types in their classrooms, from 41% to 44%.

                                                    18
peers in third grade (in addition to the full set of covariates in Table IV.) 18 As expected,

the inclusion of controls for peer quality in the model increases slightly the magnitude of

estimated coefficients on the low-effort cross-terms. Point estimates move from -2.27 to -

2.29 for math and from -2.23 to -2.26 for reading, suggesting that the absence of controls

for peer effects in earlier tables may have biased coefficient estimates toward zero.

         Peer effects, then, do not appear to account for the difference in differences in

gains by effort-types in small and large classes, but may have caused this difference to be

slightly understated.



                                   V. Summary and Conclusion

         The analysis uses the transition from grade 3 to grade 4 in San Diego Unified as a

source of exogenous variation in class size (given a California law funding small classes

only up until grade 3). The paper then compares differences in test score gains between

grades 3 and 4 for low and high types, using various metrics to define type. Empirical

findings indicate that class-size expansion may reduce gains for low-effort students more

than for high-effort students, but no significant difference in reductions of gains is

observed when types are defined by ability. Underlying grade-level trends do not appear

to drive the difference-in-differences findings. Differences in peer grouping for high and

low types do not appear to drive the results either, but suggest that the estimated

magnitude of the difference-in-differences estimates may be a lower bound. Findings are

also robust to the inclusion of controls for possible variation in teacher quality between

grades 3 and 4, and for variations in class size in grade 4, itself, among student types.

18
  It could also be the case that greater dispersion of peer quality reduces gains. We have included
dispersion measures (standard deviations of the peer measures) in the regressions referenced in Table VIII.
These did not alter the point estimates or the statistical significance of the main results.

                                                    19
       Previous empirical work on class-size reduction has rarely attempted to look

inside the black box and discern the mechanism by which class size may influence

education production. In the Tennessee STAR experiment, disadvantaged students appear

to have experienced larger test-score gains than advantaged students. A standard

explanation is that small classes allow teachers to offer special help to low-achieving

students. Results here, if they may be generalized, suggest an alternative explanation—

that larger gains for disadvantaged students may have occurred because small classes

allow teachers to incentivize disengaged students more effectively, or because students

are better able connect to the school setting in small classes.

       More generally, findings here suggest it may be important to consider non-

cognitive characteristics of students when investigating the effects of increased school

resources on student outcomes. Not only might some interventions have greater impact

on disengaged students (and other groups that policy–makers may wish to target), but the

differing impacts of interventions on different types of students may itself provide

information about the underlying mechanism. Student attitudes and behaviors may shape

the ways in which school spending is transformed into human capital. If so, then

empirical research using characterizations of student attitudes and types may be central to

the crafting and evaluation of education policy, and to a deeper understanding of human

capital production.

Based on students in grades 3-5 durring 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002 school years. Some students
transferred into SDUSD and their records lack test score data for the year prior to the transfer. (25,615 out of 95,541
observations in grades 3,4,5 lacked data on gains.) This sample differs from the Table I, Panel B, Column 4 sample
that will be used in the main analysis, as these basic motivating regressions use data that go beyond fourth grade and
do not require early grade 1 data.

Based on Table 1.B, Column 4 sample. High (low) effort types
are students whose academic-GPA exceeded (did not exceed)
the school first-grade academic-GPA average. High (low)
ability types are students whose behavior-GPA exceeded (did
not exceed) the school first-grade behavior-GPA average.

dummy variables for whether a students’ teacher in a given year possessed a
master’s degree, whether she possessed an emergency certificate, whether she
possessed an intern certificate, and whether she had 0-2 years, 3-5 years, or 5-7
years experience teaching. Apart from the addition of covariates Acad-GPA(peer)
