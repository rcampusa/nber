                                         ABSTRACT

This article develops and implements a Real Option approach to value renewable natural
resources in the case of Marine Fisheries. The model includes two sources of uncertainty: the
resource biomass and the price of fish, and it can be used by fisheries to optimally adapt
their harvesting strategy to changing conditions in these stochastic variables. The model also
features realistic operational cash flows and fisheries can shutdown and reopen operations. Using
publicly available data on the British Columbia halibut fishery, the required parameters are
estimated and the model solved. The results indicate that the conservation of the biomass is both
optimal from a financial and a social perspective. The approach could be extended to other
fish species and natural resources if the appropriate data were available.

The economic sustainability of sheries is an ongoing concern for consumers, shers, govern-

ments, intergovernmental organizations, and academics. Overshing occurs when more sh

are caught than the natural population growth, and as Ye and Gutierrez (2017) indicate,

during the last decade the worldwide percentage of stocks classied as overshed remained

stable at 30%, pointing to a failure of self-regulation and a misalignment between economic

incentives and conservation. This is the starting point of several eorts from governments and

institutions around the world to regulate these markets and achieve a sustainable equilibrium.


   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO (2008)) indicates

that an important part of solving the overshing problem is to adjust shing capacity to

sustainable levels through policy and regulations, including judicious use of subsidies and

eradication of illegal, unreported and unregulated shing. Nowadays one of the most used

policy device is the Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) system, an allocation of extraction rights

of the total annual sh catch (TAC) in the form of transferable quota shares which limits

not only the total catch, but also controls the individual sher's landings.


   Although the IVQ policy has been successful on limiting overexploitation, there is still

an ongoing discussion on the optimal economic level of the quota.        This paper develops a

methodology in a dynamic setting to determine the total annual sh catch which maximizes

the value of the natural resource. This optimal TAC not only maximizes the value of the

resource, but also assures the sustainability of the resource.


   The valuation of natural resources under uncertainty is a problem in which the Real

Option approach has proven to be appropriate in other contexts, as the work of Brennan

and Schwartz (1985) and the signicant body of work that followed indicate, but until now

it has not been fully applied to marine sheries. This article develops and implements such

approach by modeling sheries as a complex option on the variables underlying the value

of the industry, in this case, the resource stock (biomass) and the sh price. Uncertainty is

introduced in the analysis by allowing these variables to follow dynamic stochastic processes.

The model has some features similar to Morck et al. (1989) for forestry but in this case the

resource growth is specic for a sh population, and operational cash ows are modeled as

an explicit function of the biomass and the total harvest.       To specify the biomass growth

uncertainty we follow Pindyck (1984) and use a logarithmic growth function which explicitly

captures the possibility of overpopulation and depletion.        For the price of sh we use a

standard nancial log-normal price dynamics.


   To make the problem tractable we consider the case where several competitive price

taking sheries can be represented by a single shery endowed with the total annual sh


                                               2
catch (TAC) whose property rights are well dened. To simplify the model we also assume

that the shery faces no taxes and that production can opened and shut down at no cost;

though these features could be easily incorporated in the model.

   The model is solved using a value-function iteration algorithm instead of the more tra-

ditional partial dierential equation approach used in Real Options problems. The solution

approach solves for the optimal dynamic harvesting policy of a representative shery, and

then uses this policy to value the marine harvesting rights. The solution allows also to study

how the optimal level of harvesting relates to the two state variables in our model, the biomass

and the sh price, and how these rights will optimally evolve with stochastic changes in the

state variables. Based on the optimal policy it is possible to simulate the dynamics of the

biomass subject to stochastic shocks and optimal harvesting, illustrating how the biomass

will evolve over a specic time horizon.

   Most of the current literature on sheries assumes that prices are constant or evolve

deterministically (Clark and Kirkwood (1986), Sethi et al. (2005)). A signicant improvement

of our model is that it includes stochastic prices which turns out to be an important issue. Our

analysis also expands the literature by including in the cost function not only xed operational

costs, but also variable costs which are related to the biomass through the sheries eciency

(catchability), and a quadratic component which incorporates an increasing marginal cost.

   To examine the model implications, we apply it to the British Columbia halibut shery.

Combining multiple sources of information we constructed time series for the halibut biomass,

total harvest (landings), and price, and using this data all required parameters of the model

are estimated. Our estimates show that the volatility of the sh price growth is comparable in

size to the estimated volatility of the biomass growth, showing that when previous literature

assumed that the sh price followed a deterministic path the shery's valuation problem is

signicantly underestimating the uncertainty faced by the shers.

   The model results show that it is optimal for the representative shery to preserve the

biomass for future harvesting, and that if the biomass suers signicant negative shocks then

it is optimal to drastically reduce exploitation, even fully stopping the harvest in scenarios

of low biomass or low resource prices. That is, the optimal harvesting policy exhibits strong

nancial incentives to avoid the extinction of the natural resource.

   This paper also contributes to the research in the valuation of marine resources using

Real Options.   The closest paper to ours are Murillas (2001) and Poudel (2013), in which

this approach is used to value capital investments in sheries using a model with uncertainty

in the growth of the sh and in the capital, a linear production cost function with no xed

cost, but no uncertainty in the resource price.

   Finally, this paper contributes to the marine sheries literature by presenting empirical


                                               3
estimations for all the parameters required to solve the model. Data for the British Columbia

halibut shery is used because of its availability.           Data was collected from several sources
                                                                          1

Canada (DFO) . Cost data is hard to nd, as Clark et al. (2009) already indicated, so we

use the two available nancial surveys performed for the DFO by Nelson (2009) and Nelson

(2011) to identify the parameters of the modeled cost function.


   In summary, this paper presents a Real Option approach to valuing sheries under the

optimal harvesting policy, including a full parameter estimation for its implementation to

study the optimal policies and value marine shery rights for the British Columbia halibut.

This approach is not only useful to value extraction rights for a current level of our state

variables, it also allows us to understand how it evolves over time, and presents evidence for

the value of conservation of the natural resource and the possibility of achieving an economic

sustainable equilibrium.


   The paper proceeds as following. The valuation model is presented in section 2. Section

3 provides a detailed implementation of the approach using data for the British Columbia

halibut shery.         Section 4 gives our concluding remarks.        Details on the employed data,

estimation methods, and the solution algorithm are provided in the Appendix.




     II.          A Valuation Model of Marine Fisheries Rights

In this section we develop a dynamic stochastic economic model to study how sheries should

optimally harvest the resource. The value of the marine shery is assumed to depend on two

stochastic variables: the biomass and the price of sh. Following Pindyck (1984) the dynamic

of the biomass of the resource is assumed to follow:



                                      dI = [G (I) â q] dt + ÏI IdZI                                (1)



where   I   is the biomass,  G (I) is the instantaneous expected rate of growth of the biomass, dZI
is a standard Wiener        process, ÏI is the volatility of the unanticipated shocks to the resource

stock, and    q   is the harvesting rate, which is the stochastic control in the model.


   Consistent with the literature (Clark (2010)), the instantaneous growth rate of the biomass

is assumed to follow a logistic function. This function explicitly captures the fact that if the

biomass approaches its carrying capacity         I max ,   resources in the environment become scarce

reducing the natural growth to zero.          On the other hand, when the biomass is bellow its

depensation level     I min ,   reproduction falls as matching is less frequent and the resource is

in danger of extinction. Considering these characteristics the logistic function is presented

Equation 2:

      Figure 1 shows the previously mentioned logistic function features for the parameters

Î³ = 0.8, I min = 10, I max = 150:

      To illustrate the dynamic behaviour of a biomass with logistic natural growth, we simulate

the evolution of a population subject to a constant annual harvest of                     q.   10,0000 dierent

paths are simulated over a 100 years time horizon. For this exercise we assume that the initial

biomass is    I0 = 100 and the growth parameters are {I min = 10, I max = 150, Î³ = 0.8, ÏI = 5%}
for   G(I).   Figure 2 presents the median of the simulated biomass path for three dierent levels

of constant annual extraction rates,       q = 2, q = 7,        and   q = 10.

      This exercise illustrates how variable the long-term biomass can be. For the harvesting

policy   q = 2 the shery is sustainable with a long term biomass higher than its initial size,
for   q = 7 a scenario in which the biomass slowly decreases but is sustainable, and for q = 10
a scenario in which the biomass decreases in every period nally reaching extinction by year

24. Naturally, in our model the optimal harvesting policy                 q   will not be constant and it will

evolve with the state variables.


      The second source of uncertainty is the resource price. As is traditional in the nance

literature, we assume that the logarithm of the resource price follows an arithmetic Brownian

motion:

                                             d ln P = Î½P dt + ÏP dZp                                       (3)


where    P   is the unit sh price,   Î½P   is the expected instantaneous rate of change in the logarithm

of price,    ÏP    is the diusion coecient and         dZP   is a Wiener process.        We assume that the
                                                                                       3
price and biomass shocks are uncorrelated, that is              E [dZI Ã dZP ] = 0.
      Consider an innitely-lived value maximizing shery, with the equiptment in place and

the right to harvest a particular sh specie. The company's cash ow per unit of time from

sh harvesting is equal to the revenues minus he costs:



                                           Ï(I, P, q) = P Ã q â c (I, q)                                   (4)



      c (I, q)   is the operating cost function of harvesting       q   given by the quadratic equation:

                                        ï£±

                              c(I, q) =                                                                    (5)
                                        ï£³0                              if q = 0

where c0 is the xed cost,      c1 is the variable cost, c2 is the quadratic cost reecting an increasing
marginal cost, and        Ï   is the shing power parameter, or catchability, which captures the

eciency of the extraction technology, that is, when sh is abundant variable costs are lower.


      As indicated at the case     q = 0,     the cost function reects an assumption that production

can be costlessly shut down and reopened. This assumption is not critical for the presented

results, and a solution for a model on which the shery pays the xed cost if not producing

is included on the Appendix.


      With respect to the increasing marginal cost, it is included to capture potential costs

required to achieve harvesting beyond the current levels. Examples of these costs may be

   3 This assumption was initially made for computational convenience and can be easily relaxed, although we
tested the independence of the historical realizations of both stochastic processes nding that the correlation
between them is 0.01, and not statistically dierent from zero.

nding new personal, increasing the eet capacity, or investing in new technology.                          The

presented function is a simple way to include this realistic feature of the costs faced by

sheries.

were   V (I, P )   is the value of the shery under the optimal policy           q â (I, P ).   As the present

value of the cash ows is maximized over the set of feasible harvesting policies it is not

dependent of this function anymore.




A.     Boundary Conditions and Constraints


The value of the shery must satisfy the HJB equation presented in Equation 9 subject to

the following boundary conditions:




                                                         7
                                                                                                      4
   1. If the price of the sh drops to zero, the value of the shery must also go to zero :



                                                  V (I, 0) = 0                                            (10)



   2. If the resource biomass is lower than the depensation level               I min ,   sheries will face

      resource extinction, thus the value of the shery must fall to zero:


                                            Ë P ) = 0 f or IË â¤ I min
                                         V (I,                                                            (11)



   3. If the resource biomass is lower than the depensation level           I min ,   all shing must stop.

      This impose the following constraint on the stochastic control:


                                            Ë P ) = 0 f or IË â¤ I min
                                          q(I,                                                            (12)



   The listed boundary conditions are chosen primarily to reect nancial or technological

restrictions. The complete valuation of marine sheries rights is the solution to Equation 9,

with respect to the optimal harvesting policy and the boundary conditions 10, 11 and 12.

Together, these equations determine the optimal harvesting policy             q â (I, P )   and the value of

the shery   V (I, P ) under this policy.   A value-function iteration algorithm is implemented to

numerically solve the model. Details of this approach are provided in the Appendix.


   In Section III we present the model solution using data of the British Columbia hal-

ibut shery, including estimation of the relevant parameters, the harvesting policy, and the

shery's value.




       III.       The British Columbia Halibut Fishery Case

To illustrate the implementation of the methodology proposed in this article we calibrate and

solve the model for the case of the British Columbia halibut. We use data from the Inter-

national Pacic Halibut Commission (IPHC), established in 1923 by a convention between

Canada and the U.S. for the preservation of the Pacic halibut shery. The IPHC provides

recommendations to these governments on the total catch limit and monitors the resource

over the regulatory areas presented in Figure 3. We focus on the area 2B corresponding to

British Columbia.
   4 Altough this is true, note however that given the stochastic process in Equation 3 the price will never
reach zero

     Our second source of data is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans of Canada (DFO),

agency responsible for ...sustainably manage sheries and aquaculture and work with sh-

ers, coastal and Indigenous communities to enable their continued prosperity from sh and
            5
seafood.       Specically, we use the British Columbia halibut landing price data and nancial

reports published on their site.


     In the following subsections we present the estimations for the parameters of the BC

halibut biomass dynamic, price dynamic, cost function, and risk adjusted discount rate.

With all the estimated parameters we end this section by presenting and discussing the

model results.




A.     Parameter Estimation


A.1.    British Columbia Halibut Biomass Dynamic Parameters


Although the biomass is not perfectly known, the stock assessment provided by Stewart and

Hicks (2017) and Stewart and Webster (2017) is the closest proxy to its true magnitude.

As detailed in the cited documents the biomass estimation is the result of a combination of

several models which use short and long term data. Figure 4 shows the time series for the

biomass and the landings of halibut for the British Columbia region, for the period 1996-2017.

                                                  9
Figure 4: British Columbia halibut stock assessment and landings, 1996-2017. Source: IPHC.


    Panel A of Figure 4 shows that the biomass exhibited a strong decline between 1996

and 2000, period also characterized by high harvesting as Panel B of Figure 4 exhibits. By

2010 the biomass was almost half of the 1996 level and harvesting was reduced to levels that

remain controlled.

    Using this data we estimate the parameters of the biomass logistic growth function, and

the volatility of the random shocks. Combining a discrete version of Equations (1) and (2)

we obtain the non-linear regression:


                                    (It â I min )                    (It â I min )
                                                                                     
                      It+1 â It qt
                               + =Î³                             1 â max                   + t                   (13)
                          It    It       It                        (I     â I min )

    Equation 13 is a non-linear function of the required parameters, so the estimation is done
                                                       6
using the Damped Least Squares technique , the results of this approach are presented in

Table I.


              Table I: Estimated Parameters for the Biomass Dynamic, 1996-2017
The parameters are estimated using Damped Least Squares (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm).                    The data
covers from 1996 to 2017 and is provided by the IPHC. All coecients are estimated simultaneously. The
volatility of the residuals of the estimated regression corresponds to the parameter      ÏI   presented in the model.

    Figure 5 illustrates the goodness of t of the estimation by comparing the biomass natural

historical growth rate (LHS of Equation (13)) versus the growth (Expected value of the RHS

of Equation (13) calculated using the estimated parameters.

   6 The technique is also known as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. For technical details check Heer
and Maussner (2009)

   Figure 5 shows that the estimated parameters are eective in capturing the relation

between the biomass level and its growth, although there is a signicant level of biological

uncertainty captured by   ÏI ,   which explains the overall dierence between the tted model

and the data.

From the Department of Fisheries and Oceans of Canada (DFO) website , we gather the

halibut ex-vessel historical prices for British Columbia. The time series covers from 1990 to

2016 and is used to compute the annual logarithmic return of the halibut price. These returns

are deated using the CPI for the British Columbia province.       Figure 6 presents the time

series of halibut prices (Panel A) and the distribution of the real logarithmic price returns

(Panel B).

A.3.       British Columbia Halibut Fishery Costs Parameters


The model's cost function is presented in Equation 5 and includes a xed operating cost, a

linear harvesting cost which is related to the biomass through the shery's eciency (catch-

ability), and an increasing marginal cost captured by the quadratic component. The param-

eters of this function are estimated using two surveys performed by Nelson Bros Fisheries

Ltd. for the DFO (Nelson (2009) and Nelson (2011)), these surveys are summarized in Table

III:


               Table III: British Columbia Halibut Fishery Revenues, 2007 and 2009
The values are obtained from the reports prepared for the DFO-Pacic Region by Stuart Nelson of Nelson

Bros Fisheries Ltd. (Nelson (2009) and Nelson (2011)), and provide estimates of the nancial performance for

vessels operating in British Columbia for the years 2009 and 2007. These reports are done with a combination

of data from the DFO and consultant collected information through interviews/correspondence with shermen

and experts. Group 1 is the group of vessels with the highest third individual landings, Group 2 is the group

of vessels with the middle third individual landings, and Group 3 is the group of vessels with the lowest third

individual landings. All values are expressed in 2017 CAD using the CPI for British Columbia.

       Table III presents two years of costs and revenues for the British Columbia halibut sh-

eries. During 2007 the sheries registered higher harvest and lower costs in comparison to

2009. All dollar values are inated using the British Columbia CPI and expressed in 2017

Canadian Dollars (CAD), making all future costs estimations and values comparable.


                                                        12
    The parameters of the cost function are determined solving an over-identied system of
                                   8
equations for the daily cost , that is, we solve Equation 5 by leaving one parameter free, in

this case   c2 ,   and then solve for the remaining two   c0 , c1 ,   subject to   c0 > 0, c1 > 0 and c2 > 0.
    Using the dierent groups of shers presented in Table III several combinations of them

can be used to identify the required parameters. Over all these combinations, the highest
                              9
cost-ecient production           is achieved using the data of {Group 1(2007), Group 1(2009)}, and

the lowest cost-ecient production is obtained when using data of {Group 3(2007), Group

3(2009)}. To implement our model, we use the set {Group 2(2007), Group 2(2009)}, as it

represent the intermediate eciency case.


    For {Group 2(2007), Group 2(2009)}, the set of feasible values for the parameter                    c2   is

[1, 110],   that is, if   c2 > 110 =â c1 < 0.        For the quadratic cost parameter we choose a

value at the percentile 30% of the feasible values, that is           c2 = 35.   This value gives a balanced

combination between the increasing marginal cost and the linear component of the harvesting

cost.


    As mentioned, the parameters are the solution of an over-identied system for the same

pair of costs, so all combinations of parameters trade o weight between the quadratic and

liner component of the cost to generate the same total cost.                 Selecting the percentile 30%

gives a positive weight to the quadratic component but still keeps more weight on the linear

cost component, which has been the standard cost model in the sheries valuation literature.

To check for the sensitivity of this assumption, we also estimate the parameters for                c2 = 55.

    Figure 7 complements the results presented in Table IV by illustrating how the proposed

parametrizations dier over the feasible range of harvesting.




Figure 7: Proposed Parametrization for the Cost Function. British Columbia Halibut Fishery.


    The gure shows how both cost parametrizations are similar for observed harvest of each

of the studied groups (between 1 and 4 million pounds per year), but when the harvesting

increases the costs diverge, showing how the quadratic component of the cost generates a

higher total cost when production growths beyond the previously observed levels.

    Although we are able to provide a parametrization of the cost function, it is clear that

more data will be necessary to achieve a better implementation of the model. Clark et al.


                                                              14
(2009) already pointed out this issue, and unfortunately these surveys are not available

for other years. Any eort to fully implement the model will have to deal with the lack of

information of the production costs, which will require collecting and standardizing additional

information.




A.4.     Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate


To estimate the risk adjusted discount rate for sheries we look at the historical returns for

companies classied as Fisheries using the SIC industrial classication, which codes are:



    â¢   0912: Fisheries, Finsh


    â¢   0913: Fisheries, Shellsh


    â¢   0919: Miscellaneous Marine Products


    â¢   0921: Fish Hatcheries and Preserves



    Unfortunately not a signicant number of rms are recorded on CRSP with the identied

SIC codes. In Fama and French (1997) however, these rms are included in the macro-sector

portfolio Agriculture. We use this portfolio denition to obtain a robust estimation of the

sector beta and the expected rate of return. The CRISP database is used to obtain the rm's
                                                                                                       10
stock returns and the historical risk-premium is obtained from Kenneth R. French site                       .


    For the returns of each rm registered in the Agriculture portfolio, 60-months rolling

betas are computed.       The median beta for the Agriculture portfolio during the 1987-2016

period is   0.35.   Combining this value with the historical risk premium and risk-free rate

the estimated real rate of return for a shery company is             2.9%.   The detailed calculation is

presented in Table V

The included beta is the annual average of the median 60-months rolling betas of the rms registered in the
Agriculture portfolio. The risk premium and risk-free rate are obtained from the historical excess of return
for the Canadian stock and bond market. The Bank of Canada ination target of 2% is used to obtain the
real rate using the continuous compounding Fisher equation.       Data from CRSP and Ken French website.

     The range of nominal rates of returns for sheries is               [0.049, 0.076].      Marine Harvest ASA

has the most recent data, and its rate of return is consistent with the estimation presented

in Table V, therefore, this will be the primary risk adjusted real rate of discount used in the

model.




B.     Model Solution: The Value-Function Iteration Approach


To solve the HamiltonJacobiBellman equation for the shery's value                            V (I, P ),   we follow

the Value-Function Iteration Approach as presented in Heer and Maussner (2009). We start

from Equation 9:



                     V (I, P ) = max Ï (I, P, q(I, P )) + eârât E {V (I 0 , P 0 ) |I, P }
                                                                                         
                                                                                                                  (14)
                                      qâ¥0


where   q(I, P )   is the extraction policy, and    (I 0 , P 0 )   is the state in   ât   units of time of the two

stochastic variables in our model, the price and the biomass.

     The problem is re- written using a discretization of the continuous-time formulation.

Dene the state space for the biomass and the resource price as                            (In , Pm ),   where   In â
{I1 , I2 , ..., IN } and Pm â {P1 , P2 , ..., PM }. The optimal control is also                  discretized to the

set qj â {0, q1 , ..., qJ }. Over the state space the function V = Vnm is                        a   N ÃM      matrix

representing the value of the shery for the state (In , Pm ).

     The biomass and the price stochastic shocks are denote by                 ZI    and   ZP   respectively. These

shocks are i.i.d. and normally distributed. The shocks discretization is a nite Markov chain

ZkI â {Z1I , Z2I , ...., ZK
                          I
                            }    ZlP â {Z1P , Z2P , ...., ZLP } for the biomass and the resource price
                                and
                                                       I       I
respectively. For the      biomass growth shocks Î» = Î»k represents the probability of transition


                                                       16
from the current shock of the biomass                     Z0I    to a shock       ZkI    in the next period. For the price
             P
shocks   Î» =        Î»Pl represents the probability of transition from the current price shock                        Z0P   to
           P
a   shock Zl .       Using this discretization of the state space, value function, harvesting policies

and stochastic shocks, Equation 14 can then be re-written as:

                                                       ârât
    Vn,m =        max              Ï(In , Pm , qj ) + e                   Î»Ik   Ã Î»Pl   Ã V (In + âIn , Pm + âPm )       (15)
             qj â{0,q2 ,...,qJ }
                                                                k=1 l=1


where    In + âIn         and      Pm + âPm      are the state of the biomass and price in               ât   units of time.

These variables are dened using the discrete-time version of Equations 1 and 3 and are

formalized for a specic policy                qj   and stochastic shocks           (ZkI , ZlP )   as:

                                                                            â
                                    In + âIn = In + (G(In ) â qj )ât + In ÏI âtZkI                                       (16)

                                                                                   â
                                                                                        âtZlP
                                              Pm + âPm = Pm eÎ½P ât+ÏP                                                    (17)


The solution algorithm follows Heer and Maussner (2009). It starts from a guess of the value-
             0
function  Vn,m  and iterates over the dened state space. In each point of the two-dimensional

state (In , Pm ) the right-hand-side of Equation 15 is maximized using the stochastic opti-

mal control qj . If the optimized value of the current iteration is greater than the previous

iteration value-function for the state, the old value-function is replaced by the current itera-

tion maximized value. The process is repeated until no signicant changes are made to the

value-function in the latter iteration.


      To complement this short description we present a formal scheme of the solution algorithm

in the Appendix. The following section presents the results of the application of the value-

function iteration approach for the British Columbia halibut shery.




C.      Numerical Results


As previously mentioned the model is solved for the British Columbia halibut shery. Based

on Clark (2010) we consider a 150 days season, therefore the relevant time step for our

numerical solution is              ât = 1/150.       The rest of the parameters used to solve the model are

summarized in Table VII.

     The grids for the state space, policies, and random shocks are constructed dividing a

specied set in an equally-spaced discrete points. For the biomass grid boundaries are the es-

timated depensation level             I min , and carrying capacity I max .          For the price grid the boundaries

are the    99%   condence interval, for a 10 year time horizon, constructed using the historical

price distribution.           For the policy grid we use a boundary of 20 million pounds per year,

which is high in comparison to the current 7.45 million pounds limit, avoiding in this way

having a binding upper limit on the harvesting. The specic dimensions and boundaries for

these sets are presented in Table VIII:

     On the following subsections results for two set of parameters are presented. In the rst

we use the estimated real risk adjusted shery discount rate of                          2.8%.    Results for a social rate

of   1%   are included in the subsequent section.



                                                                  18
    The model results for an alternative cost function parametrization, and a shery which

has to pay the xed cost in case of not producing, are included in the Appendix. The main

characteristic and main conclusions of the following numerical results do not drastically

change on these additional cases.




C.1.       Value Function and Harvesting Policies for the British Columbia Halibut

           Fishery Parametrization and Real Risk Adjusted Discount Rate


The result for the value of the British Columbia halibut shery under the optimal harvesting

policy is reported in Figure 8.




Figure 8:      Value of the British Columbia Halibut Fishery Using the Real Risk Adjusted
Fishery Discount Rate of      2.8%

    As the resource price increases, current revenues and the incentives to increase the har-

vest also increase.     But this will diminish the biomass level, reducing the future resources

growth and increasing the future marginal cost trough the catchability of the resource. This

represents the main economic trade-o in the model.


    This trade-o can be observed in Figure 8. As the marginal increment in the value of the

shery is positive when the price or the biomass grow. The marginal increment in the value

over the state space is non-linear, however, an extra unit of biomass becomes more valuable

in high price states in comparison to low price states, as in high biomass states an extra unit

not only improves the the current and future prots in a high price state, it also reduces the

extraction cost.


    The value of the shery is zero in the case that the biomass reaches the lower boundary

I min ,   reecting that once this level is reached extinction becomes inevitable.




                                                 19
Figure 9: Optimal Harvesting Policy of the British Columbia Halibut Fishery Using The
Real Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate         2.8%

      The optimal harvesting policy is chosen to maximize the value of the shery. This value

is shown in Figure 8. Now we turn to examine the optimal harvesting policy for dierent

values of the state variables. Figure 9 illustrates the range of daily optimal harvesting, which

goes from zero, in states of low biomass and price, to approximately 0.13 million pounds per

day (20 million pounds per year) in states of high price and biomass at its carrying capacity
     max
(I         = 85   million pounds). The optimal harvesting policy is also a non-linear function of

the state variables.


      For example, the harvesting policy in a high price state ($20 CAD per pound) goes from

zero to 0.13 million pound per day as the biomass increases, but if the price is low ($5 CAD

per pound) harvesting goes from zero to just 0.04 million pound per day. Table IX presents

results for the value function and optimal harvesting policies for dierent values of the state

space, including the current level of biomass and halibut price.


      Figure 9 also indicates that the shery should optimally close operations temporarily in

several states, most of them characterized by low biomass and low sh prices. The periods

without harvesting allow the stock to recover, increasing future growth and reducing future

harvesting costs.

     Panel A of Table IX shows that the value of British Columbia halibut shery at the

current state is approximately $2.52 billion CAD. The optimal harvesting policy will be 7.44

million pounds per year, which is consistent with the current total annual sh catch (TAC)

of of 7.45 million pounds per year.


     The extraction optimal policy presented in Panel B of Table IX illustrates how it changes

for dierent values of the state space, highlighting the importance of a dynamic harvesting

rights system which adjust promptly to changes on the resource price and biomass assessment.




C.2.      Simulations of the Biomass and Harvesting Policies for the British Columbia
          Halibut Parametrization and Risk Adjusted Discount Rate


To illustrate how the halibut biomass will evolve if the optimal harvesting policy is im-

plemented, simulations of the price and biomass are generated combining their respective

distribution with the optimal policy.             We simulate   10, 000   dierent paths over an horizon

I0 = 57.82 million pounds and P0 = 7.75 CAD per pound.
     Figure 10 presents two dierent paths for the simulated sh price, biomass, and harvesting

policy over a 10 year horizon.

Figure 10: Simulated paths for the Price, Biomass, and Optimal Harvesting Policy for the
British Columbia Halibut Fishery Using The Real Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate                       2.8%.

   Figure 10 shows a signicant variability of the optimal harvest for the simulated paths.

As the two states variables experience random shocks, the uncertainty faced by sheries is

signicant, and the optimal harvesting policy adjusts reecting those changes. Path 1 is

characterized by negative price shocks during the rst 5 simulated years, which generates a

reduction in the harvesting, even reaching a zero harvest period by the end of year 8. As

the price remains low not a signicant amount of resource is extracted (approximately 0.03

million pounds per day, 4.5 million pounds per year), allowing the biomass to growth, even
                                     max
reaching its carrying capacity (I          ) at year 6. Path 2 diers by exhibiting a high price

level for most of the simulation.      As a consequence, the extraction policy remains at high

levels (approximately 0.07 million pounds per day, 10.5 million pounds per year), and the

biomass remains at a level close to the initial state even after suering positive shocks by the

end of year 5.


   Panel A of Figure 11 shows the median, and the                 1th   and   99th   percentiles, of the biomass

dynamic paths.     The median biomass is characterized by a growth period on which the

harvesting progressively increases, and by the end of the simulation the biomass median

level is higher that the initial state.      The   1th   percentile of the biomass indicates that the

there are several paths on which the biomass decreases, but it always remains away from

depletion. The   99th   percent percentile illustrates that in paths of positive biomass shocks the
                                                         max
biomass will approach its carrying capacity (I                 ). Panel B of Figure 11 provides the same



                                                    22
information for the optimal harvesting policy.

Rate   2.8%.

   These simulations exemplify the results of the model.            First, we observe a signicant

amount of uncertainty and a harvesting policy which adjusts promptly. Second, we notice

that the biomass will increase in most of the simulated paths and it will not reach levels

close to extinction with    99%    probability, presenting strong evidence for the intuition that

conservation is economically optimal.




C.3.    The British Columbia Halibut Fishery Parametrization and a Social Dis-

        count Rate


The previous results are computed using a private discount rate. Given that this market is

regulated by governmental institutions and resources are publicly owned, its important to

understand how these results will change if a social discount rate is used (Clark and Munro

(2017)). We set the social real discount rate to      1%, increasing the weight of future cash ows
relative to current cash ows and the importance of the conservation of the resource. Figure

12 present the results for the value function and harvesting policies for the model using this

new rate.




                                                    23
Figure 12: Value and Optimal Harvesting Policy for the British Columbia Halibut Fishery
Using the Social Discount Rate of   1%

   The value of the shery increases in comparison to the private discount rate as the future

cash ows have a higher present value.      With respect to the extraction policy the main

dierence is that there are more states with a no extraction policy, indicating that the value

of future revenues generated by conservation increase as they are discounted at a lower rate.

   As in the previous section we simulate 10,000 paths for the biomass and the halibut price,

over a   10   Years horizon and calculate the annual percentiles and median for the optimal

harvesting and the biomass over the simulations.        This allows us to compare the results

with the ones obtained using a private discount rate. We present the annual percentiles and

harvesting median over the simulated paths.




Figure 13: Simulated Biomass and Harvesting Policy for the British Columbia Halibut Fish-
ery Using the Social Discount Rate of    1%,   Compared to the Simulations Computed Using
The Real Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate        2.8%.

   Figure 13 shows that when using a social discount rate the model generates a higher

median biomass over all the simulated period. This is the result of a harvesting policy which


                                               24
is also smaller than when discounting with the private rate over all the period.

   Panel A of Figure 14 reports the volatility of the biomass over all the simulations. Al-

though both simulations are subject to the same sources of uncertainty, the overall variability

of the resource stock is lower when we use a social discount rate. This is evidence of a more

conservative extraction resulting in less extreme scenarios. Panel B of Figure 14 shows the   1th
percentile of the simulated biomass. This percentile of the simulated paths is higher for the

social rate of discount. Thus, there is even a smaller probability of observing the depletion

of the resource in this case.

Halibut Fishery Using the Social Discount Rate of      1%,   Compared to the Simulations Com-
puted Using The Real Risk Adjusted Fishery Discount Rate         2.8%.

   In summary, when the social discount rate is used, the optimal harvest policy is lower and

a zero harvest is more common than in the case where the private discount rate is used. Under

this optimal policy the variability of the biomass paths is reduced and in most cases it is

optimal to increase the biomass growth, prioritizing future resource stock over contemporary

revenues.




                                    IV.     Conclusions

This article develops and implement a Real Option approach to value a renewable natural

resource with two sources of uncertainty: the resource stock and the price. The solution of

the model is obtained by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the value of the

Fishery.    To achieve this goal we follow a value-function iteration approach.    Overall, the

results highlight the strong non-linear relation between the biomass and the resource price

on the value of the shery and the optimal harvesting policy, and the importance of the

option to shut down and re-open the sheries.


                                                25
   The solution is implemented using the estimated parameters for the British Columbia

halibut shery, for which we include the methodological details and data to help future

research. The model results are used to simulate the dynamic of the studied shery, nding

that in the majority of the simulated paths it is optimal to increase the biomass. For negative

shocks to the biomass growth we obtain reductions of the resource stock, but the performed

simulations present evidence that with 99% probability we will not observe biomass levels

close to the extinction. For the current state   I0 = 57.82   million pounds,   P0 = 7.75   CAD per

pound, we found an optimal annual harvesting policy is 7.4 million pounds per year, which

is comparable with the current harvesting levels.


   We repeat the analysis for a social discount rate, nding that a zero harvest policy is more

common over the state space, and that the variability of the simulated harvesting policies and

biomass are reduced. In this case conservation becomes increasingly valuable so the optimal

harvest prioritizes future resource stock over current revenues.


   The model solved for a realistic set of parameters suggests that an economically viable

shery is feasible, that overshing is indeed not optimal, even in the presence of two signicant

sources of uncertainty as the sh price and the biomass stock. This highlights the value of

conservation and that current eorts to control overshing are indeed ecient from a social

and a nancial perspective.

           Appendix A: Value-Function Algorithm Scheme

In this section we sketch the solution algorithm, describing the key steps, but abstracting

from detailed calculations. Broadly, we start from an initial value function and iterate over

the policy space until a maximum is attained. The outcome of the process is the maximized

value-function, and the optimal policy, for each point in our two-dimensional state space.


Step 1: Initialize      v0 .
     To dene the initial value of the value function, we use a coarse grid on the dened

interval   [I1 , IN ] Ã [P1 , PM ],   and compute using our algorithm. Then, we use our desired grid,

interpolate using the coarse grid, and the estimated value function, to obtain an initial value

function on the ner desired grid.


Step 2: Compute a new value function                         v1 ,   and the policy       q1 .
     For each   (n, m) â {(1, 1) , (1, 2) , .., (N, M )}                 repeat the following steps:

   Figure 16 shows the simulated biomass and optimal harvesting policy with the new

parametrization of the cost function.    The optimal harvesting policy is in general lower

than in the case presented in the main text. For example, for the current state space the

optimal harvesting is 6.27 million pounds per year versus 7.44 million pounds per year for

the previous case. As a consequence, the level of the biomass is higher for the median and

the 1% and 99% percentiles.

   Figure 17 illustrates that the value function and the harvesting policies are similar to

the previously presented cases, being the main dierence that when closing is costly the no

harvesting region is smaller, but this dierences are observed only in low price states, which

are in most of the cases not highly probable. Overall, these results indicate that the costlessly

shutdown assumption is not critical for the results presented in the main text.
