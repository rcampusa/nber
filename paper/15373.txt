How likely is a catastrophic event that would substantially reduce the capital stock, GDP and wealth?
How much should society be willing to pay to reduce the probability or impact of a catastrophe? We
answer these questions and provide a framework for policy analysis using a general equilibrium model
of production, capital accumulation, and household preferences. Calibrating the model to economic
and financial data, we estimate the mean arrival rate of shocks and their size distribution, the tax on
consumption society would accept to limit the maximum size of a catastrophic shock, and the cost
to insure against its impact.

       What is the likelihood that the U.S. will experience a devastating catastrophic event over
the next few decades? And how much should society be willing to pay to limit the possible
impact of such an event? By “catastrophic event,” we mean something national or global
in scale that would substantially reduce the capital stock and/or the productive efficiency
of capital, thereby substantially reducing GDP, consumption, and wealth. Examples might
include a nuclear or biological terrorist attack (far worse than even 9/11), a highly contagious
“mega-virus” that spreads uncontrollably, a global environmental disaster, or a financial and
economic crisis on the order of the Great Depression.1 We show how the probability and
possible impact of such an event can be inferred from the behavior of economic and financial
variables such as investment, interest rates, and equity returns. We also show how our
framework can be used to estimate the amount society should be willing to pay to reduce
the probability of a catastrophic event, or to insure against its actual impact should it occur.
       An emerging literature has used historical data to estimate the likelihood and expected
impact of catastrophic events.2 Examples include Barro (2006, 2009), Barro and Ursúa
(2008), and Barro et al. (2009).3 These studies, however, are limited in two respects. First,
many of the included disasters are manifestations of three global events — the two World
Wars and the Great Depression. Second, the possible catastrophic events that we think are of
greatest interest today have little or no historical precedent — there are no data, for example,
on the frequency or impact of nuclear or biological terrorist attacks. Or consider the forty-
year period beginning around 1950 and ending with the breakup of the Soviet Union, during
   1
    Readers who are incurable optimists or have limited imaginations should read Posner (2004), who pro-
vides more examples and argues that society fails to take these risks seriously enough, and Sunstein (2007).
For a sobering discussion of the likelihood and possible impact of nuclear terrorism, see Allison (2004).
   2
     The roots of this literature go back to the observation by Rietz (1988) that low-probability catastrophes
might explain the equity premium puzzle first noted by Mehra and Prescott (1985), i.e., could help reconcile
a relatively large equity premium (5 to 7%) and low real risk-free rate of interest (0 to 2%) with moderate
risk aversion on the part of households. Weitzman (2007) has shown that the equity premium and real
risk-free rate puzzles could alternatively be explained by “structural uncertainty” in which one or more key
parameters, such as the true variance of equity returns, is estimated through Bayesian updating.
   3
    In related work, Gourio (2008) modeled an exchange economy with recursive preferences and disasters
that have limited duration. He found that the effect of recoveries on the equity premium could be positive
or negative, depending on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Gabaix (2008) and Wachter (2008)
showed that a time-varying disaster arrival rate could explain the high volatility of the stock market (in
addition to the equity premium and real risk-free rate).


                                                      2
which one potential catastrophic event dominated all others: the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet
nuclear war. The Department of Defense, the RAND Corporation and others studied the
likelihood and potential impact of such an event, but there was no historical precedent on
which to base estimates.
       We take a different approach from earlier studies and ask what event arrival rate and
impact distribution are implied by the behavior of basic economic and financial variables.
We do not try to estimate the characteristics of catastrophic events from historical data
on drops in consumption or GDP, nor do we use the estimates of others. Instead, we
develop an equilibrium model of the economy that incorporates catastrophic shocks to the
capital stock, and that links the first four moments of equity returns, along with economic
variables such as consumption, investment, interest rates, and Tobin’s q, to parameters
describing the characteristics of shocks as well as behavioral parameters such as the coefficient
of relative risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We can then determine
the characteristics of catastrophes as a calibration output of our analysis. In effect, we are
assuming that these characteristics are those perceived by firms and households, in that they
are consistent with the data for key economic and financial variables.4
       Our framework also provides a tool for policy analysis. For example, how much should
society be willing to pay to reduce or limit the impact of a catastrophic event? To measure
“willingness to pay” (WTP), we calculate the maximum permanent percentage tax rate that
society should be willing to accept in order to eliminate the possibility of a catastrophic
shock, or reduce the maximum possible impact of such as shock. We also show how our
framework can be used to calculate the equilibrium price of insurance against catastrophic
risk, and we compare the use of insurance to the cost of reducing or eliminating risk.
       In the next section we lay out a parsimonious model with an AK production technol-
ogy, adjustment costs (which we show are crucial), and shocks that arrive unpredictably.
Each shock destroys a random fraction of the capital stock. We treat as catastrophic those
   4
    In related work, Russett and Slemrod (1993) used survey data to show how beliefs about the likelihood
of nuclear war affected savings behavior, and argue that such beliefs can help explain the low propensity to
save in the U.S. relative to other countries. Also, see Slemrod (1990) and Russett and Lackey (1987).



                                                     3
shocks that reduce the capital stock by a “large” amount, e.g., something more than 10
or 15 percent. We explain how the model’s calibration yields information about the char-
acteristics of shocks, as well as important behavioral parameters, and we show how all of
the parameters of the model can be identified. Proceeding in stages, we show (1) how the
variance, skewness, and kurtosis of equity returns can be used to identify the parameters
that characterize shocks to the capital stock; (2) how the equity risk premium can then be
used to identify the coefficient of relative risk aversion; (3) how, given these parameters, the
risk-free interest rate then identifies the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and/or the
rate of time preference; and (4) how the consumption-investment ratio and the real growth
rate of GDP then determine the marginal propensity to consume, Tobin’s q, and investment.
We also explain how the calibrated model can be used to determine the equilibrium price of
insurance against catastrophic risk.
    To calibrate the model, we use data for the U.S. economy and financial markets over
the period 1947 through 2008. Section 3 presents our calibration results and discusses their
implications for the characteristics of shocks and for behavioral parameters. Section 3 also
shows the implications of the model for the price of insurance against catastrophes of var-
ious sizes, and demonstrates the importance of adjustment costs. Section 4 discusses the
application of our framework to policy analysis. In particular, we calculate the maximum
permanent tax on consumption that society would accept to reduce or eliminate the impact
of catastrophic shocks. Section 5 concludes.


I     Framework.
In this section, we lay out the building blocks of a simple general equilibrium model and
then explain how the model is solved.

I.A    Building Blocks.

Preferences. We use the Duffie and Epstein (1992) continuous-time version of Epstein-
Weil-Zin (EWZ) preferences, so that a representative consumer has homothetic recursive


                                               4
preferences given by:5

                                                  t

where
                                                              −1
                                            ρ     C 1−ψ − ((1 − γ)V )ω
(2)                          f (C, V ) =                               .
                                         1 − ψ −1     ((1 − γ)V )ω−1
Here ρ is the rate of time preference, ψ the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS),
γ the coefficient of relative risk aversion, and we define ω = (1 − ψ −1 )/(1 − γ). Unlike
time-additive utility, recursive preferences as defined by eqns. (1) and (2) disentangle risk
aversion from the EIS. Note that with these preferences, the marginal benefit of consumption
is fC = ρC −ψ−1 /[(1 − γ)V ]ω−1 , which depends not only on current consumption but also
(through V ) on the expected trajectory of future consumption.
       If γ = ψ −1 so that ω = 1, we have the standard constant-relative-risk-aversion (CRRA)
expected utility, represented by the additively separable aggregator:

                                                      ρC 1−γ
(3)                                   f (C, V ) =            − ρV.
                                                      1−γ

One of the questions we address is whether γ is close to ψ −1 , so that the simple CRRA utility
function is a reasonable approximation for modeling purposes. More generally, we examine
how equilibrium allocation and pricing constrains the model’s parameters, including the EIS
and the coefficient of relative risk aversion.
       Production. Aggregate output has an AK production technology:

(4)                                             Y = AK ,

where A is a constant that defines productivity and the capital stock K is the sole factor of
production. The AK model is widely used, in part because it generates balanced growth in
equilibrium. In our specification, K is the total stock of capital; it includes physical capital
as traditionally measured, but also human capital and firm-based intangible capital (such
as, patents, know-how, brand value, and organizational capital).

   5
    Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990) developed homothetic non-expected utility in discrete time,
which separates the elasticity of intertermporal substitution from the coefficient of relative risk aversion.


                                                          5
       Shocks to the Capital Stock. We assume that discrete downward jumps to the capital
stock (“shocks”) occur as Poisson arrivals with a mean arrival rate λ. There is no limit to the
number of these shocks; the occurrence of a shock does not change the likelihood of another,
and in principle shocks can occur frequently.6 When a shock does occur, it permanently
destroys a stochastic fraction (1 − Z) of the capital stock K, so that Z is the remaining
fraction. (For example, if a shock destroyed 15 percent of capital stock, we would have
Z = .85.) We assume that Z follows a well-behaved probability density function (pdf) ζ(Z)
with 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1. By well-behaved, we mean that the moments E(Z n ) exist for n = 1, 1 − γ,
and −γ. As we will see, these are the only moments of Z that are relevant for our analysis.
       As we will show in Section 3 when we discuss the calibration of the model, shocks occur
frequently, but for most shocks losses are small. We consider catastrophes to be shocks for
which the drop in the capital stock is sufficiently large, e.g., more than 10 or 15 percent.
Using our calibration, we will see that the model predicts that catastrophic shocks are rare.
       The capital stock is also subject to ongoing continuous fluctuations. These continuous
fluctuations, along with small jumps, can be thought of as the stochastic depreciation of
capital. Large shocks, on the other hand, are interpreted as (rare) catastrophic events.
       Investment and Capital Accumulation. Letting I denote aggregate investment, the
capital stock K evolves as:

(5)                       dKt = Φ(It , Kt )dt + σKt dWt − (1 − Z)Kt dJt .

Here the parameter σ captures diffusion volatility, Wt is a standard Brownian motion process,
and Jt is a jump process with mean arrival rate λ that captures discrete shocks; if a jump
occurs, K falls by the random fraction (1 − Z). The adjustment cost function Φ(I, K)
captures effects of depreciation and costs of installing capital. Because installing capital
is costly, installed capital earns rents in equilibrium so that Tobin’s q, the ratio between
the market value and the replacement cost of capital, exceeds one. We assume Φ(I, K) is

   6
    Stochastic fluctuations in the capital stock have been widely used in the growth literature with an AK
technology, but unlike the existing literature, we examine the economic effects of shocks to capital that
involve discrete (catastrophic) jumps. See Jones and Manuelli (2005) for a survey of endogenous growth
models with with a stochastic AK technology.

homogeneous of degree one in I and K and thus can be written as:

(6)                                       Φ(I, K) = φ(i)K ,

where i = I/K and φ(i) is increasing and concave. Unlike other models of catastrophes, we
explicitly account for the effects of adjustment costs on equilibrium price and quantities.7
       For simplicity, we use a quadratic adjustment cost function, which can be viewed as a
second-order approximation to a more general one:

(7)                                      φ(i) = i − 21 θi2 − δ .

       Catastrophic Risk Insurance. We will use our model to determine the equilibrium
premium for catastrophic risk insurance. In order to make our analysis of insurance as general
as possible, we introduce catastrophic insurance swaps (CIS) for shocks of every possible size.
These swaps are defined as follows: a CIS for the survival fraction in the interval (Z, Z + dZ)
is a swap contract in which the buyer makes a continuum of payments p(Z)dZ to the seller
and in exchange receives a lump-sum payoff if and only if a shock with survival fraction in
(Z, Z + dZ) occurs. That is, the buyer stops paying the seller if and only if the defined
catastrophic event occurs and then collects one unit of the consumption good as a payoff
from the seller. Note the close analogy between our CIS contracts and the widely used credit
default swap (CDS) contracts. Unlike typical pricing models for CDS contracts, however,
ours is a general equilibrium model with an endogenously determined risk premium.

I.B       Competitive Equilibrium.

Our model can be solved as a social planning problem, but we want to assert that the result
is equivalent to a decentralized competitive equilibrium with complete markets. That is, we
assume that the following securities can be traded at each point in time: (i) a risk-free asset,
(ii) a claim on the value of capital of the representative firm, and (iii) insurance claims for
catastrophes with every possible recovery fraction Z.
   7
    Homogeneous adjustment cost functions are analytically tractable and have been widely used in the q
theory of investment literature. Hayashi (1982) showed that with homogeneous adjustment costs and perfect
capital markets, marginal and average q are equal. Jermann (1998) integrated this type of adjustment costs
into an equilibrium business cycle/asset pricing model.

                                                    7
   Because we allow for jumps in the capital stock, market completeness requires that agents
can trade these insurance claims. But note that as with the risk-free asset, in equilibrium
the demand for these insurance claims is zero. Although no trading of the risk-free asset
or insurance claims will occur in equilibrium, we allow for the possibility of trading so that
we can determine the equilibrium prices. In a representative agent model like ours, this
“zero demand” result is a natural consequence. With heterogeneous agents (differing, e.g.,
in preferences, endowments, or beliefs), there will be trading in general, with some agents
being buyers (i.e., holding long positions) and others being sellers (holding short positions)
of these assets. However, in equilibrium the prices of these assets will be such that the total
long positions will equal the total short positions, so that the market clears.
   We define the recursive competitive equilibrium as follows: (1) The representative con-
sumer dynamically chooses investments in the risk-free asset, risky equity, and various CIS
claims to maximize utility as given by eqns. (1) and (2). (2) The representative firm chooses
the level of investment that maximizes its market value, which is the present discounted
value of future cash flows, using the equilibrium stochastic discount factor. The consumer
and the firm make these choices taking the equilibrium prices of all assets and invest-
ment/consumption goods as given. (3) All markets clear. In particular, (i) the net supply
of the risk-free asset is zero; (ii) the demand for the claim to the representative firm is equal
to unity, the normalized aggregate supply; (iii) the net demand for the CIS of each possible
recovery fraction Z is zero; and (iv) the goods market clears, i.e., It = Yt − Ct at all t ≥ 0.
   These market-clearing conditions are standard. With these conditions, we can invoke the
welfare theorem to solve the social planner’s problem and obtain the competitive equilibrium
allocation, and then use the representative agent’s marginal utility to price all assets in the
economy. We emphasize that CIS insurance markets are crucial to dynamically complete
the markets. This is a fundamental difference between our model and models based purely
on diffusion processes without jump risk.
   We next summarize the solution of the model via the social planner’s problem, leaving
details to Appendix A. A separate appendix, available from the authors on request, derives
the decentralized competitive market equilibrium and shows that it yields the same solution.

I.C       Model Solution.

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the social planner’s allocation problem is:

                                                                                          
(8)      0 = max f (C, V ) + Φ(I, K)V 0 (K) + σ 2 K 2 V 00 (K) + λE [V (ZK) − V (K)]           ,
              C                              2
where V (K) is the value function and the expectation is with respect to the density function
ζ(Z) for the survival fraction Z. We have the following first-order condition for I:

(9)                               fC (C, V ) = ΦI (I, K)V 0 (K) .

The left-hand side of eqn. (9) is the marginal benefit of consumption. Unlike in standard
expected utility models, here fC depends on not just consumption C but also the contin-
uation utility V , which reflects the non-separability of preferences. The right-hand side is
its marginal cost, which equals the marginal value of capital V 0 (K) times the marginal effi-
ciency of converting a unit of the consumption good into a unit of capital, ΦI (I, K). With
homogeneity, we have ΦI (I, K) = φ0 (i).
      We will show that the value function is homogeneous and takes the following form:
                                             1
(10)                              V (K) =       (bK)1−γ ,
                                            1−γ
where b is a coefficient determined as part of the solution. Let c = C/K = A−i. (Lower-case
letters in this paper express quantities relative to the capital stock K.) Appendix A shows
that b is related to the equilibrium level of the investment-capital ratio, i∗ , by:
                                                            !−ψ/(1−ψ)
                                                     ρ
(11)                       b = (A − i∗ )1/(1−ψ)                         .
                                                  φ (i∗ )
                                                   0

The equilibrium i∗ can then be found as the solution of the following non-linear equation:
                                              γσ 2

Note that in equilibrium, the optimal investment-capital ratio I/K = i∗ is constant.
      Consider the special case of no adjustment costs, for which our adjustment cost function
of eqn. (7) becomes φ(i) = i−δ, where δ can be interpreted as the expected rate of stochastic
depreciation. It is straightforward to show that in this special case

The last term in both eqns. (13) and (14) is an adjustment for risk. Ignoring those terms,
net investment i − δ and consumption net of the rate of time preference, c − ρ, are both
proportional to A − δ − ρ. Thus, with no adjustment costs, the model cannot separately
identify A, δ, and ρ (which is a drawback of AK models without adjustment costs).
   The role of adjustment costs can also be understood as follows. Without adjustment costs,
the capital stock is perfectly liquid, so consumption and investment are always perfectly
substitutable. With no risk, intertemporal smoothing is then solely determined by A − δ −
ρ, the difference between net productivity A − δ on the investment side and the rate of
time preference ρ for consumption. Introducing adjustment costs makes physical capital
illiquid, i.e., it is costly to substitute consumption and investment. Thus the firm becomes
more prudent when investing, because capital cannot be used for consumption in the future
without incurring adjustment costs. Adjustment costs also make installed capital more
valuable than newly purchased capital, so existing capital earns rents, implying Tobin’s
q > 1. Incorporating adjustment costs makes the consumption-saving tradeoff more realistic
and allows us to separate the effects of A − δ from the subjective discount rate ρ.
   Returning to the general case with adjustment costs, equilibrium capital accumulation is
given by:
(15)                     dKt /Kt = φ(i∗ )dt + σdWt − (1 − Z)dJt ,

where i∗ is the solution of eqn. (12). Let g denote the expected growth rate conditional on
no jumps. Note that by setting dJt = 0 in eqn. (15), g = φ(i∗ ) . The expected growth rate
inclusive of jumps, denoted by g, is then

(16)                              g = φ(i∗ ) − λE(1 − Z) ,

where the second term is the expected percentage decline of the capital stock due to jumps.

   Eqn. (17) is simply an accounting identity that equates investment and saving. Eqn. (18)
is a first-order condition for producers. Re-writing it as φ0 (i)q = 1, it equates the marginal
benefit of an extra unit of investment (which at the margin yields φ0 (i) units of capital, each
of which is worth q) with its marginal opportunity cost (1 unit of the consumption good).
   The left-hand side of eqn. (19) is the consumption-wealth ratio, c/q. In equilibrium, c/q
is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of wealth, and it is also the dividend
yield, because consumption in equilibrium is totally financed by dividends, and total wealth
is given by the market value of equity. (Note that the entire capital stock is marketable and
its value is qK.) Eqn. (19) is a first-order condition for consumers. What drives the MPC,
c/q? Looking at the right-hand side of the equation, if ψ = 1, wealth and substitution effects
just offset each other, and c/q = ρ, the rate of time preference. More generally, if ψ < 1, the
wealth effect is stronger than the substitution effect, and hence the MPC increases with the
growth rate g and decreases with risk aversion and volatility. The opposite holds if ψ > 1.
   Appendix A shows that this equilibrium resource allocation has the following implications
for the risk-free interest rate r and the equity risk premium rp:

(21)                         rp = γσ 2 + λE (1 − Z) Z −γ − 1

   Eqn. (20) for the interest rate r is a generalized Ramsey rule. If ψ −1 = γ so that
preferences simplify to CRRA expected utility, and if there were no stochastic changes in K,
the deterministic Ramsey rule r = ρ + γg would hold. In our model there are two sources
of uncertainty; continuous stochastic fluctuations in K and discrete shocks (i.e., jumps in


                                                  11
K). The third term in eqn. (20) captures the precautionary savings effect of continuous
fluctuations in K for non-expected utility. The last term describes the effects of jumps on
interest rates, which include both the precautionary savings effect of risk and the mean
effect of a lower expected growth rate (because the capital stock always decreases as jumps
occur). Note that the first term in the square brackets is the reduction in the interest rate
for expected utility. The second term gives the additional effects for non-expected utility;
when ψ −1 < γ, the jump risk further increases the equilibrium interest rate from the level
implied by standard CRRA utility.
     Eqn. (21) describes the equity risk premium, rp. The first term on the RHS is the usual
risk premium in diffusion models, and the second term is the increase in the premium due
to jumps in K. When a jump occurs, (1 − Z) is the fraction of loss, and (Z −γ − 1) is
the percentage increase in marginal utility from that loss, i.e., the price of risk. The jump
component of the equity risk premium is given by λ times the expectation of the product
of these two random variables. Note that the fraction of loss (1 − Z) and the percentage
increase of marginal utility (Z −γ − 1) are positively correlated, which further substantially
contributes to the risk premium. (In the limiting case where the loss is close to 100%, the
increase in marginal utility approaches infinity.) Also note that the risk premium depends
only on the coefficient of risk aversion, and does not depend on the EIS or rate of time
preference.
     The model can also be used to determine the equilibrium price of catastrophic risk in-
surance. We will examine the price of insurance in the next section when we discuss the
calibration of the model, after specifying the distribution ζ(Z) for the fraction of the capital
stock that survives a jump shock, Z.


II      Calibration.
This section explains our calibration procedure. We begin by specifying the probability
distribution for the survival fraction Z, and we show how this distribution simplifies the
model and also yields identifying conditions on the second, third, and fourth moments of


                                              12
equity returns. Those conditions along with the other equations of the model can be used to
identify the various parameters. We describe the data (for the U.S. during 1947–2008) used
to obtain values for the model’s inputs, and we present a baseline calibration and additional
sensitivity calibrations. We turn next to the pricing of catastrophic risk insurance, and show
insurance premia for different size losses. Lastly, we turn to the role of adjustment costs
and compare our results with those of Barro (2009). This helps to show the importance of
adjustment costs and the implications of certain parameter choices.
   Note that our calibration is based on data that does not include catastrophic shocks,
defined as sudden drops in the capital stock of 10% or more. But this does not mean that
we cannot identify the distribution ζ(Z) or other parameters of the model. With rational
expectations, agents assign correct probabilities to scenarios and hence price risk accordingly.
Indeed, the high and time-varying volatility in asset markets is suggestive that investors may
be quite averse to catastrophic shocks. Moreover, given the nature of catastrophic shocks,
it is expected that such low-probability events might not appear in the data. Finally, as an
empirical matter, we will show that while our approach is completely different from existing
work, we obtain a distribution ζ(Z) that is surprisingly close to the one estimated by Barro
and Jin directly from panel data.

II.A     The Distribution for Shocks.

The solution of the model presented above applies to any well-behaved distribution for
recovery Z. We assume that Z follows a power distribution over (0,1) with parameter α > 0:

(22)                            ζ(Z) = αZ α−1 ; 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1 ,

so that E(Z) = α/(α + 1). Thus a large value of α implies a small expected loss E(1 − Z).
   The distribution given by eqn. (22) is general. If α = 1, Z follows a uniform distribu-
tion. For any α > 0, eqn. (22) implies that − ln Z is exponentially distributed with mean
E(− ln Z) = 1/α. Eqn. (22) also implies that the inverse of the remaining fraction of the
capital stock follows a Pareto distribution with density function α(1/Z)−α−1 with 1/Z > 1.
The Pareto distribution is fat-tailed and often used to model extreme events.

                                              13
   The power distribution for Z given in (22) simplifies the solution of the model. We need
three moments of Z, namely E(Z n ) where n = 1, 1 − γ, and −γ. Eqn. (22) implies

(23)                                 E(Z n ) = α/(α + n) ,

provided that α + n > 0. Since the smallest relevant value of n is −γ, we require α > γ,
which ensures that the expected impact of a catastrophe is sufficiently limited so that the
model admits an interior solution for any level of risk aversion γ. Thus E(1 − Z) = 1/(α + 1)
is the expected loss if an event occurs, and E(Z −γ −1) = γ/(α−γ) is the expected percentage
increase in marginal utility from the loss; both are decreasing in α.

II.B     Equity Returns.

The distribution for the survival fraction Z given by eqn. (22) can be used to obtain moment
conditions on equity returns. Recall that − ln Z is exponentially distributed with mean
E(− ln Z) = 1/α. Thus E((ln Z)2 ) = 2/α2 and E((ln Z)3 ) = −6/α3 .
   Because the equilibrium value of Tobin’s q is constant, the value of the firm, Q = qK,
follows the same stochastic process (with the same drift and volatility) as the capital stock
K. Also, in equilibrium the dividend yield is constant, so only capital gains contribute to
second and higher order moments of stock returns. Therefore, the variance, skewness, and
kurtosis for logarithmic equity returns over the time interval (t, t + ∆t) equal the correspond-
ing moments for ln Kt+∆t /Kt . Let V, S, and K denote the variance, skewness, and excess
kurtosis, respectively, for equity returns. We show in Appendix B that they are given by:
                                                        
(24)                             V = ∆t σ 2 + 2λ/α2
                                     1        −6λ/α3
(25)                            S = √
                                      ∆t (σ 2 + 2λ/α2 )3/2
                                    1      24λ/α4
(26)                            K =
                                    ∆t (σ 2 + 2λ/α2 )2

Here ∆t is the frequency with which returns are measured. In our case returns are measured
monthly and are in monthly terms; because all variables are expressed in annual terms for
purposes of our calibration, ∆t = 1/12.

                                                14
   Using eqn. (23), the expected growth rate that includes possible jumps is

                                                     λ
(27)                                     g=g−           .
                                                    α+1
Eqn. (23) can also be used to simplify eqns. (19), (20), and (21), which now become:

                                         c

                                          α − γ (α + 1)(α + 1 − γ)
Recall that in equilibrium the consumption-wealth ratio c/q is equal to the dividend yield.
Eqn. (28) is essentially a Gordon growth formula; it states that the expected return on equity
(r + rp) equals the dividend yield (c/q) plus the expected growth rate g (inclusive of jumps).

II.C     Identification.

With eqns. (17), (18), and (24) to (30) we can identify the key parameters and variables
of the model. To do this we use the following inputs: the variance, skewness, and excess
kurtosis of equity returns, the real risk-free rate r and equity premium rp, the output/capital
ratio Y /K, the consumption/investment ratio c/i, and the per capita expected real growth
rate g. We discuss the data and calculation of these inputs below. The identification of the
model is easiest to see in steps.
   First, the two sources of risk in our model (diffusion and jump risk) are characterized
by three key parameters: volatility σ, jump intensity λ, and the loss distribution parameter
α. These three parameters determine the second and all higher moments for equity returns.
Given the variance, skewness and kurtosis for equity returns, we use eqns. (24) to (26) to
calculate λ, α and σ. Thus the three parameters that govern stochastic changes in the capital
stock are all determined by the second, third, and fourth moments of equity returns.
   Second, given these three parameters, we use eqn. (30) for the equity risk premium
equation to calculate the coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ. Thus γ is determined by the
cost of equity capital relative to the risk-free rate.

                                                15
   Third, we can use eqn. (29) for the risk-free rate to identify either the rate of time
preference ρ or the EIS ψ. Except for the special case of expected utility, where ψ = 1/γ, our
parsimonious model does not allow us to separately identify these two parameters. Instead
we use eqn. (29) to obtain ψ as a function of the discount rate ρ, and then consider a range
of “reasonable” values for ψ and the implications for ρ.
   Lastly, we use the equations for the real side of the model to identify the remaining
variables and parameters. We calculate the productivity parameter A directly; it is just
the average output/capital ratio (with the capital stock broadly defined to include physical,
human, and intangible capital). Then, given c/i, eqn. (17) determines both c and i. Finally,
given the expected growth rate g, eqn. (19) determines q, and eqn. (18) determines the
adjustment cost parameter θ. Because g = φ(i) = i − θi2 /2 − δ, we thus also determine δ.
   The identification of the model can also be seen in terms of equations and unknowns.
We have 8 equations: (17), (18), and (24) through (30). We use these equations to identify
8 parameters and variables: the parameters λ, α and σ that govern stochastic changes in K,
the behavioral parameters γ and either ψ or ρ, and the economic variables c, i and q.
   Note that we use equity returns rather than consumption or output data to measure the
diffusion volatility σ and jump process parameters λ and α. By design, our parsimonious
model describes a stochastic steady-state growth path that is the same for all variables,
including consumption, output, dividends, and the price of equity. All these variables thus
have the same volatility, same likelihood of catastrophic shocks and same losses should a
catastrophic event occur. This is an inevitable limitation of our simple representative-agent
model with constant but risky investment opportunities. We chose to measure σ, λ and
α using equity returns because we view the stock market as more informative about risk,
especially regarding catastrophic events, than aggregate consumption series. As an empirical
matter, aggregate macro time series are more reflective of information for an “average” agent,
while time series for equity returns reflect information about the “marginal” investor who
prices assets.

II.D     Baseline Calibration.

Ours is an equilibrium model, so its calibration should be based on data covering a time
period that is long and relatively stable. We therefore use data for the U.S. economy from
1947 to 2008 to construct average values of the output-capital ratio Y /K, the consumption-
investment ratio C/I, the real risk-free rate r, and the expected real growth rate g. We
calculate the equity risk premium rp and second, third, and fourth moments of equity returns
using monthly data for the real total value-weighted return on the S&P500. As discussed
in Appendix D, our measure of the capital stock includes physical capital, estimates of
human capital, and estimates of firm-based intangible capital (e.g., patents, know-how, brand
value, and organizational capital). Thus, we obtain a measure of the productivity parameter
A = Y /K consistent with the AK production technology of eqn. (4). Our measure of
investment (and GDP) includes investment in firm-based intangible capital, and we assume
that investment in human capital occurs through education and is part of consumption.
   Table 1 summarizes the inputs used in the baseline calibration, and the calibration out-
puts. Note that we obtain a value of 3.1 for the coefficient of relative risk aversion, which is
well within the consensus range. Recall that we cannot separately identify ψ and ρ (except
for the special case of expected CRRA utility), so in Table 1 we set ψ = 1.5, which yields a



                                              17
value of just under .05 for the rate of time preference ρ.8 Also, our estimate of q is about
1.55, which is close to the value of 1.43 obtained by Riddick and Whited (2009), who used
firm-level Compustat data for 1972 to 2006.9
       We obtain a mean arrival rate λ of 0.734 for the jump process and a value for the
distributional parameter α of 23.17. These numbers imply that a shock occurs about every
1.4 years on average, with a mean loss E(1 − Z) = 1/(α + 1) of only about 4%. Thus most
shocks are small, and could be viewed as part of the “normal” fluctuation in the capital
stock. What about larger, “catastrophic” shocks? For the power distribution specified in
(22), given that the jump occurs, the probability that the loss from a shock will be a fraction
L or greater, i.e., the probability that Z ≤ 1 − L, is (1 − L)α . Thus the probability that the
loss will be at least 10% is .9023.17 = .087, at least 15% is .023, and at least 20% is .006.
       Table 2 reports the probability that at least one shock causing a loss larger than L will
occur over a given time span T . Using the Poisson distribution property, the probability of
one or more shocks with loss larger than L occurring over time span T is

For example, if we consider as catastrophic a shock for which the loss is 15% or greater,
the annual likelihood of such an event is (.85)α λ = .017. This implies substantial risk; for
example, the probability that at least one catastrophe (with a loss of 15% or greater) will
occur over the next 50 years is 1 − e−.017×50 = .57.
       By comparison, using a sample of 24 (36) countries, Barro and Ursúa (2008) estimated λ
as the proportion of years in which there was a contraction of real per capital consumption
(or GDP) of 10% or more, and found λ to be 0.038 (for consumption and GDP). But for the
U.S. experience (which corresponds to our calibration), there were only two contractions of

    Estimates of ψ in the literature vary considerably, ranging from the number we obtained to values as
high as 2. Bansal and Yaron (2004) argue that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is above unity
and use 1.5 in their long-run risk model. Attanasio and Vissing-Jørgensen (2003) estimate the elasticity to
be above unity for stockholders, while Hall (1988), using aggregate consumption data, obtains an estimate
near zero. The Appendix to Hall (2009) provides a brief survey of estimates in the literature.

     With measurement errors and heterogeneous firms, averaging firm-level data provides a more economi-
cally sensible estimate for the q of the representative firm than inferring q from aggregate data.

consumption of 10% or more over 137 years (implying λ = 0.015), and five GDP contractions
(implying λ = 0.036). Our estimate of λ uses equity market return moments and corresponds
to the proportion of years for which there is a jump shock of any size. If we use a 10% or
more loss as the threshold to define a catastrophe, then as shown in Table 2 the annual
probability of a catastrophe occurring is 0.062, which is larger than the Barro and Ursúa
estimate. They also found an average contraction size (conditional on the 10% threshold,
and for the international sample) of 0.22 for consumption and 0.20 for GDP. Applying our
estimate of α (23.17) to losses of 10% or greater, we find the expected catastrophic loss
using the 10% threshold to be E [(1 − Z)|(1 − Z) ≥ 10%] = 1 − 0.9α/(α + 1) = .137. Thus,
compared to Barro and Ursúa, we find that shocks greater than 10% occur with a greater
annual frequency (0.062 versus 0.038) but with a smaller average contraction size (.137 versus
0.20 to .22).
       Barro and Jin (2009) independently applied the same power distribution that we used
in eqn. (22) to describe the size distribution for contractions. We obtained a value of the
distribution parameter α as an output of our calibration; they estimated α for their sample
of contractions. In our notation, their estimates of α were 6.27 for consumption contractions
and 6.86 for GDP, implying a mean loss of about 14% for consumption and 13% for GDP.10

    Eqn. (22) is the distribution for Z, the fraction of the remaining capital stock. It implies that S = 1/Z
has the distribution fS (s) = αs−α−1 , s ≥ 1. Barro and Jin (2009) use data on S, but conditioning on
                                                                       0  0
S ≥ s = 1.105 to estimate α0 for the distribution fS (s) = (α0 − 1)s−α sα −1 , s ≥ s. Thus our α corresponds


                                                     19
However, they only considered contractions that were 10% or greater, and as explained
above, applying their truncation to our calibrated value of α implies a mean loss of 13.7%.
This number is very close to the Barro-Jin estimate, but note that we obtained it in a
completely different way. Rather than use historical data on drops in consumptions or
GDP, we found the mean contraction size as an output of our calibration. Thus one might
view our approach (theory-based inference with specific functional form assumptions) as
complementary to direct estimation.

II.E     Catastrophic Insurance Premium.

Our model solution also implies the equilibrium price of every possible insurance claim:

(32)                                      p(Z) = λZ −γ ζ(Z)

where ζ(Z) is the probability density function for the recovery fraction Z, so that λζ(Z) is
the conditional arrival intensity of a shock that destroys a fraction (1 − Z) of the capital
stock. Eqn. (32) gives the payment rate that the CIS buyer must make to insure against
a shock with loss fraction (1 − Z); should that shock occur, the buyer would receive one
unit of the consumption good. Not surprisingly, the higher the arrival rate of a shock with
survival fraction Z, λζ(Z), the higher the corresponding CIS payment. The multiplier Z −γ
in eqn. (32) is the marginal rate of substitution between pre-jump and post-jump values, and
measures the insurance risk premium; the higher is γ and the bigger is the loss (the lower is
Z), the more expensive is the insurance.
   Using eqn. (22) for the probability density function that governs the recovery fraction
Z, we can calculate the cost of insuring against any particular risk. Recall that E(Z n ) =
α/(α + n). Thus for each CIS with survival fraction Z, the required payment is:

(33)                                     p(Z) = λαZ α−γ−1 .

For example, to obtain the cost of insuring against a shock that results in losing a fraction

to their α0 via α = α0 − 1. But note that our distribution is not truncated (i.e., s ≥ 1) while theirs is
truncated, including only losses at least greater than 1 − s−1 ≈ 10% (so s ≥ s = 1.105.)


                                                   20
L or more of the capital stock (i.e., 1 − Z ≥ L), the required payment per unit of capital is
                                                   (1 − L)α−γ   (1 − L)α−γ+1
                                                  "                           #
                     Z    1−L
(34)                            (1 − Z)p(Z)dZ = λα            −              .
                      0                               α−γ         α−γ+1
Thus to obtain the required payment per unit of capital to insure against any size shock, just
set L = 0 in eqn. (34). Note that unlike the existing catastrophic insurance literature, we
obtain the insurance premium in a general equilibrium setting. Also, observe from eqn. (34)
that the CIS payment depends only on risk aversion γ, the parameters describing shocks, i.e.,
λ and α, and the lower bound L of the loss insurance. The CIS payment does not depend on
the EIS ψ and the discount rate ρ, for example, because these parameters do not describe
the characteristics of or attitudes toward risk.
      Using our baseline calibration (which yielded γ = 3.066, λ = 0.739, and α = 23.17) and
eqn. (34), the annual CIS payment to insure against shocks of any size is about .040 per
unit of capital, i.e., 4% of the capital stock. We have A = .113, so the total annual cost
of the insurance would be .040Y /.113 = .355Y , i.e., about 35% of GDP, or about 48% of
consumption.11 How much of this very large annual CIS payment reflects the expected loss
from a shock and how much is a risk premium? We first calculate the expected loss with
                                                                         R 1−L
no risk premium. The implied actuarially fair annual CIS payment is       0       (1 − Z)λζ(Z)dZ,
which can also be found by setting γ = 0 in eqn. (34). The “price” of risk is ratio of the
annual CIS payment to the actuarially fair payment.
      Table 3 summarizes both the CIS and actuarially fair payments (denoted by AF), both
as a fraction of consumption, to cover losses of different amounts. If we treat as catastrophes
shocks that result in losses of 15% or more, the annual payment to insure against such
losses is over 7% of consumption — a substantial amount. If we restrict our definition of
catastrophes to only include shocks that cause losses of 20% or more, the annual insurance
payment is nearly 3% of consumption — still quite large. Note that the “price” of risk (the
ratio of the CIS payment to the actuarially fair premium) increases with L, the lower bound
of the loss fraction that is insured. For example, to insure only against catastrophes that
generate a loss of 10% or more, the price of risk is about 1.7. But if insurance is limited to

      Using c + i = A = .113 and c/i = 2.84 gives C = .740Y = .0836K.

Note: For each amount of loss coverage, CIS is the required annual insurance payment as a percent
of consumption and AF is the actuarially fair payment. L = 0.25 means that only losses of 25% or
more are covered.

only those shocks causing losses of 25% or more (i.e. L = 0.25), the annual cost is just under
1% of consumption, while the actuarially fair rate is about 0.3% of consumption, implying
a price of risk of about 2.8. The price of risk is higher in this case because the insurance is
covering larger losses on average and insuring tail risk is expensive.

II.F    The Role of Adjustment Costs.

How important are adjustment costs? To address this question and do welfare calculations,
we use the quadratic adjustment cost function given by eqn. (7). In our baseline calibration,
the resulting value of θ is 12.03, which is determined by eqn. (18): q = 1/φ0 (i) = 1/(1 − θi).
In our calibration, q = 1.55, i + c = A, and c/i = 2.84, which pins down θ = 12.03.
   To explore the role of adjustment costs, we first review Barro’s (2009) results and then add
adjustment costs to his model. Based on historic “consumption disasters,” Barro estimated
λ to be .017. He set γ = 4, and using an empirical distribution for consumption declines,
estimated the three moments E(Z), E(Z 1−γ ), and E(Z −γ ). He also set ψ = 2, ρ = .052,
σ = .02, and A = .174. (Because there are no adjustment costs, only A − ρ can be identified
in Barro’s model.)
   The first row of the top panel of Table 4 shows this calibration of Barro’s model; there are

no adjustment costs so capital is assumed to be perfectly liquid and q = 1. The calibration
gives a sensible estimate of the risk-free rate r and risk premium rp, but yields a consumption-
investment ratio of only 0.38, whereas the actual ratio is about 3. The rest of the top panel
shows how the results change as the adjustment cost parameter θ in eqn. (7) is increased. The
experiment here is to hold the structural parameters for both preferences and the technology
fixed, change only θ, and then re-solve for the new equilibrium price and quantity allocations.
First, as we increase θ, investment becomes more costly, so i falls and c = A − i increases.
Additionally, q increases because installed capital now earns higher rents in equilibrium.
When θ = 8, both c/i and q roughly match the data. However, r falls below −3%. Basically,
given Barro’s parameter choices (particularly γ and the productivity parameter A) along
with the exogenous inputs for λ and the moments of Z, the model cannot match all of the
basic economic facts, even allowing for adjustment costs.
   The bottom panel of Table 4 shows results using our baseline calibration, but varying
the value for θ. (The boldface row corresponds to our baseline calibration where θ = 12.03.)
As θ increases, the cost of investing increases, so investment becomes less attractive relative


                                               23
to consumption, and thus i falls. With ψ = 1.5 > 1, the substitution effect dominates the
wealth effect, and hence r also falls. As a result of this drop in the cost of capital, q increases.
Thus for a calibrated model to match the data, adjustment costs are crucial. Put differently,
without adjustment costs, the consumption/investment ratio is much too low and interest
rates unrealistically high because with perfectly liquid capital, q = 1 and investment is overly
attractive.
   Note that because of the block structure of our calibration procedure, the value of the
adjustment cost parameter will not affect our estimates of λ and α. But it will greatly affect
the welfare calculations that we present in the next section. The reason is that to calculate
WTP, e.g., to eliminate catastrophic risk, we must determine the response of consumption
and investment to a change in risk. Adjustment costs make investment more expensive
and make intertemporal consumption smoothing difficult, and thus have important policy
implications, and must be accounted for when calculating WTP.
   To summarize, these results illustrate some important differences between our approach
and that of Barro (2009): (1) By construction, q = 1 in models with no adjustment costs
because physical capital is assumed to be perfectly liquid, which is not realistic. Our model
captures this important feature of the illiquidity of physical capital and the empirical fact
that q 6= 1. (2) Models with no adjustment costs cannot separately identify the effect of the
productivity coefficient A from the effects of the rate of time preference ρ and the expected
rate of depreciation δ. In our model, A has a distinct effect on the investment-capital ratio i
that differs from the effects of ρ, so that A and ρ can be separately identified. (3) As noted
earlier, Barro’s AK model generates an unrealistically high investment-capital ratio; our
model does not because adjustment costs make investment more expensive. (4) Including
adjustment costs is essential for policy evaluation; they make intertemporal consumption
smoothing difficult and hence influence WTP calculations, as we show below.

III     Policy Consequences.
We now turn to the second question raised in the first paragraph of this paper: What is
society’s willingness to pay to reduce the probability or likely impact of catastrophic events?
Our measure of WTP is the maximum permanent consumption tax rate τ that society would
be willing to accept if the resulting stream of government revenue could finance whatever
activities are needed to permanently limit the maximum loss from any catastrophic shock
that might occur to some level L.
                               b Of course it might not be feasible to limit the maximum

loss to L
        b with a tax of that size, or it might be possible to achieve this objective with a

smaller tax. In effect, we are examining the “demand side” of public policy — society’s
“reservation price” (maximum tax) for attaining this policy objective.

III.A     Willingness to Pay.

We want to determine the effect of a permanent consumption tax. Given investment It and
output Yt , households pay τ (Yt − It ) to the government and consume the remainder:

(35)                                  Ct = (1 − τ )(Yt − It ) .

Suppose that a costly technology exists that could ensure that any shock that occurs would
                               b = (1 − Z).
lead to a loss no greater than L        b   That is, the technology would permanently
change the recovery size distribution ζ(Z) to a truncated distribution, given by

   How much would households be willing to pay the government to finance such a tech-

size distribution ζ(Z); and (2) paying a permanent consumption tax at rate τ to adopt the
new technology which changes the distribution ζ(Z) to ζ(Z)
                                                      b    given by eqn. (36). Households
would be indifferent if and only if the following condition holds:

(38)                                     Vb (K; τ ) = V (K; 0) ,

where Vb (K; τ ) is the household’s value function given by eqns. (C2) and (C7) with a con-
sumption tax rate τ , and with the optimal investment-capital ratio î for the truncated
distribution given by eqn. (37). In Appendix C, we show that this condition implies that:

(39)                                 b(τ ) = (1 − τ )bb(0) = b(0) ,
                                     b


where bb(0), given by eqn. (C8), is the coefficient in the value function Vb (K; 0) when there is
no tax but the distribution for Z is truncated, as given by eqn. (36). Thus to eliminate the
                                                            b = (1 − Z),
possibility of catastrophic shocks with losses greater than L        b households would be

willing to pay a consumption tax at the constant rate
                                                   b(0)
(40)                                         τ =1− b    .
                                                   b(0)
       For the household, a permanent tax at rate τ is equivalent to giving up a fraction τ
of the capital stock. This is because the tax is non-distortionary. The tax is proportional
to output, so households’ after-tax consumption is lowered by the same fraction as the tax
rate in all states and in all future periods. Thus households’ intertemporal marginal rate of
substitution, which determines the equilibrium interest rate and the pricing of risk, remains
unchanged for any give rate of tax τ . (Although equilibrium pricing and resource allocations
are the same with or without a tax, they are not the same for different distributions for Z,
i.e., for the truncated versus non-truncated distribution.) Likewise, the total value of capital
(including the taxes paid to the government) is unchanged, and investment is unchanged,
for any given tax rate τ . A fraction τ of ownership is simply transferred from households
to the government. This key result follows from the recursive homothetic preferences and
equilibrium property that the economy is on a stochastic balanced growth path.12
  12
     We have focused on policies that would limit the maximum loss from a shock, but the results also apply
if the tax is used to reduce the likelihood of a shock of any size.

III.B     Tax Calculations.

Table 5 shows the maximum permanent tax rate on consumption that society would accept
to limit the maximum loss from a jump shock to various levels. The tax rates are shown for
three different values of the EIS ψ, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. (Recall that given ρ we can pin down
ψ, but we cannot pin down both ρ and ψ.) The first row, for which the maximum loss is
zero, gives the tax that society would pay to eliminate all jump shocks. That tax rate is very
large, on the order of 50%. But even if we were to limit the impact of shocks to a loss no
greater than 15%, the warranted tax is substantial — close to 7% per year (forever). Shocks
causing losses greater than 25% or 30% are very rare, so the tax is much lower.
   To a first-order approximation, the CIS premium for insuring against losses above a par-
ticular percentage is close to the maximum consumption tax society would pay to eliminate
the possibility of such losses. For example, the CIS premium for insuring against losses above
15% is 7.34% of consumption, which is only slightly larger than the corresponding consump-
tion tax rate. Eliminating or reducing catastrophic risk, however, is fundamentally different
from purchasing insurance since the latter is a zero NPV financial transaction, with no gain
in value. Using tax proceeds to reduce the consequences of catastrophic shocks is a different


                                              27
way to manage aggregate risk than purchasing insurance because the former changes real
economic activities (consumption and investment) while the latter simply transfers resources
from one party to the other depending on whether the insured event takes place.
   Note that because our cost-benefit analysis is a general equilibrium one, it is fundamen-
tally different from the standard cost-benefit approach in which an NPV is calculated treating
input prices and the cost of capital as exogenous. The standard approach is adequate for
evaluating the construction of a new bridge, because while the bridge involves a change in
cash flows, there is no change in the cost of capital (i.e., the pricing kernel). But when the
“project” involves a major change in the economy (e.g., reducing catastrophic risk), prices
as well as cash flows change, so the “project” can only be evaluated by comparing its cost
to its WTP, as we have done above. Our model of a production economy with adjustment
costs is a natural framework for general equilibrium cost-benefit analysis.

III.C     Welfare Decomposition.

Our analysis is related to the “cost of business cycle” literature. Beginning with Lucas
(1987), much of that literature has found the welfare gains from eliminating business cycle
risk to be low. An exception is Barro (2009), who found the welfare gains from eliminating
“conventional” business cycle risk — i.e., continuous fluctuations in output — to be very
low, but the gains from eliminating disaster risk (jump risk in our model) to be substantial.
For comparison to the earlier literature, we use our model to evaluate these welfare gains.
   In our model, we measure welfare gains in terms of WTP, i.e., the maximum consumption
tax society would pay to change the economy such that various risks are reduced or elimi-
nated. We therefore calculate the maximum tax rate to eliminate continuous fluctuations in
the capital stock, i.e., to make σ = 0, leaving jump risk unchanged; to eliminate jump risk
(i.e., make λ = 0), leaving σ unchanged; and to make σ = λ = 0. We also want to determine
the welfare implications of adjustment costs (missing in Barro’s analysis), so we repeat these
calculations but also setting the adjustment cost parameter θ = 0. Finally, we calculate the
welfare gain from eliminating adjustment costs, but leaving both σ and λ unchanged.
   The results are shown in Table 6. The first row, for λ = 0, corresponds to the first

row of Table 5, and shows a willingness to pay a consumption tax of over 50% to eliminate
jump risk. However, the willingness to pay to eliminate continuous fluctuations (σ = 0),
leaving jump risk unchanged, is almost as large — a 44% tax. This is in stark contrast to
the results of Barro (2009), Lucas (1987) and others. There are two reasons for this. First,
earlier studies use the 2 to 2.5% standard deviation of log changes in consumption as the
value of σ that describes business cycle risk, whereas we estimate σ to be 13.5% based on
stock return data. Second, we include adjustment costs, which make stochastic fluctuations
in the capital stock (whether continuous or jumps) more costly. Indeed, as the third row of
Table 6 shows, the willingness to pay to eliminate adjustment costs — leaving both σ and
λ unchanged — is about 29%. The effects of adjustment costs can also be seen from rows 5
and 6. The WTP to eliminate both jump risk and adjustment costs is a tax rate of about
80%, which is much larger than a 52% tax rate society would pay to eliminate only jump
risk. Similarly, the WTP to eliminate both diffusion risk and adjustment costs is a tax rate
of 73%, as opposed to the 44% tax rate society would pay to eliminate only diffusion risk.
   Another reason for the high willingness to pay to eliminate stochastic fluctuations (make
σ, λ, or both zero) is that in our model changes in the capital stock are permanent. Per-
centage changes in the (endogenous) growth rate are iid, i.e., there is no mean reversion.
Allowing for catastrophic shocks to be followed by recoveries (so that there is mean reversion
in growth rate changes), e.g., as in Gourio (2012), would reduce the tax rates in Table 6.

                                             29
   Alvarez and Jermann (2004) estimate the cost of consumption fluctuations directly from
asset prices. They do not specify a utility function and instead use no-arbitrage restric-
tions to compare the value of a claim to lifetime consumption with a claim to stabilized
lifetime consumption. Their calculation takes observed asset prices as given to infer the
stochastic discount factor and then value the benefits of reducing consumption fluctuations.
We hypothesize a government intervention in the current economy to lower uncertainty and
calculate the WTP for the change from the current to the new economy. Therefore, the
two calculations conceptually are very different and are designed with different purposes.
The advantage of Alvarez and Jermann (2004) is that they do not rely on specific utility
functions. However, their exercise is not suited for our purposes because we are interested
in the WTP to reduce the likelihood or impact of catastrophic events.


IV      Concluding Remarks.
We have provided a new framework for evaluating the characteristics of possible catastrophic
events that are national or global in scale, calculating their implications for catastrophic
risk insurance, and evaluating tax policies to limit their magnitude. Rather than using
historical data on declines in consumption or GDP as others have done, we calculated event
characteristics as calibration outputs from a general equilibrium model and used aggregate
asset market data. Our framework provides a natural benchmark to quantitatively assess
public policy; it fully incorporates general equilibrium quantity and price adjustments by
the private sector in anticipation of a policy intervention. And unlike previous studies, our
model also matches the production side of the economy such as the investment-capital ratio,
and generates sensible estimates for Tobin’s q and for the coefficient of relative risk aversion.
   We calculated as a “willingness to pay” measure the permanent tax on consumption
that society would accept to limit the maximum loss from a catastrophic shock. For our
calibration, we found that a permanent tax of about 7% would be justified if the resulting
revenues could be used to limit the impact of shocks to a loss no greater than 15% of the
capital stock. Even if the objective was to limit losses to be no greater than 20 or 25%,


                                               30
a tax of one or two percent would be justified — a substantial tax given that it would
be permanent. These results suggest that governments should devote greater resources to
reducing the risk and potential impact of catastrophes, and thereby provide quantitative
support to arguments along these lines made by Allison (2004), Posner (2004), and Parson
(2007), among others. These arguments are especially important given the tendency of
governments (with their short political cycles) to underestimate both the likelihood and
possible impact of catastrophic events and the value of risk mitigation.13
      We estimated that the probability that over the next 50 years we will experience one
or more shocks causing a loss of 15% or more of the capital stock exceeds 50%, and the
probability of one or more shocks causing a loss of 25% or more is about 5%. (See Table 2.)
These estimates apply to “generic” shocks, i.e., of an unspecified nature. For comparison,
here are estimates of the likelihood and possible impact of some specific catastrophic shocks:
      Global Warming: A consensus estimate of the increase in global mean temperature
that would be catastrophic is about 7◦ C. A summary of 22 climate science studies surveyed
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007 puts the probability of
this occurring by the end of the century at around 5%. Weitzman (2009) argued that the
probability distribution is fat-tailed, making the actual probability as high as 10%. What
would be the impact of a catastrophic increase in temperature? Estimates of the effective
reduction in (world) GDP range from 10% to 30%.14
      Nuclear Terrorism: Various studies have assessed the likelihood and impact of the
detonation of one or several nuclear weapons (with the yield of the Hiroshima bomb) in
major cities. At the high end, Allison (2004) put the probability of this occurring in the
next ten years at about 50%! Others put the probability for the next ten years at 1 to
5%. For a survey, see Ackerman and Potter (2008). What would be the impact? Possibly
a million or more deaths. But the main shock to the capital stock and GDP would be
a reduction in trade and economic activity worldwide, as vast resources would have to be

devoted to averting further events.
   Megaviruses: Numerous authors view major pandemics and plagues (including bioter-
rorism) as both likely and having a catastrophic impact, but do not estimate probabilities.
For a range of possibilities, see Byrne (2008). As with nuclear terrorism, the main shock to
GDP would be a reduction in trade, travel, and economic activity worldwide.
   Other Catastrophic Risks: Less likely, but certainly catastrophic, events include
nuclear war, gamma ray bursts, an asteroid hitting the Earth, and unforeseen consequences
of nanotechnology. For an overview, see Bostrom and Ćirković (2008).
   In concluding, some caveats are clearly in order. Our model is intentionally simple and
stylized. For example, we solved the social planner’s problem for a representative firm with
a simple AK production technology and adjustment costs, and a representative household
with rational expectations. This is equivalent to a competitive equilibrium with a large
number of identical firms and identical households, with the same production technology
and preferences, so that we ignore heterogeneity among firms and households. The model
ignores transitional dynamics and the stochastic balanced growth paths for consumption,
investment, output, the price of equity, and the capital stock are the same, which can have
significant implications for our conclusions. We also characterized catastrophic events in a
simple way — a Poisson arrival with a constant mean arrival rate, and a permanent impact,
the size of which is stochastic. On the other hand, these simplifications make the model
highly tractable, and provide insight into the questions we raised in the Introduction.
   Lastly, we should emphasize that while our calibrations fit the basic economic aggre-
gates, we did not statistically test the model. Interestingly, however, although our approach
to identification is entirely different from existing empirical work, the parameters of our cal-
ibrated model are close to the direct estimates obtained by others (e.g. Barro and Jin) using
panel data for large sets of countries over long periods of time.

    Using Ito’s lemma and the equilibrium allocation, we have

The equilibrium restriction that the expected rate of change of Mt must equal −rt implies
the following formula for the equilibrium interest rate:

   Let Q(K) denote the value of the capital stock and q denote Tobin’s q. By homogeneity,
Q(K) = qK. The equilibrium dividend is then Dt = Ct for all t. The standard valuation
methodology implies that Mt Dt dt + d(Mt Qt ) has an instantaneous drift of zero. Using Ito’s
lemma and simplifying yields an equation for q:

The expected rate of return on equity is then

B       Moments of Equity Returns.

Here we derive eqns. (24), (25) and (26) for the moments of equity returns. Let k = ln K
and let F (t; x, kt ) denote the characteristic function: F (t; x, kt ) = Et (eixkT ). From (15),

(B1)                                     b + σdBt − (1 − z)dJt ,
                                   dkt = αdt

                   b = (α − 21 σ 2 ). Then F (t; x, k) satisfies the differential equation:
where z = ln Z and α

                                  σ2
(B2)                      αF
                          b k+       Fkk + Ft + λE [F (k + z) − F (k)] = 0 .
                                  2
    We conjecture that

(B3)                          F (t, x, k) = exp [ikG(t, x) + H(t, x)] .

                                                  34
Note that G(T, x) = x and H(T, x) = 0. Substituting (B3) for F (t, x, k) into (B2) gives
                                                                                     h       i

   For the term ikGt (t, x) we have Gt (t, x) = 0 and G(T, x) = x, so G(t, x) = x. For the
remaining terms,                                    h       i
(B5)                     b − 1 σx2 + Ht (t, x) + λE eizx − 1 = 0 .

The solution is
(B6)                             F (t, x, kt ) = exp [ixk + H(t, x)] ,
where H(t, x) is given by
                                      h                                   i

   Let νn = E(z n ), and note that

(B8)                                            b + λE(z)](T − t)
                                  Hx (t, 0) = i[α
(B9)                             Hxx (t, 0) = −(σ 2 + λν2 )(T − t)

(B11)                          Hxxxx (t, 0) = λν4 (T − t)

   Using kt and k interchangeably, the characteristic function of kT − kt is

Let mn denote the nth (uncentered) moment of kT − kt . Then

                                                                1 ∂ nF ∗

We have

                                  ∂x      x=0

which implies m1 = (T − t)(α
                           b + λν1 ). Similarly,

                              ∂2F ∗
(B15)              i2 m 2 =                     = Hx (t, 0)2 + Hxx (t, 0)

which implies m2 = m21 + (σ 2 + λν2 )(T − t) . Therefore, the conditional variance of kT − kt is

(B17)                           m2 − m21 = (σ 2 + λν2 )(T − t) .

                                                       35
    Similarly,

                             ∂3F ∗
(B18)            i3 m 3 =                  = Hxxx (t, 0) + 3Hxx (t, 0)Hx (t, 0) + Hx (t, 0)3 ,
                              ∂x3    x=0

so m3 = 3(m2 − m21 )m1 + m31 + λν3 (T − t) , and the conditional skewness of kT − kt is

                   m3 − (3(m2 − m21 )m1 + m31 )
                                                                   "                #

                          (m2 − m1 )               T − t (σ 2 + λν2 )3/2

For the fourth moment,

                            ∂4F ∗
(B20)       i4 m 4 =                      = Hxxxx (t, 0) + 4Hxxx (t, 0)Hx (t, 0)
                             ∂x4    x=0

which implies m4 = λν4 (T − t) + 4m3 m1 − 6m2 m21 + 3m41 + 3(m2 − m21 )2 . Therefore, the
conditional kurtosis of kT − kt is

                 m4 − (4m3 m1 − 6m2 m21 + 3m41 )
                                                                       "                #
                                                       1       λν4

                                                             2


For the excess kurtosis, subtract 3 from the RHS of (B21). Eqns. (24) to (26) follow directly,
with ∆t = T − t. Note that with annual data and returns measured on an annual basis,
∆t = T − t = 1. With monthly data and annualized returns, ∆t = T − t = 1/12.


C       Consumption Tax.

We will show that in our model a permanent consumption tax is non-distortionary, so the
social planner’s solution coincides with the competitive market equilibrium. We thus proceed
by solving the social planner’s problem.
   With a tax and a truncated distribution whose probability density function is given by
eqn. (36), the first-order condition (FOC) for consumption in the planner’s problem is

(C1)                                 (1 − τ )fC (C, V ) = φ0 (i)Vb 0 (K) .

Note that the original non-truncated distribution ζ( · ) is a special case with Zb = 0.
    Consider a tax to permanently limit the maximum loss from any catastrophic shock that
might occur to some level L.
                           b We conjecture that Vb (K; τ ), the value function for given values
of τ , has the homothetic form:
                                                      1 b      1−γ
(C2)                                  Vb (K; τ ) =       b(τ )K      ,

                                                        36
where bb(τ ) measures certainty-equivalent wealth (per unit of capital) when consumption is
permanently taxed at rate τ . Let Vb (K; 0) and bb(0) denote the corresponding quantities in
the absence of a tax as in Section 2. Let cb = (1 − τ )(A − bi) denote the after-tax consumption-
capital ratio with truncated distribution (36). Substituting Vb (K; τ ) given by (C2) into the
FOC (C1) yields:
                                                           !ψ

                                                                b
                                              φ0 (bi)

Substituting (C3) for bi = A − cb/(1 − τ ) into the Bellman eqn. (8) and simplifying, we can
write the equilibrium consumption-capital ratio cb∗ (τ ) as:

Rewriting (C3) and using bi∗ from solving (C5), we have the following equation for bb(τ ):
                                                      "                 #−ψ/(1−ψ)

Therefore,
                                                                                "               #−ψ/(1−ψ)

where the last equality follows from (C5), in that bi is independent of tax rate τ . We have

D      Data and Inputs to Calibration.

Unless otherwise indicated, National Income and Product data are from the Dept. of Com-
merce (www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb), data on fixed reproducible assets are from the Fed-
eral Reserve’s Flow of Funds (www.federalreserve.gov/releases/), data on T-Bill rates and
the CPI are from the Federal Reserve, and returns on the S&P 500 are from Robert Shiller
(www.econ.yale.edu/˜ shiller). The data are for the period January 1947 to December 2008.
Inputs to the calibration are measured or calculated as follows. (All data and calculations
are in a spreadsheet available from the authors on request.)
    Capital Stock. Our measure of the total capital stock KT has three components:
physical capital KP , human capital KH , and intangible capital held by firms KI . Physical
capital, from the Fed’s Flow of Funds data, consists of fixed reproducible assets, including
those held by federal and state and local governments. To estimate the stock of human
capital, we use an approach suggested by Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1998), and take the
wage premium (the average wage minus the minimum wage) to be the return to human
capital. We also assume that physical and human capital earn the same rate of return.
Thus the total annual return to human capital is the wage premium as a fraction of the
average wage (about .60 on average) times total compensation of employees. To get the
rate of return on physical capital, we use total capital income (corporate profits including
the capital consumption adjustment, i.e., gross of depreciation, plus rental income, plus
proprietors’ income) as a fraction of the stock of physical capital. That rate of return
(about 7%) is used to capitalize the annual return to human capital.15 For the stock of
intangible capital, we use a weighted average of McGrattan and Prescott’s (2005) estimates
of the intangible capital stock as a fraction of GDP for 1960–69 and 1990–2001. The result
is KI = .68Y . Given annual values for KP , KH , and KI , we calculate annual values for
A = Y /KT and use the average value of A (0.121) as an input to our calibration.
    Investment. We need total investment, inclusive of investment in intangible capital,
to measure the consumption-investment ratio C/I. In equilibrium, investment in intangible
capital is given by II = (δI + g)KI , where δI is the depreciation rate for intangible capital
and g is the real GDP growth rate (.02). The BEA’s estimate of the depreciation rate on
R&D is 11%, but McGrattan and Prescott (2005) argue that this rate is too high for most
non-R&D intangible capital. McGrattan and Prescott (2010) estimate the depreciation rate
for intangible capital to be 8%, which is the rate we use. Thus II = .10KI = .068Y .16
  15
    For comparison, we also calculated the stock of human capital using the results in Jones et al. (2005),
who estimated investment in human capital as a fraction of GDP. Assuming the depreciation rates for human
and physical capital are the same, the equilibrium stocks will be in proportion to the investment levels. We
obtained similar results (to within 15%) for the stock of human capital.
  16
    This is within the range of the Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2005) estimates of investment in intangible
capital.


                                                    38
Adding this to investment in physical capital yields a consumption-investment ratio of 2.84.
We assume here that investment in human capital occurs through education and is thus part
of measured consumption.
   Real Risk-Free Interest Rate and Equity Returns. For the real risk-free rate, we
use monthly data on the nominal 3-month T-bill rate net of the percentage increase in the
CPI for all items. Averaging over the (annualized) monthly numbers yields r = 0.008. For
the equity risk premium, we use the monthly total return on the S&P500 index and subtract
the nominal 3-month T-bill rate, yielding a risk premium rp = 0.066. For the variance,
skewness, and excess kurtosis of equity returns, we again use the monthly total return on
the S&P500. (The equity risk premium using the CRSP data is slightly higher, .0685 versus
.0661, but this makes no material difference for the results.)
   Real GDP Growth Rate. We use real GDP and population data from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis to compute the annual growth rate of real per-capita GDP. Averaging
over these annual growth rates yields g = .020.
