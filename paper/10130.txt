Have National Business Cycles Become More Synchronized?

JEL No. E32, N10

                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper, we document evidence on the synchronization of business cycles across 16 countries

over the past century and a quarter, demarcated into four exchange rate regimes. We find using three

different methodologies that there is a secular trend towards increased synchronization for much of

the twentieth century and that it occurs across diverse exchange rate regimes. This finding is in

marked contrast to much of the recent literature, which has focused primarily on the evidence for

the past 20 or 30 years and which has produced mixed results. We then considered a number of

possible explanations for the observed pattern of increased synchronization. We first ascertained the

role of shocks demarcated into country-specific (idiosyncratic) and global (common). Our key

finding here is that global (common) shocks are the dominant influence across all regimes. The

increasing importance of global shocks we posit reflects the forces of globalization, especially the

integration of goods and services through international trade and the integration of financial markets.

Our evidence shows a modest role for increasing bilateral trade in explaining synchronization, with

stronger evidence for regional integration in Europe and North America but the evidence for the role

of financial integration proxied by the removal of capital controls is inconclusive.

                                       I. INTRODUCTION

The increasing worldwide integration of goods, capital and financial markets is widely

believed to have led to more interdependence between national business cycles. In the recent

encyclopedia Business Cycles and Depressions, Dore (1997) considers the synchronization

of international cycles a stylized fact and argues that “[i]nstitutional changes such as free

capital mobility, floating exchange rates, and the increase in international arbitrage and

speculative activities have increased interdependence among the major capitalist nations,

which is likely to lead to further synchronization of cycles.” From a theoretical perspective,

however, the correlation between business cycle synchronization and integration is not

necessarily positive. Krugman (1993) noted that stronger trade integration may lead to

greater regional specialization, which can lead to less output synchronization with industry-

specific shocks. Relatedly, Heathcote and Perri (2002) showed how increased financial

integration may be an endogenous reaction to the regionalization of real sector linkages, as

the latter allow for gains from the global diversification of asset portfolios.



The broadly synchronized recent downturn in the industrial countries has generally

reinforced the notion of international business cycle synchronization. Paradoxically,

however, the empirical evidence for the past three decades is so mixed that it remains

difficult to make a strong case for the notion of increased or increasing business cycle

linkages among industrial countries. Depending on the sample period, output correlations

have even decreased in recent decades, largely on account of a remarkable cycle de-

synchronization among the major industrial countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s

(Helbling and Bayoumi, 2003). The empirical case against increased synchronization is made
                                                   -3-




forcefully by Doyle and Faust (2002), who analyze changes in the comovements among the

growth rates of G-7 countries since 1971 and found no evidence for significant increases in

output correlations over time, even for Canada and the United States or for the euro area

member countries. On the other hand, studies using dynamic factor models find evidence of

increased international business cycle linkages. For example, Kose, Otrok and Whiteman

(2002) report that a global factor explains larger shares of output variances in the G-7

countries during 1986-2001 than it does during the Bretton Woods period (1960-1972).



In this paper, we study international business cycle synchronization over 120 years, using

annual data that covers four distinct eras with different international monetary regimes. 1 The

four eras covered are 1880-1913 when much of the world adhered to the classical Gold

Standard, the interwar period (1920-1938), the Bretton Woods regime of fixed but adjustable

exchange rates (1948-1972), and the modern period of managed floating among the major

currency areas (1973 to 2001). The annual data for 16 industrial countries that we use in this

paper come from Mitchell (1998a, 1998b, and 1998c) and other sources. They were used by

Bergman, Bordo, and Jonung (1998) and Bordo and Jonung (2001). 2 The IMF’s

International Financial Statistics was used to update the dataset to 2001.




1
 This approach follows Bergman, Bordo and Jonung (1998) and Backus and Kehoe (1992). Unlike these
papers, we focus on international synchronization and devote less attention to the comparison of national
business cycle properties such as output volatility or output-consumption comovements.

 These references also provide more details on the data. The countries included in our data set are Australia,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In some of the tables, we list the countries by their
geographical proximity rather than in alphabetical order.

We believe that using a much longer data sample provides a much-needed broader and

complementary perspective on business cycle synchronization. In the short term, much of the

business cycle dynamics depends on the shock dynamics, which tends to overshadow the

effects of integration. Changes in the latter, as a recent essay in the IMF’s World Economic

Outlook (2001) has pointed out, are often minor over short periods of time. Across the four

eras that we examine, the variation in cross-border integration in the markets for goods,

capital and financial assets has been considerably larger than over the last 20 years while the

influence of particular shock realizations appears arguably to have been somewhat less

important.



The paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses conceptual issues regarding

international business cycle synchronization and provides the basic stylized facts. The

subsequent section looks at the role that changes in this structure of shocks may have played

in the observed changes in the synchronization of cycles. Section IV analyzes how changes

in trade integration and the exchange rate regime have contributed to the observed increased

international synchronization of business cycles.



          II. CROSS-COUNTRY BUSINESS CYCLE S YNCHRONIZATION OVER TIME




The notion of business cycles becoming increasingly synchronized across countries captures

the observation that the timing and magnitudes of major changes in economic activity appear

increasingly similar. For example, in the most recent slowdown, output growth started to
                                                  -5-




weaken at about the same time in the major advanced economies (e.g., Helbling and

Bayoumi, 2003). Despite its frequent use, however, synchronization as a formal concept has

only recently been formally introduced into the business cycle literature, where comovements

among cyclical time series have been the dominant object of analysis for many decades.

Harding and Pagan (2002b) proposed a definition of cross-country cycle synchronization that

is an offspring of the traditional concepts developed by the National Bureau of Economic

Research (NBER) starting in the early 1920s. Specifically, they consider national business

cycles to be synchronized if turning points in the corresponding reference cycles occur

roughly at the same points in time. On this basis, they have derived a statistical measure, the

concordance correlation, that allows one to test whether national cycles are significantly

synchronized or not. This approach to measuring synchronization boils down to national

business cycles being in the same phase—expansions and recessions—at about the same

time.



Using NBER-based business cycle concepts has distinct advantages, including the fact that

there is no need to apply detrending procedures and a rich collection of empirical studies

dating back to the 1920s and 1930s. There are also distinct disadvantages. First, the use of

non-linear filters and judgments in the derivation of turning points in the reference cycle

often precludes standard statistical analysis based on the linear models widely used in

economics. 3 Second, since Koopman’s (1947) review of Measuring Business Cycles by

3
  However, recent advances in econometrics and information technology have facilitated the use of nonlinear
models in empirical economic research. Diebold and Rudebusch (1999) address business cycle issues with
(nonlinear) regime switching approaches.
                                             -6-




Burns and Mitchell (1946), the mostly a-theoretical framework of the traditional NBER

business cycle measures has been recognized as problematic by many. In particular, it

remains difficult to link the phase-based NBER measures with structural models of

macroeconomic fluctuations, including with the impulse-propagation approach to modeling

business cycles that has increasingly dominated the academic literature. Finally, NBER

reference cycle dates do not exist for all the countries in the sample from 1880-2001.



For an analytical paper, the costs associated with these disadvantages weigh heavily and we

will adopt a more eclectic approach to measuring business cycle synchronization. In

particular, we make extensive use of standard correlations and factors-based measures of

synchronization, both measures which have frequently been used in the academic literature.

We will, however, follow Harding and Pagan (2002, 2003), Stock and Watson (1999), and

others by using real gross domestic product—or output in short—as the measure of aggregate

economic activity or the business cycle rather than the synthetic reference cycle series used

by the NBER. In addition, we will also examine the synchronization in industrial production.

While we would not associate national business cycles with industrial production (IP),

studying the latter is nevertheless interesting for two reasons. First, fluctuations in IP are

more cyclical than fluctuations in some other sectors, especially services or government,

which helps to understand the extent to which the cyclical sectors in an economy are

interrelated with those abroad. Second, IP approximates fluctuations in the tradables sectors.

A. Output Synchronization



1. Concordance Correlations



Harding and Pagan (2002) proposed to measure the cross-country synchronization of

business cycles in countries i and j by the correlation between the binary cycle indicator

variables Sit and Sjt. The latter are 1-0 variables that take on the value 1 in period t if an

economy is in an expansion and the value 0 if it is in a recession (determined on the basis of

output developments, as discussed). 4 As the correlations are related to the so-called

concordance statistic (the sum of the products of the binary cycle indicators), which

determines the number of periods during which national cycles are in the same phase (as a

fraction of the total number of periods in the sample), we will refer to them as concordance

correlations. 5 If two cycles are perfectly synchronized, in the sense of being in the same state

in every period, the concordance correlation coefficient ñS is 1. If the two cycles are exactly

in the opposite state in every period (Sit=1-Sjt, t=1...T), the correlation is -1. Finally, if the two

cycles are uncorrelated, the correlation is 0.



We have calculated the binary business cycle state indicator variable Sit for four eras for a

panel of 16 industrial countries, for which GDP data are available from 1880. (As noted

4
 See Chapter 3 of the April 2002 World Economic Outlook for an overview of business cycle concepts and
methods.
5
  Specifically, Harding and Pagan (2002) demonstrate that the bilateral concordance correlation coefficient and
its statistical significance can be estimated by regressing the binary cycle indicator of one country, adjusted by
its standard deviations, on that of the other country.
                                           -8-




above, real GDP is our measure of aggregate economic activity). With annual data, the

determination of expansions and recessions is straightforward. A recession is defined as one

or more consecutive years of negative real GDP growth, while an expansion consists of a

year or more of positive growth. The resulting business cycle turning points broadly match

the dates in the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) chronologies for the United

States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany (available in Glasner, 1997). The

differences reflect the use by the NBER of higher frequency (monthly) data and a broader

variety of indicators, such as employment and department store sales. On this basis,

correlation coefficients between all country pairs and their significance were estimated.



Figure 1 shows the concordance correlation coefficients by percentile for three of the four

eras. The reason for leaving out the Bretton Woods era is that most countries did not

experience any classical recession during this period. Hence, the business cycle indicator Sit

takes on the value 1 in every period. Naturally, the regression-based correlation coefficients

can not be derived in the circumstances, as cycles (cycle states) become perfectly correlated

without variation in the cycle phases. Table 1 shows the average concordance correlations by

era, including for a number of country groups.



Comparing the distribution of the correlation coefficients by era suggests the following.



•      In the Gold Standard era, the average of the correlation coefficients was just about

       zero, as about half of all the pairs of national business cycles were negatively related
                                                                                               -9-




                                         to each other while the other half was positively related to each other. Hence, on

                                         average, business cycles were not synchronized according to this measure.



•                                        In the interwar and the post-Bretton Wood periods, more than half of all pairs of

                                         national business cycles were positively related to each other. On average, the

                                         correlation is about 0.2, suggesting generally synchronized business cycles during

                                         these eras. Nevertheless, more than one fourth of all cycles remained negatively

                                         related, which explains why the average “synchronization” remains relatively weak.

                                         Comparing the distributions of the two periods suggests no significant difference

                                         (which is confirmed by a Wilcoxon Rank sum test).

Overall, we find that synchronization was most pronounced in the Bretton Woods era, when

many economies enjoyed uninterrupted expansions. As shown below, the finding is

misleading because output comovements were not stronger in that era than in either the

preceding or the subsequent era. The relevant key finding is that synchronization patterns

appear to have systematically changed once the world went off the classical Gold Standard.

During the latter era, cycles were, on average, uncorrelated while, beginning with the

interwar period, they started to become synchronized on average.



2. Output Correlations



Output correlations have been the perhaps most frequently used measures of business cycle

synchronization. According to this measure, national cycles are synchronized if they are

positively and significantly correlated with each other.                      The higher are the positive

correlations, the more synchronized are the cycles. Compared with concordance correlations,

measuring synchronization with standard contemporaneous correlations is more stringent, as

the latter require similarities in both the direction and magnitudes of output changes. 6



Figure 2 shows the correlation coefficients for log output growth by percentile for the four

eras. The distribution of the correlation coefficients differs substantially from era to era. In


6
  As we use annual data, it is not surprising that there is little evidence of strong lead-lag relationships among
the log output growth rates in our dataset.
                                                                                        - 11 -




particular, there has been a tendency toward higher, positive output correlations, not just a

one-time level increase in synchronization, as observed in the previous subsection based on

concordance correlations. During the Gold Standard, about one half of all country pairs were

characterized by negative output correlations and the average output correlation coefficient is

about 0 (Table 2). A first important step toward synchronization occurred during the interwar

period, when the share of negative correlations fell below 30 percent while the average

correlation increased to about 0.15. A subsequent reversal during the Bretton Woods era was

small, and correlations remained, on average, above those found for the Gold Standard era. A

second important increase then occurred during 1973-2001, when less than 10 percent of all

country pairs were characterized by negative output correlations and the average correlation

was 0.33.

Are these changes over time statistically different? This question is relevant since the

confidence intervals for the bilateral correlation coefficients are relatively wide given the few

observations per era. 7 We used both nonparametric and parametric tests to address the issue.

(Nonparametric) Wilcoxon Rank sum tests suggest that the upward shifts in the distribution

of the correlation coefficients are significant at the 5 percent level for the interwar period

(compared to the Gold Standard era) and for the modern floating era (compared to both the

interwar and the Bretton Woods eras). The downward shift in the distribution of correlation

coefficients from the interwar to the Bretton Woods eras is only significant at the 10 percent

level.



The Wilcoxon rank sum test does not require any assumption about the underlying

distribution of the correlation coefficients. In practice, however, it is typically assumed that

the correlation coefficients of a vector series of log first differences of outputs reflect an

underlying multivariate normal distribution, at least asymptotically. For this reason, we also

formally tested for the equality of the covariance and correlation matrices over subsequent

periods using the tests proposed by Jennrich (1970). In a first step, we tested for the

significance of the changes in the average correlation coefficients. The changes between the

Gold Standard and the interwar eras and between the Bretton Woods and the modern floating

eras, respectively, are statistically significant while the decline between the interwar and the


7
  The sampling standard deviation of estimated correlation coefficients depends on the size of the estimated
coefficient and the number of observations. Given the former, small samples tend to amplify the sampling
uncertainty greatly. For example, for a correlation coefficient of 0.15—the average for the interwar period—the
standard deviation for a sample of 20 observations is 0.23. With 50 and 100 sample observations, the standard
deviations decline to 0.14 and 0.10, respectively.
                                           - 13 -




Bretton Woods eras is insignificant (Table 3). Given the small number of observations per

era, this is a strong result.



Beyond average correlations, however, the statistical significance of the changes in output

comovements in general is more ambiguous. Regarding the six possible pairs of covariance

matrices for the four eras, all but two are statistically significantly different from each other

at the 5 percent level (Table 4), which bears on the factor model-based approach to

measuring synchronization discussed in the next subsection. The pairs that are insignificantly

different are 1880-1913 vs. 1926-1938 and 1880-1913 vs. 1951-1972, respectively.

Regarding correlation matrices, only two are statistically different at the 5 percent level

(1926-1938 vs. 1973-2001 and 1951-1972 vs. 1973-2001, respectively). This, however,

reflects to some extent “substitution” among country pairs, as some correlations increased

while others decreased.



For smaller groups, especially the (old and new) core countries and European countries, the

changes in the correlation matrices from era to era are generally statistically significantly

different from era to era, except for the pair 1880-1913 vs. 1926-1938. We attribute the fact

that the changes between those two eras are often insignificant to the few number of

observations for the interwar era, which tends to reduce the sampling precision (as noted in

footnote 7). Overall, the results of all the tests support the notion of a secular increase in

business cycle synchronization.

So far, we have looked at business cycle synchronization through a global lens, noting the

increased synchronization without consideration for other factors. However, one would

expect that synchronization patterns differ considerably across groups of countries,

depending on factors such as “gravity” or country size. The evidence clearly illustrates that

the extent to which gravity has shaped the synchronization trends depends on the region

(Table 2). For core European countries (the old “EEC”) and Continental European countries,

the increase in business cycle synchronization was clearly much sharper than the general

increase. At the other end of gravitas, business cycle synchronization between Japan and the

other countries in the panel has increased by less. In particular, there is no evidence for an

increase between the Bretton Woods era and the modern floating rate period.



The fact that the increase for all Continental European countries was smaller than that for the

Core European countries suggests that the forces of gravity are affected by common policies,

preferential trading agreements, and specific currency arrangements. The increase in

correlations among the Anglo-Saxon countries is also remarkable even though it seems more

difficult to attribute this to forces of gravity. 8 While we do not believe that common

institutions and heritage among the Anglo-Saxon countries account directly for the increased

synchronization, as Otto et al. (2002) have argued, they likely have fostered similar patterns




8
 The emergence of strong business cycle linkages among core European countries and among the Anglo-Saxon
countries was noted, among others, by Helbling and Bayoumi (2003) and Stock and Watson (2003).
                                                  - 15 -




in the transmission of shocks through what appear to be similar, market-based financial

systems. 9



While the regional perspective reinforces the notion of a trend increase, it should be noted

that stark regional differences have only really emerged during the modern floating rate

period. Forces of gravity were not a factor behind business cycle synchronization during the

classical Gold Standard, as differences in correlations among regions were minor, with the

high correlation between Canada and the United States and, to a much lesser extent, among

the Scandinavian countries, being the main exceptions. During the Bretton Woods period,

increased regional synchronization began to emerge in the core European countries.

Interestingly, the increased synchronization during the interwar period was primarily on

account of an increased synchronization between the cycles in the United States and other

countries, which in turn seems to reflect the equity boom bust cycle and its effects from the

mid-1920s to the mid-1930s.



So far, all the cycle correlations we have studied were based on log first differences of

output. Does the detrending method matter for our findings? Naturally, high frequency noise

is not a great concern, given our panels of annual data, but it is possible that the increases in

cycle correlations from the 19th to the end of the 20th century really reflect changes in trend

comovements. For this reason, we have also looked at correlation patterns in bandpass-



9
    See Bayoumi and Edison (2003) on the distinction between market- and bank-based financial systems.
                                                  - 16 -




filtered log output data (Table 5). 10 The results show that the detrending method makes little

difference and that the same principal changes in the patterns of cycle synchronization are

found with bandpass-filtered output data.



3. The Importance of Common Factors



Another measure of business cycle synchronization is related to the notion of common

factors. Many macroeconomists would probably agree that international business cycle

linkages are best understood as a small set of factors that are common to all countries and

that explain a substantial fraction of fluctuations in major macroeconomic aggregates. Baxter

(1995), for example, refers to the world component to business cycles. 11 The common factors

themselves reflect a combination of global shocks affecting all countries and country-specific

disturbances with significant spillover effects. It is, therefore, quite natural to examine

international business cycle linkages with factor models. 12



In our context, we have estimated the following factor model for each country i in the

sample:




10
     We used the parameter setting recommended by Baxter and King (1999) for annual data.

11
  This is akin to Stock and Watson’s (1989) suggestions to use the first common factor in a panel of business
cycle indicators as the reference cycle.
12
  See, among others, Gerlach (1988), Gregory, Head, and Raynauld (1997), Lumsdaine and Prasad (1999),
Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman (2002), Monfort and others (2002), and Helbling and Bayoumi (2003).
                                                   - 17 -




                                               yit = λi' Ft + ε it                                           (2.1)

where yit denotes (log) output growth in country i at time t, Ft is a vector of factors, λi is a
                                                                                                        '




vector of factor loading for country i, and åit an idiosyncratic error term. In this set-up, the

factors in Ft are common to all countries but each country has specific factor loadings,

allowing for country-specific responses to shocks to the factor. Subsequently, we will call the

product λi' F the common factor(s) for country i. This model is what is called a static

approximate factor model in the literature (e.g., Bai and Ng, 2002). It is static because it does

not allow for dynamics in the relationship between output and the factors. It is approximate

because the set-up allows for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity in the idiosyncratic

components. While seemingly restrictive, these assumptions seem compatible with the

properties of the data we use, given little evidence of significant serial correlation in output

growth rates during all four eras.



A frequently used measure of output synchronization is the fraction of the output variance

that is explained by common factors. Following practices in the literature, we use the first

common factor as a measure of the common elements in cross-country business cycle

fluctuations (Table 6). 13 The results are based on log output growth rates (the results obtained

with bandpass-filtered log output series are, again, very similar). The role that common

factors play in explaining output fluctuations has clearly increased over time. The share of


13
  Bai and Ng (2002) proposed to use information criteria to determine the appropriate number of factors.
However, their Monte Carlo simulations show that for panel datasets where the cross-sectional and time
dimensions are as low as in ours, the tests are not very reliable and tend to imply too high a number of factors.
                                            - 18 -




the variance in output fluctuations attributable to fluctuations in the common factor doubled

from about 20 percent during the Gold Standard era to about 40 percent during the modern

era of flexible exchange rates.



B. The Synchronization of Cycles in Industrial Production



Unfortunately, IP data are only available for some of the countries in our panel. Based on a

small eight country panel, we calculated the same set of synchronization measures for

fluctuations in IP indices over all four eras. With a larger panel, we calculated them for the

post-World War II eras. The results are qualitatively very similar with those for output

fluctuations, and we only show the correlation coefficients (Table 7). Compared with output

fluctuations, all measures clearly suggest a much stronger increase in synchronization over

time. Strikingly, the evidence for much stronger increases in regional synchronization

compared to the average increase is weaker than in the case of output linkages.



         III. EXPLAINING INCREASED S YNCHRONIZATION: THE ROLE OF SHOCKS


Using three measures of synchronization, we found evidence of increased cross-country

business cycle synchronization over time among industrial countries. From an impulse-

propagation perspective, the increased synchronization could reflect changes in the nature of

the impulses (the “shocks”) driving the economies, especially changes in their cross-country

correlations, changes in the transmission channels and mechanisms, resulting inter alia from

increased integration, or, most likely, both.
                                           - 19 -




Disentangling the relative contributions of the changes in the correlation of shocks and

changes in the transmission channels to the changes in output correlations is difficult,

however, as this would require a comprehensive structural model of the economy that can be

estimated empirically. Such a model, which would need to allow for factors such as changes

in trade and financial integration and a multitude of shocks, seems beyond our reach, given

the current state of the art in multi-country modelling. Financial integration, for example, is

not yet satisfactorily accounted for in any of the leading multi-country models.



Against this background, we will proceed with a more modest research agenda. In this

section, we will focus on deriving measures of the impulses driving each economy and study

the changes in their variance-covariance structure. On this basis, we will then attempt to

assess the extent to which changes in this structure of shocks may help to explain the

observed changes in the synchronization of cycles. In the next section, we will focus on how

changes in integration and the policy environment may have shaped changes in business

cycle synchronization.



A. Global Shocks versus Idiosyncratic Shocks



In a first exercise, we will address the issue of whether there is evidence that global shocks

have been driving the increased business cycle synchronization. This is a natural hypothesis,

given the evidence of increased globalization, that is, economic interdependence through
                                                    - 20 -




trade in goods, services, and assets. To structure our discussion, the following canonical,

simple model is a helpful illustrative device:14




                                    y1 t   a11     a12   y1 t −1   ν1 t 
                                     =                            + 
                                    y2 t   a21     a22   y2 t −1   ν2 t                           (3.1)




where yit denotes the log output growth rate in country i. Following Stock and Watson

(2003), the error vector í is assumed to be determined by the following factor structure:15



                                             ν1t       η1t 
                                              = Gζt +  
                                            ν2 t       η2 t 
                                                                                                          (3.2)




In this factor VAR model, æ is a global shock and çi is a country-specific idiosyncratic shock,

both of which are assumed to be white noise processes. G is a vector of factor loadings.

According to this model, increased output synchronization—as measured by output

correlation—between countries 1 and 2 can, ceteris paribus, arise for three reasons:



     •   Increases in the variance of the global shock relative to the country specific

         idiosyncratic shocks.


14
  Canova and Dellas (1993) show how a very stylized two-country real business cycle model implies such a bi-
variate vector autoregressive representation.
15
  In contrast, in the standard dynamic factor model, the coefficient matrix A is usually assumed to be zero and
the dynamics arise from the factors, which are modelled as autoregressive processes.
                                                   - 21 -




     •   Increases in the covariance of the idiosyncratic shocks ç1 and ç2 .



     •   Increases in the “transmission” coefficients a12 and a21, which determine the spillover

         effects that shocks in country 1 have on country 2 and vice versa. 16



Extending the simple bivariate model (3.1) and (3.2) to a general model that includes all the

16 countries in our sample proved to be difficult. First, given few observations for each era,

very few degrees of freedom would be left if the model were estimated even with one lag.

For the interwar era, the number of common observations for all 16 countries is even less

than the number of parameters, so that comparability of the model across eras could not be

ensured. Second, in our annual data, the degree of autocorrelation in output growth is

generally low in all eras. While there are some intrinsic dynamics in the cross-country output

dynamics, they are generally insignificant, as the null hypothesis of a11 =a12 =a21 =a22 =0 could

usually not be rejected in bi-variate VARs. In the circumstances, we used two simplified

versions of the general factor VAR model for the analysis:



     •   The center country model. In this version, the equation for each country’s real GDP

         growth includes lagged own GDP growth and lagged GDP growth in the center

         country (the United Kingdom in the Gold Standard era and the United States in the


16
   In the simple model of Canova and Dellas (op. cit.), these coefficients follow from the production structure,
as foreign intermediate goods are needed to produce the final consumption goods.
                                            - 22 -




       other eras). The rationale behind this model is that idiosyncratic shocks in the center

       country can be transmitted through the traditional channels while idiosyncratic shocks

       elsewhere have only limited effects on other countries.



   •   The trade linkages model. In this version, the equation for each country’s real GDP

       growth includes lagged GDP growth and lagged GDP growth in important trading

       partner countries (the ones reported in Mitchell (1998a, 1998b, and 1998c, as

       explained below). The rationale behind this model is, of course, straightforward.



We estimated the models with a two-step, semi-parametric procedure. In the first, we used

SURE estimators to obtain the coefficients and the residual series í it. In a second step, we

used the approximate factor model approach of section 2.3 to obtain the global shock æ and

the idiosyncratic shocks çi from the residual series í it. Both models turned out to be roughly

similar in terms of information criteria for all eras, although the restrictions implied by the

center model compared to the trade model were rejected by standard likelihood ratio tests

(we note, though, that the values of log determinants of the variance-covariance matrix of the

simple de-meaned log growth rates are generally lower than the information criteria for either

model in each era).



A first set of results concerns the issue of whether the moderation in the volatility of national

output growth rates over time in the postwar period reflects primarily reductions in the
                                                    - 23 -




volatility of global shocks. 17 Table 8 shows the average standard deviations of the national

output series (log growth rates) and compares them with the estimated variances of the global

shock and the average idiosyncratic shock. As was to be expected, the direction of change in

the standard deviations of both global and idiosyncratic shocks generally follows that of the

average standard deviation of output growth. The most striking feature is the change in the

difference between the standard deviations of the two types of shocks. While idiosyncratic

shocks were clearly larger than global shocks during the Gold Standard and the interwar

period, their magnitudes became about equal during the modern floating era. In this sense,

global shocks have become more important in shaping national output dynamics.



A second set of results concerns the issue of whether global shocks or spillovers drive the

observed increases in output synchronization. Table 9 presents averages of 4-step variance

decompositions of the output growth rates for the four eras, distinguishing between the shares

of total output variance explained by the global shock, the idiosyncratic shocks, and

transmission. To have a variance decomposition based on orthogonal shocks, we used the

diagonal of the variance-covariance matrix of the çi series rather than the full matrix. 18

Hence, we assume that the transmission of shocks—which can be both due to global shocks




17
  The general moderation in the amplitude of output fluctuations has been analyzed by Blanchard and Simon
(2001).

18
     We note that the cross-correlation among idiosyncratic shocks is very minor.
                                                  - 24 -




and idiosyncratic shocks—occurs with a one-year lag. 19 Output synchronization due to a

global shock is thus immediate, while that due to transmission occurs gradually.



The variance decomposition suggests the following. First, idiosyncratic shocks have become

less important in shaping each country’s output dynamics. Second, both global shocks and

transmission have become more important. Third, the relative importance of the last two

factors in accounting for the lesser role of idiosyncratic shocks depends on the model. The

center model suggests that the increases in the variance share of the global shock account for

most of the reduction in the variance share of the idiosyncratic shocks. The increase

accounted for by the transmission of idiosyncratic shocks is minor. On the other hand, the

trade model suggests that both increases in the variance shares of the global factor and the

transmission account for the reduction in the variance share of idiosyncratic shocks.

However, it is noteworthy that shock transmission appears more important for peripheral

countries than for core countries in the trade model. For the core countries, the increase in the

variance share related to global shocks accounts for most of the decrease in the share

explained by idiosyncratic shocks.



Our factor VAR models thus suggest that the increased business cycle linkages among core

countries, as measured by output correlations, largely reflect the dynamics of common global

shocks. Remarkably, the increased importance of transmission for peripheral countries only

19
  The shares of the global shocks and the idiosyncratic shocks reported in Table 9 are the shares explained by
each country’s own autoregressive structure in response to each of the two shocks. We do not, therefore,
distinguish between the transmission of global shocks and idiosyncratic shocks.
                                                   - 25 -




arises in the trade model. This suggests that it is not transmission from the center country, a

channel that operates in both models, that accounts for the increased variance share of

transmission. It is rather the intra-European transmission that matters in the modern floating

era, a fact that seems consistent with the above average output synchronization among

European countries reported in Table 2.



For a further understanding of the role of global shocks, Figure 3 is instructive. Each panel

shows the global shocks from the trade model (solid lines) for an era, supplemented by dotted

lines depicting the global shocks from the simple factor model discussed in section 2.3 and

bars showing time dummies—the equivalent of global shocks—from an error components

model that are significant at the 5 percent level. 20 21 We estimated the latter to obtain a

measure for large and important shocks. The global shocks implied by the two factor-based

approaches—the trade model and the simple factor model—are surprisingly similar except

for the interwar period, although the shocks from the trade model are generally smaller in

magnitude. The latter finding is not that surprising since the possibility of transmission

implies lower shock variances with equal output variances.




20
   Naturally, only the product ËFt is identified in this factor model. We normalized the square of the factor
loadings, i.e., Ë’Ë/16=1, to identify Ft . We believe this to be the natural normalization, as it allows for
comparable variances between outputs and factors. The alternative would be to normalize the factor variance
to 1 (Bai and Ng, 2002).
21
     We estimated the following traditional error component model with our panel dataset:

where ët denotes a time dummy taking on the value 1 in time t and çi,t a shock specific to country i.

The general picture emerging from Figure 3 is that global shocks appear noticeably important

at times of world-wide downturns, suggesting an asymmetry between downturns and

upturns. 22 However, as the differences in the global shocks for the interwar period illustrate,

simple factor models can occasionally identify global shocks when it is really the

transmission of a large idiosyncratic shock in one of the large economies that is behind

synchronized output fluctuations, a problem noted by Stock and Watson (2003). 23 The Great

Depression is a case in point. It originated largely in the United States, but was transmitted

abroad rapidly through “the golden fetters” of the Gold Standard (Friedman and Schwartz,

1963, and Eichengreen, 1992). Similarly, the “Volcker shock” in 1981/82 also hit other

countries hard at a time when the after effects of the 1979-80 oil shock were still widely felt.

Indeed, this corroborates findings reported in IMF (2002), where episodes of broadly

synchronized classical recessions were found to have generally coincided with recessions in

the center country. 24



Overall, our results are consistent with both globalization and business cycle moderation.

With increased economic and financial interdependence through trade and financial linkages,

the scope for global shocks or the rapid transmission of shocks in the center countries has


22
  This corroborates Helbling and Bayoumi (2003), who found a similar result for the G-7 countries during
1973-2001 using quarterly data and a dynamic factor model to isolate common cycles.
23
   While global shocks continue to be important in the trade model, it can be noted that the magnitudes of these
shocks in this model are smaller compared to the simple factor model, highlighting the importance of
transmission in output synchronization.
24
   Helbling and Bayoumi (2003) have shown that during 1973-2001, the tendency for major growth contractions
to be synchronized and coincide with recessions in the center country also holds.

clearly increased. In addition, with global shocks, floating exchange rates do not provide

much scope for insulation, since shocks affect all countries in similar ways. At the same time,

business cycle amplitudes have clearly moderated during the post-World War II period,

reflecting, among other factors, changes in sectoral structure, automatic stabilizers, the use of

lender of last resort operations, and the use of discretionary counter-cyclical policies. 25 In this

context, it is interesting to note that the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks has decreased more

than that of global shocks. Among other factors, this finding is consistent with the notion that

the changes in the sectoral structure and the use of automatic stabilizers as well as other

counter-cyclical policies have been fairly similar across the industrial countries.



B. Demand and Supply Shocks over Time



In a second exercise, we study what are often called “demand” and “supply” shocks by era

for each country and analyze their correlation structure. Following Blanchard and Quah

(1989), the two kinds of shocks are derived on the basis of the residuals of bivariate vector

autoregressive (VAR) models for output growth and inflation for each country by era. 26 The

demand and supply shocks are orthogonal and are identified by differences in their long-run




25
  See McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), Ahmed, Levin and Wilson (2002), Blanchard and Simon (2001),
IMF (2002), Dalsgaard, Elmeskov, and Park (2002), and Stock and Watson (2002) for recent studies examining
the volatility of output fluctuations in industrial countries, especially the United States, and the reasons thereof.
26
  Bordo and Jonung (1996) and Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1994) used the same approach with similar data for
other purposes.
                                                     - 29 -




cumulative effects on growth. 27 Demand shocks only have temporary effects on real GDP

while supply shocks have permanent effects on real GDP. We would like to emphasize,

however, that we merely follow conventional wisdom in the terminology and that we will not

focus on whether the impulse response functions meet the standard overidentifying

restrictions. 28 We are primarily interested in obtaining shock series that can be used to

analyze whether the increased importance of global shocks concerns primarily permanent or

temporary shocks or both. In addition, we hope to corroborate our earlier findings using

another approach that does not require assumptions about the factor structure and relies on

country-specific information in the data only.



For the underlying VAR models, two versions were estimated for each country. 29 For the first

version, the lag length for each country model was determined on the basis of the standard

likelihood ratio tests, starting from an initial lag length of 3. For the second version, the lag

length for each country model was determined on the basis of the Bayesian information

criterion, also starting from an initial lag length of 3. The results are very similar, and we

only show those based on information criteria minimization.




27
   In addition to this long-run behavioral restriction, the identification requires additional restrictions. Following
standard practice, the restrictions used ensure that the variance-covariance matrix of the orthogonalized shocks
matches that of the VAR residuals.

28
  Bordo and Jonung (1996) discuss these and related issues in the context of a similar exercise that also uses
long time series going back to the late 19th century.
29
  We note that, unlike in the case of bi-variate VARs for output growth, the autoregressive dynamics are more
important in this set-up.
                                           - 30 -




For supply shocks, the average correlation has clearly increased over time for both VAR

versions (Table 10). From being roughly uncorrelated during the classical Gold Standard,

they became more correlated over time, although the average correlation and the change

between the Bretton Woods era and the modern floating rate era remain small in magnitude.

With regard to the regional breakdown, we note that the increase in the correlations of supply

or permanent shocks is particularly strong for the continental European and, even more so,

for the core European countries and the United States and Canada. In addition, the increase in

supply shock correlations has been steady for the case of the United States and Canada while

for the European countries, it largely occurred between the Bretton Woods era and the

modern floating rate era, which is consistent with the patterns in European integration.



For demand shocks, the average correlation followed a u-shaped pattern (Table 11). After the

classical Gold Standard, the correlation of demand shocks fell during the interwar and the

Bretton Woods eras and then increased again during the modern floating rate era to a level

above the initial one. Regarding the regional breakdown, we note that the increase in the

correlations of demand or temporary shocks is particularly strong for the continental

European countries and, even more so, for the core European countries. This regional

increase in correlations occurred largely between the Bretton Woods era and the modern

floating rate era, which is consistent with the coordination of policies required with the

pegging of currencies within Europe.



Overall, the direction of changes in the average correlation of the demand and supply shocks

obtained with the first versions of the VAR seems consistent with the direction of changes in
                                            - 31 -




output correlations. Under the classical Gold Standard, output correlations were, on average,

zero, which, according to our shock decomposition exercise, coincided with roughly

uncorrelated shocks. The subsequent increase in output correlations reflected in part

increased shock correlations. The fact that output correlations increased by more than shock

correlations could be explained with larger spillover effects, as cross-border economic and

financial linkages in the modern floating rate period have also risen compared to the classical

Gold Standard era.



Finally, we also examined the factor structure in our panel of shocks series (Table 12). This

analysis suggests that the shares of the shock variances explained by the global component

contained in each national shocks series increased over time for demand or temporary

shocks. For permanent shocks, the evidence is less clear-cut. In particular, relative to the

Gold Standard era, the increase is very small only. The fact that the global component plays

an increasing role in demand shock realizations is consistent with our earlier finding of the

global synchronization of recessions, the effects of which are, after all, reversed in the

subsequent recoveries.



    IV. EXPLAINING INCREASED S YNCHRONIZATION II: INTEGRATION AND POLICIES




Changes in the nature of shocks are only one reason for the observed increased in business

cycle synchronization. In parallel with the factor model-based literature on the sources of

international business cycle linkages, the role of structural factors such as trade integration
                                                   - 32 -




and exchange rate regimes in determining shock correlations as well as the transmission

coefficients aij has also been studied. For example, as noted by Canova and Dellas (1993),

the extent to which two or more countries are linked through trade is an important

determinant of the aij coefficients and thus of the strength of business cycle linkages. In this

section, we will focus on how changes in integration and the policy environment may have

shaped changes in business cycle synchronization.



                                           A. Trade Integration




Starting with Canova and Dellas (1993), the role of trade interdependence in explaining

international business cycle linkages has received considerable attention in the literature. 30

Frankel and Rose (1998) found that in the period from 1959-1993, OECD countries with

closer trade links tended to have more tightly correlated business cycles. In this subsection,

we follow Frankel and Rose’s methodology and examine the linkages between business cycle

synchronization and trade links for the four eras that are the subject of our paper. In

particular, we will try to address the questions of whether and to what extent the observed

changes in trade linkages can explain the changes in business cycle synchronization.



Using data from Mitchell (1998a,1998b, and 1998c) for the Gold Standard and the interwar

period and from the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics for the Bretton Woods era and


30
     See, for example, Frankel and Rose (1998), Otto, Voss, and Willard (2001), and Imbs (2003).

modern floating era, we constructed a measure of the trade intensity between countries i and j

proposed by Frankel and Rose (1998):31



                                                          X ijt + M ijt
                                                wYijt =
                                                           Yit + Y jt                                       (4.2)


where X and M denote exports and imports, respectively, and where a double subscript ij

stands for bilateral trade values. Y denotes nominal GDP. Unfortunately, based on the limited

information provided in Mitchell (1998a, 1998b, and 1998c), we could not construct the two

measures for all the 120 correlation observations that we have for each era. We will thus

show results for a sample of 59 observations for each of the four eras and for a sample of all

the 120 country pair combinations for the post-World War II eras.



With these measures, we estimated cross-sectional regressions of the form for each era ô:

                                      f (corrij ,τ ) = α + β ln(wijk ,τ ) + ε ij ,τ                         (4.3)

where the bar over the trade intensity measure wk (k=T, Y) indicates that it is an era average

and where the function f(·) maps the output correlation coefficient corrij from the interval [-




31
  We also constructed the other measure proposed by Frenkel and Rose (1998), where bilateral trade is
normalized by total trade:

                 Xijt + M ijt
wijtT =
          X it + M it + X jt + M jt


where simple subscripts i or j indicates aggregate trade values. We found that this measure lacked a clear time
trend, which suggests that the direction of trade has been quite stable over time.
                                                         - 34 -




1,1] to [- , ] so that standard assumptions in the linear regression model are met. 32 As do

Frankel and Rose, we treat trade intensity as an endogenous variable and use gravity

variables as instrumental variables. Specifically, the following three instruments are used: the

natural logarithm of the distance between the main business centre in each country, a dummy

variable for common borders, and a dummy variable for common language.



Table 13 shows the results for both trade intensity measures and for both the smaller and

larger sample, as discussed earlier. The estimated â coefficients all have the right sign but

they are not always significant. However, the insignificant coefficients are confined to the

smaller panel covering all four eras, which may reflect small sample problems, as we are

missing bilateral trade relations among the smaller European countries in particular. The

simple regressions suggest the following observations.



•           There is substantial variation in the slope coefficients (and the constant terms) across

            eras. In fact, the assumption of identical slope coefficients and constant terms is

            rejected for both samples.


•           As do Frankel and Rose, we find that changes in bilateral trade intensities are

            estimated to have large effects on output correlations. For example, a one percentage




                                       1+ x 
32
     We use the function f ( x) = ln        following Otto, Voss, and Willard (2001). Frankel and Rose (1998) used
                                      1 − x 
raw correlation measures.
                                                  - 35 -




          point increase in trade intensity generally raises output correlations by more than 3½

          percentage points in the case of bilateral trade normalized by GDP.


•         The difference in the estimated â coefficients for the Gold Standard and interwar eras

          is small. Between the Bretton Woods era and the modern floating rate era, however,

          the synchronization effects of higher trade intensity appear to have increased, which

          may suggest that the synchronization effects of trade intensity depend on other factors

          as well. We will take up this issue below, but note in the meantime that this finding is

          consistent with the argument that stronger trade linkages in recent years have

          reflected common policies, including, for example, those related to European

          monetary integration. 33 It is also consistent with our earlier finding of increased

          structural shock correlations, since bilateral output correlations are determined by the

          product of the transmission coefficients, which in turn can be considered to be

          functions of trade intensities, and shock correlations. 34


•         Finally, similar to Otto, Voss, and Willard (2001), we find that while they are

          significant determinants, trade intensities alone explain relatively little of the overall

          variation in bilateral output correlations, especially for the interwar and the Bretton

          Woods eras. For the Gold Standard era, bilateral trade intensities appear to explain

          about the same share of output correlations as during the modern floating era with the



33
     This argument was advanced by Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993).
34
  In the general autoregressive model (3.1), the positive interaction between transmission coefficients and
shock correlations holds for a wide range of the admissible parameter values.
                                                    - 36 -




           first measure. Interestingly, the explanatory power of the gravity variables in the first

           stage regressions appears to increase over time.




So far, the results suggest that bilateral trade intensities explain only a small share of the

differences found in bilateral output correlations for each era. Can changes in trade intensities

from era to era explain the increased international business cycle synchronization? In Table

14, we show the estimated impact of the actual changes in trade intensities between eras on

bilateral output correlations (the second set of columns in the table corresponds to the larger

sample for the postwar eras). Since the restriction of identical slope coefficients between eras

can generally be rejected, we use both the estimated values for the current and the previous

era to generate predicted changes. 35



The actual changes in the average bilateral output correlation are generally much larger than

the changes predicted by changes in trade intensities. The model is successful in explaining

the increase in output correlations from the interwar to the Bretton Woods eras, where the

rise in trade intensity explains roughly half of the increase or more, depending on the â

coefficient used in the calculations. This finding is consistent with the notion that trade

liberalization after World War II, when the earlier increase in the restrictiveness of trade

regimes was reversed under the umbrella of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

(Irwin, 1995), has played an important role in shaping business cycle synchronization. The


35
     We do not use changes in the constant between eras in the calculation of the predicted changes.
                                            - 37 -




model is less successful in explaining the strong increase in output correlations from the

Bretton Woods era to the modern floating rate period. We interpret this as possible evidence

that the momentum of trade liberalization has slowed down in recent decades, as efforts in

the most recent GATT/WTO rounds have shifted from tariff reductions on industrial goods

towards nontariff barriers and trade in agriculture and services (Irwin, op. cit.). It also may be

that increased financial integration played a bigger role in shaping output synchronization

than trade integration during recent decades.



                                 B. Asset Market Integration




Increasing asset market integration is another channel through which globalization can affect

international business cycle synchronization. Baxter and Crucini (1995), for example, show

how asset market integration affects the spillover effects of country-specific shocks and, thus,

output correlations. Unfortunately, asset market integration remains difficult to measure.

Bilateral data in (net) asset trade is all but unavailable, especially for a period covering our

four eras. Measuring asset market integration through the correlation of asset returns may

suffer from problems of reverse causality. We decided, therefore, to use a very crude

indicator to measure asset market integration. Based on the annual capital control dummy

variables for each country prepared by Bordo et al (2001), we derived an indicator, which we

will refer to as CC, that measures the number of years (as a fraction of the total number of

years covered by each era) during which capital flows were subject to restrictions.
                                               - 38 -




With this indicator, we first estimated the simple regression equation:




                                  f (corrij,τ ) = α + δ CC ij,τ + ε ij,τ                     (4.4)



where the function f (·) is the same as above for each era but the Gold Standard era. The latter

is because our dummy variables suggest that none of the countries in our sample imposed

capital controls. Ordinary least squares was used to estimate the coefficients. Subsequently,

we also estimated the following equation that combines trade and asset market integration:




                          f (corrij,τ ) = α + β ln(wijY ,τ ) + δ CC ij,τ + ε ij ,τ           (4.5)



for both post-World War II eras. By focusing on the postwar period only, we have 120

observations for the trade intensity measures, which is preferable, given that we suspect

small sample problems for the data set covering all four eras. As above, we treat the trade

intensity measure wY as an endogenous variable using the gravity variables discussed above

as instruments (and our capital control indicator CC).



The results are shown in Table 15. The ä coefficients have the right signs for the interwar and

modern floating rate eras but are insignificant. The conclusion is that adding the capital

control indicator to the trade equation does not add to the explanatory power of the equation.

We interpret these results mainly as a reflection of possible shortcomings of our dummy
                                                  - 39 -




variable rather than as a rejection of the hypothesis that financial market integration has been

a major factor behind international business cycle synchronization. 36



                                       C. Exchange Rate Policy




One of the main arguments, if not the main argument, in favor of flexible exchange rates has

been that they allow a country to insulate itself from external shocks through an independent

monetary policy. With fixed exchange rates, the scope for pro-cyclical spillovers can be

expected to be larger, unless capital controls or other restrictions allow for some monetary

independence.



To some extent, we have accounted for differences in the exchange rate and external policy

environment by distinguishing between four eras with different international monetary

regimes. Nevertheless, there are interesting cross-sectional variations in the exchange rate

regime in each era. For example, Italy went off the Gold Standard in 1894 and did not return

to a gold parity until 1928. To the extent that the cross-sectional variation in exchange rate

regimes has changed over time, this may be a factor that could explain changes in the


36
   Other measures of financial market integration have been suggested to us. In particular, our discussant and
other conference participants suggested that we use Lewis’ (1996) consumption sharing “betas” to construct an
alternative measure. The consumption betas are the coefficients from a panel regression of consumption growth
on GDP growth, which, with perfect cross-country consumption insurance, should not be statistically
significantly different from zero. However, we faced the problem that the betas are not only positive and
statistically significantly different from zero (a problem also faced by Lewis) but also increasing in magnitude
from era to era, which contradicts the widely-accepted hypothesis of a u-shaped pattern in international
financial integration (Obstfeld and Taylor, 1998 and 2003, and Bordo, Eichengreen, and Kim, 1998). We intend
to explore this puzzle in future research.
                                                      - 40 -




average business cycle synchronization from era to era. To estimate the effects of exchange

rate regimes, we have constructed a dummy variable, which, again, is based on the annual

exchange rate regime indicators for each country prepared by Bordo et al (2001). The

indicator, which we will refer to as Z, measures the number of years (as a fraction of the total

number of years covered by each era) during which the exchange rate between two countries

was pegged (disregarding re-alignments in the case of fixed but adjustable rates).



With this indicator, we estimated the simple equation:




                                   f (corrij ,τ ) = α + γ Z ij ,τ + δ CC ij,τ + ε ij ,τ             (4.6)

for each era. 37 We would expect the ã coefficient to be positive for the reasons noted above.

Despite earlier problems, we kept the capital control indicator CC in the equation, since it is

important to control for these effects. Subsequently, we also added the exchange regime

indicator to the trade equation but only for the two post-World War II eras for the reason

explained above.



The results are shown in Table 16. The ã coefficients generally have the right sign and are

significant at the 10 or 5 percent levels, except for the Gold Standard era. The latter may be

explained by the fact that only four out of the 16 countries had not pegged their currencies to

gold (at least during some time) in this era. For the interwar period, the ã coefficient has the


37
     As explained above, the capital control indicator CC is redundant for the Gold Standard era.
                                                     - 41 -




wrong sign, which may reflect the fact that the countries hanging on to the Gold Standard

after the United States and other countries went off resorted to exchange controls and

increased trade restrictions to maintain their peg. The ä coefficients are generally of the right

sign, except for the Bretton Woods period.



The exchange rate regime effect is not robust to small variations in the specification. 38 For

example, adding the trade intensity variable reduces the size of the exchange rate regime

effect considerably. Similarly, the significance also changes once that additional variable is

included. Finally, we would like to note one interesting aspect for the modern floating rate

period. If a European country dummy is included, the exchange rate regime indicator

becomes insignificant, which can be interpreted as evidence that the exchange rate pegging

within Europe (all bilateral fixed exchange rate regimes in the modern floating rate period are

confined to that continent for our panel of countries) has been really important or that the

exchange rate indicator picks up the effects of European integration more generally.




38
   Frankel and Rose (1998), who in one specification added a dummy variable for country pairs with fixed
exchange rates, argued that the exchange rate regime choice is also endogenous and used the same gravity
variables as instruments to correct for this endogeneity. We remain somewhat skeptical about the relevance of
these instruments and note the technical problems in using a 1-0 variable as an endogenous variable in a linear
regression. We have, however, used instrumental variable estimators with the same instruments to check the
robustness of our results. For the simple equation (0.6), the results are robust. In fact, the size of the exchange
rate effect increases somewhat, and the standard errors of the ã coefficients decrease. For the interwar period,
the sign of the ã coefficient changes. If the trade intensity variable is included, the results do not remain robust.
In particular, as Frankel and Rose, we find that the ã coefficients are negative and insignificant.

                                       V. CONCLUSION




In this paper, we have documented evidence on the synchronization of business cycles across

16 countries over the past century and a quarter, demarcated into four exchange rate regimes.

We find using three different methodologies that there is a secular trend towards increased

synchronization for much of the twentieth century and that it occurs across diverse exchange

rate regimes. This finding is of interest because it is in marked contrast to much of the recent

literature, which has focused primarily on the evidence for the past 20 or 30 years and which

has produced mixed results.



We then considered a number of possible explanations for the observed pattern of increased

synchronization. We first ascertained the role of shocks demarcated into country-specific

(idiosyncratic) and global (common). Our key finding here is that global (common) shocks

are the dominant influence across all regimes. We note, however, that it remains difficult to

distinguish between “true” global shocks and major shocks in the center country(ies). For

example, shocks in the largest country, the U.S., were, unsurprisingly, a key factor in the

worldwide Great Depression.



This finding coupled with earlier evidence produced by ourselves and others that business

cycles since World War II have become less volatile, less frequent and asymmetric with a

tendency towards recoveries exceeding downturns in duration, has some interesting
                                                   - 43 -




implications. We suggest that what may be occurring is that the weakening in national

business cycles since World War II coupled with the diminution of idiosyncratic shocks

reflect the forces discussed by Zarnowitz (1992) and others, such as changes in the

composition of output, the advent of automatic stabilizers, improvements in discretionary

monetary and fiscal policy, the implementation of effective lenders of last resort and a

financial safety net, and the proliferation of private risk sharing instruments. 39



At the same time, the increasing importance of global shocks we posit reflects the forces of

globalization, especially the integration of goods and services through international trade

(Findlay and O’Rourke 2003) and the integration of financial markets (Obstfeld and Taylor

2003). We present evidence showing a modest role for increasing bilateral trade in explaining

synchronization, with stronger evidence for regional integration in Europe and North

America. Evidence for the role of financial integration proxied by the removal of capital

controls is inconclusive.



Finally, we began considering explicitly the role of the policy regime in explaining the

pattern of synchronization. We find little evidence for the prediction that adhering to fixed




39
    We would like to emphasize that the decrease in idiosyncratic shock volatility does not necessarily imply that
it is the volatility of the underlying “deep structural” shocks (e.g., a widespread drought) that we are measuring.
Given that we derive the shocks on the basis of GDP series alone, it means that the effects of these deep shocks
on output have diminished. There is, however, some evidence that shocks that are widely perceived as being
exogenous may have an endogenous component. Barsky and Kilian (2001), for example, argue that the sharp
increase in real oil prices in the 1970s was in part a reaction to the earlier massive expansion of the world
money supply.

exchange rates fosters synchronization except in the period since 1973, and these results

appear driven largely by the process of European Monetary Union.



What are the policy lessons to be gleaned from these findings? One lesson from the

dampening of national cycles and the diminution in idiosyncratic shocks is that to the extent

that they reflect sound domestic macro policy and the creation of an environment conducive

to the development of both private and public risk sharing institutions and instruments that

these policies should continue to be fostered.



A second lesson is that globalization seems to be associated with the creation of a global

business cycle. Whether policies should be developed at the global level to counter it is

another matter. Regarding monetary policy, experience suggest that the key to success has

been that policy makers get their policy objectives right. In addition, for monetary policy to

be effective, it is also critical that policy makers get the shocks right. In this sense, policy

coordination is likely to be very important. As Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002) have argued, there

is probably little gain from policy coordination beyond this, provided that central banks have

the right policy objectives. The generally negative experience with policy coordination in the

1970s and 1980s supports this view (Frankel, 1990).



A third lesson, to paraphrase Forrest Gump, is that shocks happen! We live in a stochastic

world and shocks generate business cycles via diffuse propagation mechanisms. Moreover

productivity shocks occur in a non linear fashion, asset markets overshoot and people are at

times over optimistic and other times over pessimistic. In this reality the best strategy is to
                                          - 45 -




encourage the development of private market mechanisms to insure against cyclical risks, in

the case of incomplete markets related to market failures to provide public insurance, and to

maintain stable and predictable macro policies.
