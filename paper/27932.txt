                                         ABSTRACT

We quantify the effect of market disruptions due to COVID-19 on the lives of households in rural
areas of Liberia and Malawi, utilizing panel data from phone surveys that were implemented as
part of a randomized cash transfer experiment. The surveys began collection several months
before the pandemic and have continued throughout it. The household survey included a
consistent set of internationally accepted and validated questions on food security (the household
dietary diversity score, the household hunger scale, and the food consumption score). In both
countries, market activity was severely disrupted and we observe large declines in income among
market vendors, but we find no evidence of declines in food security for households in the short
run. Even though we observe no adverse effects of the lockdowns on food security among the
control group, cash transfers improved dietary quality and quantity over the low levels observed
at baseline.

1       Introduction
Rural Africa has largely been an afterthought during the COVID-19 pandemic, due in part to rela-
tively lower disease prevalence.1 Yet while case counts are relatively modest, economic disruptions
have been nearly as intense as those in developed countries.2 This study focuses on 2 countries:
Liberia, which ordered a full shelter-in-place for 3 months, and Malawi, which lacked a shelter-
in-place but still closed schools and placed restrictions on transportation and gatherings. Both
countries restricted cross-border movement.
    The impact of these restrictions on rural households is not obvious ex ante. On the one hand,
Malawi and Liberia are among the poorest countries in the world; the average household in this
study spends less than $1 per day and has almost no financial wealth. Safety nets are weak in both
countries, much of the workforce is in the informal sector, and governments have limited financial
and logistical capacity to identify beneficiaries and provide income assistance. Indeed, in our study
areas, no households reported receiving assistance during the pandemic. Many media accounts take
this view, warning of millions being pushed into poverty and even of imminent starvation (FAO,
IFPRI and WFP (2020)). On the other hand, rural areas are less likely to be affected by the
virus itself, because of low population density, remoteness from population centers, and reliance on
farming (which can be practiced at social distance). They may also be similarly insulated from the
lockdowns – while economic activity in population centers has clearly declined, this may not have
spilled over into more rural areas.
    We measure the impacts of the COVID lockdowns on well-being using monthly phone surveys
with households as well as with food vendors in local markets. The surveys were implemented
as part of an ongoing evaluation of a large unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program, and data
collection started well before the global onset of COVID-19, and have continued throughout the
pandemic. The household survey was conducted every 2 months (with half of the sample interviewed
each month) and includes questions on food security, income, labor supply, expenditures, transfers
and other related outcomes. The second survey is with food vendors in markets in the study area,
as well as in comparable markets elsewhere in the country, and is conducted monthly. This survey
includes questions on food prices; in addition, in the weeks following the imposition of COVID-
related public health measures, we added retrospective questions on market activity including
income, revenues, the number of customers, and supply chains. Finally, in both surveys, we added
modules specific to COVID-19, including questions on attitudes and behavior changes.
    While there has been an explosion of research on the economic impacts of COVID-associated
market disruptions, this study makes two main contributions. First and foremost, our household

      At this writing, according to Worldometer, there have been about 1.5 million cases and 35,000 deaths in Africa
(population 1.2 billion), and about half of these are in the country of South Africa. By contrast, North America has
approximately 9 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths (population 580 million) while Europe has approximately
5 million cases and 220,000 deaths (population 740 million).

      A map-visualization of the stringency of the lockdowns (as of May 2020, the height of restrictions), based on the
University of Oxford’s Government Response Tracker is available here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-
stringency-index?year=2020-05-01.

survey includes standardized questions on food intake, specifically the household dietary diversity
score (HDDS), the food consumption score (FCS), and the household hunger scale (HHS). These
measures are recommended for use by organizations such as the FAO and USAID, and have been
validated in several settings to meaningfully correlate with food security.3 Second, we use the cash
transfer experiment to evaluate the effect of cash during the lockdowns.
    We find that knowledge about the virus was high, that people are concerned about contract-
ing the virus and have changed their behavior consistent with health guidance, and that market
disruptions were enforced. We find major declines in market activity in both countries, which is
not surprising in Liberia where there was a lockdown, but is important to document in Malawi
where there was no official restriction. Food vendors suffered large income losses – monthly profit
declined by about 42% in Malawi and 52% in Liberia. Effects on prices show no consistent pattern.
In Liberia we observe price increases of about 4-9% for all food items and of 12-20% for staples
such as rice and cassava; in Malawi, we actually observe large declines in prices of food, likely due
to the harvest coinciding with the lockdown, and even relative to historical trends.
    Yet despite these disruptions, our main result is that we observe no evidence of worsened food
security in either country (for either the treatment or control groups in the experiment). This
is not because government or NGO support programs mitigated negative effects (no households
reported receiving any such support during this period). This finding is not to diminish the fact
that in both countries, the level of food security is low – in Liberia, 40% of households reported
at baseline that a household member went to bed hungry in the past month, while in Malawi this
percentage was 48%. However, we find that this low level of food security did not further worsen
during the market disruptions. We also find that cash transfers modestly improved food security,
which is noteworthy because transfers were sent well prior to the crisis. This result is similar to
Banerjee et al. (2020), who study the effects of universal basic income (UBI) in Kenya and like us,
find modest effects on food security. Our context differs from a UBI, in that the transfers we study
pre-date the pandemic onset.
    Why are effects so modest? Most respondents in our sample are subsistence farmers, and
farming was exempt from restrictions. Respondents do also engage in other income-generating
activities like casual labor, or small business, but income from these sources is very limited (less
than $10 per month), and we observe modest declines. Finally, while markets have been restricted,
they were nevertheless open, and the price of food has increased only modestly in Liberia and has
actually declined in Malawi.
    In this study context, it appears that the remoteness of rural areas, and its reliance on subsis-
tence farming, may have actually helped mitigate negative effects – while economic activity clearly
declined in population centers, as well as for market vendors, effects appear much more muted for
study households, most of whom are farmers.4 While our results are for only 2 countries, they

    Our results share some similarities with Ceballos, Kannan and Kramer (2020), who find that impacts of lockdowns
were linked with market integration levels – farmer incomes declined in remote areas where market integration was
poorer, but consumption improved because more stocks were available locally. However, we do not observe a decline

suggest that temporary lockdowns can be implemented in rural areas like these, without worsen-
ing food insecurity (at least for most households). It is possible that other people in these study
areas, such as service workers, suffered during the lockdown; however, these jobs are rare in our
study samples. It is also clear that some business owners like vendors lost income during the crisis;
although these individuals are better off to start with in our data, it is possible that food security
declined for them. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the typical farming household was able
to cope, which we believe is an important result given that these 2 countries are among the poor-
est in the world, and our study samples include people living well below the global poverty line.
That being said, we reiterate that these findings could be specific to these areas and could differ
in other contexts 5 , and could also differ in future pandemics if lockdowns last longer, since this
study focuses only on the short term.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the study context, Section 3
presents results, and Section 4 concludes.


2     Experimental Design, Background, and Study Context
This project is based on field work that has been ongoing in Liberia and Malawi since 2018. The
design is nearly identical in both countries, with minor context-specific differences. In each coun-
try, we are evaluating the effect of UCTs which are being given out by the NGO GiveDirectly
(henceforth, GD). The cash transfers average $500, roughly equivalent to annual household expen-
ditures. The treatment is randomized at the village level: in treatment villages, all households
receive cash, while control villages receive nothing.6 Villages were randomly selected to receive
$250, $500, or $750 per household, paid in monthly $250 installments, translating into 1, 2, or 3
payments.Additionally, in Liberia, respondents were randomized into being paid in this fashion, or
quarterly; in Malawi, households were randomly selected to have the male or female head receive
the transfer. Transfers are made via mobile money; since pre-existing mobile money usage is low,
beneficiaries are given the option to buy cell phones.7
    The study areas were chosen by GD and USAID based on poverty levels, cell phone coverage,
and proximity to roads. In Liberia, the project takes place in 6 districts8 in Bong and Nimba
counties. In Malawi, the project takes place in Chiradzulu and Machinga districts in the Southern
Region. In Liberia, the project was phased in over 2 years: a first wave (90 villages) was enrolled
in early 2019, while a second wave (210 villages) began enrolling in early 2020. However, due
in income in our data.
    5
      Indeed, several studies of COVID in Africa find large declines in food security in Uganda (Mahmud and Riley
(2020)) and Nigeria (Amare et al. (2020))
    6
      The decision to apply universal targeting, i.e. give transfers to everybody, was made with GD to minimize
within-village conflict. However, since there is limited funding, this meant working in a few modestly-sized villages.
The average number of households in sampled villages was 27 in Liberia and 55 in Malawi. The villages are therefore
not meant to be representative of larger villages.
    7
      We also cross-cut a “market access” intervention with the cash transfers. We control for this treatment, but it
is not a focus.
    8
      Year 1 of the study takes place in Salala and Yeallequelleh districts in Bong and Year 2 in the districts of Twan
River, Meinpea Mahn, Leewehpea Mahn, and Buu Yao, in Nimba, as well as a part of Yeallequelleh district in Bong.

to COVID-related disruptions, many villages were not enrolled until late August. In Malawi, all
villages were enrolled in 2019. A map of study locations, with pins of the study villages and markets,
is included as Appendix Figure A2. Appendix Figure A1 has a timeline of project activities.
   In total, 600 villages were sampled (300 in each country), and we attempted to enroll 10 house-
holds per village in the study. Where possible, treatment intensity was varied by geographic location
(the smallest level of governance above the village), and stratified by TA in Malawi and district/clan
in Liberia.

2.1      COVID-19 disruptions in Liberia and Malawi
Liberia’s response to COVID was typical for Africa. Following the first case on March 16, the
country immediately banned entry from countries with more than 200 cases, closed schools, and
restricted public transportation. On March 21, the government announced a state of national
health emergency, placing restrictions on bars, restaurants, markets, and other gathering places.
On March 24, Montserrado and Margibi counties including the capital and the airport) were ordered
to shelter in place. Overland borders were closed. On April 8, a state of emergency placed the
counties of Montserrado, Margibi, Nimba, and Grand Kru under shelter-in-place starting April 10.
This was extended to the entire country on April 24. Restrictions were removed on July 22.
   Malawi’s response was more atypical, due to a legal challenge upheld by the country’s High
Court. The government announced a “state of disaster” on March 20th, which mandated school
closures, restrictions on public gatherings and on travel. On April 1, the border with Mozambique
closed. On April 14, the government announced a country-wide lockdown (due to start on April
18th), but this order was challenged and was overturned by the High Court on April 19th. Without
a country-wide lockdown, Malawi’s response was one of the weakest in Africa, ranking 57/100
(compared to 88/100 for Libera) on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker.9
   As of this writing, Liberia has had about 1,300 cases and 82 deaths (population of about 5
million), while the corresponding numbers in are Malawi 5,600, 176, and 18 million.

2.2      Sample selection and surveys
We drew a sample using information provided by GD. To select villages, GD visited each village
considered for study inclusion, where GD field staff marked each habitation structure with a GPS
pin. We randomly selected study households from this list of GPS pins, and targeted female heads
of households for surveys (because intimate partner violence is a key outcome).
   The analysis in this paper is based on two sets of monthly phone surveys, one of households
and one of food vendors. We describe these below.

2.2.1    Households phone surveys

Our ongoing evaluation was designed to measure the time-varying effects of cash transfers. We
randomly selected 2 households per village to receive cell phones (worth $10-15), and enumerators
called them every 2 months for approximately 10-14 months.10
    Our main outcome is food security, but the phone survey also included questions on income,
expenditures, transfers, savings, and related outcomes. We have 3 measures of food security: (1)
the household dietary diversity score (HDDS), which groups foods into 12 categories, and records
whether at least one food item in each category was consumed in the past 24 hours;11 (2) the food
consumption score (FCS), which is similar to HDDS but measures frequency of consumption rather
than just indicators for 9 food groups (over the past 7 days), and ranges from 0-112;12 and (3) the
household hunger scale (or HHS) is based on a series of 6 questions such as “In the past 4 weeks
(30 days), was there ever no food to eat of any kind in your house because of lack of resources to
get food?” and “In the past 4 weeks (30 days), did you or any household member go to sleep at
night hungry because there was not enough food?” This score ranges from 0-6.13

2.2.2    Surveys of food vendors

As part of our evaluation, we set up data collection to measure prices in areas where cash was
distributed, and in comparison markets. In Liberia, comparison markets were selected throughout
other parts of the country, using the WFP Liberia Market Review Report.14 We enrolled all markets
after excluding the five smallest markets (by number of food vendors), as well as a few additional
markets not used by our respondents. We started with 32 markets in Bong in April 2019 and
added another 48 from Nimba and other counties in February 2020. In Malawi, we obtained the
full official list of markets in the two study districts, Machinga and Chiradzulu, and 7 surrounding
districts as comparison.15 From this, we sampled the biggest market for each traditional authority
(TA), resulting in 95 markets. In total, there are 80 markets (40 treatment and 40 comparison) in
Liberia, and 95 markets (25 treatment and 70 control) in Malawi.
    We attempted to enroll at least 2 vendors of each product per market, though this was chal-

  10
      Table A1 shows attrition from the household phone surveys, by treatment status. Columns 1-7 show regression
for survey completion round-by-round, while Column 8 shows an indicator for appearing in at least 1 round, and
Column 9 shows the percentage of rounds completed. Taking Column 9 as the summary measure, we find that 91%
of surveys were completed in Malawi, and this was similar in treatment and control. In Liberia, completion was
much lower: 60% in Wave 1 and 70% in Wave 2. Unfortunately, completion is significantly lower among treatment
households in Wave 1; this is because households changed their phone numbers when they received the cash transfer
offer and so mechanically were harder to reach. We addressed this issue in Wave 2, and attrition is lower and also
balanced in Wave 2. However, due to this issue, we do not present Wave 1 results in the main regressions (though
we do show them in the appendix, Table A6); we also have very limited data from Wave 2, since enrollment in the
treatment was disrupted by COVID (whereas the surveys themselves were not, allowing us to examine the impact of
COVID.

lenging in smaller markets. We measured only food prices (given the importance of food in local
consumption baskets), and selected items based on their frequency in consumption and production
as found in existing household surveys (HIES for Liberia and IHS4 for Malawi) as well as our own
baseline survey. We collected prices for 14 items in Liberia16 and 16 in Malawi.17 We enrolled ~900
vendors in Liberia and 1,200 in Malawi, and called them once per month. Prior to COVID, these
surveys focused only on prices. We asked each vendor about the products that she sold (“direct
prices”) as well as the prices of other items on the list (“indirect prices”); we did this because some
items were rarely sold in smaller markets and finding their prices was challenging. However, we use
direct prices whenever possible.

2.2.3     COVID-related questions

Shortly after the lockdowns began, we redesigned our phone surveys to measure the impact of the
unfolding crisis. These surveys started in May after all IRB approvals. The new surveys included
several modules. First, we asked a series of questions about knowledge, attitudes and behavior
changes around COVID. These questions were designed using other available surveys and so are
similar to those used in other contexts. Second, we added modules to retrospectively measure
outcomes that had not been measured previously. For households, we added questions on spousal
labor income as well as business outcomes. For food vendors, we added questions on quantities
sold, the number of customers, revenues, profits, and income from other sources. To construct a
comparison month, we measured these month-by-month from February 2020.

2.3     Summary statistics
Table 1 presents summary statistics. From Panel A, the vast majority of the sample is female
(since we targeted female heads), and the average respondent is 40 years old. Most respondents are
married and the average household has 4-5 members. Panel B shows data on income, expenditures,
and assets. The vast majority of the sample earns income from farming, and only 21-25% report
having a business. The average household spends about US $38-42 per month, which works out to
less than $0.30 per day per capita.
    The average household has about $400 in assets in Liberia and $1,500 in Malawi, but the
majority of this is in the form of land and housing – other assets are only $20 in Liberia, and less
than $100 in Malawi. Financial assets are almost non-existent: cash savings is less than $10 in each
country, and outstanding household debt is similarly sized; in fact, household net financial wealth
is negative in Malawi and only $2 in Liberia.
    Panel C documents food security. While our main results will show indices as described above,
we present some intuitive components of those indices here, since they are more understandable.

   16
      The items are salt, imported rice, local rice, cassava, cassava flour, chicken, fresh fish, dried fish, palm oil, pepper,
bitter balls, okra, onions and sugarcane juice.
   17
      The items are salt, sugar, sweet potatoes, rice, maize, maize flour, chicken, soybeans, dried fish, mpiru (a local
vegetable), beans, groundnuts, tomatoes, eggs, onions, and pigeon peas.

We find that 40-44% of respondents report skipping a meal in the past month because there was
not enough food, and almost a quarter experienced no food for an entire day.

3     Quantifying the Effect of COVID-19 Market Disruptions
3.1      Regression Specifications
3.1.1      Individual level outcomes

We restrict this analysis to data collected between January and August 2020. In most cases, we
drop March 2020 (since restrictions came into force mid-month) and run the following specification




                                                            7
using February 2020 as a reference group:

                                                Aug
                                                X
                                        yit =           Dt + θyio + µs + it                                    (1)
                                                t=Apr


where Dt is a month fixed effect, µs is a strata fixed effect, and yio is a measure of the dependent
variable collected during baseline (making the specification ANCOVA). For outcomes that were
measured retrospectively, we do not include the baseline control.

3.1.2    Prices

In each market, we attempted to collect at least 2 price points for each item. We construct a
market-level price as the average price in the market, using direct prices where available, and run
regressions very similar to (1):

                                                  Aug
                                                  X
                                       pmjt =            Dt + µm + γp + it                                     (2)
                                                 t=Apr


where µm and γp are market and product fixed effects.

3.2     Descriptive evidence on disruptions
Table 2 documents that government measures disrupted overall economic activity. Panel A shows
that in Liberia, all activities were almost universally restricted. The extent of disruptions is much
smaller in Malawi, but nevertheless schools, religious centers and public transportation were re-
stricted or closed.
    Panel B shows summary statistics of self-reported behavior changes. Almost everyone in both
countries reports that they stopped shaking hands, started washing hands more frequently, and
followed social distancing norms. A significant fraction of people reported limiting travel and
wearing masks.18
    Panel C presents economic disruptions as reported by food vendors. Again, the disruption is
felt more strongly in Liberia, where 98 percent of vendors reporting that they are closed or reduced
business hours, relative to 25 percent in Malawi. Vendors report difficulty sourcing supplies, and
report that the cost of stocking the same bundle of supplies as they did in February would cost
35% more in Liberia and 22% more in Malawi. Table A3 shows statistics on income losses, using
retrospective data. We find large reductions in profits in Liberia, declining to almost zero by May
2020, and smaller but still substantial losses in Malawi of about 40% in April and 20% in June.


   18
      Table A2 shows a few other selected indicators. Respondents are universally aware of the virus, and levels
of concern about it are quite high (this is true even in Malawi where public health measures were more muted).
Respondents overwhelmingly trust information coming from the government, and take the virus as a serious threat.
However, from Panel C, no households in Malawi reported any assistance to cope with the crisis (the data for Liberia
has not been collected yet).

              This is calculated from the reported cost of procuring a fixed bundle of items Febru-
            ary versus when the survey was conducted, which ranges from May-July 2020.



3.3   Effects on food prices
Table 3 shows effects on food prices (Columns 1-4 are for Liberia and 5-8 are for Malawi). Columns
1 and 5 capture effects on all items and show that prices have increased by 3-9% during the post-
COVID period in Liberia (relative to February), but actually declined by about 20-24% in Malawi.
When restricted to staple crops in column 2, prices increased by 18-20% in Liberia and declined by
even more (29-36%) in Malawi. Since these price changes are purely temporal, changes due to the
lockdowns are indistinguishable from seasonal trends, which are important in Malawi, since the this


                                                       9
area harvests around March. To account for historical monthly price trends, we use the 2011-2019
data series from the WFP for available crops.19 In each country, we focus on the primary staple
crop – rice in Liberia, and maize in Malawi. This data is available for an unbalanced sample of 23
markets in Liberia and 115 in Malawi. Seasonal price trends for these crops are shown in Figure A4.
Columns 3 and 7 show price trends for these crops only, and shows a 5-10% increase in Liberia and a
large decrease of 66-77% in Malawi (due to the harvest). When we control for seasonal trends, price
trends became negative in Liberia (because rice prices traditionally rise slightly during this period),
but estimates decline somewhat in Malawi, though they are still large (53-66%). Anecdotally, the
large decline in Malawi appears due to a bumper harvest.20

3.4       Effects on households
We present our main result – the impact of the lockdowns on food security, in Figure 1. Our
outcome variable is a composite food security index (henceforth, FSI) of three different indices of
   19
      WFP’s price data for Malawi start from 1998 and for Liberia from 2006 but with fewer num-
ber of markets and items.             More information about how WFP collects these prices is here:
https://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/manual_guide_proced/wfp291385.pdf
   20
      Table A4 shows effects on soap and cleaning products, and shows increases in prices across the board. Effects
seem modest for disinfectant and soap, but the price of water buckets almost doubled.


                                                               10
food security – FCS, HDDS, and HHS.21 We present three independent data series – Malawi, and
the two Liberia waves. To ensure that results are unconfounded by the effects of cash, we present
the control groups only.
    Mirroring our discussion about seasonality in Section 4.2, we observe that the temporal dis-
tribution of the FSI jumps around considerably.22 For all 3 samples, we find no decline in food
security during the lockdown. Table A5 shows these results in regression form, showing that these
changes are statistically significant in many cases.

        Note: The dependent variable is a standardized index of the household dietary diversity score
        (HDDS), the food consumption score (FCS), and the household hunger scale (HHS). The recall
        period is 24 hours for the HDDS, one week for the FCS, and four weeks for the HHS. The figure
        shows the average for the control group only. There are 75 respondents in Liberia Wave 1, 174 in
        Liberia Wave 2, and 296 in Malawi. The empty data points for Liberia’s Wave 1 sample indicate
        when there was a pause of data collection for that sample.


    For Malawi, we observe an increase in the FSI after March 2020. This result is likely due to
the fortuituous fact that the harvest in Southern Malawi begins around March. To shed some light
on whether 2020 trends were similar to other years, we use data from the 2010 and 2016 rounds
of the Malawi IHS for the Southern Province (where Chiradzulu and Machinga are located) to
  21
     Since lower values of HHS is better, the FSI includes the inverted value of the HHS. Figure A5 shows each
component separately – results are similar for all of them.
  22
     The peaks and troughs for Liberia Wave 1 (the only series with sufficiently long coverage) coincide around the
same months in both the years.


                                                                                      11
examine how responses to similar food security questions change over time (this is identified off of
non-random survey rollout, and should be taken with caution)– results are presented in Appendix
Figures A6 and A7. For both years, we observe an improvement in the FCS and a decrease
in household hunger around March, though these effects are typically more modest.23 As noted
above, price declines were also larger than usual during this time period, which may be explained
by the bumper maize harvest in Malawi in 2020.24

3.5     Effects of cash transfers
Table 4 shows the impacts of cash transfers on FSI (and its components) during the pandemic
period (March-July 2020). We limit the main analysis to Malawi only because (as discussed in
footnote 10) the Wave 1 phone survey sample was not balanced (due to a technical problem around
sim cards) and the rollout of the Wave 2 cash transfers was disrupted by COVID. In Malawi, we find
higher food security among cash transfer beneficiaries on all food security indicators, and observe
higher spending on food. However, since food security did not decline for the control group in the
first place (Figure 1), these effects represent an increase in consumption, rather than a smaller
decrease (i.e., mitigation).

    The Liberia results show a similar pattern (subject to the above caveats). Table A6 shows
Lee bounds for Wave 1. The uncorrected estimate is positive and significant, though the bounds
include zero. For Wave 2, the rollout of cash was only partially completed in several districts due to

     We are unable to replicate this analysis for Liberia using the HIES as the sample size for the relevant counties -
Bong and Nimba - is too small to support any conclusive findings.

COVID; we can therefore create an ITT estimate by comparing the treatment and control groups in
these districts. However, this is underpowered since a large portion (63%) of the assigned treatment
villages were untreated; we therefore also compute TOT estimates. As can be seen in Appendix
Table A7, the estimates are similar to the Malawi results, though (unsurprisingly) not significant.


4        Conclusion
We document the effect of COVID-19 market disruptions in Liberia and Malawi using a panel of
phone surveys of households and food vendors. We find high levels of awareness and behavior change
and large declines in market activity. However, we find no evidence of increased food insecurity.
     While we do not want to over-generalize from this research (since these are just 2 data points),
at least for these contexts it appears that the worst fears about lockdowns have not occurred. Our
results suggest that lockdowns can be implemented in rural areas if necessary, without causing huge
increases in food insecurity (at least for some amount of time), even in very poor settings. The
disease itself has not yet spread widely in rural Africa, and activities like subsistence farming have
apparently continued with modest disruption. In our sample, people earn very little money from
sources other than farming, and this income did not decline much.25 Similarly, in other contexts,
people have worried about the loss of services such as school meals – yet in this setting, kids were
not getting meals in the first place anyway, so there was little to lose.26 In this context, market
disruptions – which limit but do not eliminate economic activity, and which are not accompanied
by a direct loss of assets – might be much easier to cope with than natural disasters, even for people
at the bottom of the pyramid.




    25
      Table A8 shows that income from other sources is only a few dollars per month, and while this did decline in
both countries, this still involved small sums.
   26
      Table A9 shows that few children received meals and most of these were just replaced by parents..

   Note: This graph shows the same information as Figure 1, but is broken down into each of
   the components: (1) the dietary diversity score (HDDS), (2) the food consumption score
   (FCS), and (3) the household hunger scale HHS). The recall period for these variables is
   24 hours for the HDDS and one week for the FCS and HHS. The figure shows the average
   for the control group only. There are 75 respondents in Liberia Wave 1, 174 in Liberia
   Wave 2, and 296 in Malawi.

Note: Diplayed are individual months’ coefficients relative to February and are for a cross-section of
households in the Southern province only. FCS is calculated using the standard definition of FCS
while the dependent variable for HHS is a single question "In the past 7 days, did you worry that your
HH would not have enough food?" Mean and standard deviation of FCS in February 2016 is 39.0 and
13.5, while the February average for the outcome in panel (b) is 71%. Note that there was a major
drought in 2015-2016 in the country and the government of Malawi declared a countrywide state of
disaster in April 2016.

Note: Monthly household phone surveys are still ongoing. We include as much data as we have in
our analysis, and therefore, round 7 for Malawi sample and round 4 for Liberia wave 2 sample do
not include those households who have not been called yet. Column 8 is an indicator for appearing
in at least 1 round, while Column 9 is the percentage of rounds that were successfully completed.
Regressions include strata fixed effects.

because it was a month that was partially both pre- and post-COVID. Omitted group in the regressions is for the last
survey round before COVID (January and February 2020 pooled). Regressions include survey month fixed effects, and
individual fixed effects. In Panel A, sample includes only Wave 2. All monetary values in USD and Winsorized at 99%.
a Household dietary diversity score (HDDS) ranges from 0 (less diverse) to 12 (more diverse).
b Food consumption score (FCS) ranges from 0 (worse) to 112 (better).
c Household hunger scale (HHS) ranges from 0 (less severe) to 6 (more severe).
d Re-standardized z-score of HDDS, FCS, and HHS (negatively weighted). Z-score of each of HDDS, FCS, and HHS (neg-

atively weighted) are summed up, and this variable is standardized again by using its mean and standard deviation of
pooled data from January and February 2020.

Note: Variables are measured as monthly totals. Table includes phone surveys between January and July 2020. Respon-
dents were called every 2 months, and the omitted group is the last survey round before COVID (January or February).
The March 2020 observations are dropped, because it was partially affected by COVID-19 and associated disruptions.
Regressions include survey month and individual. The Liberia results (Panel A) include only Wave 2 of the study (since
coverage over this time period was spotty in Wave 1). All monetary values are in USD and winsorized at the 99th per-
centile.
a Income information for previous calendar months was asked restrospectively at a survey conducted in May or later .

For example, at a survey conducted in May, income was asked for February, March, and April.
b Income for the past 30 days was asked in the survey conducted each indicated calendar month.
