The Informativeness Principle Under Limited Liability

JEL No. D86,J33

                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper shows that the informativeness principle does not automatically extend to settings with
limited liability. Even if a signal is informative about effort, it may have no value for contracting. An
agent with limited liability is paid zero for certain output realizations. Thus, even if these output realizations
are accompanied by an unfavorable signal, the payment cannot fall further and so the principal cannot
make use of the signal. Similarly, a principal with limited liability may be unable to increase payments
after a favorable signal. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for signals to have positive
value. Under bilateral limited liability and a monotone likelihood ratio, the value of information is
non-monotonic in output, and the principal is willing to pay more for information at intermediate output
levels.

    The informativeness principle (Holmstrom (1979), Shavell (1979), Gjesdal (1982),
Grossman and Hart (1983), Kim (1995)) is believed to be one of the most robust results
in contract theory. The textbook of Bolton and Dewatripont (2005, Section 4.7) states
that the moral hazard literature has produced very few general results  for example,
even the intuitive result that a lower cost of e¤ort increases the optimal e¤ort level need
not hold  but the informativeness principle is one of the few results that is general.
They write: among the main general predictions of the model is the informativeness
principle, which says that the incentive contract should be based on all variables that
provide information about the agents actions. Formally, a signal s is valuable for the
principal  i.e. an optimal contract is a function of s  if and only if output q is not a
su¢cient statistic for e¤ort e given (q; s).
    The informativeness principle was derived in settings without constraints on the
contract. However, contracting constraints do exist in reality. Perhaps the most im-
portant one is limited liability, which applies to almost all contracts between employees
and rms. Entrepreneurs raising nancing also enjoy limited liability, because their eq-
uity cannot fall below zero. This paper studies whether the informativeness principle
continues to hold under this important constraint. The textbook of Tirole (2006, p123)
conjectured that it does: he writes: added risk is bad when the limited liability con-
straint is binding, but we show that this is not always the case.1
    Section 1 considers a model in which both the agent and principal are risk-neutral
and the only contracting constraint is that the agent is protected by limited liability.
We show that, if output q is a su¢cient statistic for e¤ort e given (q; s), then it remains
the case that the signal has zero value. However, the reverse is no longer true: the
optimal contract may be independent of s even if output is not a su¢cient statistic.
Some signals have zero value even though they are informative.
    The intuition is as follows. Without contracting constraints, the principal can
always make use of an informative signal by adjusting the agents wage accordingly. If
   1
     To establish the existence of an optimal mechanism, Holmstrom (1979)  and much of the ensuing
literature  assumed that sharing rules have a bounded total variation. As he states, this restriction
is natural from a pragmatic point of view as well, since the agents wealth puts a lower bound, and the
principals wealth ... an upper bound [on payments]. When deriving the informativeness principle,
however, he implicitly assumed that the solution was interior. He conjectured that the informativeness
principle may not hold under contracting constraints (if, for administrative reasons, one has restricted
attention a priori to a limited class of contracts (e.g., linear price functions or instruction-like step-
functions), then informativeness may not be su¢cient for improvements within this class) but does
not formally study the implications of limited liability for the informativeness principle.


                                                    2
low output is accompanied by a low signal, the agent is paid even lower than with a
high signal. However, with limited liability, the agent is already being paid zero under
low output. The principal cannot punish the agent further upon a low signal, and so
the signal is of no value even though it is informative about e¤ort. Signals are only
useful if they can be used to reduce the wage, which  under limited liability  requires
the wage to be strictly positive to begin with. In turn, the agent is only paid a positive
wage for the output level that maximizes the likelihood ratio. Thus, signals are only
useful if they are informative about e¤ort at this output level.
    Section 2 considers additional contracting constraints. In Section 2.1, the principal,
as well as the agent, is protected by limited liability. Thus, the contract can no longer
involve the principal paying only in the maximum likelihood ratio state, as the required
payment would exceed her pledgeable income. As in Innes (1990), the optimal con-
tract is a live-or-diecontract where the agent receives nothing if output falls below
a threshold q  , and the entire output if it exceeds the threshold. Section 2.2 imposes
an additional monotonicity constraint which requires payments to each party to be
non-decreasing in output. The optimal contract is an option on rm output: the agent
receives nothing if output falls below q  , and the residual q q  if output exceeds it.
    In both cases, the contract depends on the signal s if and only if it is informative
about e¤ort when q = q  , i.e. at the center of the distribution, because then it can
be used to allow the threshold q  to vary with the signal. Signals that are informative
about e¤ort at the tails of the output distribution are of no value. The intuition for
q < q  is as above: the agent is already being paid zero, and cannot be paid less
upon a low signal without violating limited liability. Turning to q > q  , the principal
cannot receive any less upon a high signal. Without the monotonicity constraint, the
principal receives zero and cannot receive less without violating limited liability; with
the monotonicity constraint, the principal receives q  and cannot receive less without
violating monotonicity. Appendix B in the Online Appendix shows that the results
continue to hold under a continuum of e¤ort levels, holding xed the target e¤ort level.
    The results have a number of economic implications. First, the presence of limited
liability requires us to re ne our notion of informativeness. When only the agent has
limited liability, a signal is valuable if and only if it is informative about e¤ort for
output levels that maximize the likelihood ratio. When the principal also has limited
liability, a signal is valuable if and only if it is informative about e¤ort at the center of
the distribution. In particular, a signal could be informative about e¤ort almost every-

                                             3
where, and still have no value in contracting. Second, the common practice of paying
agents for luck, i.e. not ltering out industry shocks, is not necessarily suboptimal. If
a rm su¤ers a catastrophe, the manager is typically paid zero, regardless of whether it
was down to bad luck (e.g. industry performance was also poor) or shirking. In reality,
instances of pay for luck typically concern very good or very bad outcomes  for
example, Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) consider how CEO pay varies with spikes
and troughs in the oil price  but additional signals are only valuable for moderate
outcomes. Third, the value of information is non-monotonic in output. Our results
suggest that the principal should only invest in signals (e.g. through costly monitoring)
at moderate output realizations.


1     Limited Liability on Agent
We consider a model with a principal ( rm) and an agent (worker). Both parties are
risk-neutral and the agent is protected by limited liability. The agent exerts unobserv-
able e¤ort of e 2 f0; 1g, where e = 0 (low e¤ort) costs the agent 0, and e = 1 (high
e¤ort) costs C > 0.
    E¤ort improves the probability distribution of output q 2 fq1 ; q2 ; :::; qQ g in the sense
of rst-order stochastic dominance. It also a¤ects the probability distribution of an
additional signal s 2 fs1 ; s2 ; :::; sS g. Let q;s (pq;s ) denote the joint probability of (q; s)
conditional on high (low) e¤ort. Both output and the signal are contractible. We refer
to each realization of an output/signal pair (q; s) as a state.
    The principal o¤ers a vector of payments fwq;s g to the agent conditional on the
state. She has full bargaining power. The agent accepts the contract if it satis es his
individual rationality constraint (IR):
                                      X
                                                q;s wq;s   C  0:                             (1)
                                          q;s


The agent exerts high e¤ort if the following incentive compatibility constraint (IC)
is satis ed:                  X
                                  (q;s pq;s ) wq;s  C:                           (2)
                                    q;s




                                                       4
Finally, the agents limited liability constraint (LL) implies:

                                       wq;s  0 8q; s:                                        (3)

The IC (2) and LL (3) imply that the IR (1) is automatically satis ed, and so we ignore
it in the analysis that follows.
    We assume that the cost of e¤ort C is su¢ciently low that the principal wishes to
implement high e¤ort, else the optimal contract trivially involves a zero wage. The
principals problem is to nd the contract fwq;s g that minimizes the expected wage:

                      min H;1 wH;1 + H;0 wH;0 + L;1 wL;1 + L;0 wL;0                       (4)
                     wq;s 0


subject to IC (2).
    Lemma 1 below states that a signal is valuable if and only if it is informative
about e¤ort in the states where the wage is strictly positive. Thus, the informativeness
principle  that the contract does not depend on s if and only if the likelihood ratio is
independent of s  continues to hold under limited liability when considering states in
which the wage is strictly positive. (All proofs are in Appendix A.)

Lemma 1 Let (wq;s ) be an optimal contract for implementing e = 1 with wq;s > 0 and
                                                                             0
wq;s0 > 0 for some q, s, and s0 . Then, wq;s = wq;s0 if and only if pq;s
                                                                      q;s
                                                                          = pq;s0 .
                                                                              q;s


    Lemma 2 states that the wage is strictly positive only in states that maximize the
likelihood ratio.

Lemma 2 Let the vectornof payments    o    (wq;s ) be an optimal contract for implementing
          q;s                q0 ;s0
e = 1. If pq;s < max(q0 ;s0 ) p 0 0 , then wq;s = 0.
                               q ;s


   Combining these results, a signal is valuable if and only if it is informative about
e¤ort in states with the highest likelihood ratio. This result is stated in Proposition 1
below:
                                                                                              q0 ;s0
Proposition 1 A signal has positive value if and only if, for all (q; s) 2 arg max(q0 ;s0 )   pq0 ;s0
                                                                                                      ,
                                   q;^s
there exists s^ such that pq;s
                            q;s
                                6= pq;^
                                      s
                                         :




                                              5
    When the agent exhibits limited liability, a signal has positive value if and only if it
a¤ects the likelihood ratio at the output level at which the likelihood ratio is maximized
without the signal, as only then is the wage associated with this output level positive.
In this case, the principal can improve on the contract by making the wage at this
output level contingent upon the signal  increase it at the signal where (q; s) has the
highest likelihood ratio and decrease it to zero at other signal realizations. In contrast,
a signal is not useful if it changes the likelihood ratio only for output levels at which the
likelihood ratio is not maximized. Since the wage is zero to begin with, the principal
cannot decrease it upon a low signal.
    In sum, if output q is a su¢cient statistic for e¤ort e given (q; s), the signal s has
zero value to the principal. However, even if q is not a su¢cient statistic, s still has
zero value if it is informative about e¤ort only for output levels at which the likelihood
ratio is not maximized. The presence of limited liability requires us to re ne our notion
of informativeness  what matters is whether signals are informative about e¤ort in
states with the maximum likelihood ratio, rather than in general.
    We conclude this section with two examples. The rst one illustrates the result
from Proposition 1:

Example 1 Consider a setting with binary outputs and binary signals with the follow-
ing conditional probabilities:
                 e=1                e=0                Likelihood Ratio
                 q = qH   q = qL    q = qH    q = qL   q = qH q = qL
                 1         1        1         1        8         1
    s=1          3         6        8         2        3         3
                 1         1        1         1        8         2
    s=0          3         6        8         4        3         3
                 2         1        1         3
    Marginal     3         3        4         4

   Note that q is not a su¢cient statistic for e given (q; s) since the likelihood ratio
conditional on q = qL is not constant:

                           pL;1   1=6  1 pL;0   1=6  2
                                =     = ;     =     = :
                           L;1   1=2  3 L;0   1=4  3

By Lemma 2, the optimal contract entails paying only in states (qH ; 1) and (qH ; 0)
where the likelihood ratio is maximized at 83 . Since the likelihood ratio is equal in
both states, any share of payments across these states generates the same payo¤ to the
principal as long as they add up to 24
                                    5
                                       (which is the amount required to satisfy incentive

                                             6
compatibility). One solution is wH;1 = wH;0 = 12 5
                                                   , wL;1 = wL;0 = 0. The wage does
not depend on s, because it is only informative at output levels for which the wage is
already zero. Since an optimal contract is not a function of the signal realization, the
signal has zero value.

   The second example shows that the key driver of our results is limited liability
and not risk neutrality. With risk aversion, paying di¤erent amounts in states with
equal likelihood ratios not only fails to improve incentives, but also forces the princi-
pal to compensate the agent for the additional risk. Thus, risk aversion removes the
multiplicity of optimal contracts from the previous example.

Example 2 Let the agents utility be u (w; e) =                  w       e; e 2 f0; 1g. Consider the
following conditional probabilities:
                e=1                        e=0
                q = qH          q = qL     q = qH   q = qL

   Let 2               2
                             . The likelihood ratios conditional on q = qL are not constant
whenever 6= :
                                        pL;1      pL;0    1

                                        L;1      L;0    1
In Appendix A, we show that the unique solution is wH;1 = wH;0 = 4 and wL;1 = wL;0 =
0. Thus, the optimal contract is again independent of the signal even though the signal
is informative about e¤ort.


2     Additional Contracting Constraints
When the only constraint is limited liability on the agent, generically the wage is
positive in a single state only. In a tradition initiated by Innes (1990), we now introduce
additional contracting constraints that yield more realistic contracts. For tractability,
we retain the assumption of binary e¤ort levels; Appendix B studies the continuous
e¤ort case.


                                                    7
    Although the results can be easily replicated for the discrete output case of Section 1,
we expand the model to a continuum of outputs since it simpli es notation. Formally,
output is now distributed over an interval q 2 [0; q], where q may be +1. E¤ort
e 2 f0; 1g and the signal s 2 fs1 ; :::; sS g are speci ed as before.2
    Since the model combines discrete and continuous variables, it is convenient to
specify the distributions in terms of the conditional f (qje; s) and the marginal se^^ 
Pr (s = s^je = e^). The joint distribution of (q; s) conditional on e¤ort is determined by
their product. Conditional on e¤ort e and signal s, output q is distributed according

2.1     Bilateral Limited Liability
In this subsection, we assume that both parties are subject to limited liability:

                                            0  ws (q)  q:                                        (8)

As in Section 1, IC and the agents LL guarantee that IR holds.
   2
     Although the assumption of a discrete signal space is unimportant for our results, it allows us to
avoid unnecessary measurability issues. Since s is discrete and q is continuous, we use the notation
s (q) rather than q;s as in the previous section.

subject to (7) and (8). Recall that in Section 1, where only the agent is subject to
limited liability, the principal pays only in the maximum likelihood ratio state. This
requires her to make a very large payment, which would violate her LL.3 Thus, she
must spread the payments out across more states. As in Innes (1990), the solution
involves paying the minimum amount possible  zero  when the likelihood ratio is
below a certain threshold , and the maximum amount possible  the whole output 
when it exceeds that threshold. The threshold level is chosen so that IC holds with
equality. If more than one such threshold exists, the optimal contract involves the
largest one:4
                        (                                                                               )

As we show in Appendix A,  exists.
Lemma 3 The optimal contract is ws (q) = 1LRs (q)>  q.
      In the remainder of this section, we assume that the distributions of outputs con-
                                                                                        (q)
ditional on (q; s) satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP): pss(q)
is increasing in q 8 s. Then, Lemma 3 implies that there exist unique thresholds
qs1 ; :::; qsS , such that the principal keeps (pays) the entire output when it is below
(above) that threshold. For a given s, the threshold levels solve LRs (qs ) =  and
                             XZ
                                                q [s1 s (q)        s0 ps (q)] dq = C:                        (10)

      Intuitively, with a continuum of outputs, the principal wishes to concentrate the payment as much
as possible in a neighborhood around the maximum likelihood ratio state. Without limited liability on
the principal, existence of an optimal contract is typically an issue. The contract cannot involve the
principal paying only in the state with the highest likelihood ratio (as with discrete outputs) since this
is a set of measure zero, so it must involve her paying in a neighborhood around that state. Without
limited liability, the principal can generically improve on the contract by concentrating the payment
in a smaller neighborhood, in which case an optimal contract fails to exist. Accordingly, Section 1
assumed discrete outputs.
    4
      In general, there may be an interval of optimal thresholds which happen with probability zero.
Under full support and continuity of the PDFs, the optimal threshold  is unique.

                                                                 9
In general, these thresholds will be contingent on the signal s, and so the contract
is contingent upon both output and the signal. Proposition 2 gives a necessary and
su¢cient condition under which the thresholds are independent of the signal (q  =
LRs 1 () 8 s). In this case, there exists an optimal contract that is contingent only
upon output and the signal has zero value.
Proposition 2 Suppose the conditional distributions satisfy MLRP. The optimal con-
tract is independent of the signal if and only if, 8 s and s0

                          q [f (qje = 1)      f (qje = 0)] dq = C:
    Thus, any signal that does not a¤ect the likelihood ratio at the threshold output q 
does not inuence the optimal contract and has zero value. Information about e¤ort
at output levels in the tails of the distribution is not valuable. The signal has no value
for q < q  because the principal is already paying the lowest amount possible (zero).
It has no value for q > q  because the principal is already paying the full output. A
signal may a¤ect the likelihood ratio almost everywhere and still have zero value: all
that matters is the likelihood ratio at the threshold q  , which has zero measure.
    As a result, signals are only useful for moderate output realizations. It may not
be optimal to investigate whether very good or very bad performance was down to
luck (e.g. industry conditions) or e¤ort. For example, if the rm su¤ers a catastrophe,
the manager is red and paid zero. Investigating whether the catastrophe was due to
shirking or bad luck is not useful, since the agent will be paid zero in either case. In
practice, situations in which executives are rewarded for luck typically involve extreme
realizations; our model suggests that these contracts might indeed be optimal.


2.2    Monotonicity Constraint
We now introduce a monotonicity constraint as in Innes (1990):

                                 0  w (q + )          w (q)  ; 8  > 0:          (11)

Innes (1990) justi es these constraints on two grounds. If the constraint on the right
did not hold, the agent could borrow on his own account to arti cially increase output,

                                                        10
raising his payo¤. If the constraint on the left did not hold, the principal would exercise
her control rights to burn output, raising her payo¤.
    For simplicity, we assume that the likelihood ratio is unbounded from above:

                                               lim LRs (q) = +1; 8s:                        (12)
                                               q!
                                                 q


This assumption is not needed for our main results. However, it allows us to rule out
corner solutions, thereby ensuring that the thresholds in the optimal contract are lower
than q: The optimal contract is then given by Lemma 4:

Lemma 4 Suppose the conditional distributions satisfy MLRP. The optimal contract
is ws (q) = max fq; zs g ; where (zs1 ; :::; zsS ) satisfy the IC (7) with equality and

                                                   s0 q

                                                        zs 0 s
                                s q
                                 R              =   s0 q
                                                      R                8s; s0 ;

    Lemma 4 yields a standard option contract, where the threshold zs is the strike
price.5 If output exceeds zs , the agent receives the residual q zs , rather than the
entire output as in Section 2.1. In general, zs may depend on the realized signal s:
Proposition 3 gives the conditions under which the strike price is independent of the
signal (i.e. zs = z  8 s), and so the signal has no value for the contract.

Proposition 3 Suppose the conditional distributions satisfy MLRP. The optimal con-
tract is independent of the signal if and only if, 8 s; s0 ;

                         Pr (q > z  ; sje = 1)   Pr (q > z  ; s0 je = 1)
                                                =                          ;
                         Pr (q > z  ; sje = 0)   Pr (q > z  ; s0 je = 0)
                        R q
where z  is given by    z
                                (q          z  ) [f (qje = 1)   f (qje = 0)] dq = C:

    Proposition 3 shows that the intuition behind Section 2.1 continues to apply when
a monotonicity constraint is introduced. Regardless of whether the monotonicity con-
straint is imposed, the agent receives zero for low output levels and the maximum
  5
    Innes (1990) considers a nancing model, where the contract stipulates the payment from the
agent to the principal. The optimal contract is debt, and so the agent has equity  an option on
output. Here, we consider a contracting model, where the contract stipulates the payment from the
principal to the agent, in line with the literature on the informativeness principle.


                                                           11
possible for high output levels  without monotonicity he receives the maximum pos-
sible without violating the principals limited liability constraint; with monotonicity
he receives the maximum possible without violating the monotonicity constraint. The
principals only degree of freedom is on the threshold zs that separates low from
high output levels. Thus, the signal is only valuable if it leads to the principal op-
timally setting di¤erent strike prices  i.e. it a¤ects the likelihood ratio of the event
that the agents option is in-the-money.


3     Conclusion
This paper studies whether the informativeness principle holds under limited liability,
an important constraint in most contracting environments. The limited liability (and,
where imposed, monotonicity) constraints bind at almost all output levels under the
optimal contract. As a result, signals may be informative about e¤ort at almost all
outputs and still have zero value  since the wage already lies at the boundary of the
contracting space, the principal cannot use the signal to modify the wage. When the
agents limited liability is the only contractual constraint, a signal is valuable if and
only if it is informative about e¤ort at the state with the highest likelihood ratio, which
has zero measure. With limited liability on the principal or monotonicity constraints,
a signal is valuable if and only if it is informative about e¤ort at a single intermediate
output, which also has zero measure. Thus, the principals willingness to invest in
signals is greatest for intermediate output realizations.

A      Proofs
Proof of Lemma 1
  Fix a vector of wages that satisfy IC, and consider the following perturbation:

                 0                                              0                              
                wq;s = wq;s +                             ; and wq;s 0 = wq;s0                              :
                                     q;s          pq;s                               q;s0         pq;s0

This perturbation keeps the incremental bene t from e¤ort constant and therefore
preserves IC. LL continues to hold for  > 0 if wq;s0 > 0, and for  < 0 if wq;s > 0. The
expected wage (4) increases by:
                                                                            
                                               q;s                q;s0
                                                                                 :                                 (13)

If the original contract entails wq;s = wq;s0 > 0 (i.e., a strictly positive wage for output q
that does not depend on whether the signal is s or s0 ), then such a perturbation would
satisfy both IC and LL. Thus, for this contract to be optimal, such a perturbation
cannot reduce the expected wage. The term in (13) must be non-positive 8 :

                                           q;s pq;s   q;s0 pq;s0
               q;s       q;s0
which yields   pq;s
                      =   pq;s0
                                .
   Proof of Lemma 2
   Consider the following perturbation, which, as before, keeps the incremental bene t
from e¤ort constant, thereby preserving IC:

                0                                                                              
               wq;s = wq;s +                          ; and wq0 0 ;s0 = wq0 ;s0                                 :

LL continues to hold for  > 0 if wq0 ;s0 > 0, and for  < 0 if wq;s > 0. The expected
wage (4) increases by:                                      

   Let (q; s) 2 arg max(q00 ;s00 ) pq00 ;s00 denote a state with the highest likelihood ratio
                                            q ;s




                                                              14
and consider a state (q 0 ; s0 ) that does not have the highest likelihood ratio:
                                                         q0 ;s0   q;s

From (15), the term inside the parentheses in (14) is strictly negative. Thus, the
principal can reduce the expected wage by selecting  > 0, which is feasible without
violating LL when wq0 ;s0 > 0. As a result, the solution entails zero payments in all
states that do not maximize the likelihood ratio.
   Proof of Example 2
   It can be shown that the principal would like to implement high e¤ort. Writing in
utils, the principals program becomes:

                                                (1         )                                (1           )

As in the core model, IC and LL imply IR, and so IR can be ignored. It is straight-
forward to verify that > 2 implies uL;1 = 0 whereas 1+2 > implies uL;0 = 0:
Substituting back in the program, the principal solves:

                                                                         (1         )

The unique solution is uH;1 = uH;0 = 2. Converting to dollar units, we obtain wH;1 =
wH;0 = 4 and wL;1 = wL;0 = 0.

While it is possible to obtain a proof along the same lines of Section 1, we follow a
more direct approach here. The in nite-dimensional Lagrangian is:
                                                            (                                                                   )

    L=                 ws (q) s1 s (q) dq                                       ws (q) [s1 s (q)      s0 ps (q)] dq   C       :

The rst-order conditions are:
                    ( )                                                                                    (       )

as well as IC, which must bind:
                     XZ
                                                           q [s1 s (q)              s0 ps (q)] dq = C:                           (17)

                              s       LRs (q)        1



   Rearranging (16), it follows that ws (q) = q if LRs (q) >  1 ; and ws (q) = 0 if
LRs (q) <  1 . It remains to be veri ed that the Lagrange multiplier  exists. Note
that the LHS of (17) converges to zero as  % +1 and to E [qje = 1] E [qje = 0]
as  & 1. By assumption, C is small enough that the principal wishes to implement
high e¤ort. In particular, high e¤ort must be optimal in the rst-best when e¤ort is
observable:
                             E [qje = 1] C > E [qje = 0] :

Thus, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a Lagrange multiplier  2
(1; +1) for which (17) holds.


                                                                       16
     Proof of Proposition 2
     The thresholds qs are independent of s if the likelihood ratios LRs () evaluated at
q  are the same for any s, where q  is the unique threshold that solves the IC in (10).
For all signals s and s0 such that the likelihood ratios (6) evaluated at q  are the same,
we have:                                                          0
                                              s1 s (q  )  s1 s0 (q  )
                   LRs (q ) = LRs0 (q ) () s                  = s0            :         (18)
                                                0 ps (q  )   0 ps0 (q  )
Using the de nition of the marginal distribution (5), when (18) holds, we can write the
IC in (10) as           Z       q
                                     q [f (qje = 1)           f (qje = 0)] dq = C:       (19)
                               q

where the threshold q  is independent of the realization of s.
   Finally, we show that q  is unique. Any contract such that w(q; s) > 0 for q < q^s ,
where q^s is implicitly de ned by f (^
                                     qs je = 1; s) = f (^
                                                        qs je = 0; s) and is unique due to
MLRP, is dominated. Indeed, setting w(q; s) = 0 for q < q^s would not a¤ect payments
on other intervals, would increase incentives relative to the initial contract, and would
reduce the expected wage. Therefore, restricting attention to contracts described in
Lemma 3 such that w(q; s) > 0 only if q  q^s , the expression under the integral sign in
(19) is positive, which implies that q  is unique.
    Proof of Lemma 4
    By the monotonicity constraint (11), ws () is Lipschitz continuous and, therefore,
di¤erentiable almost everywhere. Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume that
ws (q) is a cadlag function satisfying 0  ws0 (q)  1 at all points of di¤erentiability.6
    We will adopt a two-step approach. First, we solve for the optimal contract for a
  xed minimum wage ws (0) = Zs  0. As we will show, the solution involves a contract
where the agent receives a xed minimum wage of Zs if output is below a threshold,
and is the residual claimant above the threshold. Then, we will show that the minimum
is zero, so the solution is a standard option contract.
    Formally, pick constants Zs  0 and consider the following relaxed program:

                                               XZ      q
                                      min                   ws (q) s1 s (q) dq         (20)
                                      ws ()       0
                                               s

  6
      A cadlag function is everywhere right-continuous and has left limits everywhere.

Note that monotonicity w_ s (q)  0 implies that Zs  0 is both necessary and su¢cient
for the agents LL to hold. We will ignore the principals LL and verify that it is
satis ed later.
    Introduce the auxiliary variables ys (q)  w_ s (q) and set up the Hamiltonian:

is a (state-independent) Lagrange multiplier. The necessary optimality conditions are:

where LRs (q)  1s pss(q) is the likelihood ratio, which we assumed to be increasing.
                       0
Thus, the LHS of the last inequality above is decreasing in q while the RHS is constant.
Hence, there exists a threshold qs 2 [0; q] such that _ s (q) > 0 for q < qs and _ s (q) < 0
for q > qs . (Note that if qs = 0 or qs = q, one of these intervals vanishes). Therefore,
s is bell-shaped, with a unique maximum at qs and (at most) two local minima  one
at 0 and and another at q.
    We claim that qs < q, i.e. s is increasing 8 q if qs = q. Then, the transversality
condition s ( q ) = 0 and (21) imply that ws (q) is constant (ws (q) = ws (0) = Zs 8 q),
which violates IC. Thus, it cannot be a solution.


                                                          18
    There are two cases to consider. First, s (0)  0. In this case, we must have
s (q) > 0 8 q 2 (0; q), since the only candidates for global minima are 0 and q and
s (0)  0 = s (  q ). Second, s (0) < 0, and so there exists a threshold qs 2 (0; qs )
such that s (q) < 0 if q < qs and s (q) > 0 if q > qs . We can combine both cases by
letting qs 2 [0; qs ) denote the threshold below which s (q) < 0. The solution is then

                                     ws (q) = Zs + max fq                   qs ; 0g                                    (23)

for some qs 2 [0; q). This concludes the rst part of the proof.
    We now show that the solution entails Zs = 0 8 s. We substitute the agents wage
from (23) into the principals objective function to yield:

         X Z        q                                   X                  Z    q                              

           s     0                                         s                       qs


and into the IC constraint to yield:

                           X Z     q                                                         

                            s      qs


Monotonicity is automatically satis ed by (23). As before, the agents LL holds if and
only if Zs  0. Since Zs increases the objective function in (24) but does not a¤ect the
IC constraint in (25), the solution entails Zs = 0 8 s. Thus, the solution of the relaxed
program is
                               ws (q) = max fq qs ; 0g ;                           (26)

where the thresholds qs are such that the IC constraint holds with equality:

                           X Z     q                                                         
                                          (q   qs ) [s1 s   (q)       s0 ps   (q)] dq         = C:
                            s      qs


We nally must verify that the principals LL is satis ed. This is true since ws (q) =
max fq qs ; 0g  q 8 q. Thus, we have established that the optimal contract is an
option where the strike prices fqs g are such that the IC holds with equality. Next, we
characterize the strike prices.
   Substituting the contract derived in (26) into the objective function (24), the latter

   We must verify that the principals LL holds in the optimal contract. This is the
case if the optimal qs is nonnegative 8 s. For qs  0, using s (q) = 0 for q < 0, we
can rewrite the principals objective function (27) as

For qs  0, using s (q) = ps (q) = 0 for q < 0, 0 s (q) dq = 0 ps (q) dq = 1, and
P s P s
  s 1 =    s 0 , we can rewrite the LHS of the incentive constraint in (25) as

          XZ           q                                                                     XZ                   q

Thus, for qs  0, the Lagrangian L is:

                   XZ                q                                                    XZ                 q

Its rst derivative with respect to qs is 0 s1 s (q) dq < 0, and so qs < 0 cannot be
an optimum for any s.
   As the necessary rst-order condition for an optimum only applies to interior solu-


                                                                                      20
tions, we need to rule out corner solutions by establishing that qs < q 8 s. First, note
that an option with qs  q is equivalent to an option with qs = q. Thus, we need to
check that limqs !q L0 (qs ) > 0. We have

      lim L0 (qs ) = lim f s1 s (y) (
                                         q            y) +  [s1 s (y)   s0 ps (y)] (

where the expression in brackets has the same sign as  1  s0ss (y) . Since assumption
                                                                              1
              s p (y)
(12) implies s0ss (y) !y!q 0, we indeed have limqs !q L0 (qs ) > 0 if  > 1. Finally, we
              1
establish that  > 1 by contradiction. If   1, the LHS of (28) is strictly negative 8
s. This implies that the optimum is qs = q 8 s, which violates the incentive constraint
in (25).
   Proof of Proposition 3
   If the solution entails zs = z  , IC becomes:
                         Z   q
                                  (q   z  ) [f (qje = 1)   f (qje = 0)] dq = C;
                         z


which is not a function of the signal distribution (for xed marginal distributions
f (qje = 1) and f (qje = 0)).
    The condition from Lemma 4 is
                           R q                    
                                                0 Rq
                        s1 z s (q) dq     s1 z s0 (q)dq
                           R q           = s0 R q
                        s0 z ps (q) dq     0 z ps0 (q) dq
                        Pr (q > z  ; sje = 1)     Pr (q > z  ; s0 je = 1)
                      )                         =                           ;
                        Pr (q > z  ; sje = 0)     Pr (q > z  ; s0 je = 0)

which states that the likelihood ratios of the event that the agents option is in-the-
money is not a function of the signal realization.
