This paper examines the factors that lead to the creation of venture capital backed start-ups, a
process we term "entrepreneurial spawning." We contrast two alternative views of the spawning
process. In one view, employees of established firms are trained and conditioned to be entrepreneurs
by being exposed to the entrepreneurial process and by working in a network of entrepreneurs and
venture capitalists. Alternatively, individuals become entrepreneurs because the large bureaucratic
companies for which they work are reluctant to fund their entrepreneurial ideas. Controlling for a
firm's size, patent portfolio and industry, we find that the most prolific spawning firms were public
companies located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts that were themselves once venture capital
backed. Less diversified firms are also more likely to spawn new firms. Spawning levels for these
firms rise as their sales growth declines. Firms based in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts and
originally backed by venture capitalists are more likely to spawn firms only peripherally related to
their core businesses. Overall, these findings appear to be more consistent with the view that
entrepreneurial learning and networks are important factors in the creation of venture capital backed
firms.

Introduction

       There is now a large and growing literature analyzing the factors that determine

whether entrepreneurs raise venture capital funding (Hellmann and Puri [2000]; Burton,

Sørensen, and Beckman [2002]) and the factors that affect the terms of this financing

(Gompers [1997], Kaplan and Stromberg [2002]). There is much less understanding of

how these venture capital backed entrepreneurs come to be entrepreneurs in the first

place. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by examining the factors that lead to the

creation of venture capital backed entrepreneurs, a process we term “entrepreneurial

spawning.”

       We contrast two alternative views of the spawning process.          In one view,

employees of established firms are trained and conditioned to be entrepreneurs by being

exposed to the entrepreneurial process and by working in a network of entrepreneurs and

venture capitalists.   The prolific spawning of entrepreneurial firms by Fairchild

Semiconductors and its descendents is a prominent example of “how entrepreneurial

learning and networks may function,” as Saxenian [1994] writes. Fairchild was founded

by eight engineers who left Shockley Semiconductor with $1.5 million in venture capital

funding from Arthur Rock, one of the earliest (and later most successful) venture

capitalists. While the “Treacherous Eight” succeeded as inventors of the first integrated

circuit in 1959, the founders and other engineers soon began to leave Fairchild to begin

firms of their own. Between 1957 and 1976, at least 23 out of 67 entrants to the

semiconductor industry had at least one founder who worked for Fairchild (Braun and

Macdonald [1982]), including Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and National

Semiconductor, almost all of which were based in Silicon Valley.




                                           2
       In this view, individuals already working for entrepreneurial firms, particularly

those already backed by venture capitalists and located in hotbeds of venture capital

activity—notably Silicon Valley and Massachusetts—may find launching their own

venture less daunting than others might. This may be the case for a number of reasons.

First, working in such firms exposes would-be entrepreneurs to a network of suppliers of

labor, goods, and capital, as well as a network of customers (Saxenian [1994]). Because

starting a new venture requires suppliers and customers to make relationship-specific

investments before it is guaranteed that the venture will get off the ground, networks can

be particularly useful in alleviating this chicken-and-egg problem (Hellmann [2002]).

Second, would-be entrepreneurs learn how to found companies by participating in the

entrepreneurial process alongside other, more experienced entrepreneurs.          Finally,

individuals with a higher taste for risky activities may have already found their way to

entrepreneurial firms, consistent with the sorting processes hypothesized by Jovanovic

[1979], Holmes and Schmidt [1990] and Gromb and Scharfstein [2002]. We refer to this

depiction of entrepreneurial spawning as the “Fairchild view.”

       An alternative view of the entrepreneurial spawning process is that individuals

become entrepreneurs because the large bureaucratic companies for which they work are

reluctant to fund their entrepreneurial ideas. The most prominent example of this is

Xerox, which developed many of the key technologies underlying the personal computer,

but which failed to commercialize these technologies (summarized in Hunt and Lerner

[1995]). In 1969, Xerox chief executive Peter McColough commissioned the firm’s head

of research to build a new laboratory to provide the company with the technology to

move the firm from being the leading office copier company to being the dominant




                                            3
supplier of information-intensive products (Chesbrough [2002]). The Palo Alto Research

Center (PARC) was formed to house this group in 1970. The firm hired outstanding

researchers for this new technical initiative, including physicists, mathematicians,

materials scientists, computer system architects, and software engineers. PARC proved

to be enormously fertile, inventing such technologies as laser printing, the Ethernet, the

graphical user interface, and personal distributed computing. Despite appeals by PARC

leaders to invest in commercializing these innovations, the firm’s Rochester, New York-

based executives resisted such expenditures. Instead, the vast bulk of the value from

these inventions was captured by employees who left Xerox to found companies such as

Adobe Systems and 3Com as well as licensees such as Apple Computer.

       There are at least three reasons that large, established firms might be more prone

to spawn entrepreneurial ventures.      We will refer to this as the “Xerox view” of

entrepreneurial spawning. First, it may be that firms are incapable of responding to

radical technological changes that upset the established ways of organizing their

businesses. Christensen [1997], perhaps the most visible proponent of this view, has

written about the failure of companies to capitalize on “disruptive technologies”:

       Why was it that firms that could be esteemed as aggressive, innovative,
       customer-sensitive organizations could ignore or attend belatedly to
       technological innovations with enormous strategic importance? …
       Finding new applications and markets for new products seems to be a
       capability that each of these firms exhibited once, upon entry, and then
       apparently lost. It was as if the leading firms were held captive by their
       customers, enabling attacking entrant firms to topple the incumbent
       industry leaders each time a disruptive technology emerged (Christensen
       [1997], p. 24).

Henderson [1993] presents evidence of the organizational incapacity of firms to respond

to technological change. Using data from the semiconductor photolithography industry,




                                            4
she shows that incumbents were consistently slower than entrants in developing and

introducing new technologies.

       A second, related reason why large, established companies may spawn more is

that high-level managers at these firms are incapable of evaluating these entrepreneurial

opportunities because they fall outside the company’s core line of business. Assessing

these opportunities may also require the analysis of “soft information,” which

hierarchical organizations may have a hard time doing (Stein [2002]; Berger, et al.

[2002]). Moreover, the internal capital market tends to favor established lines of business

over less established, but perhaps more promising, businesses (Scharfstein [1998];

Scharfstein and Stein [2000]). These arguments suggest that a considerable amount of

entrepreneurial spawning should come from large established firms, where these

problems are presumably most severe.

       Finally, it is also possible that the level of entrepreneurial spawning would be

high among these firms not because of any sort of inefficiency at these firms, but rather

because these firms wisely choose to focus on their core business or “core competence.”

The wisdom of focusing on one’s “core competence,” has been a mainstay of

management consulting since the 1980s. It is also supported by the findings that:

   •    diversified firms tend to trade at a discount to a portfolio of comparable focused

       firms (Berger and Ofek [1995]);

   •    firms that diversified excessively during the 1960s and 1970s were more likely to

       be acquired and broken up in the subsequent two decades (Mitchell and Lehn

       [1990]); and




                                            5
   •    when firms diversified into unrelated businesses, the productivity of their existing

       businesses declined (Schoar [2002]).

Thus, in this view, even though good entrepreneurial ideas might be germinated at these

firms, management wisely chooses not to develop them because it would do more harm

than good to their core businesses.

       This paper is an empirical exploration of the Fairchild and Xerox views of the

entrepreneurial spawning process. To analyze these perspectives on spawning, we

assemble a database of employees who leave public companies to start venture capital

backed firms during the period 1986-1999. From these data, we are able to calculate the

spawning levels of public companies. We then relate these spawning levels to firm

characteristics in a cross-sectional analysis and examine how these spawning levels

change over time for particular firms.

       Controlling for firm size, patent portfolio, and industry, we find that the most

prolific spawning firms from 1986 to 1999 were public companies located in Silicon

Valley and Massachusetts that were once venture capital backed themselves. These

effects are substantial: being located in Silicon Valley increases the spawning level by

almost 38%; companies in Massachusetts have a 23% higher spawning level; and

companies that were once venture capital backed have a 23% higher spawning level.

       Diversified firms appear to spawn less, not more. Firms focused in one segment

have spawning levels 19% higher than those operating in multiple segments. Moreover,

after controlling for the quantity, quality, and originality of patents that firms have in the

areas of principal interest to venture capitalists (computers and communication as well as

drugs and medical), the existence of other types of patents in the portfolio (e.g.,




                                              6
mechanical patents) tends to reduce a company’s spawning level.              This result is

inconsistent with the notion that more diversified firms will spawn more. Our findings

appear to be more consistent with the notion that diversified firms are less entrepreneurial

and thus less prone to have the sorts of people who would have the inclination, ability, or

skills to start new venture capital backed firms.

       The penultimate empirical section of the paper examines how spawning levels

change over time for firms. Thus, we construct a panel of annual spawning levels for

firms with patents in areas of interest to venture capitalists. When we use firm fixed

effects in our regression analysis, we find that firm spawning levels are lower when a

firm’s past sales growth is high relative to the firm’s mean level of growth. We interpret

this finding as indicating that when firms are growing rapidly, employees choose to stay

at their firms (and perhaps develop their entrepreneurial ideas internally) because they

perceive the rents from doing so to be high. When growth slows, however, employees

are more prone to seek entrepreneurial opportunities outside the firm.

       One competing interpretation of our findings is that venture capital backed firms

in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts with a history of venture capital backing have high

spawning levels not because of entrepreneurial learning, networks, or attributes, but

simply because they have technologies and operate in businesses that are of more interest

to venture capitalists in the first place (as, for instance, the tabulations in Kortum and

Lerner [2000] suggest). While this remains a possible explanation, it is worth noting that

we have controlled extensively for patent characteristics (quantity, class, quality, and

originality) and industry. Thus, if high spawners simply function in fields of greater




                                             7
relevance to venture capitalists, they must do so in a way that is neither observable to us

nor captured by our patent and industry controls.

       As a further check to see that our results are not driven by technology differences,

we examine the extent to which venture capital backed start-ups pursue businesses related

to those of the firms from which they are spawned. If technology differences underlie our

results, we would expect to see more related spawning from the high spawners.

However, this is not what we observe in our empirical analysis. We find, instead, that

firms located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts with prior venture capital backing

spawn less related businesses.

       This finding also sheds some light on the causes of entrepreneurial spawning.

The results do not appear to be consistent with Xerox-type spawning because we would

expect less related spawning from large, established firms for the reasons discussed

above, i.e., the inability of the firms to evaluate technologies outside their core business

or the commitment on the part of these firms to focus on their core business. Instead, the

findings appear to be more consistent with the view that these firms are unable or

unwilling to take advantage of entrepreneurial opportunities in their core business

(perhaps because of fear of cannibalization). By contrast, the high spawners in Silicon

Valley and Massachusetts are more prone to spawn outside their core and would appear

to be capitalizing on opportunities in their core lines of business.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the construction

of the data set and summarizes the data. The analysis is presented in Section II. Section

III concludes the paper, discusses some implications of our findings, and highlights other

research opportunities in this area.




                                              8
I.    Constructing the Data Set

        The core data for the analysis come from VentureOne. VentureOne, established in

1987, collects data on firms that have obtained venture capital financing. Firms that have

received early-stage financing exclusively from individual investors, federally chartered

Small Business Investment Companies, and corporate development groups are not included

in the database.

        The companies are initially identified from a wide variety of sources, including trade

publications, company Web pages, and telephone contacts with venture investors.

VentureOne then collects information about the businesses through interviews with venture

capitalists and entrepreneurs. The data collected include the identity of the key founders (the

crucial information used here) as well as the industry, strategy, employment, financial

history and revenues of the firm. Data on the firms are updated and validated through

monthly contacts with investors and firms.

        For the purposes of this analysis, we examine the founders and initial executive

officers (henceforth referred to as “entrepreneurs”) that joined firms listed in the

VentureOne database during the period from 1986 and 1999.1 Typically, the database

reported the previous affiliation and title (at the previous employer) of these entrepreneurs,


1
 We did not include events in earlier periods because of concerns about selection biases.
VentureOne has “back-filled” data on entrepreneurial firms through the early 1980s, but
firms that did not survive until 1987 were not added to the database. At the time this
study was initiated, the 2000 and 2001 data were substantially less complete than the
other years due to lags in identifying and surveying firms.




                                              9
as well as the date they joined the firm.2 In some cases, however, VentureOne did not

collect this information. In these cases, we attempt to find this information by examining

contemporaneous news stories in LEXIS-NEXIS, securities filings, and web sites of

surviving firms.3 We believe this data-collection procedure may introduce a bias in favor of

having more information on successful firms, but it is not apparent to us that it affects our

analysis.

        Table I summarizes the population of entrepreneurs and their venture capital backed

start-up firms. First, the table presents the number of entrepreneurs that joined new venture

capital backed companies in the VentureOne database by the year that they joined those

venture-backed firms, as well the number of new venture capital backed firms that these

entrepreneurs joined in each year. We also list the number of venture capital backed

technology companies.      We then present the number of entrepreneurs who held at least one

of three key titles in the new company—CEO, president, and chief technical officer

(CTO)—as well as the count of entrepreneurs who left firms that were publicly traded.

Finally, we report the share of entrepreneurs that were from entities that were publicly

traded at the time of their departure.

        Two observations should be highlighted from the summary statistics. First, the level

of activity has risen over the period, reflecting the more general growth of the venture

2
 We code the entrepreneur as being spawned from the most recent company for which he
worked, even though he may have a wealth of experience working at other types of
companies.
3
 When we were unable to ascertain the year in which the individual joined the firm, we
used the year in which the firm was formed, which was the modal answer in cases where
we had complete data. This approach does introduce some empirical difficulties, as we
discuss below.




                                             10
capital industry over these years.4 The number of entrepreneurs joining venture capital

backed start-ups increases from 483 in 1986 to 1717 in 1999. Similarly, the number of

distinct venture capital backed firms represented in the sample increases from 218 in 1986 to

799 in 1999. Second, the share of entrepreneurs that emerge from publicly traded firms is

significant.   The first measure we report calculates the share as a percentage of all

entrepreneurs. This measure suggests that there has been an increase of about 40% over this

period in the share of entrepreneurs coming from public companies (from 30% to 42% of

the entire sample of entrepreneurs). There are many entrepreneurs, however, for which the

database reports no prior work history. If one excludes these entrepreneurs from the

calculation, the share of entrepreneurs coming from public companies appears more stable,

averaging approximately 45% per year.          The difference in these findings is probably

attributable to the more complete reporting of prior work histories in later years.

        The data on entrepreneurs are linked to information on the companies that spawned

them. In particular, we determine whether the entrepreneur had previously been employed

at a publicly traded firm in the United States, and, if so, we link it to the appropriate firm in

the Compustat and Center for Research into Securities Prices (CRSP) databases. We also

identify the spawning firm’s patents (and their characteristics) using the National Bureau of

Economic Research’s (NBER) Patent Citations Data File (summarized in Hall, Jaffe, and

Trajtenberg [2001]).    This database links patent data from the U.S. Patent Office to

4
 The reader may be puzzled that the volume of spawned venture capital backed start-ups
falls in 1999, a record year for venture capital activity. This decline occurs because the
years reported are those where the entrepreneurs joined the new firms, not the year of
first venture capital financing. Thus, even though many more entrepreneurs may have
joined start-ups in 1999, it is likely that a smaller percentage of them were later funded
by venture capital because of the plunge in the NASDAQ in April 2000 and the
subsequent drop in overall venture capital funding.



                                               11
Compustat (as it was comprised in 1989). We add links for companies listed in Compustat

after 1989.5

        Table II lists the firms and industries that were most active in spawning new firms.

Panel A lists the 48 publicly traded corporations that spawned ten or more entrepreneurial

teams during the sample period. (Multiple individuals departing to establish a firm are

regarded as a single team).      Panel B describes the top three-digit Standard Industrial

Classification (SIC) codes in which the most spawners operated. (Each firm is assigned to

one three-digit SIC code, based on the primary industry assigned in Compustat.)            The

dominant importance of firms in the software, computer and office equipment, and drug

industries is apparent. The concentration of entrepreneurs spawned from public firms in

these industries closely mirrors the overall investment pattern of the venture capital industry.

It is not surprising that the venture capitalists would finance entrepreneurs with relevant

technology experience.

        Table III compares spawning firms to non-spawning firms. We take averages for

each company that ever spawned a venture capital backed start-up in the VentureOne

database during these years: i.e., those that spawned at least one entrepreneur over the time

period. We contrast these firms to those that spawned no venture capital backed firms. For

the purposes of interpreting our later results, we report summary data only on those firms

that end up in our basic regression analysis.



5
 Because there are a very large number of companies listed in the patent database, it was
not feasible to scan the entire database for possible links to Compustat. Thus, we listed
all companies in the patent database with at least two patents in the computers and
communication and medical and drugs patent categories and narrowed our search of
public companies to this subset of patent holders.




                                                12
       The tabulation reveals that spawning firms tend to be significantly larger than non-

spawners. For instance, the median spawning firm has 60% higher sales, 90% greater

assets, and 170% more employees. Tobin’s Q is calculated as the ratio of the market value

of the firm to the book value of its assets, following the procedure delineated in Kaplan and

Zingales [1997]. Because the distribution of Tobin’s Q has a dramatic rightward skew, we

report winsorized versions of this measure, cutting off the distribution at a Q of 10, roughly

corresponding to the 99th percentile.     The mean Q of spawning companies (2.75) is

somewhat higher than the mean Q of non-spawning firms (2.54). The difference in the

medians is much larger: 2.18 versus 1.71. The average EBITDA to assets ratio is not

appreciably different across the two sub-samples but sales growth is considerably higher

among the spawning firms.6

       In addition to looking at differences in the financial performance of spawning and

non-spawning firms, we also tabulate whether the headquarters of these firms are in Silicon

Valley or Massachusetts.      Prior venture capital backing is determined by linking the

companies to the Venture Economics database of venture capital financings (discussed in

Gompers and Lerner [1999]), and then supplemented with the annual listing of venture

capital backed IPOs in Venture Capital Journal. Following Saxenian [1994], we define

Silicon Valley as California’s Alameda, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. Although

the hub of start-up activity in Massachusetts is around Route 128 (Middlesex County), the

state is small enough that it is not meaningful to make distinctions among the counties of

Massachusetts. We determine the headquarters’ location from Compustat. Spawning firms

6
 These measures are also winsorized. In the case of EBITDA to assets we cut off any
ratios below -0.5 and above 0.5 and in the case of sales growth we cut off any rates above
10.



                                             13
are much more likely to have been venture capital backed themselves (35.5% vs. 12.2%)

and to be located in the hubs of venture capital activity, Silicon Valley and Massachusetts.

       The table also lists information on the degree of focus of the spawning and non-

spawning firms. We consider a firm focused if it reports just one industry segment in its

filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.7 Spawning firms tend to be more

focused even though they are substantially larger.

       Not surprisingly, spawning firms have considerably more patents over the period

from 1980 to 1999, particularly in patent classes that are most relevant to venture capital,

i.e., patents with a primary assignment to category 2, “Computers and Communications,” or

category 3, “Drugs and Medical,” using the classification scheme in the NBER data file.

       Finally, the table reports information on the average quality and originality of

patents in categories 2 and 3 for these companies. The standard measure of patent quality

(see the extended discussion in Jaffe and Trajtenberg [2002]) is the number of citations the

patent receives. We use this citation measure of quality, adjusting for the year in which the

patent was granted and the sub-category of the patent.8     Thus, our quality measure is the



7
 There are a number of limitations of this focus measure. One is that firms have discretion
in what businesses they choose to lump together into a business segment. Thus, some
single-segment firms that pool a number of businesses into one segment may be no more
focused than a multi-segment firm that breaks them out. Another limitation is that some of
the multiple segment firms may have quite related businesses across different segments.
Our measure takes no account of those relationships. Despite this measurement error, it is
likely that on average the firms we categorize as focused will indeed be more focused than
the other firms in the sample.
8
  The NBER database includes four subcategories for Computers and Communications:
“Communications, “Computer Hardware and Software,” “Computer Peripherals,” and
“Information Storage.” There are four sub-categories for Drugs and Medical: “Drugs,”
“Surgery and Medical Instruments,” “Biotechnology,” and “Miscellaneous.”




                                              14
firm fixed effect in a regression of a patent’s citations on a set of dummy variables for the

year in which the patent was granted and the patent sub-category. The table indicates that

the average patent quality of spawning firms is higher than that of non-spawning firms.

       Recent research (summarized in Jaffe and Trajtenberg [2002]) has highlighted the

importance of the measure of patent originality. A patent is considered more original if it

cites patents across more patent categories, as it is more likely to synthesize knowledge

across a variety of disciplines. We use this measure reported in the NBER Patent Citations

Data File, again adjusting for the granting year of the patent and the patent’s sub-category.

The table shows that the average originality of patents held by spawning firms is lower than

that of non-spawning firms.



II. Analysis

       We present the results here in five sub-sections. We start in sub-section II.A by

analyzing the factors that affect the total number of venture capital backed start-ups that

public companies spawn over the entire sample period, 1986-1999.        In the next two sub-

sections, II.B and II.C, we examine the extensive and intensive margins of spawning—

i.e., the factors that determine whether a firm spawns at all and the factors that determine

how much spawning a firm undertakes conditional on spawning at least one firm. We

then examine in sub-section II.D whether the factors that explain overall spawning levels

explain spawning levels on a yearly basis. In this sub-section, we also look at the annual

spawning levels in a model with firm fixed effects. Thus, we are able in this part of the

paper to examine the time-varying characteristics that affect whether a firm’s spawning




                                             15
level is above or below its own mean. In subsection II.E, we examine the extent to which

the activities of the spawned firms are related to their parents.



A. The Determinants of Total Spawning

        In this section, we analyze the factors that affect the total number of venture

capital backed companies spawned by public companies during the sample period 1986-

1999. One issue that we face from the outset is that some firms will have very little

spawning activity simply because they specialize in areas that are of little interest to

venture capitalists. Indeed, historically, more than 80% of venture capital disbursements

have gone to firms in the information technology and health-related fields. Thus, for the

bulk of the analysis, we restrict our analysis to firms who were awarded at least one

patent between 1981 and 1999 in NBER patent categories 2 (computer and

communications) or 3 (drugs and medicine), which correspond to areas of greatest

interest to venture capitalists.

        As the dependent variable, we use the logarithm of the number of venture capital

backed start-ups that the firm spawns over the sample period (plus the number one to

avoid dropping non-spawning firms).         When more than one person leaves a given

company in a given year to form a particular firm, we still count it as one firm that was

spawned. In some of the analyses, we look only at spawning of start-ups in technology

intensive businesses for which the patents in categories 2 and 3 are most relevant. As

shown in Table I, these spawned firms account for roughly two-thirds of the companies

spawned in a given year.




                                             16
       We start by looking at overall spawning because of our inability to identify the

spawning date with certainty for every venture capital backed company. In many cases,

VentureOne does not report the date on which the entrepreneur joined the start-up. In

these cases, we tried to fill in this information from publicly available information, but in

many of them, we were unsuccessful. When we could not find the information from

other sources, we used the founding date of the start-up. There are, however, a number of

cases in which the founding date of the company precedes the founding date of the public

company, indicating that the entrepreneur most likely joined at a later time. These

observations are dropped from the analysis when annual spawning levels are analyzed.

This tends to disproportionately reduce the measured spawning levels of young public

companies. Of course, looking at overall spawning levels has its own limitations, the

most important of which is that it does not allow us to examine the time dynamics of

spawning. Since there is no perfect solution to this problem, we analyze the determinants

of total spawning levels here and annual spawning levels in sub-section II.D below.

       The first column of Table IV reports the results of a cross-sectional regression in

which the dependent variable is the log of a firm’s total spawning. The mean of this

variable is 0.482, indicating that the average firm spawns 0.619 firms between 1986 and

1999. The regressors in this analysis are: (1) the log of the total number of patents the

firm was granted between 1981 and 1999 in each of the six NBER patent categories (as

described in Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg [2001]); (2) the mean of logarithm of the firm’s

assets over the sample period expressed in 1996 dollars; (3) the mean ratio of EBITDA to

assets; (4) the mean annual growth of real sales; (5) the mean of annual Q; (6) a dummy

variable that equals one if the firm was venture capital backed; (7) separate Silicon




                                             17
Valley and Massachusetts dummies; (8) the mean of the firm’s focus dummy; (9) the

quality of patents in categories 2 and 3; and (10) the originality of the patents in

categories 2 and 3. Because the firms are in the sample for different numbers of years,

we also include a set of dummy variables for each year the firm is in the sample. The t-

statistics are based on heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors that allow for non-

independence of observations across firms within the same 2-digit SIC code.

       Not surprisingly, the coefficients of the patent quantities in categories 2 and 3 are

positive and highly statistically significant. The coefficient indicates that the elasticity of

spawning with respect to patenting in category 2 is 0.235 and that the elasticity in

category 3 is 0.141. It is noteworthy also that this elasticity is less than one; doubling a

company’s patents generates significantly less than twice as many spawned entities.

There may be several explanations of this finding. First, not all businesses are based on

patents and technological know-how; patents may be irrelevant for these spawned

entities. Second, many patents may have no immediate practical business value. If larger

firms with more patents are more likely to have such patents (perhaps because they have

internal patent departments that reduce the cost of applying for patent awards, and thus

make it worthwhile to apply for more marginal awards), the incremental impact of a

patent on spawning activity could be lower. A third possibility is that some patenting

may be an attempt to limit the extent to which employees take their ideas and start new

ventures. Finally, to the extent that we have included other measures of size, such as the

logarithm of real assets, these variables may be picking up some of the effect of an

increase in patenting.




                                              18
           Interestingly, the coefficients on the other four patent categories are all negative

and, in the case of mechanical patents (category 5) and other patents (category 6), they

are statistically significant. This finding suggests that having research activities outside

of the main venture capital related areas reduces the level of spawning. This is not

consistent with the Xerox view that spawning is a consequence of corporate bureaucracy.

It is, however, consistent with the Fairchild view to the extent that firms operating in

multiple areas of research tend to be less entrepreneurial in style and attract a less

entrepreneurial type of employee. We discuss this and related findings later in this

section.

       The table also indicates that firms with more assets spawn more firms, which is

not surprising given that the dependent variable is not size adjusted.            There is no

statistically significant link between spawning and EBITDA over assets, nor with one-

year real sales growth. High Q firms do, however, spawn more. There are many potential

explanations for this finding.      One plausible explanation is that firms have high Q

because they are expected to develop new businesses. The ideas for these new businesses

are generated by the firm’s employees and some of them may choose to develop the ideas

on the outside, backed by venture capital.

       The coefficient of the venture capital dummy is positive, large and highly

statistically significant. The estimate of 0.264 indicates that, all else equal, public

companies that were once venture capital backed spawn 26.4% more firms than those that

were not venture capital backed. The coefficient of the Silicon Valley dummy indicates

that public companies based in Silicon Valley spawn 37.7% more firms than those based

outside the two hubs of venture capital activity. The coefficient estimate on the




                                               19
Massachusetts dummy is also large and statistically significant; while smaller than the

effect of being in Silicon Valley, the effect is comparable in size to that of being venture

capital backed.

       The result that venture capital backed firms spawn more is consistent with the

Fairchild view of spawning. In this view, employees of venture capital backed firms

learn how to be entrepreneurs through the experience of working in an entrepreneurial

environment. They may also have greater exposure to the network of suppliers of goods,

capital, and labor, as well as customers. Furthermore, employees that select into venture

capital backed firms may be less risk averse, and thus more willing to accept the risks

associated with starting a new company. While it is difficult to determine the precise

mechanism through which employment at a venture capital backed firm affects the

amount of spawning, the effect is quite strong in the data. The finding does not appear to

be consistent with the alternative Xerox view of spawning.

       The positive effect of being located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts is also

consistent with the Fairchild view. In both regions, employees have a closer connection

to a network of suppliers of goods, capital and labor that is critical to the creation of a

new enterprise. Saxenian [1994] argues that being located in a region with other small

entrepreneurial firms makes it easier to find companies that are willing to supply critical

inputs. She argues that this effect is stronger in Silicon Valley than in Massachusetts

because the latter region tends to have larger, more vertically integrated firms. Although

we estimate a larger effect in Silicon Valley than in Massachusetts, it would be a stretch

to say that we have confirmation of Saxenian’s claim.




                                            20
       We also find that a firm’s average level of focus is positively related to the extent

of its spawning.    The estimated effect is also quite large.       A firm that is focused

throughout the sample period spawns 20% more than a company that is diversified

throughout. This finding appears at odds with the view that spawning is a response to

bureaucratic rigidities in large, technology-intensive firms. The result appears more

consistent with the Fairchild view.

       The regression results also indicate that older public companies spawn fewer

venture capital backed start-ups. The estimated elasticity of 5.8% is small. Given the

imprecision with which we measure firm age, these results need to be interpreted with

some caution.

       Finally, the regression includes measures of patent quality and originality. Firms

with higher quality patents in categories 2 and 3 appear to spawn more, while those with

lower average originality appear to spawn less. The coefficient of patent quality is

statistically significant, while the coefficient of patent originality is not.   An increase

from the 25th percentile of quality to the 75th percentile—an increase of 6.3 adjusted

citations—leads to an increase of 2.8% in the level of spawning, a small effect. Like the

age effect, the estimated effect of patent quality is rather unimpressive.

       The second set of regressions in Table IV uses spawning in technology industries

as the dependent variable. We find the same basic patterns of results here as we did in

the regression with overall spawning. The last two columns repeat the first two but add

industry dummies for two-digit SIC codes.          The key findings are unaffected: the

coefficients of the venture capital, Silicon Valley, and Massachusetts dummies and the

coefficient of average focus all remain positive and statistically significant.         The




                                             21
magnitudes of the coefficients also change very little. Mean Q, age, and patent quality

are no longer statistically significant, though their magnitudes change very little.

       In unreported regressions, we examine the influence of repeat entrepreneurs.

“Serial entrepreneurs,” who work at multiple entrepreneurial firms, are said to be

important in many industries. It is reasonable to worry that serial entrepreneurs drive our

results that firms based in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts and backed by venture

capitalists spawn more. That is, these firms many not teach their employees how to be

entrepreneurs or expose them to networks, or even select for entrepreneurial types.

Instead, firms with these characteristics may tend to be younger and more likely to have

been founded in the recent past by entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs may then leave

then to start other firms, leading to the appearance that these firms are more prolific

spawners.

       We thus repeat the analysis, dropping cases where an entrepreneur had been

involved with a previous venture-backed firm. To do this, we create an identifier for

each entrepreneur, researching the sources noted above to determine whether a “Jim

Joyce” and a “James Joyce” in the VentureOne database are really the same person. In

all, the elimination of repeat entrepreneurs leads to the elimination of 9.7% of the

observations, where the entrepreneur was involved as a founder or key officer in a

previous venture-backed firm.      Of the repeat entrepreneurs in the sample, 83% are

involved with two firms, 13% with three, 3% with four, and less than one percent with

five or more firms.

       The deletions have little impact on the results. Neither the magnitude nor the

statistical significance of the key results presented in Table IV changes. Similarly, when




                                             22
we repeat the analyses reported in later tables, the deletion of the repeat entrepreneurs has

little impact.



B. The Characteristics of Firms that Spawn

        In the sample of 1370 companies that patent in categories 2 and 3, 515 companies

spawn at least one venture capital backed firm and 855 spawn none. What are the factors

that determine whether a firm spawns at least one firm? To address this question, we

report the results of regressing a dummy variable that takes the value one if the firm

spawns at all on the same set of regressors as those reported in Table IV. Although we

report the ordinary least squares estimates in Table V, the logit results are substantively

similar.

        Not surprisingly, firms with more patents in categories 2 and 3 are more likely to

spawn a venture capital backed start-up. A firm with only one patent in category 2 (the

25th percentile of patent quantity) has a 33.5% chance of spawning a venture capital

backed start-up, whereas a firm with 9 patents in category 2 (the 75th percentile) has a

54.6% chance of spawning a venture capital backed start-up. The estimated effect for

patents in category 3 is similar in magnitude. Patenting in the other patent categories—

particularly in categories 5 and 6—tends to reduce the probability of spawning.

        The estimated effects of the critical variables of interest—prior venture capital

backing, location, and focus—are all large and statistically significant. The predicted

probability of spawning any start-up is 20.2% higher for venture capital backed public

companies than for firms that were not venture capital backed. The empirical model

predicts that non-venture capital backed public firms have a 33.0% probability of




                                             23
spawning at least one company, while a venture capital backed public company has a

53.1% chance of spawning such a firm. The estimated effects are similar in magnitude

for firms located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts. Firms located outside of either

have a 34.7% chance of spawning at least one start-up, while a public company located in

Silicon Valley has a 51.2% chance of spawning a start-up and one located in

Massachusetts has a 48.4% chance of spawning a start-up.

        The estimated effect of the focus variable is somewhat smaller than those of

location and prior venture capital backing. A firm that is focused throughout the sample

period has a 51.8% chance of spawning at least one start-up, while a firm that was

diversified throughout the sample has a 43.4% chance of spawning a start-up. In

interpreting the magnitude of the focus coefficient, however, one has to keep in mind that

the regression also includes the number of patents outside of categories 2 and 3, which

also measures the degree of focus. Indeed, if one excludes the quantity of patents outside

of categories 2 and 3, the estimated coefficient of average focus doubles in magnitude

and is highly statistically significant in all specifications.

        With respect to patent characteristics, patent quality appears to be significantly

and positively related to spawning at least one company, while the effect of originality is

negative albeit statistically insignificant.

        The second column of Table V repeats this specification for spawning of

technology intensive businesses. The results are essentially unchanged. The last two




                                               24
columns add 2-digit SIC code industry dummies. The estimated effects change little

across specifications, though patent quality is no longer statistically significant.9



C. The Intensity of Spawning

       In this section, we examine the intensity of spawning, conditional on the firm

spawning at least one venture capital-financed firm.             Table VI re-estimates the

specifications in Table IV for the 515 companies that spawn at least one start-up. The

main difference between the coefficients estimated in Table IV and those estimated in

Table VI is that, although the estimated coefficient of the venture capital dummy is

positive, its magnitude is small and statistically insignificant. Thus, one might conclude

that prior venture capital backing affects whether a company spawns, but not how much

it spawns conditional on spawning.

       The estimated effects of location continue to be large, though the coefficient

estimate of the Massachusetts dummy is now estimated imprecisely, perhaps because the

sample size is so much smaller now. The coefficient of focus is also positive and

borderline statistically significant at the 5% confidence level. The estimated effect of

quality is also positive and statistically significant.      None of these effects change

substantially when we restrict the dependent variable to the spawning of high-tech firms

(column 2) and add industry dummies (columns 3 and 4).

9
 Patent quality in categories 2 and 3 appears to be higher if the company patents little
outside those categories. Thus, the negative coefficients of patenting outside categories 2
and 3 may proxy in part for poor patent quality in categories 2 and 3. Excluding the
patent quantities in categories other than 2 and 3 increases the coefficient of patent
quality, which becomes highly statistically significant.




                                              25
D. The Determinants of Annual Spawning Levels

       In this sub-section we analyze the determinants of spawning on an annual basis.

As discussed above, measuring annual spawning is imprecise given the data we have

because in some cases we do not know when the entrepreneur joined the start-up. When

we do not have this information, we assumed that it occurred at the founding of the start-

up.   If the start-up is founded before the spawning company goes public, then the

observation is dropped from the sample.          This approach means that we tend

underestimate to a greater extent the number of spawned entities from companies that

have gone public more recently. With this caveat in mind, we present the results of

pooled cross-section/time series analysis in Table VII and a firm fixed effect analysis in

Table VIII.

       We observe the same basic pattern of results in the first column of Table VII.

Prior venture capital backing, a Silicon Valley or Massachusetts headquarters, and focus

are all positively related the annual spawning levels.       The effects are somewhat

attenuated by including industry dummies and by limiting the spawning to those in

technology-intensive industries as shown in columns 2 and 3 of Table VII.

       The last column of Table VII reports the result of the between estimator:

regressing firm average annual spawning levels on firm averages of the regressors. This

approach is similar to the approach taken in Table IV, but relies on the more imprecise

measure of annual spawning as opposed to cumulative spawning. Although the results

are all consistent with those observed in Table IV, the coefficients are generally more

imprecisely estimated in Table VII.




                                           26
       Table VIII reports estimates of a regression equation with firm fixed effects. We

cannot, of course, estimate the effects of the time-invariant factors such as prior venture

capital backing and location. Thus, we include only those variables that change over

time. The main question that we can address with this approach is whether firms tend to

spawn more when their performance and growth are relatively good or when they

diminish. There are two alternative views. On the one hand, spawning may be higher

during relatively good times as employees are exposed to more entrepreneurial

opportunities. On the other hand, when growth slows or performance weakens one might

expect employees to be more aggressive in pursuing outside entrepreneurial opportunities

as the value of remaining at the company falls.

       Table VIII shows that spawning is unrelated to Q and the EBITDA measure, but it

is negatively and significantly related to lagged 3-year sales growth. The estimated

coefficient, however, is small. The model implies that an increase in sales growth from

the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile reduces the log quantity of spawning from 0.089

to 0.085, a change of just 4.6%.      It is difficult to determine whether the effect is

genuinely small or is small because of the significant measurement error in calculating

annual spawning levels. In either case, however, the results appear to be consistent with

the view that employees leave firms not at the peak of their growth rates, but instead

when growth rates have fallen, i.e., employees pursue entrepreneurial opportunities

outside their firms when the rents from staying at the firm are diminished.

       The regression also includes the logarithm of age and the firm focus measure.

Spawning appears to decline as a firm ages; the coefficient is significant at the 10%

confidence level. The coefficient on the focus variable is positive, consistent with our




                                            27
earlier cross-sectional findings, but the estimated effect is statistically insignificant. In

this analysis with firm fixed effects, we can only identify the effect of focus through

changes in this variable. To the extent that focus changes little over time, the empirical

test does not have much statistical power.

       The remaining columns of the table examine slightly different specifications. The

second column looks at spawning in high-tech industries. We continue to observe a

negative relationship between spawning and sales growth. The third column includes two

alternative measures of sales growth: mean industry sales growth over the prior three

years and firm-specific deviations from mean sales growth. The results indicate that it is

the firm-specific component of sales growth that drives the relationship to spawning.

       One might be concerned that what is driving the sales growth results is that firms

with large reductions in sales or those that go bankrupt are laying off workers, some of

whom find new jobs and some of whom start new companies. If this were true we would

expect to see all of the results coming from an increase in spawning when sales drop and

not from a decrease in spawning when sales rise. To examine this possibility, we replace

the continuous measure of sales growth with dummy variables for two regions of sales

growth: sales growth greater than the 75th percentile of sales growth and sales growth less

than the 25th percentile of sales growth. The inter-quartile range is excluded so the

estimated coefficients are measured relative to this region of sales growth. The results

indicate that moving out of the highest quartile of sales growth is associated with

significantly greater spawning and that moving from moderate sales growth to the lowest

quartile of sales growth is also associated with the more spawning.             Though the

magnitude of these coefficients is roughly the same, only the coefficient on the high sales




                                             28
growth dummy is statistically significant. This result is inconsistent with the hypothesis

that spawning is generated by layoffs.



E. Relatedness of Start-up to Parent

       This section examines the extent to which venture capital backed start-ups enter

businesses that are related to those of the firms from which they are spawned. We

undertake this analysis for two reasons. First, we want to see whether our key findings

are driven by unobserved differences in the technologies of the firms that spawn many

new ventures and those that spawn relatively few new ventures. For example, one of our

main findings above is that public firms based in Silicon Valley or Massachusetts are

more likely to spawn new firms, as are public firms that were themselves once venture

capital backed. This may simply be because firms in these regions and with prior venture

capital backing have technologies that are of more interest to venture capitalists. If,

however, we find that these high spawners tend to spawn firms with technologies that are

less related to their own technologies, it would cast some doubt on this explanation.

       The second reason to study the relatedness of the start-up to its spawning parent is

that it can shed light on the causes of spawning. Recall that in the Xerox example, much

of the spawning emanated from the Palo Alto Research Center, a group that was distant

from corporate headquarters and was pursuing technologies outside Xerox’s core

business. In this view, spawning occurred because headquarters was out of touch with its

peripheral businesses.    This example would imply that Xerox-type firms—large,

diversified corporations headquartered outside the main regions of venture capital activity




                                            29
and with no prior link to venture capital—should be more likely to spawn outside their

core line of business.

       To investigate the relatedness of start-ups to their spawning parents, we first need

a measure of relatedness. One possibility is to use industry codes of the start-up and the

spawning parent. We reject this approach because the start-up industry codes from

VentureOne are not Standard Industrial Classification codes used in the public company

Compustat database. Thus, one would have to map one set of codes into the other, an

imprecise and coarse mapping. Instead, we measure the relatedness of the two firms

based on the patents of the parent company and the patents associated with the industry

of the start-up. This approach also has some shortcomings, not least of which is that

many of the start-ups in our sample are not in industries that have significant numbers of

firms with patents.

       One challenge of this approach is defining what it means for patents to be related

to each other. Above, it will be recalled, we employed the technology classification

scheme developed by Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg [2001], who divided the patent classes

in the U.S. Patent Classification scheme into 36 distinct categories. Each of these 36

classes encompasses several U.S. patent classes. This classification scheme, while useful

as a control, is probably too broad for the purpose of measuring relatedness.

       To get around this difficulty, we base the analysis of relatedness on the

International Patent Classification (IPC) scheme. The IPC system has its origins in the

Council of Europe's 1954 "European Convention on the International Classification of

Patents for Invention." The classification has been managed by an international (rather than




                                            30
a purely European) agency since 1969. Since that year, U.S. patents have been classified by

patent examiners according to both the U.S. and IPC schemes (WIPO [1981]).

       The IPC has at least two advantages over the U.S. classification (upon which the

NBER categories are based). First, the IPC scheme is based on the usefulness of the patent

for an industry or profession rather than being based on the structure and function of the

patent. Thus, the IPC scheme reflects the economic importance of new inventions, as

opposed to the technical focus of the U.S. scheme. Second, the first four levels of the IPC

classifications are nested. This is in contrast with the U.S. system, where 435/40 is a subset

of 435/39, which is in turn a subclass of 435/34, but 435/41 is not a subclass of any of these

(USPTO [2003]). The non-nesting of the U.S. scheme would make it inadequate for our

relatedness measure.

       Because the IPC classification data is not included in the NBER Patent Citations

Data File, we obtain this information from Thomson Delphion, a data vendor. For the

public companies in our sample, we simply match the patents in our data to the Delphion

database and extract the primary IPC classification. Getting the IPC classifications on the

start-ups in our sample was more complex because they are generally not included in the

NBER database.10 Thus, we identify their patents by searching for them on the USPTO

website (www.uspto.gov). We restrict attention to start-ups in 21 industries with significant

numbers of patents: e.g., we include wireless communications equipment and biotechnology

but do not include business application software and physician-practice management. There

are 1457 entrepreneurs leaving public companies to start firms in these industries, 28.2% of

the entrepreneurs (for which we have industry data) who leave public companies.




                                             31
       For each start-up in these industries, we record the patent numbers of the first five

patents they received (although they usually they have fewer than five patents). Then for

each of the VentureOne industries, we identify all 2-digit IPC patent classes that have at

least five percent of the patents in that industry. For example, in wireless communication

equipment there are four patent classes with at least 5% of the patents in the industry:

measuring and testing (13.8%), basic electric elements (16.0%), basic electronic circuitry

(7.5%), and electric communication technique (55.3%), collectively accounting for 92.6%

of the patents in this industry.11 We then normalize these patent-class percentages by the

cumulative percentage, e.g., dividing 13.8% by 92.6% (14.9%) to get the share of the

measuring and testing patent class in all patent classes with a greater share than 5%.

       To measure the relatedness of the spawning company to the start-up, we calculate

the share of the spawner’s patents that are in the main patent classes of the start-up’s

industry. Because some of the patent classes in the start-up industry are more common than

others—e.g., in wireless communication equipment, electric communication technique

patents are more common than basic electronic circuitry—we weight the patent classes in

this calculation by their industry share described in the preceding paragraph. For example,

suppose the spawning company has 20 patents in all, 5 in electric communication technique

(with a 59.7% share) and two in measuring and testing (with a 14.9% share), and the rest in

other patent classes. Then our measure of relatedness would be (59.7% x 5 + 14.9% x 2)/20

= 16.4%. The mean relatedness measure in our sample is 27.0% and the median is 22.6%.


 The assignment of CUSIPs in the NBER Patent Citations Data File was done as of
10

1989. Firms that went public after 1989 do not have an assigned CUSIP in the file.
11
  In the 21 industries, the cumulative percentage of patents with at least a 5% industry share
is typically between 80% and 100%.



                                              32
        We are now ready to examine the factors that affect the relatedness of the start-up to

the spawning parent. As discussed above, it may be that the high spawners tend to spawn

more simply because they have technologies that are more appropriate for venture capital.

In this case, we would expect to see more related spawning from companies in Silicon

Valley and Massachusetts and those that were also once venture capital backed. The

regressions in Table IX examine this possibility and others.

        The dependent variable in the regression is the relatedness measure discussed above,

while the independent variables are similar to those in the earlier regressions. (We omit for

obvious reasons the patent-based measures.) We present two sets of regressions, both with

and without industry fixed effects. The industry dummies will control for cross-industry

differences in our relatedness measure.12

        The results indicate that companies located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts tend

to spawn less related ventures than companies outside these areas.               This pattern is

inconsistent with the view that the spawning patterns follow mechanically from the greater

propensity of firms based in entrepreneurial regions to spawn more because they have

technologies that are more relevant for venture capital investment. We similarly find a

negative relationship between relatedness and prior venture capital backing of the spawning

company; the coefficient is statistically significant in the first regression but insignificant in

the other. This is also inconsistent with the view that the higher spawning level of venture

capital backed firms is driven by differences in technology. The view is also inconsistent


12
  Some industries have more patent classes represented than others. As a result, in these
industries the relatedness measure will tend to be lower than in industries with fewer
patent classes represented. Industry dummies for the spawned start-up control for the
cross-correlation that might follow if the industries with relatively more patent classes
also tend to be the ones that are, say, located in Silicon Valley.



                                               33
with the Xerox-type spawning as that would imply that firms located outside the

entrepreneurial regions would tend to spawn more outside their core business. Instead, they

seem more likely to spawn related ventures.

          The other findings are probably more mechanical in nature. Not surprisingly, larger

firms and less focused firms tend to do more unrelated spawning (although the latter result

appears only in the second regression). High Q firms and those with high lagged sales

growth are also more likely to spawn related ventures. This is probably because the supply

of good ideas in the core business is greater than in firms with low Q and low sales growth.

          What do these results tell us about the spawning process? At this point, it is

difficult to draw definitive conclusions, but we can offer two hypotheses that are

consistent with the data. One hypothesis is that firms located in Silicon Valley and

Massachusetts are more committed to remaining focused on their core lines of business

and exploiting opportunities in their core. This pattern may stem from the fact that

remaining focused is a key business value that venture capitalists try to instill in

entrepreneurs and one that may have been critical in their success.13 Thus, these high

spawning entrepreneurial firms in the main regions of venture capital activity may be

more prone than other firms to reject new business opportunities outside their core lines.

A second hypothesis is that these firms are better than others in identifying business

opportunities in their core areas of specialization. In this case, venture capitalists would

be less willing to fund new ventures from these companies because of adverse selection

concerns. Thus, the new ventures that emerge from these firms are more likely to be

outside the core business. At this point, these hypotheses remain purely speculative. We

                                               34
can, however, conclude that the data are inconsistent with the view that the results are

driven by systematic differences in the technologies of the high and low spawners.



III.    Conclusions and Suggestions for Future Research

       This paper examines the determinants of entrepreneurial spawning, i.e., the

propensity of publicly traded corporations to spawn new venture capital backed firms.

While entrepreneurial activity has received a tremendous amount of attention from

academic researchers and the popular press, the source of new entrepreneurial firms has

received relatively little systematic attention. We show that existing public companies

are an important source of entrepreneurs for venture capital backed start-ups, particularly

public corporations with patents in areas of interest to venture capital. Younger firms,

that were backed by venture capitalists themselves and that are located in the main hubs

of venture capital activity (Silicon Valley and Massachusetts) are more likely to spawn

new firms. Moreover, firms focused in one main line of business are more likely to be

the source of entrepreneurial ventures.           Firms outside of Silicon Valley and

Massachusetts not originally backed by venture capitalists are more likely to spawn

businesses related to their core areas of specialization.

       These findings appear to be inconsistent with the view that entrepreneurs start

new firms in response to their frustration with large, bureaucratic companies. Instead,

they suggest that the breeding grounds for entrepreneurial firms are other entrepreneurial

firms. It is in these environments that employees learn from their co-workers about what

it takes to start a new firm and are exposed to a network of suppliers and customers who

are used to dealing with start-up companies. These spawning entrepreneurial firms may




                                             35
also implicitly select for less risk averse individuals who are willing to bear the greater

risks of starting a new firm.

       Our findings have several implications.          In particular, they suggest that

entrepreneurial activity in a given region has increasing returns (Saxenian [1994]).

Stimulating entrepreneurship in a region with few existing entrepreneurial firms is

difficult; there may be many individuals with the technological know-how to start a new

venture capital backed firm, but many fewer who know how to start new companies. In

addition, the network of suppliers and customers may not be strong enough to support a

new venture.14 Policies that have sought to foster entrepreneurial and venture capital-

activity by providing capital or investment incentives may not be enough. Instead,

regions may need to attract firms with existing pools of workers who have the “training

and conditioning” to become entrepreneurs.

       At the same time, the results suggest that the ultimate success (in terms of scale)

of individual venture capital backed firms may be bounded. The analysis shows that

when growth slows, employees are likely to leave their firms to start new ones. Thus,

there may be limits to how big a venture capital backed firm can get while maintaining

their most entrepreneurial employees.

       There are a number of related research questions we plan to pursue. We list three

of them here. First, we hope to supplement this analysis with a survey of spawned

entrepreneurs. What reasons do they give for leaving their firm and starting a new one?

How do the responses vary depending on the type of company from which the


 Lerner [1999] discusses the powerful political pressures that can lead to the scattering of
14

venture capital funding across regions, as well as presenting evidence consistent with this
view from one government program to finance small high-technology businesses.

entrepreneur was spawned? Second, how does spawning affect the parent? In particular,

does it have a negative effect on growth and performance of the spawning firm as its

most creative employees leave to start new ventures? Finally, how do the characteristics

of the spawning firms affect the success of the new ventures?         For example, are

entrepreneurs from more successful spawning firms more or less likely to be successful

themselves? And, how do the characteristics of the spawning firm’s patents affect the

likelihood of success of the new venture?

The sample is derived from public companies listed in Compustat during the period 1986-1999. A spawned
entrepreneur is an employee who leaves a public company to start a venture capital backed firm. Data on
founders come from the VentureOne database of 15,297 founders of 5,112 venture capital backed start-ups
during the period 1986-1999. Panel A lists all public companies that spawn at least ten entrepreneurial
teams during the sample period, 1986-1999, and the number of entrepreneurial teams they spawn during the
sample period. (Multiple individuals departing to a single firm are regarded as a single entrepreneurial
team.) Panel B lists all industries in which public companies spawn at least 20 entrepreneurs in total and the
number of entrepreneurs they spawn.

                            Characteristics of Public Spawners vs. Non-spawners

The sample is derived from public companies listed in Compustat during the period 1986-1999. Spawners
are identified as those public companies in which at least one employee left to start a venture capital backed
firm. Data on founders come from the VentureOne database of 15,297 founders of 5,112 venture capital
backed start-ups during the period 1986-1999. The table compares the characteristics of public companies
that spawn at least one entrepreneur during the sample period 1986-1999 (the first three columns) to the
characteristics of public companies that never spawn during the sample period (the second three columns).
All dollar figures are in millions of 1999 dollars. Patent category 2 refers to computer and communication
patents as classified in the NBER Patent Citations Data File and category 3 refers to medical and drug
patents. The differences in the means are all statistically significant based on heteroskedasticity-consistent
t-statistics that adjust for non-independence of observations of the same firm over time.

                                                     Regression Analyses of Spawning Levels

The table presents regression results for the cumulative number of spawned entrepreneurs for each firm in our sample. The sample is
derived from public companies listed in Compustat during the period 1986-1999 with patents in either Computer and Communications
or Drugs and Medical based on the NBER Patent Citations Data File classification scheme. The dependent variable in the regressions
is the natural logarithm of the cumulative number of venture capital backed entrepreneurs spawned over the whole sample period.
The information on entrepreneurs comes from a sample of 15,297 founders of 5,112 venture capital backed start-ups in the
VentureOne database of venture capital financing who received venture capital financing between 1986 and 1999. Independent
variables include the natural logarithm of inflation-adjusted firm size, the firm’s sales growth over the previous three years winsorized
at the 99th percentile, Tobin’s Q for the firm winsorized at the 99th percentile, the natural logarithm of patents in six patent categories,
dummy variables indicating whether the firm was backed by venture capitalists, dummy variables indicating if the firm was located in
Silicon Valley or Massachusetts, measures for the firm’s patent originality, the natural logarithm of firm age, and a dummy variable
that equals one if the firm reports only one industry segment in Compustat. All regressions include year dummies for every year that
the firm is in the sample, though the coefficients are not shown; some include industry fixed effects. Heteroskedasticity-consistent t-
statistics in parentheses adjust for non-independence of observations of the same firm over time.

                                           Regression Analyses of Likelihood of Doing Any Spawning

The table presents regressions of the probability of a sample firm having any spawning activity. The sample is derived from public
companies listed in Compustat during the period 1986-1999 with patents in either Computer and Communications or Drugs and
Medical based on the NBER Patent Citations Data File classification scheme. The dependent variable in the regressions is a dummy
variable that equals one if the firm ever spawns at least one venture capital backed entrepreneurs. The information on entrepreneurs
comes from a sample of 15,297 founders of 5,112 venture capital backed start-ups in the VentureOne database of venture capital
financing who received venture capital financing between 1986 and 1999. Independent variables include the natural logarithm of
inflation-adjusted firm size, the firm’s sales growth over the previous three years winsorized at the 99th percentile, Tobin’s Q for the
firm winsorized at the 99th percentile, the natural logarithm of patents in six patent categories, dummy variables indicating whether the
firm was backed by venture capitalists, dummy variables indicating if the firm was located in Silicon Valley or Massachusetts,
measures for the firm’s patent originality, the natural logarithm of firm age, and a dummy variable that equals one if the firm reports
only one industry segment in Compustat. All regressions include year dummies for each year that the firm is in our sample, though
the coefficients are not shown; some include industry fixed effects. Heteroskedasticity-consistent t-statistics in parentheses adjust for
non-independence of observations of the same firm over time.

                             Regression Analyses of Cumulative Spawning Levels Conditional on Any Spawning

The table presents regressions of the cumulative spawning rates for firms, conditional on the firms doing any spawning during our
sample period. The sample is derived from public companies listed in Compustat during the period 1986-1999 with patents in either
Computer and Communications or Drugs and Medical based on the NBER Patent Citations Data File classification scheme. The
dependent variable in the regressions is the natural logarithm of the cumulative number of venture capital backed entrepreneurs
spawned over the entire sample period from these public companies. The information on entrepreneurs comes from a sample of
15,297 founders of 5,112 venture capital backed start-ups in the VentureOne database of venture capital financing who received
venture capital financing between 1986 and 1999. Independent variables include the natural logarithm of inflation-adjusted firm size,
the firm’s sales growth over the previous three years winsorized at the 99th percentile, Tobin’s Q for the firm winsorized at the 99th
percentile, the natural logarithm of patents in six patent categories, dummy variables indicating whether the firm was backed by
venture capitalists, dummy variables indicating if the firm was located in Silicon Valley or Massachusetts, measures for the firm’s
patent originality, the natural logarithm of firm age, and a dummy variable that equals one if the firm reports only one industry
segment in Compustat. All regressions include year dummies for each year that the firm is in our sample, though the coefficients are
not shown; some include industry fixed effects. Heteroskedasticity-consistent t-statistics in parentheses adjust for non-independence of
observations of the same firm over time.

                                        Cross Sectional Regression Analyses of Annual Spawning Levels

The regression are pooled cross-sectional regressions or the between estimators from fixed effects regressions of annual spawning
levels for publicly traded firms. The sample is derived from public companies listed in Compustat during the period 1986-1999 with
patents in either Computer and Communications or Drugs and Medical based on the NBER Patent Citations Data File classification
scheme. The dependent variable in the regressions is the natural logarithm of the number of venture capital backed entrepreneurs
spawned in a given year from these public companies. The information on entrepreneurs comes from a sample of 15,297 founders of
5,112 venture capital backed start-ups in the VentureOne database of venture capital financing who received venture capital financing
between 1986 and 1999. Independent variables include the natural logarithm of inflation-adjusted firm size, the firm’s sales growth
over the previous three years winsorized at the 99th percentile, Tobin’s Q for the firm winsorized at the 99th percentile, the natural
logarithm of patents in six patent categories, dummy variables indicating whether the firm was backed by venture capitalists, dummy
variables indicating if the firm was located in Silicon Valley or Massachusetts, measures for the firm’s patent originality, the natural
logarithm of firm age, and a dummy variable that equals one if the firm reports only one industry segment in Compustat. All
regressions include year dummies, though the coefficients are not shown; some include industry fixed effects. All regressions include
year dummies, though the coefficients are not shown; some include industry or firm fixed effects. Heteroskedasticity-consistent t-
statistics in parentheses adjust for non-independence of observations of the same firm over time.

                                     Firm Fixed-Effects Regression Analyses of Annual Spawning Levels

The table presents the firm fixed-effects regressions for the sample of publicly traded spawning firms. The sample is derived from
public companies listed in Compustat during the period 1986-1999 with patents in either Computer and Communications or Drugs and
Medical based on the NBER Patent Citations Data File classification scheme. The dependent variable in the regressions is the natural
logarithm of the number of venture capital backed entrepreneurs spawned in a given year from these public companies. The
information on entrepreneurs comes from a sample of 15,297 founders of 5,112 venture capital backed start-ups in the VentureOne
database of venture capital financing who received venture capital financing between 1986 and 1999. Independent variables include
the natural logarithm of inflation-adjusted firm size, the firm’s sales growth over the previous three years winsorized at the 99th
percentile, the firm’s industry sales growth over the previous three years winsorized at the 99th percentile and deviations from that
industry sales growth over the previous three years winsorized at the 99th percentile, Tobin’s Q for the firm Winsorized at the 99th
percentile, the natural logarithm of patents in six patent categories, the natural logarithm of firm age, and a dummy variable that equals
one if the firm reports only one industry segment in Compustat. All regressions include year dummies, though the coefficients are not
shown; some include industry or firm fixed effects. Heteroskedasticity-consistent t-statistics in parentheses adjust for non-
independence of observations of the same firm over time.

                                            Regression Analyses of Likelihood of Related Spawning

The table presents regressions of the degree of relatedness between a spawning and spawned firm. The sample is derived from public
companies listed in Compustat during the period 1986-1999 with patents in either Computer and Communications or Drugs and
Medical based on the NBER Patent Citations Data File classification scheme. The dependent variable is the measure of relatedness
described in the text. Independent variables include the natural logarithm of inflation-adjusted firm size, the firm’s sales growth over
the previous three years winsorized at the 99th percentile, Tobin’s Q for the firm winsorized at the 99th percentile, dummy variables
indicating whether the firm was backed by venture capitalists, dummy variables indicating if the firm was located in Silicon Valley or
Massachusetts, and a dummy variable that equals one if the firm reports only one industry segment in Compustat. All regressions
include year dummies for each year that the firm is in our sample, though the coefficients are not shown; one includes industry fixed
effects. Heteroskedasticity-consistent t-statistics in parentheses adjust for non-independence of observations of the same firm over
time.
