                                            ABSTRACT

Previous studies have found large gender and racial differences in commercialization of invention.
Using novel data that permit enhanced identification of women and African American inventors, we
find that gender and racial differences in commercial activity related to invention are lower than once
thought. This is despite relatively lower patent activity among women and African Americans. Further,
among determinants of commercialization, the evidence suggests that advanced training in engineering
is correlated with better commercialization outcomes for women and African Americans than for U.S.
inventors as a whole, for whom advanced training in life sciences is more important.

1       Introduction

    The two critical endpoints in the innovative process are basic scientiﬁc research and com-

mercialization of invention. Women and African Americans have increasingly participated at
the beginning and end of this process. The share of women receiving doctoral degrees in sci-

ence and engineering increased from nine percent in 1970 to 40 percent in 2005. For African
Americans, this share grew from less than 0.01 percent to four percent over the same period.1
With respect to the commercialization of ideas, the gap appears to be closing, as well. From
the best data available in 1998, women inventors assigned 51 percent of their patents to
ﬁrms in 1977-1982, and, by 1998, they assigned 75 percent of their patents to ﬁrms.2 Among
African Americans, in 1975, 44 percent of patents were assigned to ﬁrms, and, by the year

2000, it was 56 percent compared to 82 percent for all inventors who obtained U.S. patents

that year.3
    Using techniques that allow enhanced identiﬁcation of inventors by gender and ethnicity,

we collect new data on women and African American patentees. The evidence suggests that
disparities related to commercialization are indeed much smaller than previously thought.

We calculate that, on average, between 2001 and 2008, women and African American in-

ventors commercialized 79 and 77 percent of their inventions compared to 80 percent for all

U.S. inventors.4 Between 2001 and 2006, for the largest ﬁrms, patent assignments by women

and African Americans exceeded those of all U.S. inventors – 56 percent and 59 percent
compared to 50 percent. These ﬁndings stem largely from more comprehensive identiﬁcation
of women and African Americans in patent data and from more recently available patent

data.
    Related to commercialization, we ask several questions with the new data. In general,
among women and African Americans, what are the patterns and determinants of diﬀerences

in rates of patenting and commercialization relative to all U.S. inventors? Are there social
and professional networks that are more salient for commercial activity than others? If so,
do these vary by gender or race? Are certain ﬁelds of inquiry better at allowing diverse

patent teams to emerge that may change the probability of commercialization?
   From these inquiries we also ﬁnd that increases in advanced engineering degrees pre-
dict increases in assigned patents, including to the largest ﬁrms, by women and African
American inventors, while increases in life-sciences doctorates predict this outcome in the
total population of U.S. patentees. Nonetheless, female and African American patents are

associated with a lower probability of assignment to ﬁrms, although there are appreciable
diﬀerences across technology categories. Increases in citations received are correlated with
patents assigned for women but vary by type of ﬁrm for African Americans. All-male and

all-female patent teams commercialize their patents less than mixed-gender patent teams.

Importantly, while we ﬁnd that the commercialization gap is closing, the evidence suggests

that the gap in patent activity is wide for women and wider still for African Americans.
   Given the burgeoning literature on the importance of ethnic and social networks on cre-

ative and scientiﬁc outcomes, the contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we extend

the data used by previous papers on women patentees by taking advantage of greater ethnic

heterogeneity to identify gender and by using more recently available data. The share of non-

U.S. citizens in U.S. Ph.D. recipients in science and engineering increased from 18 percent in
1978 to 42 percent in 2008, which implies that new identiﬁcation methods could be useful in

capturing an increasing number of patent-holders.5 Second, our analysis uses the new data
to build on earlier work that identiﬁes and analyzes patenting and commercialization pat-
terns among women. Third, to the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic analysis
of recent African American patenting and patent-related commercialization behavior.

2     The Literature

    For some time researchers have attempted to understand the innovation production prob-

lem, especially inventors or scientists who participate in this process, e.g., Schmookler (1957).
Patenting diﬀerentials between certain groups have begun to receive attention. Ding, Mur-

ray, and Stuart (2006) employ longitudinal data from a random sample of 4,227 academic life
scientists and ﬁnd that women faculty members patent at approximately 40 percent of the
rate of men. Ashcraft and Breitzman (2007) present patterns of women’s inventive activity
in the IT sector from 1980 to 2005. They show that nine percent of IT patents have at least
one female inventor and that this share has increased over time. Similarly, Agarwal, Kapur
and McHale (2007), Kerr (2008), and Cook (2007b) examine patent diﬀerences by ethnicity

and race.
    Less attention has been given to diﬀerences in commercialization of invention. The re-

search that does exist suggests that patent commercialization activity diﬀers along gender

and racial lines. Diﬀerences by gender were ﬁrst documented by the National Science Foun-
dation (NSF (1995)). Morgan, Kruytbosch, and Kannankutty (2001) use survey data from

NSF’s Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) and compare activity

related to commercialized products or processes and related to licenses between scientists in

the academic and industrial sectors. They ﬁnd that success rates of female scientists in com-

mercializing their innovations are three and 13 percent lower than for their male counterparts
in both academia and industry. Murray and Graham (2007) suggest that characteristics of
female scientists, such as attitudes toward risk and competition and commercial experiences

play an important role in the commercial activity of female academic scientists. They also
ﬁnd that social networks and venture capitalists’ views of female scientists widen the gender
gap in commercial science at academic institutions.
    Systematic diﬀerences in patent-related commercialization activity by race were ﬁrst
examined by Cook (2007b). Using data on African American inventors before and after the
Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, the author ﬁnds that changes in commercialization activity among

                                               3
African Americans do not correspond to changes in the commercialization activity of other
U.S. inventors over the same period.6

    While the literature on the gender gap in commercialization is growing, the data used
in existing studies are primarily limited to women in academia and to those with English
or American names. This study builds on the current literature by broadening the scope of
inquiry to include all women inventors and African American inventors and to include new
sets of questions to increase our understanding of their invention-related behavior.



3       The Data

    This paper focuses on two groups of inventors - women and African Americans. Patents

are considered women’s patents or African American patents if they have at least one woman
or one African American inventor.7 Female patentee data are derived from matching names of

inventors who obtained patents from the USPTO between 1975 and 2008 to commonly-used

women’s names. Female names are matched using commercial name-matching software,

discussed in the Data Appendix, which includes identiﬁcation of Asian- and Slavic-origin

names, among other ethnicities. Each record from the USPTO contains information on the
invention, e.g., title, citations, and patent classiﬁcation, and on the inventor, e.g., name and

address. This method yielded more women’s patents than in other studies, such as the U.S.

Patent and Trademark Oﬃce (USPTO, 1999), because women’s names of foreign origin were

not identiﬁed or may have been underidentiﬁed previously. In total, we ﬁnd 169,061 U.S.
women’s patents granted between 1975 and 2008. Between 1977 and 1998, the number of

U.S. women’s patents in our dataset is 66,967 compared to 60,065 utility patents identiﬁed
by the USPTO.8

    6
      The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 provides for the transfer of exclusive control of government-funded inventions
to universities and ﬁrms for further development and commercialization.
    7
      In this paper, patents refer to utility patents, the largest category of patents.
    8
      Unless otherwise stated, women’s patents in this study refer to patents for which one inventor is a
woman, and the ﬁrst-named inventor resides in the United States. Following USPTO (1999) and related
studies, a patent in which a woman inventor resided in the United States but the ﬁrst-named inventor does


                                                      4
    In our research, two African American inventor data sets are used. First, the African
American Inventors data set from Cook (2004, 2005, 2007a) is the most extensive data-
collection eﬀort of its kind to date. It was constructed by matching African American

inventors and potential patentees to USPTO patent data for the period 1963 to 2006, yielding
1,861 patents and 427 inventors.9
    A second data set is created by using the Census Bureau’s (2009) list of common names
by race, USPTO data, and commercial technology. Inventor names are randomly drawn
from the USPTO inventor ﬁle, which contains 7,881,906 inventor-invention units between

1975 and 2008. Using the Census list and inventor address and zip-code data from the
USPTO, we generate unique ﬁrst-, middle-, and last-name matches.10 From this method
we obtain 1,626 inventors and 4,657 patents. Finally, these data are merged with the Cook

(2007a) data, resulting in 6,518 patents and 2,053 inventors, 305 of which are African Amer-

ican women. Given our conservative approach in identifying female and African American

inventors (ambiguous cases considered to be male or not African American), in the empirical
analysis that follows our results will be biased towards zero, i.e., not ﬁnding the gaps of

interest.
    A central challenge in this study is to identify individual-level commercialization activity.

Forms of commercialization considered in the literature have often been in the secondary
market, e.g., licensing (Arora and Ceccagnoli, (2006)), the achievement of ﬁrst sale (Nerkar
and Shane, (2007)), having a product under review, having a product in market, or having
a start-up company (Campbell et al., (2004)). We consider assignment to a corporation,
university, organization, or anyone other than oneself a proxy for commercialization activity.
That is, the assignment represents commercialization activity at the date of patent issue.


not reside in the United States is excluded. The authors acknowledge that we adopt a crude but widely-used
measure of women’s and African Americans’ patents.
    9
      Sources used include directories of scientists and engineers, data from national organizations, and obit-
uaries. See Cook (2009) for a detailed description of the data.
   10
      Names that have zero probability of being African American names, as determined by the Census list,
are not included in the matching process. See Data Appendix for a detailed explanation of the name-matching
process.


                                                      5
   Further data on female and African American patents are obtained by matching patent
numbers of women and African American inventors to Hall, Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg (2001,
updated 2009), the National Bureau of Economic (NBER) patent database. These data

comprise the patent number, number of citations, assignee code, USPTO patent class and
sub-class, and NBER-Hall, Jaﬀe, and Trajtenberg technological class.
   Many patent-commercialization studies focus on the commercialization activity of federal
laboratories or universities with a small group of institutes or one institute. The measure
of commercialization by assignment to ﬁrms is clear, because the main objective of ﬁrms

is to seek a return on their investment. Some researchers, e.g. Morgan et al. (2001), ob-
tain commercialization data from inventors’ surveys. Data on licensing or commercialization
activities are, however, unavailable on a large scale. As an indirect approach, we connect

potential commercial activity with assignment to ﬁrms with the following argument. Gener-

ally, patent owners will renew their patents if they calculate that a patent’s future value is

higher than its renewal cost, e.g., Pakes and Schankerman (1998) and Serrano (2008). And
the patent value should have a strong relationship with future revenue from licensing, selling,

or launching a new product. Using data from 1983 to 2001, Serrano (2008) ﬁnds that the

proportion of patents expired in ﬁrms is less than one in the individual-owner or unassigned

category. Consequently, we assume that patents owned by ﬁrms have a higher propensity to

gain pecuniary beneﬁt than patents owned by non-ﬁrms.
   To better understand commercialization outcomes and opportunities, women’s and African
American patents are matched to COMPUSTAT data by using a company-matching ﬁle in
the NBER patent database (2006). COMPUSTAT data comprise all publicly-traded ﬁrms
on the New York, American, NASDAQ, and regional stock exchanges in the U.S. We expect
ﬁrms in the COMPUSTAT data set to engage in higher levels of patent commercialization
relative to other ﬁrms. Between 1976 and 2006, there were 841,341 patents assigned to
COMPUSTAT ﬁrms out of 1,748,776 U.S.-origin patents. Women and African Americans
assigned 78,938 and 1,808 of their patents to COMPUSTAT ﬁrms.

4     Graphical Evidence

    Prior to inspecting and testing data on commercialization of patents, we begin by sum-

marizing data from the revised data on women inventors and new data on African American
inventors. To recall, the central questions are: Has the gender gap in commercialization

remained, or has it closed over time? Is there evidence that African Americans are becoming
more active in the process of commercializing new technologies?


General

    Figures 2 and 3 and Table 1A present patents per million obtained by U.S. inventors, U.S.
women inventors, and African American inventors. Since the mid-1980’s, the population-

weighted number of patents has increased for all three groups. On average, U.S. inventors
were granted 168 patents per million between 1980 and 1989 and 278 patents per million

annually between 1990 and 1999. Over time, the share of advanced degrees in science and

engineering (S&E) ﬁelds has risen for women and African Americans. Figures 4 and 5 show

that the largest share of S&E doctorates among women and African Americans has been in
the life sciences, but there is signiﬁcant heterogeneity otherwise. Data on the distribution

of patents by technological ﬁeld and assignment status for each inventor group are given in

Tables 1B, 1C, and 1D and Figures 6 to 8. Fields of invention are broadly similar for U.S.
and African American inventors and are only similar in computers and communications and

other ﬁelds for U.S. and female inventors.
    Related to ownership, the proportion of patents assigned to ﬁrms is relatively stable
for U.S. inventors between 1963 and 2008 as can be seen in Figures 9 to 11 and Table
1C, which gives the evolution of assignment behavior by decade. For women and African
Americans, shares of patents assigned to ﬁrms have increased markedly since 1963. Evidence
from assignment to COMPUSTAT ﬁrms is in Figure 12 and in Table 1D and shows that the
share of total U.S. patents assigned to publicly-traded corporations declined slightly from 50



                                              7
percent between 1976 and 1980 to 47 percent for the period between 1996 and 2000. These
data imply that U.S. inventors are increasingly less likely to rely on large corporations to
pursue commercialization of invention.

   Forward citations and backward citations for each group are presented by technology
category in Figures 13 and 14.11 Forward citations of U.S. inventors, U.S. women inventors,
and African American inventors are similar and growing over the period of study.




Women

   Changes in patent activity among women have been in tandem with changes among U.S.

inventors. U.S. women inventors were granted between 17 patents per million between 1980
and 1989 and 56 patents per million annually between 1990 and 1999. On average, women

inventors participate more actively in the drugs and medical ﬁeld than other U.S. inventors.

This observation is consistent with relatively higher shares of women receiving life sciences

degrees and relatively lower shares receiving engineering degrees since 1970 (Figure 4). The

share of electrical inventions among women’s patents is six percentage points lower than that
of U.S. inventors between 1975 and 2008. The share of chemical patents for female inventors

drops slightly over time but is still higher than for that of U.S. inventors.
   The average annual share of women’s patents assigned to ﬁrms increased from 54 percent
between 1975 and 1980 to 79 percent between 2001 and 2008. The share of unassigned
women’s patents dropped from 39 percent between 1975 and 1980 to 12 percent between 2001
and 2008. In contrast to U.S. trends, the share of female patents assigned to COMPUSTAT
ﬁrms grew in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s and has stayed above 50 percent. Similar
to the U.S., individuals, government, and other non-ﬁrm entities own 26 percent of patents
granted to women inventors over the period 1963 to 2008.

  11
     Citations received in the NBER data set are weighted by the method proposed in Hall, Jaﬀe and
Trajtenberg (2001, updated 2009). Citations made are calculated from citations among patents granted
between 1976 and 2006 using the NBER U.S. patent citations data set.


                                                 8
   Considering each technology, quality, as measured by the median number of citations
for patents, is increasing in tandem with those of all U.S. inventors. However, since 1980,
the median number of citations received for women’s patents has been higher than for U.S.

inventors’ patents for most technology categories, except drugs and medical.
   Single-sex and mixed patent teams perform very diﬀerently. From Table Appendix 1,
we observe that female-only teams assign their patents to ﬁrms only 42 percent of the time,
compared to 74 and 80 percent for all-male and mixed teams. Moreover, more than half
of female-only patents are not assigned to any organization, while just one ﬁfth and one-

tenth of all-male- and mixed-gender-team patents are not assigned to any organization.
Further, all-female patents are less commercialized in drugs and medical, mechanical, and
other technological categories than in chemical and computer and communications. The

ﬁnding that the assignment rate to ﬁrms is higher for mixed-gender teams than single-gender

teams is consistent with but a more general ﬁnding than that of Ashcraft and Breitzman

(2007), who ﬁnd a similar pattern among IT patents.


African Americans

   Corresponding to patent activity for U.S. inventors and women inventors, the population-

weighted number of patents has increased for African Americans. African American inventors

obtained between 3.7 and 4.5 patents per million between 1980 to 1989 and 1990 to 1999.
This ﬁnding is intuitive, given signiﬁcant increases in the supply of potential patentees, e.g.,
advanced degree recipients in the sciences, among African Americans. For African American
inventors, the distribution of ﬁelds of invention mirrors that of all U.S. inventors. This
observation also corresponds to shares of African Americans receiving science and engineering
degrees (Figure 5). As is the case for women, the share of chemical patents falls slightly but
is still higher than that of U.S. inventors.
   The average annual share of African American patents assigned to ﬁrms was relatively
unchanged at 60 percent between 1963 and 1990 but jumped to 77 percent between 2001


                                               9
and 2008. Assignment patterns by organization are not uniform across groups. Individuals,
government, and other non-ﬁrm entities own 33 percent of African American patents, which
is substantially higher than the share for women and U.S. inventors between 1963 and 2008.

    Quality, as measured by the median number of citations for African American patents,
is increasing, which is consistent with those of women and all U.S. inventors.
    From the initial evidence, we do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant commercialization gap for the most
valuable ﬁrms. From a t-test of mean shares of patents assigned to COMPUSTAT ﬁrms,
we can reject the null hypothesis that the U.S. mean is greater than or equal to the mean

for women and for African Americans. Given the aforementioned signiﬁcant increase in the
number of women patentees gleaned using new methods, the gap closes at least partly as a
result of including women with non-English names in the analysis, which has not been done in

previous work. While this ﬁnding is diﬀerent from most in the literature, it is consistent with

the ﬁndings of Morgan et al. (2001). They use the National Science Foundation workforce

survey data to show that, conditional on a patent being granted, rates of commercialization
between men’s and women’s patents are similar, although not identical.
    Nonetheless, a similar test of means for patent activity and general assigned-patent ac-

tivity reveals signiﬁcant diﬀerences across groups. We reject the null hypothesis that the

U.S. means are less than or equal to those of women and African Americans. The evidence

implies that the broader patent and commercialization gaps are not yet closed.



5     Empirical Evidence

    In this section, we extend the analysis to ask if the gaps found above persist when
accounting for other factors. Speciﬁcally, we will test whether determinants of patent and
innovative activity diﬀer across groups for patents, assigned patents, and patents assigned to
COMPUSTAT ﬁrms. With the new data on women and African Americans, we can proceed
by estimating standard models of patent activity from the literature.



                                              10
   Following Griliches (1990), in the knowledge production function innovative activity,
measured by patents, is determined by observable investment, e.g., R&D expenditure, or
number of research scientists, and unobservable error. Many researchers have tested this

relation between innovative activity and inputs using ﬁrm-level data, e.g., Hall, Griliches,
and Hausman (1986), and Pakes and Griliches (1984). Aggregate innovative activity using
country-level data has also been studied.

   Chellaraj, Maskus, and Mattoo (2009) modify the “national ideas production function”
proposed by Porter and Stern (2000) to incorporate the contribution of skilled immigration

and foreign graduate students to U.S. innovative activity. Chellaraj, Maskus and Mattoo
(2009) propose an approach to disentangle the allocation-of-resources variable into R&D
expenditure, stock of scientists and engineers, ﬂow of total graduate students, ﬂow of in-

ternational graduate students, and ﬂow of immigrants. We adopt the Chellaraj, Maskus

and Mattoo (2009) model to study patterns of patenting activity for all U.S. inventors,

U.S. women inventors, and African American inventors. Speciﬁcally, the R&D resources we
use are R&D expenditure, number of employed S&E doctoral researchers, and number of

doctoral graduates.
   To formally test the implications of Chellaraj et al. (2009), two types of data are used

to investigate patent and commercialization activity for each inventor group. We use time-
series data to explain changes in patent and commercialization over time. We then use
cross-section data and discrete-choice analysis to better account for unobserved heterogeneity
among inventor groups.


A. Time-Series Estimation

Patent Activity

   We would like to answer the question: “Are there observable diﬀerences in patenting
and commercial activity between inventor groups over time?” Speciﬁcally, we estimate the



                                             11
following time-series model for each group:

where P AT EN Tt is log of U.S. patents granted by application year, RDt−1 is lag of log of

tists and engineers, SEGRADt−1 is lag of log of S&E PhD graduates, and EN GM GRADt−1
is lag of log of engineering Master’s graduates. All variables are weighted by population.12

Following Griliches (1990), each variable is lagged one year to capture time to innovate.13,14
Models estimated include time trend and a dummy for extension to a 20-year patent term

in 1995, which is believed to have induced a sizeable increase in the number of patent appli-

cations.
    Data used in estimation are patents granted between 1976 and 2008. As is customary, we

drop the last four application years to avoid truncation lag problems.15 Baseline statistics

for each variable are given in Table 2. A Phillips and Perron (1988) test is used to determine

the presence of a unit root. We ﬁnd evidence of a unit root in the patent sample, and each
variable is ﬁrst-diﬀerenced before OLS models are estimated. OLS regressions are executed

for U.S., U.S. women, and African American inventors to shed light on diﬀerences among

these three inventor groups.16
    The endogeneity bias problem in R&D expenditure is well known in the literature. Fol-

  13
      Chellaraj, Maskus, and Mattoo (2009) suggest ﬁve- and seven- year lags for models with patent appli-
cations and grants, respectively, as the dependent variable.
   14
      Dummies for years 1980 and 1984 are included to capture the eﬀect of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 and its
amendment which allow universities to retain intellectual property rights and to license innovation developed
by federal funds.
   15
      The range of the African American data set from Cook (2007a) is shorter, between 1976 and 2002.
   16
      Baseline statistics are reported for four samples of African American inventors. Data from Cook (2007a)
are the AA1 sample, data from commercial encoding are the AA2 sample, and the combined AA1 and AA2
samples are the AA3 sample. The AA4 sample is the AA3 sample plus African-origin names. Results do
not diﬀer substantially between those obtained among samples. Therefore, results from the combined AA4
sample are the ones generally reported. The combined sample drops duplicate patents.


                                                     12
lowing Kanwar and Evenson (2009) and Liu and La Croix (2008), we execute two-stage least
squares estimation (2SLS) using lag of log of GDP per capita (GDP P Ct−1 ), high-school en-
rollment rate (HSERt ), and degree-institution enrollment rate (DIERt ) as instruments.17

The ﬁrst-stage equation is


                    RDt = γ1 + γ2 GDP P Ct−1 + γ3 HSERt + γ4 DIERt + ϵt .                               (2)


    From Table 3, for U.S. inventors, a one-percent increase in the growth rate of engineering
doctorates is correlated with a 0.74-percent increase in the growth rate of patent activity.
The results from 2SLS estimation mirror the results from OLS, and this result is robust
across models estimated in the full sample.

    We use multiple inventors’ discounting to assign the same weight to each patent.18

Women’s patent activity measured by multiple inventors’ discounting is presented in the
fourth and eighth columns of Table 3 (summary statistics for all groups appear in Table

1A). The results are similar to those without discounting.
    In equation (1), we establish context for examining commercialization activity by ﬁrst ex-

amining patent activity in each group. To address patent diﬀerences across inventor groups,
we deﬁne the dependent variable as the diﬀerence in U.S. inventor patents per million and

each group’s patents per million. Estimates are presented in Table 4. For African Americans,

a one-percent increase in the growth rate of doctoral S&E employment is correlated with a

1.4-percent decrease in the growth rate of the diﬀerence between U.S. inventors’ and African
American patent activity. This implies that an increase in African American doctoral S&E
employment narrows the gap between U.S. inventors and African American patent activities.




  17
      See Data Appendix for data sources. Kanwar and Evenson (2009) argue that we expect enrollment rate
to change with scientiﬁc development or R&D expenditure but not patenting activity.
   18
      Computation of fractional contribution to a patent using multiple inventors’ discounting has been exe-
cuted in the literature, e.g., in Ashcraft and Breitzman (2007) and Kerr (2009). The interpretation should
be that if one of six inventors on a patent team is a woman, the patent is one sixth of a woman’s patent.

Commercialization Activity

   Patterns of commercial activity, measured by number of patents assigned to ﬁrms and

number of patents assigned to ﬁrms in COMPUSTAT, are investigated and presented in this
section. Patent activity by ﬁrms is assumed to be driven by proﬁtability.19 In the Griliches

(1990) knowledge model, proﬁtability is one of the ultimate ends of knowledge and depends
on valuable knowledge growth, which is unobservable. Additions to the stock of knowledge
rely on R&D resource allocation, or R&D expenditure. A simple model can be derived from
Griliches (1990) in which proﬁtability is a function of R&D allocation. Using this simple

relationship, we can write down the model to be estimated for commercial activity as in the

previous section:


           ASSIGN M EN Tt = α + β1 IN DRDt−1 + β2 SEEM Pt−1 + β3 SEGRADt−1
                                                                                                             (3)
                                  + β4 EN GM GRADt−1 + β5 DU M M Yt + β6 T IM Et + ϵt ,


where ASSIGN M EN Tt is log of percentage of patents assigned to ﬁrms by application year

and IN DRDt−1 is lag of log of U.S. R&D spending in the industrial sector. The results for

assignment to ﬁrms are presented in Table 5. After controlling for policy change, a 10-percent

increase in the growth rate of industrial R&D expenditure is associated with a 0.7-percent
increase in the growth rate of assignment to ﬁrms for U.S.-inventor patents. A 10-percent

increase in the growth rate of life-science doctorates is correlated with a 1.8-percent increase

in the growth rate of U.S. patents assigned to ﬁrms. For women inventors, a 10-percent
increase in the growth rate of physical-science Ph.D.’s is correlated with a 1.5-or 1.8-percent
decrease in the growth rate of patents assigned to ﬁrms. Among African Americans, a
10-percent increase in the rate of growth of physical science Ph.D.’s is correlated with a
1.9- or 1.7-percent increase in the rate of growth of assigned patents. In contrast, a 10-
percent increase in the growth rate of African American life-science doctorates is correlated
with a decline of 5 percent in the growth rate of African American patents assigned to
  19
       Other factors, e.g., defensive patenting, as in Hall and Ziedonis (2001), are omitted in this analysis.


                                                        14
ﬁrms. A review of NSF 2003 survey data on employment in S&E disciplines shows that 37
percent of African American Ph.D.’s employed as biological scientists teach at postsecondary
institutions, while only 17 percent of African Americans employed as physical scientists

teach at postsecondary institutions.20 Since the lion’s share of patenting occurs at industrial
laboratories, i.e., not at postsecondary institutions, and since most of that activity is assigned
to ﬁrms, a negative relation between the rate of arrival of life-science doctorates and the rate
of arrival of assigned patents is not surprising.

    In line with Griliches (1990) and related papers, we ﬁnd that a one-percent increase in

the growth rate of expenditure on industrial R&D is associated with a 1.1-percent increase
in the growth rate of assignment to ﬁrms.21 A 10-percent increase in the growth rate of
master’s in engineering graduates is correlated with a 9.5-percent increase in the growth

rate of assignment for African American inventors. These results suggest that there may be

relatively more or fewer scientiﬁc or commercial spillovers for African American inventors in

certain ﬁelds of invention. For 2SLS estimation, the correlations between R&D expenditure
and growth rate of assignment are statistically insigniﬁcant. Estimated coeﬃcients on other

independent variables are similar to those from OLS estimation.
    Estimates from the sample of COMPUSTAT ﬁrms are presented in Table 6. For African

Americans, an increase of 10 percent in the growth rate of engineering doctorates is correlated
with an increase of 1.4 or 1.5 percent in the growth rate of assignment to COMPUSTAT
ﬁrms. Other results remain largely the same as for all assigned patents.
    Diﬀerences in commercialization activity, measured by percentage of U.S. inventors’
patents assigned to ﬁrms (or COMPUSTAT ﬁrms) minus percentage of each group’s patents
assigned to ﬁrms (or COMPUSTAT ﬁrms), are presented in Tables 7 and 8. Results from
Tables 7 and 8 are consistent with those from Tables 5 and 6. These results are suggestive
that advanced engineering degrees may play an important role in closing gaps between U.S.
  20
     NSF (2007a).
  21
     In general, given a shorter time series than that used by Griliches (1990), Chelleraj, et al. (2009), and
others estimating the relation between patent output and measures of R&D, we expect that our results may
be similar but not identical to these papers.


                                                     15
inventors and each group examined.
   Older and newer results from the literature on women in science and engineering may
shed light additional light on our ﬁndings. A number of papers document relatively higher

exit rates, rates of departure from degreed ﬁeld of study, among women compared to men
in science and engineering, e.g., Hall (2007), Hewlett, et al. (2008), Hill, et al. (2010),
Hunt (2010), Morgan (2000), Preston (1994, 2004, 2006), Sonnert and Holton (1995), and
Stephan and Levin (2005). Among the explanations given are isolation related to being a
minority with less mentoring and fewer networks, diﬃculty of balancing extended work days
in science and engineering with family commitments, and discrimination, including negative

stereotypes associated with women in science. Hunt (2010) ﬁnds that excess exit rates among
women are concentrated in engineering and that this is largely due to dissatisfaction over

pay and promotion opportunities. Given higher exit rates in science and engineering and

especially engineering, it is likely that these constraints are less binding for those “survivors”

who remain in corporate laboratories, where it can be assumed that much patent-related
work is done. If the perception is that the contributions of “survivors” are highly valued,

the correlation between assignment to COMPUSTAT ﬁrms and the presence of a woman on

a patent is not surprising.
   Both NSF data and the literature suggest that explanations oﬀered for outcomes for
women may extend to African Americans. In general, exit rates are higher for African
American doctorates in S&E ﬁelds than for their counterparts. The 2003 NSF survey also
establishes that, 35 percent of African American S&E doctorates were employed in non-S&E
occupations, in comparison to 25 percent of all S&E doctorates. Further, unlike women in
the larger S&E population, African American women constitute the majority of total African
American S&E graduates. In addition, women make up 45 percent of all African American
doctorates who are employed in S&E occupations, while women make up only 28 percent
of all doctorates in the total S&E occupations. While the research on African Americans
is limited, related work, e.g., Price’s (2009) study of the economics profession, also suggests


                                               16
that the literature on women S&E graduates may be applicable to African Americans.
   Given limited comparable data and scholarship on African Americans and to shed light on
the mechanisms underlying our ﬁndings, between 2003 and 2009 we conducted interviews in

a small sample of African Americans. Those in the sample have at least one of the following
characteristics: patentee, entrepreneur, former employee of a government laboratory, former
employee in S&E ﬁeld, or current employee in S&E ﬁeld.22 Two thirds are entrepreneurs, the
majority of whom have ﬁrms related to self-generated patents or other forms of intellectual
property (IP) or licenses for the use of another ﬁrm’s intellectual property. One entrepreneur
notwithstanding, all have training in math or science, which was not a selection criterion.

There are two signiﬁcant ﬁndings from the interviews. First, social, professional, and ﬁnan-
cial networks for inventive and business activities were cited as important but often missing.

This ﬁnding is broadly consistent with the evidence from data on black business ownership

and performance from Fairlie and Robb (2009) and from female academic scientists stud-

ied in Murray and Graham (2007). Generating networks to compensate for missing ones,
e.g., through internships, small-business programs, golf-club memberships, seemed to fea-

ture prominently in the allocation of ﬁrm resources. Not surprisingly, those with the least

binding network constraints were previously at large ﬁrms or who are licensees or aﬃliates

of well-known (IP) ﬁrms (or both). Second, as was found for women, most entrepreneurs

reported encountering more perception problems than their white and Asian counterparts
due to the small number of African American IT and IP-related ﬁrms. While this evidence

is not extensive, it is suggestive that there may be common features between women and
African Americans in science and in science-related employment that may help to explain
patterns of commercialization activity.

information on the sample.

B. The Inventor’s Commercialization Decision

    Time-series estimation using aggregate data allowed us to study patterns of patenting and

commercialization by women, African American, and U.S. inventors. However, the aggregate
data and analysis are limited, because they sum female and African American patents in

diﬀerent technologies and team characteristics in the same year together. Therefore, we
use cross-section data to exploit patent and team characteristics to more closely evaluate
commercialization activity. We examine the inventor’s decision to assign a patent to a ﬁrm
and treat each patent as a unit of observation. With this slightly diﬀerent approach, our

main question is: “How do gender and race covary with commercial activity measured by

assignment to ﬁrms?” Speciﬁcally, we estimate the following probit model:


 P r(ASSIGN F IRMi = 1) = F (α + β1 Wi + β2 AAi + β3 T EAMi + β4 CIT AT IONi

                                 + β5 Wi × T EAMi + β6 AAi × T EAMi + β7 Wi × CIT AT IONi
                                                                  ∑
                                                                  5
                                 + β8 AAi × CIT AT IONi +                β9,j T ECHij
                                                                   j=1

                                     ∑
                                     5                            ∑
                                                                  5
                                 +         β10,j Wi × T ECHij +         β11,j AAi × T ECHij + ϵi ),
                                     j=1                          j=1

                                                                                                          (4)


where ASSIGN F IRMi is a dummy variable with the value one if patent i has been assigned
to a ﬁrm; Wi and AAi are dummy variables with the value one if there is a woman or

African American inventor on a given patent team; and T EAMi is number of inventors on
patent team, which is a proxy for patent collaboration; CIT AT IONi is number of forward
citations23 ; T ECHij is a dummy variable with the value one if patent i is in technological

  23
     Patent citations are used in the innovation literature to measure knowledge spillovers and quality of
patents, e.g., Hall, Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg (2001, updated 2009). Citations received or made inform linkages
between inventors and innovations, and patent quality is positively associated with the number of forward
citations, or patents citing a given patent. If the original patent is cited by a number of following patents,
this indicates that the original patent is important or has high quality, e.g., Hagedoorn and Cloodt (2003)
and Trajtenberg (1990). In addition to patent counts, citations received may be used to measure patenting
activity, e.g., Hall, Jaﬀe and Trajtenberg (2005) and Acharya, Baghai and Subramanian (2009).


                                                     18
category j. We expect the number of inventors to increase with the probability of assigning
a patent to a ﬁrm.24 Moreover, dummies for women’s and African American patents as
proxies for networks and discrimination are included in the regressions. Using taste-based

preferences of the employer proposed by Becker (1971), we would predict that the probability
of patents assigned to a ﬁrm may be negatively correlated with the share of women or African
Americans on the patent team. Controls for technological categories and forward citations are
also included. We pool patents granted between 1976 and 2008 together to estimate model
(7) as a probit model. Further, we estimate probit models with two ﬁve-year-subsamples,
between 1976 and 1980, and between 2001 and 2005 to capture changes in commercialization

activity for women and African Americans.
    We are concerned that the assignments of some patents may be driven by a few proliﬁc

inventors. It is possible that the error terms are correlated for the observations relating to

the same proliﬁc inventors. To address this issue robust standard errors that are clustered on

the identity of the most proliﬁc inventor in a patent team are reported for probit models.25
    Results are presented in Tables 9A and 9B. For the population of U.S. inventors between

1976 and 2006, having women or African American inventors on the patent team reduces the

probability of assigning patents to ﬁrms by 0.11 and 0.07. An additional inventor increases

the probability of assigning patents to ﬁrms by 0.09. In the 1970’s subsample, if other

variables are held constant, women have a lower probability of assigning to ﬁrms than men
by 0.22. For African Americans, the probability of assigning patents to corporations is lower

than other races by 0.09. These gaps remain in the 2000’s subsample. The opportunity for
women and African American inventors to assign their patents to ﬁrms, compared to men and
other races, is worse. Given the nonlinearity of probit estimation, the marginal eﬀects cannot
be summed directly.26 The predicted probabilities of having women and African Americans
  24
      Jones (2009) proposes that an increase in size of patent team is caused by an increasing specialization
requirement and an increase in the burden of knowledge.
   25
      Singh and Fleming (2009), for example, address the possibility of correlation among error terms involving
the same inventor by clustering on the identity of the ﬁrst inventor.
   26
      Moreover, the method and code in the literature, e.g. Ai and Norton (2003) who use only one interaction
term, cannot be used in our estimation. Our dummy variables for women and African Americans are


                                                      19
on a patent team are calculated and presented in Figures 15A and 15B. Gaps between women
and men and African American and other races in most technological categories are evident.
For example, predicted probabilities of assigning patents to ﬁrms for women and African

Americans are lower than their counterparts by 0.11 and 0.08 in the ﬁeld of mechanical
invention.
   The diﬀerence between technological categories is considered in Tables 10A and 10B.
Pooled data between 1976 and 2006 are separated into six technological categories. From
results in Table 10A, the gender gap in commercialization is large in the mechanical and mis-

cellaneous categories. For mechanical patents, having team members who are women reduces
the probability of assigning patents to ﬁrms by 0.18. The gap between African Americans
and other races is also large in the computer, electrical, mechanical, and miscellaneous cat-

egories. The results for COMPUSTAT ﬁrms are presented in Tables 11A, 11B, 12A, and

12B. Having a female or African American inventor renders ambiguous results for the entire

period, but this result varies by subperiod for women. We would expect signiﬁcantly higher
rates of assignment to COMPUSTAT ﬁrms in four of six categories if a woman inventor

participates on the patent team. We would expect signiﬁcantly lower assignment rates if an

African American inventor participates in a mechanical or miscellaneous invention. Fewer

patents assigned to the most valuable ﬁrms are anticipated when the size of a female in-

ventor’s patent team increases. More COMPUSTAT patents are expected when women and
African American inventors receive citations for their drug and miscellaneous patents.


C. The Inventor’s Post-Invention Decisions

   In the probit models, the inventor’s decision is whether or not to assign a patent to a
ﬁrm or a publicly-listed ﬁrm. In fact, the inventor’s decision is broader and not taken in
isolation. She must decide among ﬁrms, government agencies, universities, and individuals
as potential assignees. To capture this decision more completely, we estimate the following

interacted with several variables, such as number of team members and number of forward citations.

                                                                5

                         k = F, G, U,


where Pf , Pg , Pu , and Pn are the probabilities of assigning a patent to ﬁrm, government,

university, and individual. The model in Equation (5) is estimated using both data on

assignment to ﬁrms and on assignment to COMPUSTAT ﬁrms. Results are reported in
Table 13A and 13B. Holding other variables constant, the probability of assigning to a

COMPUSTAT ﬁrm (a non-listed ﬁrm) is lower for women’s patents than for men’s patents

by 0.01 (0.1). For African Americans, the probability of assigning to a non-listed ﬁrm is

lower than for U.S. inventors by 0.06. Among women, we expect more patents assigned to

universities in all speciﬁcations. Moreover, women and African Americans are more likely to
assign their patents to government entities than their counterparts. This may be due to a

number of factors, such as greater employment and contracting opportunities, relatively more
penalties for discrimination, and preference for working in the government sector. However,

our data will not allow us to rule out any of these alternative explanations.



6    Conclusion and Future Research

    Using unique data on women and African American inventors, we ﬁnd that commer-
cialization behavior among women and African American inventors is closer to that of U.S.
inventors than previously thought. This evidence emerges despite signiﬁcantly lower patent


                                                                21
activity among women and African Americans. A common feature of the two groups is that
increases in advanced engineering degrees predict increases in commercialization. In con-
trast, for all U.S. inventors, greater investment in life-science doctorates is correlated with

greater commercialization activity. Increasing citations received or the number of partici-
pants on a patent team is not systematically associated with better commercial outcomes for
African Americans and women, as it is for the broader population of inventors. We ﬁnd that
expected assignment rates are higher for women and African Americans when the assignee is
a government entity. Finally, the evidence indicates that mixed-gender patent teams are bet-
ter at commercialization than all-male and all-female teams. Our ﬁndings partly result from

enhancing identiﬁcation of women and African American patentees and taking advantage of
more recently available data. These results are all the more striking, given our conservative

strategy of identifying female and African American inventors.

   Indeed, this research may raise more questions than it answers. The evidence is sugges-

tive that experience in organized and sustained groups dedicated to scientiﬁc discovery, as
in engineering programs, may provide a critical link to invention-related commercial activ-

ity. Future work may focus on further explorations of these mechanisms; racial and gender

diﬀerences by innovative ﬁeld, especially scientiﬁc and commercial spillovers for women and

African American inventors; and examination of additional commercialization activities.

Data Appendix

Data Sources

   Data on utility patents between 1963 and 2006 come from the NBER patent database, Hall,

Jaﬀe, and Trajtenberg (2001, updated 2009) and between 2007 and 2008 come from USPTO (2009).

The NBER patent database is available at http://www.nber.org/patents. The NBER patent

database 2006 edition is extended in 2008 by matching USPTO data by assignment and technology

codes to NBER ﬁles. All patents granted between 1976 and 2006 have a unique assignee number

that can identify them as COMPUSTAT ﬁrms. Data on science and engineering doctorates are from

NSF (2009a). Data on science and engineering master’s graduates are from NSF (2009b). Data on

employed science and engineering doctorates are taken from Commission on Professionals in Science

and Technology (2006). Data on population by race and gender are from U.S. Census Bureau

(various issues). Data on total U.S. and industrial R&D expenditure are from NSF (2007b). Total

U.S. R&D expenditure data are used in Tables 3 and 4. Industrial R&D expenditure data are used

in Tables 5 to 8. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2009). R&D expenditure

per capita is deﬂated by GDP deﬂator from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2009). Data on

high-school enrollment rates and degree-institution enrollment rates are from U.S. Department of

Education (2009).



Female Name-Matching

   Female-inventor patents have been identiﬁed systematically by matching ﬁrst names using pro-

fessional software developed by the Melissa Data Corporation.27 Inventors with ﬁrst names which

are male-only or which could not be easily characterized as male or female were assumed to be

male. Patent origin is determined by the residence of the ﬁrst-named inventor. From 7,881,906

inventor-invention units in the USPTO inventor ﬁle between 1975 and 2008, there are 197,850 fe-

male inventor-invention units with ﬁrst-named inventor residing in the U.S. If we use simple unique

  27
     Other methods have been used in the literature. For example, Ashcraft and Breitzman (2007) identify
inventor gender in their IT inventor database by scanning name, matching with Social Security Adminis-
tration top 1000 boys’ and girls’ names, and searching websites for “not typical” American names, e.g.,
Sanjay.


                                                  27
last-, ﬁrst-, and middle initial, there are 86,962 U.S. women inventors. These inventors account for

169,061 U.S. women’s patents.



African American Encoding Process

   From 7,881,906 inventor-invention units in the USPTO inventor ﬁle between 1975 and 2008,

we generated unique last-, ﬁrst-, and middle name. After dropping repeated names and foreign

inventors, we obtained 1,167,019 unique U.S. inventor names. Then, 500,000 names were drawn to

encode ethnic groups using software developed by Ethnic Technologies. In order to reduce ineﬃ-

ciency from submitting low-probability African American last names, e.g., Indian or Chinese last

names, we used the probability of African Americans using a particular surname from U.S. Census

Bureau (2008) as a threshold for selecting data. The surname was not drawn if the probability of

African Americans using that surname is zero. Ethnic groups, including African Americans, are

encoded by their ﬁrst name, last name, and address. Inventor address and zip code data from the

USPTO data are used in the matching process. As these data are not always available, data are

collected using various online databases of addresses and zip codes, e.g., Google. From this process

we obtain 1,167 African American inventors.




Overlapping Patents and Patentees

   There is a small number of overlapping patents and patentees, and they are counted once in

the merged series. It is not surprising that the two methodologies produce overlapping but not

identical data sets. The Cook (2007a) data, which begin in 1963, capture a larger cohort of older

inventors, whose names would be less distinct than those in more recent cohorts. Identifying black

names, e.g., as in done in Bertrand and Mullinathan (2004) and Fryer and Levitt (2004), is more

straightforward in data starting from the mid-1970’s when increasing heterogeneity is observed

among African American ﬁrst names, which the software exploits. In addition, the approach in

Cook (2007a) is more conservative, as it matches inventors, engineers, and other potential paten-

tees who are African American to patent data rather than matching patentees to names that are



                                                28
potentially African American.




African American Interviews

   Participants were selected from the African American patent database, professional directories,

conference proceedings, and industry lists, e.g., at blackenterprise.com. The sample is not random

but is meant to be representative. Interviews were conducted in Stanford, CA; Oakland, CA; At-

lanta, GA; Decorah, IA; Ann Arbor and East Lansing, MI; the greater Boston, MA area; and the

greater Washington, DC area. Nine interviews were conducted in person, by phone, and by email

between 2003 and 2009.




Distinct Inventor

   A distinct inventor is deﬁned by having same last name, ﬁrst name, and middle initial. If the

initial middle name is blank but the ﬁrst and last names overlap with another record with the same

ﬁrst name, last name, and NBER subcategory, we treat them as the same inventor.28




  28
     This practice is consistent with that of the literature, e.g., Jones (2009) and Singh (2004). Another
algorithm can be found in Trajtenberg, Shiﬀ, and Melamed (2006).

Notes: 1) Patent data are patents granted between 1976 and 2008, for which applications were made
between 1976 and 2004.
2) The African American sample is sum of Cook (2007a) and commercial encoding.
3) Ph.D.’s granted are separated into ﬁelds: engineering, life sciences, and physical sciences.
4) Log of diﬀerence in patents per million = log (U.S. inventors patents per million -
each group’s patents per million). Data are by application year and ﬁrst-diﬀerenced.
5) Log of R&D expenditure per capita, deﬂated, Employed S&E Doctorates, Ph.D.’s granted,
and Master’s in engineering are ﬁrst-diﬀerenced and lagged one year in estimation.
6) Industrial R&D expenditure per capita is deﬂated by GDP deﬂator from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (2009).
7) Models are estimated as OLS and 2SLS models. Instruments for R& D spending in the IV regressions
are lag of log GDP per capita, high-school enrollment rates, and degree-institution enrollment rates.
8) A time trend is included in each model.
9) Newey-West robust standard errors for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation are in parentheses.
10) Coeﬃcients marked with an asterisk (***) are signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level of signiﬁcance; (**),
at the 5 percent level; and (*), at the 10 percent level.

Notes: 1) Patent data are patents granted between 1976 and 2008, for which applications were made
between 1976 and 2004.
2) The African American sample is sum of Cook (2007a) and commercial encoding.
3) Ph.D.’s granted are separated into ﬁelds: engineering, life sciences, and physical sciences.
4) Diﬀerence in percentage of patents assigned to ﬁrms = percentage of U.S. inventors’ patents assigned
to ﬁrms - percentage of each group’s patents assigned to ﬁrms. Data are by application year and ﬁrst-diﬀerenced.
5) Log of industrial R&D expenditure per capita, deﬂated, Employed S&E Doctorates, Ph.D.’s granted,
and Master’s in engineering are ﬁrst-diﬀerenced and lagged one year in estimation.
6) Industrial R&D expenditure per capita is deﬂated by GDP deﬂator from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (2009).
7) Models are estimated as OLS and 2SLS models. Instruments for R&D spending in the IV regressions
are lag of log GDP per capita, high-school enrollment rates, and degree-institution enrollment rates.
8) A time trend is included in each model.
9) Newey-West robust standard errors for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation are in parentheses.
10) Coeﬃcients marked with an asterisk (***) are signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level of signiﬁcance; (**),
at the 5 percent level; and (*), at the 10 percent level.

Notes: 1) Patent data are patents granted to U.S. inventors between 1976 and 2006.
2) All models are estimated as multinomial logit models. In model (1), there are 4 choices of assignment that are ﬁrm, government,
university, and individual. In model (2), there are 5 choices of assignment that are COMPUSTAT ﬁrm, non-listed ﬁrm, government,
university, and individual.
3) Coeﬃcients in each column are marginal eﬀects (discrete changes). Heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors of are in parentheses.
4) The base case is none or individual assignment. The omitted technology category is Other.
5) The “university” assignee category includes universities, foundations, research institutions, and hospitals.
6) Coeﬃcients marked with an asterisk (***) are signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level of signiﬁcance; (**), at the 5 percent level; and (*),
at the 10 percent level.
