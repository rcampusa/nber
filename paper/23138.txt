                                           ABSTRACT

The appropriability of innovation depends not only on the instruments available to an innovator
to protect private returns, but how those instruments interact with each other as part of the firm‚Äôs
entrepreneurial strategy. We consider the interplay between two appropriability mechanisms
available to start-up innovators: control, whereby the innovator earns rents from their
establishment of formal intellectual property rights, versus execution, whereby innovators earn
returns through a first-mover advantage that yields dynamic benefits allowing the firm to ‚Äúget
ahead, stay ahead.‚Äù While most prior work has taken these instruments to be independent, we
establish that these two alternative appropriability instruments are substitutes on the margin. For
example, if the learning advantage from execution is sufficiently high, an entrepreneur might
choose not to invest in a patent, even if intellectual property protection is costless. Moreover, the
endogenous choice between control and execution is interdependent with other strategic choices
of start-up innovators, such as the choice to pursue a narrow or broad customer segment, or
whether to commercialize a ‚Äúminimal viable product‚Äù version of their innovation versus delay
commercialization until a product is available with a higher level of technical functionality and
reliability.

  Since Nelson (1959) and Arrow (1962), economists have understood that the private value of an
innovation may be significantly lower than its social value, and that this gap may result in
significant underinvestment in innovation. This insight has prompted significant study by
economists and researchers in related fields such as strategy focusing on how innovators can
appropriate the value of their innovations, and how this varies across different economic,
institutional and strategic environments (Teece, 1986; Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh, 2000).
  Attention has been focused on the appropriability of innovations arising in new firms (i.e.,
entrepreneurial start-ups) that are unable to leverage existing capital or product market assets such
as manufacturing capabilities or brand reputation (Aghion and Howitt, 1992; Gans and Stern,
2003). At least two appropriability approaches have been identified for start-up innovators:
reliance on formal intellectual property protection such as patents and copyrights (which we will
refer to as a ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù approach) and first-mover competitive advantage (which we will refer to as
an ‚Äúexecution‚Äù approach). Most theoretical and empirical research in economics and strategy have
taken the appropriability regime governing a given start-up innovation to be exogenous, resulting
from the economic and strategic environment in which the start-up operates. For example, start-
up innovators in the biotechnology industry such as Genentech are presumed to appropriate returns
through their ability to leverage the interplay between strong formal intellectual property rights
and regulatory entry barriers (Pisano, 1997), while Internet software entrepreneurs such as Netflix
or Amazon are presumed to appropriate through rapid time-to-market and their ability to learn
from customers to ‚Äúget ahead, stay ahead‚Äù (Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997; Sutton, 2012).
  This paper develops a simple model highlighting the interplay between control and execution as
alternative routes to appropriability. A core element of this model is that, whereas a control strategy
allows an innovator to forestall imitation once control is established, control itself takes time to
establish, and so can delay market entry; in contrast, an execution strategy is premised on taking
advantage of the benefits arising from rapid market entry such as learning from customers, early
reputational advantages or coordination on a standard. In effect, the sharpest distinction is between
choices that are predicated on the startup being shielded from future competition by entry barriers
(as might be afforded by formal intellectual property protection, control of key assets or some
network effects) versus that competition being met by superior quality or cost capabilities that are
built and developed early. In other words, investing in control is akin to investing to compete for
                                                                                                                                                  3

the market whereas investing in execution is competing in the market through the establishment
of dynamic capabilities.1
   We derive two main results. First, we find that, as an endogenous choice of the start-up, control
and execution are strategic substitutes. Rather than simply reflecting exogenous and independent
environmental conditions governing the fraction of value captured by the innovator, the choice of
an appropriability strategy by the start-up shapes the appropriability regime that ultimately governs
the innovation. For example, when the ability to learn from early customer feedback in the
marketplace is sufficiently high, an entrepreneur might choose not to invest in intellectual property
protection for their innovation, even if intellectual property protection is costless. Second, the
choice between control and execution is interdependent with other key strategic choices for start-
up entrepreneurs, such as their choice to pursue a narrow or broad customer segment, or their
choice of whether to commercialize a ‚Äúminimal viable product‚Äù version of their innovation or only
commercialize products with high levels of technical functionality and reliability. Consistent with
the framework and evidence developed in Ching, Gans and Stern (2017), our core results suggest
that the appropriability of innovation depends not only on the instruments available to an
innovator, but on how those instruments interact with each other as part of the firm‚Äôs
(endogenous) entrepreneurial strategy.

                                                               I. The Model

   We consider an entrepreneur who has already developed an idea. The maximal value from the
idea in any given period is equal to 1 (e.g., there is a uniform unit mass of consumers each with
willingness to pay of 1). To introduce an innovation, the innovator incurs a one-time sunk cost C,
and each firm operating in the market incurs a per-period fixed operating cost of c (< 1); the
                                                                                  !"#
potential net present value of the market is, therefore,                                ‚àí ùê∂, where d is the discount rate.
                                                                                  !"$

   There are two potential ways that the innovator can lose their ability to capture value from the
idea: imitation and competitive follow-on innovation. Imitation occurs in period t+1 (with
certainty, and resulting in subsequent profits of 0) if the idea is introduced into the market in t


    1
      While our model highlights the starkest choice between control-oriented and execution-oriented commercialization, the distinction in practice
is of course more subtle. For example, aggressive entry into a market with network effects may allow a firm to establish effective entry barrriers;
while the end objective of such a strategy is control, some of the initial investments in building out scale may be difficult to distinguish from an
execution-oriented approach.
without any intellectual property protection and the start-up does not undertake activities during t
to obtain a period t+1 advantage over potential rivals.
   A separate risk facing the innovator is the potential for follow-on innovation commercialized by
a rival. A potential follow-on innovation arises each period with probability l that can be
introduced into the market at an incremental sunk cost of C. For simplicity, we assume that, though
the follow-on innovation when commercialized supersedes the earlier product generation (i.e., the
original start-up will end up earning 0 in subsequent periods if the follow-on innovation is
introduced by a competitor), the value of the market remains the same across periods (i.e., at a unit
mass of 1 with WTP of 1).2
   If the entrepreneur simply releases the product to the market without intellectual property
protection and without developing capabilities that yield a future marginal cost advantage, the
innovator will enjoy a single-period of monopoly followed by the complete loss of appropriability
(we will refer to this possibility as opportunistic entry). As such, the entrepreneur will evaluate
alternative mechanisms for enhancing their appropriability through their ability to forestall
imitation and competitive follow-on innovation.
       We consider two strategies: control and execution. Under control, the start-up delays product
launch until their ability to control their innovation has been established, such as through formal
intellectual property protection such as patents or copyrights, contract-based control mechanisms
such as non-disclosure agreements or non-compete agreements with employees, or product design
approaches such as through the establishment of proprietary architectures.3 The key assumption is
that, even when control is effective, control takes time to establish (or, equivalently, results in a
delay in the ability to bring the product to market quickly). For simplicity and focus, we consider
a case where, though control involves an opportunity cost of delay, the financial costs of
intellectual property are equal to zero and intellectual property rights, once established, are
effective in shielding the strat-up from immediate and future competition. Specifically, Control
yields two distinct benefits: it precludes imitative competition (with probability one) and, for any



   2
      As in quality ladder models (O‚ÄôDonoghue, Scotchmer, and Thisse, 1998), and models of step-by-step innovation (Aghion, et al, 2001), this
assumption allows us to focus sharply on the strategic tradeoffs between control versus execution rather than conflating these effects with the impact
of market expansion resulting from follow-on innovation.
    3
      While we focus here on the direct benefits from control as the start-up brings the product to market, formal intellectual property rights will
also be complementary with cooperation (as opposed to competition) with established product market players, as formal intellectual property rights
allows start-ups and established firms to overcome the disclosure problem inherent to negotiating an agreement (Arrow, 1962; Gans and Stern,
2000; Gans, Hsu, and Stern, 2002).
                                                                                                                                               5

new follow-on innovation opportunity, allows the start-up to have priority over that subsequent
innovation with probability a.4
   Alternatively, under execution, the entrepreneur introduces the product to the market
immediately, and incurs a per-period incremental cost e (< 1 ‚àí ùëê), yielding two distinct benefits
through the development of product market experience capabilities. First, these capabilities allow
the start-up to establish a marginal cost advantage over potential rivals in the subsequent period
(though these capabilities decay after one period and so require reinvestment each period). Second,
execution allows the start-up to sense and take advantage of follow-on innovation opportunities
that match these capabilities (Teece, Pisano, and Shuen, 1997; Gans, 2016). Thus, we assume that
with probability b (a measure of the impact of product market learning on their ability to ‚Äúget
ahead, stay ahead‚Äù), the entrepreneur can exploit a follow-on innovation faster than any rivals and
capture the market for that product generation. Therefore, under both control and execution, an
entrepreneur has the possibility to secure rents from follow-on innovations.

                                                 II. Control Versus Execution

   We now turn to analysis of the appropriability strategy that will be undertaken by the start-up.
There are four options for investment in the face of a new innovation: opportunistic entry, control,
execution, or control+execution. To do so, we start by describing the stationary net present value
from each strategy, taking advantage of the fact that, given the model set-up, the optimal strategy
chosen in response to a given innovation opportunity will be independent of whether that was the
initial innovation opportunity or a subsequent follow-on innovation opportunity (and so the
strategy is time- and state-independent).
   Opportunistic Entry: The entrepreneur commercializes the product immediately at a cost C
and has the market to themselves for one period. However, imitative entry in the next period (and
all periods thereafter) results in a total loss of subsequent appropriability. Under opportunistic
entry, the entrepreneur earns:
(1) ùë£./ ‚àí ùê∂ = 1 ‚àí ùëê ‚àí ùê∂ ‚áí ùë£./ = 1 ‚àí ùëê




   4
     a can be interpreted as a measure of the breadth of control over the innovation, as in O‚ÄôDonoghue, Scotchmer and Thisse, 1998 or in terms of
control over follow-on innovation (as in Aghion and Howitt, 1993).
  Control: The entrepreneur establishes control after a one-period delay but loses control each
period (including during the time before they initially come to market) with probability l(1-a).
The net present value, vCON, is therefore:
(2) ùë£2.3 ‚àí ùê∂ = 1 ‚àí ùúÜ 1 ‚àí ùõº ùõø 1 ‚àí ùëê + ùë£2.3 ‚àí ùúÜùõºùõøùê∂ ‚àí ùê∂
              !"8 !"9 (!"#)"892
‚áí ùë£2.3 = ùõø
                !" !"8 !"9 $

  Execution: The entrepreneur enters immediately but incurs an incremental per-period cost to
develop capabilities that foreclose imitative entry and gain an advantage on access to follow-on
innovation. The net present value of this strategy is therefore:
  (3) ùë£/:/ ‚àí ùê∂ = ‚àíùê∂ + 1 ‚àí ùëê ‚àí ùëí + 1 ‚àí ùúÜ 1 ‚àí ùõΩ ùõøùë£/:/ ‚àí ùúÜùõΩùõøùê∂
            !"#"="8>$2
‚áí ùë£/:/ =
           !" !"8 !"> $

  Control + Execution: This involves the entrepreneur pursuing both strategies, which allows
them to exploit both directions in sustaining leadership, but also they must incur both costs. Their
product introduction is delayed for one period yet they must incur the execution cost e in all
periods. The expected payoff is therefore:
  (4) ùë£?.@A ‚àí ùê∂ = ‚àíùê∂ ‚àí ùëí ‚àí 1 ‚àí ùúÜ 1 ‚àí ùõº 1 ‚àí ùõΩ ùõø 1 ‚àí ùëê + ùë£?.@A ‚àí ùúÜ(ùõº + ùõΩ ‚àí ùõºùõΩ)ùõøùê∂
            "=B !"8 !"9 !"> $(!"#)"8(9B>"9>)$2
‚áí ùë£?.@A =
                       !" !"8 !"9 !"> $

  Our first result is that execution and control are substitute strategies from the perspective of the
entrepreneur. This means that the marginal return to either one is reduced if the other is being
undertaken. This is summarised in the following proposition.
Proposition 1. Control and execution are substitute strategies.
  The two strategies are substitutes if ùë£?.@A ‚àí ùë£/:/ ‚â§ ùë£2.3 ‚àí ùë£./ . This condition holds because
while both strategies have distinct costs (execution involves an ongoing cost e while control
involves an opportunity cost of delay), both strategies yield a similar benefit ‚Äì the deterrence of
short-term entry and the potential to forestall follow-on innovation competition. While the costs
of each strategy are independent, the marginal benefit of each is reduced when the other strategy
is also implemented. Consequently, the two strategies are substitutes on the margin. For start-up
innovators, where both human and financial resources are highly constrained, it is likely that there
will be a meaningful trade-off between an investment in the types of activities that would allow
the firm to forestall imitation or gain a legal right to block follow-on innovation versus those
                                                                                                                                               7

activities that would focus the young firm on learning about customers and developing the
capabilities required to ‚Äúget ahead, stay ahead.‚Äù The choice between control and execution depends
of course on the idiosyncratic costs and benefit of each strategy for a start-up. As we emphasize in
Ching, Gans, and Stern (2017), a particularly interesting case to consider is when, because of
uncertainty about how each strategy will be realized in the market, the start-up is unable to rank
these alternatives in terms of their ability to forestall follow-on innovative entry by competitors
i.e., ùõº = ùõΩ).5 In this scenario, execution will be preferred to control if 1 ‚àí ùõø 1 ‚àí ùúÜ 1 ‚àí ùõΩ                                               E
                                                                                                                                        > FGH .
Execution is chosen when the rate of generation of product innovations is high, or the ability to
leverage current incumbency into future leadership is low. As well, for a sufficiently low discount
factor (ie., when the start-up is impatient to earn revenue), execution will again be preferred. More
generally, this result highlights that a start-up innovator may choose to forego intellectual property
as part of their optimal strategy even when formal intellectual property protection is costless and
allows for strict appropriability once established. Given that execution is chosen when the product
innovation rate is rapid (l is high), this means that the observed rate of patented innovation may
be low even when the true rate of patentable innovation is high.

                                 III. Entrepreneurial Strategy Complementarities

   We now turn to consider how the choice between control and execution depends on the other
strategic choices and conditions governing the overall entrepreneurial strategy of the start-up
innovator.

                                                                 A. Customer

   For a given innovation, a start-up often faces a choice not only of whether to commercialize
through control versus execution but also whether to focus initially on a niche customer base or
attempt to appeal to the mass market (Christensen, 1996; Zott and Amit, 2008; Gans, Stern, and
Wu, 2016). Targeting a smaller customer segment comes at the expense of demand but offers the
potential for a lower cost of learning about customers (allowing the firm to maintain a dynamic
advantage over imitative rivals). How does the choice of market segment size relate to the choice


   5
     Specifically, Ching, Gans and Stern (2017) highlight how Rosenberg uncertainty ‚Äì the inability to forecast the precise details of the market
demand and cost for a technologically successful innovation ‚Äì implies that it will be difficult for start-up innovators to meaningfully rank the
potential of alternative commercialization paths in terms of their relative long-term profit potential.
between control and execution? Consider a start-up who is considering a market segment size
choice, ùúé < 1, where the net returns each period are ùúé ‚àí ùëê(ùúé) where c is an increasing and convex
function of s.   s both determines the size of the (served) market each period, and impacts the
per-period cost of market operation (since serving a larger market is more expensive at an
increasing rate). As well, suppose that the choice of s impacts the cost of implementing an
execution-oriented approach: e is also an increasing function of s; in other words, with a broader
market segment, the start-up faces a higher cost of effort to maintain dynamic capabilities that
forestall imitative entry and allow for a higher chance of taking advantage of follow-on innovation
opportunities (ùõΩ). Now contrast that with how the cost structure associated with implementing a
control-oriented strategy is influenced by market size. The costs of control ‚Äì such as the costs of
obtaining effective formal intellectual property protection or the costs of designing a product in
such a way as to make imitative competition and follow-on innovation more difficult (e.g., by
establishing proprietary technical interfaces) ‚Äì are largely independent of the size of the market
being served. At the same time, the ability to use control over a design and customer base in the
current generation as a means for deterring follow-on innovation competition in subsequent
generations is likely enhanced (at least on the margin) when the start-up serves more customers
initially. In other words, a is a function is s with ùõº J ùúé ‚â• 0; that is, the larger the share of
customers you acquire, the easier it is to defend your market leadership as the next generation
technology arises.
  The resulting optimization problem for the start-up establishes complementarity between market
size and the choice of appropriability regime.
Proposition 2. Suppose that ùëí J ùúé > 0 and ùõº J ùúé ‚â• 0. Let ùúé ‚àó (ùë†) be the optimal customer share
of the entrepreneur under ùë† ‚àà {ùê∏ùëãùê∏, ùê∂ùëÇùëÅ}, respectively. Then ùúé ‚àó ùê∏ùëãùê∏ < ùúé ‚àó ùê∂ùëÇùëÅ .

     PROOF: To see this, note that in a period where control is chosen the optimal share is
     determined by:
                   ùëöùëéùë•Z {‚àíùê∂ + 1 ‚àí ùúÜ(1 ‚àí ùõº(ùúé) ùõø ùúé ‚àí ùëê ùúé + ùë£2.3 ‚àí ùúÜùõº ùúé ùõøùê∂}
     This gives a first order condition:
               ùúÜùõº J ùúé ùõø ùúé ‚àí ùëê ùúé + ùë£2.3 ‚àí ùê∂ + 1 ‚àí ùúÜ(1 ‚àí ùõº(ùúé) ùõø 1 ‚àí ùëê J ùúé = 0
     Note that, as the first term is positive, this implies that 1 ‚â§ ùëê‚Ä≤(ùúé ‚àó ùê∂ùëÇùëÅ) (holding with
     equality if ùõº J ùúé = 0).
     For a period where execution is chosen, the optimal share is determined by:
                    ùëöùëéùë•Z {‚àíùê∂ + ùúé ‚àí ùëê ùúé ‚àí ùëí(ùúé) + 1 ‚àí ùúÜ(1 ‚àí ùõΩ ùõøùë£/:/ ‚àí ùúÜùõΩùõøùê∂}
     This gives a first order condition: 1 ‚àí ùëê J ùúé = ùëí J ùúé which implies that 1 > ùëê‚Ä≤(ùúé ‚àó ùê∏ùëãùê∏ ).
     Recalling that c is convex completes the proof.
                                                                                                                                                       9



   Intuitively, the efficacy of control is enhanced if the venture secures a larger customer base
whereas the reverse is true for execution. Thus, we expect to see an execution strategy associated
with a smaller initial customer base upon launch than a control strategy; recalling that in the latter
case, product launch comes later.6

                                                                   B. Technology

   A second domain for strategic choice on the part of a start-up innovator is whether to bring an
early-stage version of their product to market in order to receive customer feedback before
undertaking subsequent R&D investment or whether to ensure that the first product in the
marketplace achieves a high level of functionality and reliability. For example, proponents of the
‚Äúlean start-up‚Äù methodology emphasize the importance of bringing a ‚Äúminimum viable product‚Äù
(MVP) to market to gain customer feedback and avoid costly investments and delayed product
introductions (Ries, 2010).
   To see how this choice of whether to release a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù version of a product interacts with the
choice between control versus execution, consider an alternative to our baseline model where the
entrepreneur can forego paying the fixed product development cost C, and instead immediately
come to market with an ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù that involves a lower value for each consumer, ùë¢]^_ < 1, and a
higher per-period cost of serving the market, ùëê]^_ > ùëê. To ensure that an investment in execution
remains a viable strategy, assume that ùë¢]^_ ‚àí ùëê]^_ > ùëí. Finally, assume that the start-up cannot
rank the long-term profitability of alternative commercialization paths (i.e., ùõº = ùõΩ). The start-up
innovator, therefore, faces the simultaneous choice between control and execution and a choice
between an MVP or traditional product development approach:
Proposition 3. Suppose that ùõº = ùõΩ. Choosing an MVP is a complement to execution and a
substitute to control.

       PROOF: Note that the return to execution versus control (under MVP) is:
                           ùë¢]^_ ‚àí ùëê]^_ ‚àí ùëí            1 ‚àí ùúÜ 1 ‚àí ùõº ùë¢a^_ ‚àí ùëê]^_
                                                 ‚àíùõø
                        1‚àí 1‚àíùúÜ 1‚àíùõΩ ùõø                      1‚àí 1‚àíùúÜ 1‚àíùõº ùõø
       While under ‚Äòright‚Äô the relative return to execution is:

     It is important to note that this result is deliberately simplified. It may well be that the set of customers targeted has broader impacts than just
on e and a as assumed here. However, these two effects are likely to be more general and hence, be a driver of the choice and worth highlighting.
                  1 ‚àí ùúÜ 1 ‚àí ùõΩ (1 ‚àí ùëê ‚àí ùëí) ‚àí ùúÜùõΩùê∂             1‚àíùúÜ 1‚àíùõº        1 ‚àí ùëê ‚àí ùúÜùõºùê∂
              ùõø                                      ‚àíùõø
                     1‚àí 1‚àíùúÜ 1‚àíùõΩ ùõø                             1‚àí 1‚àíùúÜ 1‚àíùõº ùõø
   An MVP will be a complement with execution if the relative return to execution rises when an
   MVP is chosen. This happens if:
                    ùë¢]^_ ‚àí ùëê]^_ ‚àí ùëí ‚àí ùõø 1 ‚àí ùúÜ 1 ‚àí ùõΩ 1 ‚àí ùëê ‚àí ùëí + ùúÜùõΩùê∂
                      > 1 ‚àí ùúÜ 1 ‚àí ùõº ùõø ùë¢]^_ ‚àí ùëê]^_ ‚àí 1 ‚àí ùëê + ùúÜùõºùê∂
                                      ‚áí ùë¢]^_ ‚àí ùëê]^_ > ùëí
   which is assumed to be true. The substitution result is the symmetric dual of this result.

Put simply, both an execution-oriented appropriability strategy and an MVP-oriented product
development strategy prioritize early introduction to the marketplace at the expense of the
establishment of long-term competitive advantage. Control involves a higher degree of patience
because of the delays associated with its implementation, and this is complementary to a product
development approach that focuses on ‚Äúgetting the product right.‚Äù

                                              C. Identity

A final area to consider is how the appropriability strategy of the start-up depends on the personal
characteristics ‚Äì the identity ‚Äì of the founding team. In our simple model, a number of parameters,
such as the opportunity cost of time borne by the start-up to actually engage in execution, the costs
of being able to navigate complex business activities that might be associated with control, or even
the innovator‚Äôs discount rate, are likely to depend not simply on characteristics of the technology
and market, but on the identity of the innovators themselves. For example, each of these costs are
likely different for a young recently graduated engineering student (who might face a low cost of
their own time but not be familiar with complex business processes due to a lack of experience),
versus a more seasoned innovator such as a serial entrepreneur or established faculty member.
Under these conditions, for a given innovation, execution will have higher returns for younger and
less experienced founders while control will have relatively high returns for more senior and
experienced innovators. In Ching, Gans and Stern (2017), we draw out the logic of this
comparative static by focusing on a sample of innovations that result from academic publications
jointly authored by faculty and students that result in a start-up firm, and establish that while
faculty-led start-ups are more heavily oriented towards formal intellectual protection, student-led
start-ups are more timely in terms of their speed from initial publication to firm founding, first
funding, and first product introduction.

                                          V. Conclusion

  Our objective has been simply to raise the prospect that the realized appropriability regime
governing an innovation depends not only on the instruments available to an innovator to protect
private returns, but how those instruments interact with each other as part of the firm‚Äôs
entrepreneurial strategy. This approach stands in contrast to most research in economics and
strategy (starting with Teece, 1986, but including our own) that has taken the appropriability
regime governing an innovation to be an exogenous feature of the technological and market
environment. Control and execution are not simply two mechanisms for appropriability, but can
be strategic substitutes, and so start-up innovators will choose between them as they consider how
to commercialize their innovations. Of course, appropriability may only be possible for certain
innovations if one invests in both control and execution; this would result in a complementarity
between the two instruments (Ching, Gans and Stern (2017) find evidence for substitutability
among academic entrepreneurs). In the case where start-ups do face the choice between control
and execution, this choice interacts in natural and potentially testable ways with other elements of
the firm‚Äôs entrepreneurial strategy (Gans, Stern, and Wu; 2016; Ching, Gans, and Stern, 2017).
Exploring how these complementarities and interdependencies play out in practice, and how start-
up innovators choose (or not) among alternative routes for the commercialization of innovation
seems likely a promising avenue for further research.
