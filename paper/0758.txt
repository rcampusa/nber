                           Capital Gains Taxation in an Economy
                                with   an "Austrian Sector"

                                         ABSTRACT


        This paper examines the effects of a proportional capital gains
 tax in an economy with an Austrian sector (with wine and trees) and an
 ordinary sector. We analyze the effect of capital gains taxation (on both
 an accrual and a realization basis) on the efficiency with which resources
 are used within the Austrian sector. Since time is the only input which
 can be varied in the Austrian sector this amounts to looking at the effect
 of capital gains taxation on the harvesting time or selling time of assets.
 Accrual taxation decreases the selling time of Austrian assets. Realiza-
 tion taxation decreases the selling time of some Austrian assets and leaves
 it unchanged for others. Inflation further reduces the selling time of
 assets taxed on an accrual basis; often, but not always, inflation increases
 the selling time of Austrian assets taxed on a realization basis. These
results suggest that the capital gains tax can reduce the holding period
of an asset. However, there is a sense in which such taxes (at least when
levied on a realization basis)
                               discourage transactions and increase holding
periods. It is never profitable to change the ownership of an Austrian
asset   between the time   of
                          the original investment and the ultimate harvesting
of the asset for final use. We examine the
                                            effect of capital gains taxa-
tion on the efficiency of the allocation of investment between sectors.
No neutrality principles emerge when ordinary investment income is taxed
at the same rate as capital gains income.
     We also analyze the effect of the special tax treatment of capital
gains at death and find that the current U.S. tax system, under which
capital gains taxes are waived at death, encourages investors to hold
assets longer than they otherwise would.

  I.     Introduction

         This paper examines the effects of a simple capital gains tax   in   an

 economy with an Austrian sector and an ordinary sector. In the ordinary

 sector the investment process is simple and straightforward; an investment

 of a dollar produces a stream of returns in the future. Assets in the

 Austrian sector do not yield a stream of services. They increase in

 value as they age; when they are harvested this growth stops. The stan-

 dard examples of Austrian investments are wine and trees, and we shall

 use these terms to refer to two different kinds of Austrian assets. Trees

are assets which require scarce resources ——    i.e.,   ones which earn rents ——

while     they age. In considering when to cut down a tree it is important

to take account of the fact that the land on which a tree now stands

can be used to grow another tree once its present occupant is felled.

Wine, in distinction, uses no scarce resources as it matures; the casks

and cellars in which wine ages earn no rents.

       We focus on the effects of capital gains taxation on Austrian invest-

ments for two reasons. First, the effects are simple and straightforward.

We are able to obtain exact expressions for the effect of capital gains

taxes on the allocatjTon of investment between sectors and for the efficiency

of resource use within the Austrian sector. We extend some of this analysis

to the case where the death of the investor (which has significant tax

consequences    in the U.S.) is uncertain.1


       In an earlier version of this paper, we also considered the effect of
       uncertainty about the growth of Austrian assets; since the main conclusion
       of that exercise was that considering uncertainty did not change the
       character of our results, we have drop?ed it from our paper.
    Secondly, a capital gains tax    affects   the timing of transactionS.

With Austrian assets these effects have real, easily—understood con-
                                                theoretical,2 have,

implicitly or explicitly, focused on the effect of capital gains taxa-

that capital gains taxes should, at least in an inflationary world,
                                      inhibiting the sale of stocks and
operate as a kind of turnover tax,

losses have been incurred. Constantinides

Scholes (1980) have shown just how appealing the strategy of realizing

losses and never selling gains can be when well—organized futures

markets with low transactions costs exist. Feldstein, Sleinrod, and

Yitzhaki (1980), Feldstein and Slemrod (       1978), and Feldstein and
                                            that this theory is correct ——
Yitzhaki (1978) have presented evidence
                                           inhibit the sale of assets whose
that   the capital gains tax does indeed
                                    were purchased. It is not clear, at
prices have increased since they

                                assets. ile it seems quite likely that

the volume of transactions has some

allocation of investment, to our kno1edge, no one has framed a theory

which will allow us to deLer the preferred volume of transactions.

Without such a theory one cannot say whether discouraging transactions

is good or bad.

2Lippn and McCall (1980) is a significant e:ception.
      Our analysis assumes that capitaa gains taxes fall only on Austrian

 assets. Thus we can only analyze the effect of the capital gains tax

on Austrian assets. The ordinary sector is in our model for two reasons;

first, we assume that it is sufficiently large that the after—tax rate

of return ——   which in our simple model is the social discount rate ——
is   determined outside of the Austrian sector and is independent of the

rate and form of the capital gains tax. Secondly, having an ordinary

sector allows us to examine the effect of capital gains taxation on the

allocation of resources between Austrian and other investments.

      We summarize our results as follQws. Section I sets out the basic model

and analyzes the effects of capital gains taxation on Austrian investments.

Our partial equilibrium model assumes that the total amount of investment is

fixed. Taxation, in particular the capital gains tax, can affect economic

efficiency in two quite different ways. First taxes can affect the flow of

investment between sectors. The intersectoral allocation of investment is

efficient when the present discounted value of all returns —— public and

private —— from a dollar of investment is the same in all sectors. We find

that when income in the ordinary sector is taxed at rate       and capital gains

in the Austrian sector are taxed at rate T, this equality is unlikely to

hold, even if T =   T       In particular, when tax rates in the sectors are equal,
                        0
Austrian investments have lower total returns than ordinary investments.

     While not without interest, this cornparison is quite artificial. A

major accomplishment of recent research on the ta::ation of capital has

been the demonstration that T is an axtraordinarilv
                                                  - conplicated beast.
                                 0

As the endproduct of the complex interaction of nan provisions of the

tax law,     cannot be identified with anything so sn-1e as the corporate
income tax. ThuE it is hard to conceive of a realistic tax change

which could set T     = T.
                  0
    Another   effect of capital gains taxation is on the allocation of

resources within a sector. For Austrian investments, the resource whose

use can be varied is time; we find that the capital gains tax leads to

inefficiencies within the wine sector by encouraging wine to be sold

more quickly than it would be in the absence of taxation. This does not

hold for some tree investments. If investment opportunities are stationary,

and if there is no inflation, cutting time is independent of T and capital

gains taxation introduces no distortions. If conditions are not stationary,

or if there is inflation, taxes affect cutting time in a complicated way.

     These results were obtained for taxation on a realization basis.

 Accrual taxation introduces different distortions. When T      T0 total
 returns   from Austrian investments (both wine and trees) can be greater

 or less than returns from ordinary investments.    For a given rate of

 taxation, selling time (again for wine and trees) is less under accrual

 taxation than under realization taxation. We have made comparisons of taxation

 at equal rates rather than equal yields because such comparisons are simpler.

 However, as Stiglitz (1981) has shown, the problem of calculating the effective

 yield of a capital gains tax is sufficiently complex that it seems no good case

 can be made for the proposition that comparisons of taxes which have equal

 yields are more meaningful than comparisons of taxes which have equal rates.

      Our model produces no strong a priori case for the greater efficiency of

 accrual taxation. Our examination of the effects of inflation in Section II

 strengthens the case for realization as opposed to accrual taxation. Although

there are exceptions, on balance inflation (at least rapid inflation) tends to

alleviate the distortions caused by taxation on a realization basis while it
                                          5



 complicates, sometimes exacerbating and sometimes alleviating the distortions

 caused by accrual taxation.

      In Section III we show how the
                                         analysis is changed by
  taking account of the special ways in which capital gains are, or could be

  taxed, at death. We show how the present United States tax system, which

  allows automatic step up of basis at death, encourages' people to hold

 on to assets longer than they would otherwise. Since the tax system leads

 them to sell wine sooner than they should, at least for wine        this

 corrects (and possibly overcorrects) a distortion of the tax system.

     Much previous work on capital gains taxation has focused on the way

 in which capital gains taxes tend to inhibit transactions and to encourage

 investors to hold assets ——    at   least assets which are growing in value ——

 longer   than they otherwise would. Our analysis suggests that the effects

 are diverse and complicated. The results suiamarized above showed that

 the capital gains tax could sometimes shorten, sometimes lengthen, and

sometimes leave unchanged the length of time the owner of an Austrian

asset would wait before he harvested it. However, we did obtain one result

which shows that the capital gains tax discourages transactions in Austrian

assets. In Proposition 3 below we show that the owner of an Austrian asset who

is subject to capital gains taxation on a realization basis will never

sell it to another interediate producer. He       will   always nake higher

profits by holding on to wine until it is sold to the consicaer.      Although
Proposition 3 is stated for wine, it also clearly holds for trees. Thus

the capital gains tax acts as a kind of tu:ncver or transaction tax on

Austrian assets and as such prornotes vertical integration in industries

which use ,ustrian processes.
       We have sacrificed a great deal of reality to keep our models simple

and tractable. The capital gains tax is proportional and everyone pays

the same rate. We ignore the complexities and arbitrage opportunities

which are encouraged by progressive taxatian at different rates.3

We also ignore the arbitrage opportunities which the options market

permits. Constantinides (1980) and Constantinide-s and Scholes (1980)

have argued th.at by using the options imarket, investors can avoid ever

realizing capital gains. Sales of assets (which are taxable events) are

dominated by the purchase and sale of options (based on the asset's

future   value) which can be written   in   such a way   that   taxes are   avoided

or    deferred. This argent loses some of its force in an Austrian model.
Assets must be sold eventually or the tree rots or the wine goes bad.
Row the existence of an active options market      would    affect our results
is an interesting question which we have not examined.
     We have also assumed that investors have a very simple goal.              They

maximize the present discounted value of wealth. We assume a constant
discount rate of r. When we treat uncertainty we assume that investors
are risk neutral so that they maximize the expected present discounted
vue of wealth. Thus we ignore both risk aversion and portfolio effects.
We make this choice for two reasons. First, it's what we can do. Second,
while it is not fol1y difficult to introduce risk aversion into me

 of our   models,   we are    uncertain as    to   how to interpret    the   results.

Suppose   an investor's portfolio contains assets which will be harvested
at different dates; risk aversion is not adequately treated by assuming
the same concave function values wealth received at                each date. To handle

risk aversion a more       complex model — presumably one with consumption —
is   needed. A further simplification is obtained by our treatment                 of death.
We assume that      investors   place   the   same   value   on wealth which their heirs

realize   as on   the   wealth they receive if they harvest          an asset.

the calculations.

I. The Basic Model


A. The Ordinary Sector

      A dollar invested in the ordinary sector yields a constant stream of gross

returns y. We abstract from the entangling detail of the real world by

assuming a simple proportional tax. Thus, after tax returns are y(l — T0)

where      is the tax rate in the ordinary sector. The tax rate             cannot be

identified with any single parameter of the tax code such as the corporate

profits tax. Auerbach (1979) and others have analyzed the complex ways in

which the provisions of the tax la combine to produce                 If the stream of
returns is not constant, -r0 is even more complicated.


      1. The After Tax Rate of Return.

          We define the after tax rate of return r as the solution to

                                           —rs
(1)                    1= fy(l—T)e ds.
                              0

Thus, y =   r/(l   -
                       T0).       Since r is the rate of return available in the

ordinary sector in a competitive economy it is the rate which all investors

will use to discount all future benefits. In a complete model r will be

determined by the interaction between tastes (particularly time preference),

technology and endowments. In this paper we analyze the effects of changes

in parameters, particularly tax parameters, which do not affect the ordinary

sector. Since these parameters shifts leave r unchanged, we can use r to

assay the effects of such changes on economic efficiency.
         2. Gross Returns and the Value of Investment.

               If government revenues are used efficiently ——        or if, equiva-
  lently, proceeds of taxation are returned to taxpayers — a dollar of tax -

  revenue collected at time t         is worth   e_t. Thus the taxes collected from

  an investment       project   yielding a stream of returns y( ) have a present

  discounted value of I y(s) Tersds which, because of (1), is equal to

  T/(l —      T).    Thus a dollar invested in the ordinary sector produces a

 stream of returns which is worth 1 + T/(l —           T)   = (1 —        dollars   when

 both private benefits and the value of tax benefits are considered. The

 fact that a dollar of investment produces more than a dollar's worth of

 benefits, can lead to complications. Anything that increases             savings   and

 investment     increases welfare. If proceeds of investment are reinvested they
 are worth more than if they are consumed. By positing mechanical rules for
 reinvesting proceeds of investment projects, we could derive alternative
 formulae for       valuing dollars of investment. Our concern in this paper is

 with valuing investments in different sectors and it does not           seem worth-
while    to   follow this line of analysis, at laast in part because to follow
 it we would need to assume that the allocation of investment between sectors
was also fixed mechanically. Another way of aking the same point is to
say that we are assuming that the total an:nt cf investment is fixed. Given
this we examine the efficiency of the allocstfon of resources to investment,
both   within and between sectors.


B. Austrian Sectors

       In the economy there are also Anstrn n.'estnent opportunities.

Austrian investments are point input1 tsfnt                 prs. An investment
  at an initial time

  the
                          to produces an asset which has   a   value of X(t —   t)   if
         asset is harvested and used for consumption at time t.


         1.    Wine and Trees.


               We consider two kinds of Austrian
                                                   production processes. In the
  first, and simpler, an initial investment produces an asset which increases

  in value as it ages. We call the
                                        output of this process wine. The other
  Austrian output, a tree, is distinguished from wine by the fact that it

 uses a scarce resource, land, as it ages. When a tree is felled, another

 can be planted in its place. When iine is drunk, the bottle in which it has

 matured      is discarded. We need terms to describe the time when an Austrian

 asset's maturation is terminated and it is consumed. For trees "cutting

 time" seems appropriate. For wine we shall call this time "selling time."
 This usage is justified in Proposition 3, below where it is shown that the
capital gains tax discourages transfers of wine before it is consumed.
Since the argument of Proposition 3 can be adapted to trees, we shall also
occasionally use selling time to refer to trees and wine together.

     2. Values and Rates of Return Without Taxes.
              Suppose that there are no taxes in the Austrian sector. In equili-
brium assets invested in the Austrian sector must earn a rate of return
equal to r. If they ear-ri a rate of return greater than r, the value of
resources used to produce wine will be bid up until the rate of return is
       just r. If B is the value or price of resources used to produce wine
      which has    a value of X(t) when sold or harvested after            t   years,
                 B = max e —rtx(t).



      We will define t as       the solution to   this maximization problem.
           In   equilibrium, scarce resources in the other Austrian sector (trees)

      also earn the competitive rate of return, but since the scarce resource,

     land, is not used to produce trees but
                                                       to provide a place for them to
     mature, the analysis is slightly different.

           If trees can be planted at cost
                                                  F, the present discounted value of a
     plot of land which can support one tree
                                                       forever is, if trees are harvested
     at intervals of length u, and if the value of a tree of age u is V(u),


     (2)     L(u) =     —P   + (V(u) — F)   e + (V(u) —      P)e2'     +

                    =   —P   + (V(u)    P) (e -   1)-i.

 The optimal cutting period u is chosen to maximize L(u); if used in the

 Austrian sector this plot of land has a value of L(u). If used in the

 ordinary sector it has an alternative value, say L. It is used in the

Sector in which it has           the   higher value.




C.     Capital   Gains Taxes, Realization.

             In this section we analyze the
                                                   effects of capital gains taxes which
are    levied on a realization basis. In the next            section   we analyze the
effects of capital gains taxes levied on a accrual basis.
            1. Wine.

                  Consider an investment in vine which if harvested and sold at time

    t,    will   yield X(t). If the wine initially costs B, capital gains are

    [X(t) —      B).     If capital gains are taxed when realized at rate T                      net    proceeds

    are


                  (x(t) —      B)(l   —   T) +   B =     x(t)(l   — T)   + TB.

    The cutting time is chosen to maximize the present discounted value of these

net proceeds. In equilibrium investments earn                              the   competitive rate of return

so that B satisfies.


(3)              B = Max       e_t[X(t)(l —         T)   + TB) = e_rt*[X(t*)(l_T)          + TB)
                         t
where the selling time t maximizes the present discounted value of the
investor's after tax profits. In interpreting (3) it should be kept in mind
that r, T and X( ) are parameters while B and t are chosen to satisfy (3).
If r and XC )            are   held constant B and t              are    functions of T.    B is the value


of the investment opportunity represented by X( ).                               If   the real   cost   of the

resources       used to produce X( ) cost less than B then these resources will
be       used to produce wine; conpetition will cause the value of these resources
to rise to B. If they coEt nore than B, the wine which has the value
stream x(         )    will not be produced.
          The present disconte value of the total returns to an investment of
B   dollars in wine            is   X(t)e

 Let ci denote the present discounted value of the return to one dollar

 invested in wine. Then

                           _rt*
             cx    (1—Te       )/(l—T).


A dollar invested in the ordinary sector produces returns with a total dis-

counted value of (l—T0). The reason why these formulae differ is easy to

understand. Considered solely in terms of costs and returns on invest-

ment ine     is   like an ordinary investment which requires an initial

investment of B and returns X(t), t             periods   later when it is sold• If

it were taxed as an ordinary investment, the tax base would be X(t), tax

revenues would be TX(t) and the total return from a dollar's worth of invest—

ment   would be (l—T) —1 .        Since investments in wine are taxed as

capital gains the tax base is not X(t) but X(t) — B.               We summarize this

discussion in


Proposition 1: The present discounted value of total returns from a dollar

invested in wine is less than the present discounted value of total returns

from a dollar invested in the ordinary sector if and only if

                _rt*
(4)        (l—Te     )/(l—-r)     <   (l—) —1

     There is a slight, and inessential, technical difference. In order to
     use continuous time we assume that returns from ordinary investments are
     flows while returns from Austrian investments are stocks.

        If   r -   T, then returns to investments in the ordinary sector are greater
than returns           to investments in wine. If i > T 0,    then returns to investments

in wine may or may not be greater than returns to ordinary investments.

Since different kinds of wines may have different selling times (different

t*) it is quite possible that some wine investments may have greater and

some lesser total social returns than ordinary investments. In interpreting

the condition T <              it is well to keep in mind what a complicated parameter

T
 0
      is.
        The value of B determines the allocation of resources to the wine

sector. As B increases more resources are devoted to the production of

wine. Whether or not this increases or decreases economic              well—being

depends on (4). In contrast, the parameter t determines the efficiency
with which resources in the wine sector are used. The value of all

resources devoted to wine grows according to the function X( ).              Since   the
social discount rate is r, the wine            should   be allowed to mature until £
where   £    maximizes.ertX(t).         Assuming, as we shall, that x'(t)/X(t) is a

decreasing function, £          is   the unique solution to

                   A      A
(5)           X'(t)/X(t) =     r.
       However, the selling time for wine, t*, is chosen to maximize

private return not social return; t satisfies not (5) but (3), thus t

must satisfy


(6)          X' (t*)/X(t*) =    r(l +
This establishes

     Proposftion2:        t   <   t.
          In   interpreting this proposition it should be remembered that while

     each wine investment may have a different
                                                            socially optimal selling
     time £ and a different privately optimal selling time t*, for all such

     investments the privately optimal time is too short.                 Were it to increase,

     the resources allocated to the wine sector would be used more efficiently

     and the present discounted value of the output of the wine sector would

     increase. Like proposition 1, proposition 2 is a consequence of the form

  of   capital gains taxation. If wine were taxed as                ordinary income the after

  tax return would be X(t)(l—T) and t*would be chosen to maximize (lT)X(t)e_'t

  so t would equal 1.

         A high basis increases the value of an asset subject to capital gains

 taxation. it is conceivable that this effect could be strong enough to

 encourage turnover of assets like wine. Working against this is the fact

 that capital gains taxes are also turnover taxes and thus they inhibit

 transactions. We show in Proposition 3 that this latter effect dominates.


 Proposition 3. No wine is sold before                it   is consumed.


Proof: Suppose first that the basis is 0. In this case the wine will be

consumed at the same time as it would be were there no tax. The value of

holding the wine to maturity is


                   = Max e_rtX(t) (l—T)          = (l—T) Max e_rtX(t) = (l—T)W°.
                      t                                     t
If    the person sells the asset iediately for a price S he                 will net, after
taxes, only (l—)S. Thus he will                 bebetter off selling only if S(l—T) >
(l—T)W°   or if   S > W°.         oever,   it    is sy to see that no person facing the
capital           tax will pa;.' Dore than W0 to buy the asset. A             prospective
buyer is viliThz to pay only S where S is a solution to

                            _rt*

or


            S =   e_t*X(t*)                       < e1X(t*) < Max e_rtX(t).
                                   l_Tett


If the basis is B, then wT(B) > W(O) so a sale would have to realize

even more than         for it to be preferable to holding the asset until

maturity. This argument considers a sale only at time t = 0, but it

obviously generalizes to sales at other times. This proof depends heavily

on our assumption that all investors face the same                    capital   gains tax.

        The capital gains tax       affects   both the allocation of wine between

sectors, through B, and the efficiency with which resources in the wine

sector are used, through t. The signs of these effects are determinate.


Proposition 4: Both B and           t   are decreasing functions of T.


Proof: 1) Let G(B, T, t) =              et(X(t)(l — ')           + TB) ;



              (B, T) = argmax G(B, T, t) and H(B, T) = G(B, T, i (B, T))
                                                                                                  —   B.

                                                           But H1 = C1 + C3         — 1 =         — 1 =
In    equilibrium H(B, T)      =              —        .                                     C1


I    exp(—r(B, T)) —      1   < 0. The second step follows from the envelope theorem,


     C3(B, T, (B,
                    1))       0. Similarly
                                                                   -LI

 Thus letting t = 4'(B,                                    -
                                          T),

       2) To calculate dt*/dT we note that B is a function of T                                  and    that

t maximizes F(t, T) =                   et        (X(t )(1 — T)             + TB(T)) so that t* must    satisfy


(8)      0 =
                F1(t*,        T)   = —rF          + ertXt(t*)(l               —   T).
                    F
      dt*            12
Thus, a— = —        i—        and,      since F11 < 0 by the second order conditions for
                     11
maximizing F with respect to t,                           it   follows that sign dt*/dT =      sign    F12.
But using (3), (7) and (8) we have                             that


          F12 = —rF2 —             ertX?(t*)

     Proposition 4      indicates         that the     effects of increasing the                 capital gains
     tax   on economic efficiency are complex. If inequality (4)                                 holds   —— as it

  will whenever I <                  —-   then   increasing T improves efficiency by diverting
  funds from the vine sector into the ordinary sector (dB/dt < 0) the effi-
 ciency of      the resources used in the wine sector will decrease as increasing

 taxes causes wine to be harvested sooner                             than it should be (dt*/dT < 0).

           2. Trees.

               The analysis for trees is much simpler. As Lippman and McCall

 (1980) have observed, the optimal cutting time u* is                                 independent of the
 rate      at which a proportional capital gains tax is levied. We model the

 elf   ect   of the capital gains tax by assuming the owner                            of   a tree pays a tax on

 the increase in the tree's value from P, its initial cost, to V(u). Thus,

assuming he plants another tree, his after tax cash flow at time u is

 (V(u) —     P)(1   —   T) + P —      P =    (V(u)     —
                                                            P)(l      —   j). Thus    (2) is changed to


(9)           L(u) =    —P   + e((V(u) —               P)(l       — T)     + p — p)

                             + e_r2u (V(u) —               P)(l   — T) +


                             =   —        + V(u)            (1 — T)
                                                   —   1

                                                   V(u) — P
      that u is chosen to                                                                   T.
so                                    maximize
                                                       e—         i       independent of


        it   is worth noting that this does                   not hold for all tree investments;

it is a consequence of the assumption that invesent opportunities in the

tree   sector are stationary. If a plot                       of land will support a sequence of
  trees each        associated. with a planting cost P. and a potential value stream
  VI,   the sequence of cutting tznes                    {u)    (u1, u2 ...)
                                                                                     will   be chosen to iiiaximize


                  L{u} =          + e'1[(V1(u) —                     — T) + (P1 —
                            —p1                            P1)(l

                                                                         P2)(l                  P3)]
                                                                                 r
                                  = —P1   + E (exp         —

                                  + (P1 -

 The optimal sequence {u*} will be independent of T if and —— for all practical

 purposes ——        only    if P1 = P for all i. If the sequence of planting costs is

 not stationary T will affect the efficiency of resource use in the tree sector.


 Proposition 6: If planting costs are constant,tlu*} = {uJ-.


          analysis of total return in the tree sector has elements of the
        The

 analysis in the ordinary sector and of the analysis in the wine sector. To
deal with the non—stationary case we analyze total returns from one cycle of
investment. Total investment is land withdrawn from production for u periods
and the planting cost P. Total after tax returns are (V(u) —                                   P)(l—T)        P

Thus, we have, in equilibrium.

              L(l—e') +           P =   (V(u)   -   P) (l—T)        er + Pe'

Solving    for total return we obtain
                       —ru= L(u)(l—e1) +
           V(u)e                      1 — T

A dollar   of investment thus brings total returns equal to

              1    -    T    —ru                P

     position 7. The present discounted value of total returns from a dollar

     invested in the tree sector is 16 where u is the cutting time of the

     tree and 6 is the ratio of planting Costs to total investment costs.


         C. Accrual Taxation

               It is sometimes asserted that many of the distortions and ineffi-

 ciencies which the capital gains           tax   causes are due to the fact that      capital
 gains are taxed on a realization basis; if taxation were on an accrual basis

 these distortions would disappear. We examine             this   claim by analyzing the
 effect of accrual taxation on the efficiency of allocation of resources

 between and within investment sectors. Our model does not support the

proposition that          accrual   taxation is to be preferred on efficiency grounds.

Accrual taxation introduces distortions different from, and in some cases

greater than,       the   distortions caused by realization taxation. While some

parameter      values may favor      accrual taxation, one cannot make    a   strong

apori case for it —— at least using the model of this paper. If anything
the evidence ses to run the other way. We observed above that in the
stationary case taxation on a realization basis does not affect the cutting
time of trees. We will see in Proposition 10 below that the cutting time
of   trees is a decreasing function of the rate of accrual taxation.


        1. Wine

           We begin our analysis      by noting that the effect of accrual taxation
on   wine is   to   force investors to behave as if their discount rate were r/ (l—T)
rather than r; furtheroore, trees taxed on an accrual basis will be cut
down sooner than when taxed on a realization basis at the sane rate.
       Proposition 8.

              If taxed on an accrual basis
                                                at rate T, wine with a growth path of X( )

                                        is the harvesting time when wine is

      realization basis at rate T.

     Proof:

       1) The key to the proof is our assumption that taxes are levied on in—
  creases in the market value of the wine. That is, if W(t) is the value of
  the wine at time t, increases in W(t) must satisfy

  (11)           W(t) =   e_t[W(tLt)(l_T)       + TW(t)J.


  This formula assumes that the investor bought the tree for W(t) in period
 t    and   sold it for W(t+&) in period t+At realizing an after               tax   return of
 (l—T)W(t+4t) +        TW(t);    if
                             is sufficiently small there is no difference
                                       Lt

 between taxation on an accrual basis and taxation on a realization basis.
 Using Taylor series to evaluate the right hand side of (11) and discarding
 all terms of order (t)2 or greater we see that W(t)rt =
                                                           W'(t)(1—T)T or,

                          Wv —   r
                          W      l-T

This    first order differential equation describes the evolution of W(t),
the    value of the tree.         A boundary condition is    that   W(t)   =
                                                                               X(ta)   if the
tree   is cut dow-n at time t. Thus, the
                                                   present discounted value of a tree
taxed on an accrual basis at rate r which will be cut do-n at t Is just

X(ta)e_(r/(l_T))ta. Clearly ta shauld be chosen to axIze this value.
        2) That dta/dt <         0   follows iiinediately from the fact that                          > o.
                                                                                              dT
        3) Let t       be   the cutting time when taxed on a realization basis with
 basis B. Then

          _____ =      r {1 + j+i: X(t*) j <          r     +
                                                                                 J=
                                                      X'(t )
                  = r(l     +           r/(l—T)   =



 Since X'(t)/X(t) is a decreasing function of t, ta <

      We thus see that accrual taxation leads to a more inefficient use of

 resources within the wine sector thar            taxation      on a realization basis at
 the same rate. We note that if T =                the rate which investors use to
discount returns in the wine sector is eoual to the gross or pretax rate

of return in the ordinary section. If T =                       y =   —f-—   .   Define

so that R =   y   =   r/(l-T),   the discount rate used by private investors

facing accrual taxation at rate T in the wine sector. This observation is

of somewhat limited interest as r, not R, is the social rate of discount; it

is not efficient to decide when to harvest wine by using the rate R as a

discount rate.


     Accrual taxation does not lead to the correct allocation of resources

between the wine and the ordinary sector even when I = T
                                                                             0

     Proposition   9


         The present discounted value of a dollar of resources invested in wine

     is exp[rt T/(l—T)].


  Proof:
         Consider one dollar invested in wine
                                                      which goes to produce wine har-
 vested at ta and worth
                                X(ta) at that time. Gross returns are clearly
 X(t)ea. Hower, in               equilibrium the present discounted value of
                                                                (r/(l_T))ta
 after tax returns is equal to one dollar so X(ta) = e

 Substituting, we find gross returns from one dollar are


            exp[t(r/(l—-r) —      r)]   =
                                            exp[rtT/(1—T)].

 Since gross returns are the sum of private returns and the present
                                                            rta T/l—T
 discounted value of taxes paid this latter amount must be e          — 1

 per dollar invested in wine.

        We note that whether the total return from investments in wine are

 greater or less than returns in the ordinary sector depends on whether

                   rt (T/(l—T)) >
 (12)      (l—T)e a                <1

Because ta is a function        of T, the expression on the left hand side of (12)

is   quite complicated to analyze. We give examples in Appendix Il-A which

show that this expreion can be greater or less than 1,            that   it can be

increasing or      decreasing   in I,    and that its limit as i approaches   1   can
be either 0   or .

          2. Trees

               The effects of accrual taxation on trees are also straightforward.

 The analysis of Proposition 8 applies. A tree cut down after u years of

 growth yields an after—tax return with a present discounted value of

V(u)e' T)•                  If planting a tree costs P, a plot of land on which trees

are planted yields returns which are equivalent to the payment of

 V(u)e(T)               —   P   Ut times   0, u, 2u            Thus the value of land is

                         , . —ur/(l—r)

                                1— e—ru

          The optimal cutting time, U,             is   chosen to maximize the right hand side
of (13). It is immediately clear from (13) that Ua is not, as in the
realization case, independent of the rate of capital gains taxation.                          We
                                           du
show in Proposition 10 that                     < 0. The      optimal cutting time   is, as

analyzed above, U.          the rate of capital gains taxation is zero then U
                                If                                                                 =

Thus     accrual taxation leads to trees being cut down too soon.

Proposition 10.
         The optimal cutting time for trees which are taxed on an accrual basis

is   a   decreasing function of the tax            rate.

     If capital gains are taxed on an accrual basis at rate T, the              gross
return to one dollar invested in trees is exp (ruaT/(l_T)).


Proof: To see this, consider again an investment in a single tree. Land
worth L(u a) is used for a period of u and resources worth P are used to
                                     a
                                                                      —(r/(1—T)u
plant the tree. These costs bring  a private return of V(Ua) e      a,
Total returns from these costs are V(u) e a Thus the ratio of total
returns to private returns, which is also in equilibrium the gross return
to an investment of one dollar, is exp (ruaT/(1_T)).
       The discussion following Proposition 9 applies here. Whether the rate
of return to trees taxed on an accrual basis is greater or less        than the

rate   of return in the ordinary sector depends on the nature of the function
                                            27




v(   ).   It   is well known that as P increases to the point where
                                                                    L(Ua) = 0,
Ua converges to ta; that         Ua satisfies V'(Ua)/V(U) =   r/(l—T).   Thus,
the examples of Appendix II.A demonstrate that
                                               (l_T)exp(rua'r/(l_T) can be
increasing or decreasing in T and that lim (lT)exp(ruaT/(1_T)) can be
                                             T1
either 0 or .

 II. Inflation

         A. The Ordinary Sector

               We model inflation in the ordinary sector by assuming that a dollar

 invested   yields a stream of gross returns              y(s)e. The after tax rate

 of   return, ', is now the solution to


 (18)         1 =   f y(s)e(l       —   T)e'8ds.

 If   r is the after tax rate of             ordinary sector without infla-
                                          return in the

 tion, it is straightforward to show that ' = r + r; r + r is the rate
which investors will use to discount all future benefits.
        If goverrnnent revenues are used efficiently a dollar of tax revenue
collected at time s has a present discounted value equal to
Thus, the present discounted value of taxes collected is again l— As
in the case with no inflation, a dollar invested in the ordinary sector
produces a total stream of returns with present discounted value equal
to (l—T).
        B. The Austrian Sectors
              Our analysis of the effects of inSlaton on the Austrian sectors
focuses on the two distortions examined earlier. Table 1 summarizes the
effects of inflation on selling time and value of gross return for wine
and trees under both accrual taxation and taxation on a realization basis.
The details of        the derivation of the entries in Table      1   are tedious and
are   given   in    Appendix II .   Here we surzaarize and explain the results.

       Under accrual taxation, the analysis of the effects of inflation is

 straightforward, but the effects themselves defy simple summary. About all

 that can be said is that inflation complicates —— sometimes exacerbating

 and sometimes alleviating --       the distortions induced by taxation. If the

 inflation rate is ri and the tax rate is T, wine taxed on an accrual basis

 is exactly the same as wine which is untaxed but discounted at a rate
                                                                                    1— T

From (18) inflation can be modeled by assuming that the discount rate rises

to r+n while the nominal value of wine sold at time t equals X(t)eflt. Thus,

wine harvested at time t has a present discounted after tax value of

                           I /       1
                                    ti = X(t) .exp   r (r+flT)   t
         X(t)e11
                   t
                       exp — ir+fl)
                             (l—T)
                           L        J                L   (l—T)


The   selling   time of wine, t, maximizes the expression above. This gives

us the first order condition


          X'(t)
                — r+flT
          x (t)   1—T


The right hand side of this equation is increasing in fl.             Thus, ta is

decreasing in ri.

      The calculation of the present discounted value of gross returns

under inflation is similar to that of Proposition 9, only now the discount

rate r+fl is substituted for r; the gross rate of return is


         exp [(r+fl) taT/(1_Tfli


which, as examples in Appendix II.B show, can be increasing or decreasing in fl.

      Trees are again more complicated than wine but the effects of inflation

are cualitatively the same. The optimal cutting time Ua              satisfies
                                               31



                                                     (r+Tfl)
                        Ua = argrnax

                                                    1 —e




 This is similar to the expression in the case without inflation, (14),
       r+flT
with             substituted for —i-—
       1—i                        1—T
       The proof that        the   optimal cutting time u is decreasing in r is

left to Appendix II.C.              Since V(ua)exp[_(r+flT)/(l_T)Jua and not

V(Ua)exp[_1/(1_T)](ua)is the present discounted after tax rate of return

to investing in trees, the argument used to establish Proposition 11.

also establishes that the gross rate of return to investment in trees

is equal to exp[(r+r)uT/(l—T)]. Again, since Ua                         approaches   ta when
L(ua) --   0,    the examples in Appendix II.B show that this expression can

either   increase or decrease as r increases.

       The analysis of inflation with taxation                   at   realization is somewhat

less straightforward, although the results themselves fit into a simple

pattern. Consider first wine. The present discounted value of the after

tax return from wine with basis B, sold at date t is


(20)       W(t,T,rI) =      e_   +fl)t[X(t)euit(1_T) + TB]


                        =   e_rtX(t) (l—T) +   e_(tTB

The owner of       wine with base B will choose a harvesting time t*(i,n) which
solves

           ax W(t,T,fl)
             t
The first      order condition which t*        must satisfy is


(21)       (t*,T,n)     = e_       r)t*{_rX(t*)eflt*(l_T) —


                            —(rr+r)TB + X'(t*)e
                                                     nt* (1—i))         0
Let W*(T,fl) =          W(t*(T,rl),           T,fl). In equilibrium investments earn a competitive

rate of return so that


(22)       B =   B(T,rl)          =   W*(T,fl)   = Max e_ +n)t{x(t)ent(l_T)            +   TB(T,r) }.



Rearranging,      we find that

Applying    the implicit function theorem to (21)                       we find that



(24)      sign               =    sign[(r4r)t* -        i+iet)t1
At low rates of inflation increases in fl can increase or decrease selling
time, depending on the evolution of x(•).                          In   Appendix II.D we       provide

examples where
                         d   t           is   greater   than,   less   than, and     equal to zero. As
                                  rj=O

r approaches             the problem the owner of wine faces converges to the problem
he would face if his basis 'ere zero and there were no inflation. That
is,
                      —r                 t
          W(t,T, ) = e   X(t)(l—i).

                             -'                                          dt*
Thus,    since tk        < t, for sufficiently large ri,                       >   0, and asymptotically,

increases       in the rate of inflation correct the distortion in                           selling

time    which the capital gains tax causes. Tnis asymptotic behavior is
further il1ustrat by the gross returns on in'esent in vine. A
invesent   of one dollar                        vine y an after ta: retr --h a
present discounted value of
  (25)        e_(r+fl)t* [X(t*)eflt*(l_T)+T]


 if wine is sold at t*. The present discounted value of gross benefits
 generated by this dollar is X(t*)ert. Setting (25) equal to one and

 rearranging we find


 (26)        X(t*)e_rt* = 1 +            [l-.e

 Although     this   is   less than (l—T)
                                            —l
                                             ,   as   i approaches    (26) converges to

 (1—T).    Thus, for large           increases        in   decrease the distortions   of
 the capital gains tax.
        A similar argument shows that inflation increases the present dis-
counted value of gross returns to investments in trees taxed on a
realization basis. If T =          T
                                    0   , inflation reduces the distortion which the
capital      gains tax induces.

        In   contrast to the case of accrual taxation, these results fit into a

simple pattern. Inflation, at least inflation at a rapid rate, reduces the

distortions which a tax on realized capital gains induces. There is a

straightfoard explanation. The distortions which this tax induces stem

from the exclusion of the base value of the asset from the tax base.

Inflation reduces the value and the effect of this exclusion.

     One entry in Table 1 does not fit this neat pattern. With no inflation

trees taxed at realization are cut down at the socially optimal time. As
                                       34




inflation increases, the cutting time        of   trees increases; inflation induces

inefficiency. The proof of this fact is tedious and given in the appendix.

However, there is a simple intuitive explanation. Inflation and taxation

interact to make it appear to the investor that             planting   costs have

increased.       The investor chooses u to maximize



                          [V(u)e(1—T) + TPe — Pe)

             =         e_r[V(u)(l_T)   +    TPe   —
                                                      P].
                 i=1

While in any period he must pay planting Costs of P, when he pays taxes
he can only exclude Pe from his tax base. Effective planting costs
have increased. The natural response is to use less planting by increasing
the time between plantings.

      III. Death and Taxes

            Death complicates. Until 1976, in the United States, when the holder

      of an asset died, the estate
                                          paid no capital gains tax; if the investor's
      heirs sold the asset in the future the basis value of the asset used to

      compute capital gains tax liability was its value on the date of the

     investor's death. From the point of view of the estate, death was equi-

     valent to a sale on the date of death
                                                        which escaped capital gains taxation.
     Although    death may not   have   had much else        to recommend it, it was a dandy

     way to avoid taxes. This system ws changed in 1976, and the U.S. began

     to wove toward a system like that analyzed in Part I in which the heir's

     basis would be the basis of the
                                           original purchaser of the asset.. In 1980,
     this movement stopped; and the U.S. has reverted to the pre—1976 system.

           In this part of the paper we analyze the effect of the capital gains

 tax on the selling time and value of Austrian assets when death alters
                                                                        the way
 in which capital gains are taxed.            Special treatment of capital gains at
 death alters, and in some cases reverses, our conclusions about the effect

 of the capital gains taxes on selling time.

           Let F(t) be the probability that            the owner of wine lives until at
least      period t.   Then F(0) = 1, F(°) =           0   and   F(t)   is   decreasing. For
Simplicity we assume F(t) is differentiable and let f(t) =                        F'(t).
probability       of death is constant then F(t) =               e      and f(t) =   —ye'.
                                                                                           If the

                                                                                                 Let
      be   the rate of capital gains taxation at death. We consider two values
of Td,      Td
                 Q   corresponds to the present U.S. system                     which is known
as    atonatjc step up in basis         or step    up for        short. Under step up, capital
gains      ta::es are avoided at death.
                                                 36




         Another possible treatment of capital gains at death is what is known

 as constructive realization. Under this system the estate is presumed to

 sell the asset at death and to pay tax at the ordinary capital gains rate

 on the gains which the sale realizes. Under constructive realization

       = T.    We compare these two systems to the system analyzed in the last

 part which is referred to as a carryover system.

        If an investor plans to sell an asset at t, the expected present dis-

 counted value of the after tax           proceeds      is


 (27)         J(t) =   e_rtF(t)(X(t)(l_T) +TB) —             f   e_rs(X(s)(l_Td)      + TdB))f(s)ds.


The first term in (27) represents the discounted after tax value he will

 receive if he lives until t. The second term is the discounted after tax

 value which his estate will receive. This formula is not quite correct for

 two reasons. First, the pretax value the estate realizes will in general

be more than X(t) since the value of the asset will exceed X(t). Determining

exactly what this value is seems very difficult. Secondly, in contrast to

the analysis of Section I above, B here is an arbitrary parameter. Although

in principle B should satisfy a zero profit condition, it is hard to write

down this condition for this model because investors'mortality functions will

influence their profits. It is hard to figure out what should be the

"market" mortality function. We think neither of these simplifications will

affect our analysis.

        The planned selling time t is chosen to maximize J(t); t satisfies

  Proposition    12:

        For capital gains taxation           at   the same   rate,   planned selling time   is
  the same under constructive realization as under carryover. Planned cutting

  time is greater under step up.


  Proof:

       Since f(t)      ( 0, this     follows immediately from (28).

          that planned selling time is not the same as actual selling
       Note

 times. Under either step up or constructive realization an investor's heirs
 may plan   to sell an asset at a different time than the original investor

 planned. This is       because the heirs will have a different, higher basis
 which will cause them to plan to sell sooner than the
                                                       original investor.
 They also will have a different mortality function which will, under step

up   also affect their planned selling time. It is easy to see from (27) that
increases in either T or Td will decrease the value of an asset.
     The effects of increases in T on planned selling time are more compli-
cated. Since planned selling time is the same under constructive reali—
zatio.n as under carryover, dt*/dT < 0 in both cases. Under step up dt*/dT
can be either positive or negative. If B = 0, the selling time will be
greater under step up then if there were no taxation so     must be positive.
On the other hand if B is positive and — f(t*) is very snail,    will be
                                         j:t*)
negative -- as It is when f(t*) = 0. For simplicity we have given the
analysis only for the case of wine, a similar analysis for trees shows that

A'(T) = — ie               < 0 and A(1) = 0.

       2. Let X(t) =                                            for d >   4r
                                        i(t—d)    c   >d

Then   t=            d   + (1—T)/r and

                 A(T) =        (1—T)        exp [T(1 + (rd/(1—T))fl.

A(O) =      1;       A'(t) =                  T]exp[T(l     + (rd/(l-T)))] > 0, and

urn A(T)         =

(This example may appear to violate the requirement that X'(t)JX(t) be

decreasing as X'(t)/X(t) is undefined for t< d; however, since

X (t)/X(t) =

X'(t)/X(t) has but a single local maximum.)

  B.

         1.     Let C(ri)         exp [(r+fl)t T/(1—T)J where c satisfies


                 X'(ta)IX(ta) =          (r+Trl)/(1_T).

        Let X(t) =       jit.     Then we know from example 1 of Appendix II.A that

  C(O) < (1—T)1 for T > 0 so that if C'(O) > 0 the distortions induced

  by the capital gains tax are reduced by small increments in the race

  of inflation. For this case, t =
                                                     (l—T)/(r+Tfl);         C(n)   exp [T(r+n)J(r+Tfl)J,
  and C'(fl) =    C(fl)r(l—T)t/(r+Tfl)2             so inflation at low races reduces

 distortions. However, liin C() = e and if                      e > (1—T)' (or if T < .632),
                                   n-3w
 then high rates of inflation more than correct the
                                                    distortions induced by
 the capital gains tax. Increases in inflation beyond the point where

 C(n) =       (1_T)1   increase distortions.


        2. For a more dramatic example of this effect, consider again the

 case where


                                           t<d
                  X(t) =                                for   d >

It is easy to calculate that C'() > 0.                    We showed in example 2 of

Appendix II.A that C(0) > (1—T) so increasing inflation exacerbates

the distortions of the capital gains tax.

                                                                               ut + k
where k >   0.   Then t =               —

 D.

       In   this section, we show that with wine taxed on a realization basis,

 at low rates of inflation an increase in ri can increase or decrease selling

 time. We give examples where                                             is greater than, less than, and
                                               dfl         tl=O
 equal to zero.


      1. Let X(t) =
                               0                  t<d
                                                   —
                                                                     where d > 0.
                                   p(t-d)         t> d

 Then from (21), with n =               0,         1 +
                                              t' = —
                                                   r
                                                       d - ——              TB      and      from (22) and (23)
                                                           1—Tn

 W*(T,0) =         (l—t) e              (l_T)P        .     From (24) this implies that
              r



            sign         = sin[ra                           -      T

 Inserting the condition B = W*(T,0)                            from (22), we see that the right-hand

 side of the above equation equals sign[rd. Since rd >                                         0,   dt*J
                                                                                                           =o >0
      2. Let x(t) =           pt   +   c where c > 0.                      Setting = 0,          (21) implies


 that t = —          c TB

                            from (22) and (23),

                                                                -i+E
                           W*(T,0) = p(l—T) e                        '      (l—T) .i
                                              r
Inserting this value of t into (24) and setting n =                                    0,   we find

                                                                                                    TrB

Setting     B = W*(T,0), the right-hand side of this equation becomes


sign [_2-J•       Thus, if C equals Zero                          dt* I
                                                                               = 0,    while if c is greater
than zero     dt*J         <0.

time, u, is increasing in r.

Rearranging, we find that
