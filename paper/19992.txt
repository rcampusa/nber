Trade, Skills, and Quality Upgrading: A Theory with Evidence from Colombia

                                                ABSTRACT

We develop a model of international trade with heterogeneous firms and endogenous quality choices.
Producing higher quality involves returns to scale, it is intensive in skilled labor and high-quality inputs.
Firms’ quality choices are interrelated because firms sell their goods to consumers and to other firms.
We estimate the model using data on manufacturing plants in Colombia before the trade liberalization,
simulate a counterfactual liberalization and compare the results to post-liberalization data. Like other
unilateral trade liberalizations in developing countries, the skill premium and skill intensity in manufacturing
increased, and the size of firms decreased in Colombia. In the model, lower tariffs lead importers and
exporters to upgrade quality, increasing the domestic demand and supply of high-quality inputs. Other
firms then upgrade their own product quality, thereby amplifying these effects of domestic inputs.
Relative demand for skilled labor increases in a wide range of firms, despite a contraction in sales.

    During the 1980s and 1990s, the numerous developing countries that unilaterally decreased

their trade barriers after decades of import-substitution experienced a broad transformation in

their manufacturing sector: Measured productivity, investment, skill intensity, the quality of

inputs and of outputs all increased while firm size decreased or remained unchanged. Skill

premia typically also rose abruptly by 10% to 20%.1 The rise in demand for skill is particularly

puzzling from the perspective of a standard factor-proportions model. Bilateral trade data sug-

gest that developing countries have a comparative advantage in producing unskill-intensive,

low-quality goods.2 So, a trade liberalization should shift their production toward low-quality

goods and decrease the relative demand for skilled workers.

    We develop a model that brings together and extends several mechanisms used to explain

this puzzle in the literature. In the model, heterogeneous firms endogenously choose the qual-

ity of their products. The production of high-quality goods exhibits economies of scale, it is

intensive in skilled labor and high-quality inputs. A trade liberalization leads exporters to up-

grade quality if their scale increases or if they face a higher relative demand for high-quality

goods abroad.3 Importers upgrade because high-quality foreign inputs make it cheaper for

them to produce higher-quality goods.4 Since producing higher-quality is skill intensive, trade

increases the demand for skills within importing and exporting firms.

    Beyond these existing mechanisms, the model brings domestic firms into the picture. Across

firms, quality choices are interrelated because firms sell their goods to final consumers and to
   1 These  changes are unlikely to come only from other reforms because they are typically larger in
sectors with larger tariff decreases. For productivity changes, see Aw, Roberts and Xu (2011), Eslava et
al. (2013), Khandelwal and Topalova (2004), Pavcnik (2002), Trefler (2004) and references there surveyed.
Goldberg and Pavcnik (2004, 2007) survey labor market changes, and Tybout (2003) surveys firm size.
See Kugler and Verhoogen (2009, 2012), Tovar (2012) and Verhoogen (2008) for quality improvements,
and Das et al. (2013) and Holmes and Schmitz (2010) for case studies. The patterns are well-documented
for middle-income countries, and they are less clear for low-income countries. The main trade partners
of these middle-income countries were at the time high-income countries—not yet China.
    2 Within product categories, high-income countries systematically sell their goods at higher unit

prices. See Schott (2004) and Khandelwal (2010) for example. Our argument and model are also ap-
plicable to higher-technology, capital-intensive goods that may appear as separate product categories in
the data.
    3 See Bustos (2011a) and Helpman et al. (2010, 2012) for the economies of scale hypothesis. Here,

differences in wages occur across firms only because of unobservable differences in skill. We do not
address labor market imperfections in Helpman et al (2010, 2012). The demand for skill intensive goods
is higher abroad in models of quality-differentiation, e.g. Verhoogen (2008) and Faber (2013), and of
offshoring, e.g., Feenstra (2010) and Feenstra and Hanson (1997).
    4 See Burstein et al. (2013), Burstein and Vogel (2012) and Kugler and Verhoogen (2012). We interpret

inputs as materials only through most of the paper, but we allow them to include capital inputs in
section 5. See also Goldberg et al. (2009, 2010, 2012) for trade in intermediate inputs.

other firms. As importers and exporters upgrade, they increase the supply and demand for

high-quality inputs in the domestic market. The increased supply makes the domestic pro-

duction of high-quality goods cheaper, and the increased demand boosts their sales relative

to low-quality goods. Both effects lead other firms to upgrade their own product quality and

thereby magnify these supply and demand effects. Like in the data, the rise in demand for skills

following a trade liberalization may be widespread. Also like in the data, a higher demand for

skill may coexist with a reduction in scale due to increased competition.5

    Through quality choices, the model also provides a unified explanation for well-documented

cross-sectional correlations between firms’ sales, wages, skill intensity, prices, and participation

in international trade.6 Economies of scale imply that more productive firms endogenously

choose higher quality, become larger and more skill intensive. They sell their output and buy

their inputs at higher prices. These larger firms are also more likely to trade because importing

and exporting require a fixed cost. If, as our parameter estimates suggest, the relative demand

and supply of high-quality goods is higher abroad, then importers and exporters are also more

skill intensive and pay higher wages even after controlling for size.

    Our application is the Colombian trade liberalization in 1991. We estimate the model to a

cross-section of manufacturing plants in Colombia in 1988, simulate a counterfactual liberaliza-

tion and compare the results to post-liberalization 1994 data. Since the model better represents

patterns within sectors, we estimate it separately for two large sectors, chemicals and machin-

ery. We believe this exercise is illustrative because the Colombian experience was typical and

patterns in chemicals and machinery are similar to other sectors in Colombia.7

    The model captures well the cross-sectional joint distribution of sales, wages, skill inten-

sity, and import and export participation and intensity. The counterfactual liberalization, in

turn, matches the data qualitatively well: Sales decrease, demand for skilled labor increases

and large firms increase their sales and skill intensity relative to small firms.8 Empirical studies
   5 Inputs also have an amplification effect in Markusen and Venables (1999) and Jones (2011), but there

amplification only occurs if firm size increases, which doesn’t occur in unilateral trade liberalizations.
   6 See Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999) and Davis and Haltiwanger (1991) for wages, skill and

size, and Bernard and Jensen (1995, 1997) and Bernard, Jensen, Redding and Schott (2007) for importing
and exporting.
   7 See studies in footnote 1 for other countries and appendix A for other sectors. Chemicals and ma-

chinery sectors both contain final and intermediate goods (see section 3).
   8 In the counterfactual, we allow for only two parameters to change—one controlling trade deficits




                                                    3
of trade liberalizations document comprehensive changes in manufacturing firms—measured

productivity, investment, skill intensity, and quality all improved. Similarly in the counter-

factual, firms that upgrade their output quality also invest, become more skill intensive and

upgrade the quality of their inputs. At the same time, their profits shrink, a prediction con-

sistent with the strong opposition of industry associations to unilateral trade liberalizations in

Colombia and elsewhere.9

    This, perhaps counterintuitive, combination of decreasing sales and increasing skill inten-

sity arises in the counterfactual for two reasons. First, the parameter estimates attribute a minor

role for economies of scale in determining a firm’s quality and skill intensity. Because exporters

are generally large, recent theories propose economies of scale as the driver of these firms’ deci-

sions on investment, productivity improvements and skill intensity. To our knowledge, we are

the first to use the joint distribution of sales and wages, and sales and skill intensity, to estimate

the role of economies of scale in a trade model. Our results do not support the economies-

of-scale hypothesis: Exporters are large even before the trade liberalization, and the positive

relation between sales and other firm outcomes is noisy.10

    Second, the amplification effect of domestic inputs is necessary for counterfactual increases

in skill intensity to be large enough to match the data and to extend to domestically-oriented

firms. In chemicals, for example, the model predicts that sales drop in 99% of firms, while skill

intensity increases in 61% of firms, including 14% of firms that neither import nor export. Sales

drop by 14% on average, and the share of skilled workers goes from 28% to 35%. In machinery,

a comparative disadvantage sector, drops in sales are larger, 34%, and increases in skill intensity

are smaller, from 19% to 25%. The domestic amplification effect accounts for roughly two-thirds

of the rise in sectoral skill intensity in chemicals, and one-third in machinery.

    The magnitude of these counterfactual changes is comparable to the data, where skill in-
and the other controlling non-tariff barriers—to exactly match changes in aggregate imports and exports.
Large firms increase their size and skill intensity relative to other firms in Bustos (2011), Kugler and
Verhoogen (2012), and Lileeva and Trefler (2010).
   9 See Edwards (2001) for the politics of the structural reforms in Colombia, and Milgrom and Roberts

(1990) for a description of broad firm transformations in modern manufacturing.
  10 This was previously noted by Tybout (2003). He adds that firm size does not increase, if anything, it

decreases with import competition, but we do not use post-liberalization data in the estimation. Help-
man et al (2012) also estimate a quantitative trade model with economies of scale, but since they do
not observe sales, they use export dummies. Export dummies, however, may reflect a firm’s ability to
compete with foreign firms in the domestic market, and the export activities and scale per se need not
drive firms’ behavior. See Lileeva and Trefler (2010) and footnote 3 for other theories.

tensity increased by 7.9 percentage points in chemicals and 2.4 percentage points in machinery.

Changes in the data, however, occurred while the skill premium in Colombia increased by 12%,

whereas our baseline counterfactuals are obtained under the assumption of inelastic wages.11

So, our quantitative results suggest that, existing mechanisms, even when magnified by do-

mestic input-output linkages, cannot fully account for the rise in demand for skill in data. In

section 5, we extend the model to narrow this gap.

     The model is in section 1. A description of Colombian reforms and the data is in section 2.

We estimate the model in section 3 and simulate the trade liberalization in section 4. Section 5

considers other explanations and section 6 concludes.



1      The model
Preferences are in section 1.1, technologies in section 1.2, and equilibrium in section 1.3. The

model extends Melitz (2003). The key theoretical innovation, from which the results follow, is

a production function where high-quality goods involve economies of scale and are intensive

in skilled labor and high-quality inputs. The assumptions on environment are guided by our

empirical application.

     The set up is static. There are two countries, Home and Foreign. Foreign variables are

denoted with an asterisk. Since Colombia is a small country, we assume all Foreign variables

are exogenous. Our focus is the medium-run effects of the trade liberalization: The five years

in which most of the changes in the labor market arguably occur. During the period, imports

increased faster than exports in Colombia as it is typical with unilateral trade liberalizations.

Also, average sales decreased and there was some exit—a change inconsistent with free entry

and constant markups, where average sales must increase whenever the probability of surviv-

ing decreases. We view free entry and balanced trade as long-run tendencies. In 1999, nearly

ten years after the liberalization, a large devaluation of Colombian pesos increased exports and

probably firm size. But to study the medium run, we allow for unbalanced trade and take
    11 Our
        counterfactual assumes that labor is perfectly elastic, and hence wages do not change. Ap-
pendix C.1 assumes that labor is perfectly inelastic and finds that the skill premium increases by 4% in
chemicals and 8% in machinery. The Colombian skill premium is from Attanasio et al. (2004, table 4)
who observe education and earnings of households. We only observe skills with error. See section 2.

the set of potentially active firms as exogenous. These assumptions make it harder for trade

to increase the demand for skills in the model since sales are allowed to drop and there are

economies of scale in the production of high-quality, skill-intensive goods. Exit may occur

because there is a fixed cost of production.



1.1    Demand

There is a continuum of goods indexed by ω. The set of goods is Ω in Home and Ω∗ in Foreign,

with |Ω| = |Ω∗ | = 1. Consumers take prices p(ω ) and qualities q̃(ω ) as given, and choose

quantities x (ω ) to maximize a demand function with constant elasticity of substitution (CES):

                                    Z                                                 σ/(σ−1)

                         X ( Q) =               x (ω )             q̃(ω )         dω                                       (1)

where σ > 1 is the elasticity of substitution. We change the quality scale to q defined through


                                                     q̃ = Φ(q, Q)
                                                                 exp(q − Q)
                               where        Φ(q, Q) =                                                                      (2)

and Q = 0. Since quality is an ordinal concept, the change of scale has no bearing on the

results. It is convenient because, in section 1.2.1 below, it allows us to capture the demand

for high-quality goods in Foreign relative to Home consumers with a single parameter. We

henceforth refer to firm ω’s quality level as q(ω ) defined by q̃(ω ) = Φ(q(ω ), Q), and to Q as

the consumer’s reference quality. The CES price index is

1.2    Production

Each good ω ∈ Ω is potentially produced by a monopolistically competitive firm. All goods

have final and intermediate usage. Firms use skilled and unskilled labor, and material inputs

for production. To produce quality q, firm ω pays a fixed cost f (q). After incurring this cost,

the output of firm ω when producing quality q with import status 1 M ∈ {0, 1} is

    Function X (q) is the CES aggregate of material inputs, where Φ(q0 , q) is the productivity

second. Higher quality inputs are more efficient, and higher-quality output is more difficult to

produce. It is also log-supermodular. Then, the firm’s relative demand for any two inputs 1

1.2.1   Firms in international trade

Firm ω pays a fixed cost f M (ω ) to import Foreign varieties ω ∈ Ω∗ .13 Log-supermodularity of

Φ implies that higher-quality firms gain more from importing high-quality inputs. This point

is also made clear in figure 1, which plots the productivity shifter Φ(q, qoutput ) as a function of

input quality q when the firm’s output quality is qoutput . The firm would like to concentrate its

input purchases in the interval marked with a bold red line. These inputs are efficient—i.e.,

Φ(q, qoutput ) is high—but probably not as expensive or scarce as inputs of higher quality. But if

the firm is among the highest quality firms in Home, these inputs are not available domestically

and Home inputs are inefficient—i.e., Φ(q, qoutput ) is low when q < qoutput . The firm will then

be more willing to pay a fixed cost to import higher-quality inputs than a low-quality firm will.

q1 > q2 . See Costinot (2009).
  13 Consumers access foreign markets freely but firms pay a fixed cost. This asymmetry can be elimi-

nated by assuming all firms and consumers can access foreign markets freely but they pay an additional
markup for distribution costs. Firms can choose to pay a fixed cost to forgo these distribution costs.

Demand in Foreign may arise from consumers or firms. Parameter Y ∗ captures the size of

the Foreign market, while parameter Q∗ captures the relative demand of high- to low-quality

goods. If Q∗ > Q, Foreign’s relative demand for high-quality goods is higher than Home

consumer’s. That is, for any two goods 1 and 2 with q1 > q2 ,

Firms with higher-quality output are then more likely to export. The fixed costs of importing

and exporting imply that larger, more productive firms are also more likely to trade. We allow

these costs f X (ω ) and f M (ω ) to be firm-specific because participation in trade varies across

firms with similar characteristics in the data.


1.2.2   The firm’s problem

We use standard CES aggregation to derive demand and set up the firm’s problem. A bundle

of labor and material inputs for producing quality q with import status 1 M costs


                                             C (q, 1 M ) = w(q)α PI (q, 1 M )1−α ,


                                (1−σL )
where w(q) = [∑i=s,u wi                    Φ L (ς, q)]1/(1−σL ) is the CES price of labor, and PI (q, 1) = P(q)

and PI (q, 0) = P(q) in equation (3) above are the CES prices of materials. These prices are

functions of output quality q through productivity shifters Φ L and Φ. Firm ω’s total revenue is

r T (ω ) = {r [q(ω ), p(ω )] + 1X (ω )r ∗ [q(ω ), p(ω )]}, where r (q, p) is Home’s demand function in

equation (10) below. The firm’s demand for skilled and unskilled labor is then

Function χ(q) summarizes the country-wide demand for quality q: Each type of spending, con-

sumers’ Y and firms’ R I (ω ), is weighted by its own relative demand for quality q captured by

shifters Φ. If Φ were constant in its second argument, all agents would have the same relative

demand for high- and low-quality goods, and χ(q) would reduce to a function of aggregate

prices, absorption and a demand shifter associated with q.
                                                                                     σ
    Firm ω sets price p = µC (q, 1 M )/z(q, ω ) where µ =                          σ −1   is the markup. It chooses quality

q, entry 1E , import status 1 M and export status 1X to maximize profits:

                           n                                                                      o
        π (ω ) =     max 1E σ−1 [r (q, p) + 1X r ∗ (q, p)] − [ f (q) + 1 M f M (ω ) + 1X f X (ω )] .                      (11)

A firm’s operating profit σ−1 [r (q, p) + 1X r ∗ (q, p)] is proportional to its productivity z(q, ω ) and

the cost of producing higher quality f (q) is fixed. So, more productive firms endogenously

choose higher quality. The decisions of output quality, import and export statuses cannot be

disentangled. Exporting increases the scale of production rendering imports more profitable,

and importing decreases variable costs rendering exports more profitable. Importing and ex-

porting also yield higher profits from quality upgrading. Similarly intertwined are other firms’

choices, since they determine input costs C and demand function χ. Before closing the model,

we illustrate these choices.


1.2.3     Choice of output quality: An example

Consider the problem of a firm in choosing its output quality. Assume that its productivity is

z(q, ω ) = z for all q. If the firm is not engaged in international trade 1 M = 1X = 0, its profit as




                                                                    10

a function of its output quality q is


                                    zσ−1 [µC (q, 0)]1−σ χ(q)/σ − f (q).                                (12)


The first term is the firm’s operating profit and the second, its fixed cost. Figure 2(a) graphs

the two terms (solid line for operating profit), where [µC (q, 0)]1−σ χ(q)/σ and f (q) are taken
                                                      

from the estimates in section 3 below.14 Higher quality has two opposing effects on the operat-

ing profit—it increases demand χ(q) and input cost C (q, 0). Demand dominates for low-quality

levels, but eventually as high-quality inputs become expensive or unavailable, the cost effect

dominates. So, the operating profit is initially increasing in q, peaks at q = 4.6 and then de-

clines. The fixed cost is linear by parametric assumption.

   Figure 2(b) shows the firm’s first order conditions, the derivative of equation (12) with

respect to q. The firm chooses quality q = 4.5, where its marginal operating profit equals

marginal cost. Its total profit is the area between the two curves minus f (0). An increase in

the firm’s productivity z shifts the marginal profit curve upward and increases the optimal

quality—more productive firms choose higher quality.

   The figure also compares the choice of quality for different import and export statuses.

Parameter estimates below are such that Foreign has a higher relative demand and supply
  14 We   use estimates from the chemical sector here.



                                                    11
of high-quality goods than Home. Then, importing decreases the relative cost of producing

high-quality, and exporting increases the relative demand for high-quality goods. Graphically,

importing and exporting shift the marginal profit curve rightward due to these relative cost

and demand effects and upward due to standard effects of increase in scale and decrease in

cost. Both shifts increase the firm’s optimal quality and operating profit. The firm engages in

international trade if the additional profit exceeds the fixed cost of importing or exporting.

   To illustrate the interconnection between firms’ quality choices, we exogenously increase all

firms’ quality by one. Aggregate prices P(q) and demand χ(q) change accordingly, but we do

not allow firms to update their choices of output quality or of import and export status. Figure

3(a) shows the changes in the problem of the firm in figure 2(b) that neither imports nor exports.

The effects of cost C (q, 0) and demand χ(q) are separated. The cost effect shifts the marginal

operating profit up and to the right. The aggregate cost of inputs C (q, 0) decreases, especially

for the production high-quality goods whose adequate materials are initially not available in

Home. Demand shifts the marginal operating profit down and to the right. The downward

shift occurs because the price index decreases—competition tightens—and the rightward shift

occurs because firms shift demand from low- to high-quality materials. The overall effect of

the experiment is large: The firm’s quality choice increases from 4.5 to 5.2, more than half of

the 1.0 exogenous increase in other firms’ quality.15

   Figure 3(b) shows the effect of the experiment on a firm that imports and exports. The cost

effect is much smaller because the firm already has access to high-quality Foreign inputs, and

the demand shift is now positive because the firm’s marginal profit intercepts the x-axis at a

higher quality level. The counterfactual trade liberalization in section 4 below leads most firms

to upgrade their product quality, and so its Home-market effects are akin to this experiment:

Reductions in the cost of producing high-quality goods leads to quality upgrades among all

firms, especially non-importers, and shifts in demand lead to quality upgrading only among

ex ante high-quality firms.
  15 The   potential for multiplicity of equilibria is discussed in appendix D.

To close the model, we take a stance on the factor(s) used for fixed costs f , f M and f X . The

data do not distinguish fixed from variable production costs, and we assume that fixed costs

use a separate factor (labor or capital) that differs from the skilled and unskilled labor used in

production function (5). When matching the model to data in section 3 below, we then take

To summarize, an economy is defined by Home’s labor supply Ls (w) and Lu (w), fixed pro-

duction costs f (q), tariffs τ, deficit D H ; the set of firms Ω each with its productivity z(q, ω ),

its fixed cost of importing f M (ω ) and exporting f X (ω ), and by Foreign, itself described by de-

mand shifters Q∗ and Y ∗ , and set of goods Ω∗ each with its price p∗ (ω ) and quality level q(ω ).

An equilibrium is a set of wages w that clears the labor markets.



2        Data and the Colombian Trade Liberalization
Following international trends, Colombia significantly reduced trade barriers in a broad set of

industries between 1985 and 1991 after decades of import-substitution policies.18 Non-tariff

barriers, which affected 99.6% of industries in 1984, were removed, and the average tariff in

manufacturing decreased from 50% to 13%. Figure 4 shows the evolution of effective tariff rates
     17 This
         assumption is innocuous for the benchmark counterfactual where labor is perfectly elastic and
wages do not change. In appendix C.2, the results barely change when we let fixed costs change with
wages in the case of inelastic labor supply.
  18 Attanasio et al (2004) and Edwards (2001) describe reforms in Colombia. The trade liberalization

was accompanied by reforms in the labor and financial markets, but these were less comprehensive
because they stalled for political reasons. See also Lora (2001).

between 1984 and 1996. The sharp decreases in 1991 were arguably unexpected.19 In 1990, the

newly-elected Gaviria administration designed a four-year plan to reduce trade barriers, but it

abruptly implemented the whole plan after a few months under the impression that uncertainty

was holding back changes in firms.

    We use the Colombian Annual Manufacturing Survey which comprises all manufacturing

plants in Colombia with 10 or more workers. A plant is interpreted as a firm in the model.20 We

use two sample years. We estimate the model with pre-liberalization 1988 data and compare the

counterfactual results to 1994 post-liberalization data. For each plant in 1988, the data contain

the value of domestic and export sales, and spending on domestic and imported materials.

The number of workers and wage bill are reported separately for managers, technicians and

production workers. We take managers and technicians to be white-collar workers, but below,

measurement error distinguishes them from unobservable skilled workers.

    The survey changed during the years of interest. In 1994, there is no plant-specific data

on imports and exports. We use only total imports and exports by sector from Feenstra et al.

(2005). Plant identification numbers changed in 1990. So, we cannot infer exit or within-firm

changes.21 Last, our measure of white-collar workers is not available after 1994 because the
  19 The figure is from Eslava et al. (2013).
  20 Plants report whether they belong to a firm with multiple plants, but not the plant(s) to which they
are linked. Six percent of plants are from multi-plant firms, and moments in the data look similar if
these plants are excluded.
  21 The number of firms decreases slightly in 1991, but there is a long term trend in increasing number




                                                              15
classification of employees changed in 1995.

    Our model is suitable to study patterns within sectors. A within-sector emphasis is con-

sistent with recent papers that find large systematic variations within and not across sectors,

and more specifically, with Helpman et al.’s (2012) finding that worker inequality and changes

in inequality occur mostly within sectors.22 The structure of the model where all goods are

recycled as inputs within sectors is also apt since input-output matrices generally have large

diagonal elements, especially in developing countries. Accordingly, we choose two sectors for

our empirical analysis and estimate the model separately for each sector. The chemical sector

with 438 plants and the machinery sector with 557 plants are among the largest in Colombia.

The chemical sector contains intermediate and final goods such as pharmaceutics, cosmetics

and household cleaning products, and about 53% of its material inputs are themselves chem-

icals. The machinery sector contains electrical and non-electrical machinery and final goods

such as household appliances, computers and televisions. Intra-sector purchases amount to

about 20% of intermediate goods in the sector.23



3    Pre-liberalization cross-section
As we turn to the estimation, we clarify the objectives of our quantitative analysis. Quality

choices in the model provide a unified explanation for well-documented cross-sectional corre-

lations between sales, wages, skill intensity, import and export participation and intensity. In

estimating the model to a pre-liberalization cross-section, we show that the model can quanti-

tatively match the joint distribution of these firm characteristics, and that this joint distribution

allows for the identification of parameters governing demand for skilled and unskilled labor.

So, changes in firm behavior due to the counterfactual trade liberalization are quantitatively

consistent with the cross section.

    Numerous studies associate trade liberalization episodes in developing countries with in-

of firms as the economy grows, making it hard to quantify exit.
  22 Helpman et al.’s (2012) data are from Brazil and cover the period of trade liberalization. See also

Bernard, Eaton, Jensen and Kortum (2003) for cross-sectional patterns.
  23 The figures for intra-sector intermediate consumption come from the 1988 input-output matrices,

whose sector classification differs from the manufacturing survey. For chemicals intermediate con-
sumption, we use the figure corresponding to “Chemicals and Rubber,” and for machinery, we use
“Machinery and Equipment.”


                                                  16
creases in the demand for skills in manufacturing—both the skill premium and the skill in-

tensity increased. In unilateral liberalizations, firm sales also decreased significantly in the

short and medium run as imports flooded the market. Together, these changes are inconsistent

with models where firms’ demand for skills depends only on economies of scale. Our model

combines economies of scale with other elements in the literature and input-output linkages.24

Quantitatively, the counterfactual results suggest how far (or close) the main mechanisms link-

ing trade to demand for skills in the literature are to explaining changes in the data and whether

the novel feature of input linkages is economically relevant. Our application is then intended

to illustrate events from a broad set of countries and sectors. So, we exploit only patterns in the

data that are well documented elsewhere, and we show in appendix A that they occur in other

sectors in Colombia.

    Still, one contrast between sectors is worth highlighting. Like other developing countries,

Colombia has a comparative disadvantage in producing machines.25 So, the extent to which

the model predicts an increase in demand for skills even when the exports of machines do not

grow suggests whether our mechanism is consistent with documented increases in demand for

skills in a wide range of manufacturing firms and sectors.

    The estimation uses the method of simulated moments, where the chosen moments de-

scribe the joint distribution of firm sales, wages, skill intensity, imports and exports. There are

15 parameters and 47 moments. The parametrization is in section 3.1.1, the simulation in sec-

tion 3.1.2 and the moments in section 3.1.3. Section 3.1.4 discusses identification. Results are in

section 3.2. Monte Carlo simulations are in appendix D.
  24 The patterns in the data cannot be generated by firms shedding their least skill-intensive products

during the trade liberalization—an alternative explanation suggested to us by Jon Vogel. In our data, the
average number of products by firm increased from 3.6 to 4.4 between 1988 and 1994 and it increased
within all sectors. These changes are consistent with quality upgrading since a firm’s product scope
may be a reasonable proxy for its product quality. See Bernard et al. (2012).
  25 See Eaton and Kortum (2001).

3.1     Estimation procedure

3.1.1   Parametrization

Table 1 summarizes the parametrization. We fix parameters that are not identified. The elas-

ticity of substitution across skilled and unskilled labor σL is not separately identified from Φ L

since they both enter the model only through the demand for labor in equation (8). Similarly,

the elasticity of substitution across goods σ is not separately identified from z(q, ω ) since it

enters only as an exponent of z(q, ω ) in demand. We take σ = 5 from Broda and Weinstein

(2006), and σL = 1.6 from Acemoglu and Autor (2010). The average tariff on chemicals in 1988

in Colombia is τ = 41.5% and in machines it is τ = 21.0%. The share of labor in production

is α = 0.7. We assume all foreign firms have the same price and quality, and set p∗ (ω ) = 1

for all ω ∈ Ω∗ . We also set wu = 1 because our moments only include relative wages, not

wages in pesos. Similarly, we set Y = 1 because we do not match firm sales in pesos, only sales

normalized by domestic absorption. Appendix C.2 experiments with alternative values for σ,

σL and α.

   We parameterize technologies z(q, ω ), fixed costs f (q), f M (ω ) and f X (ω ), productivity

                                   z(q, ω ) = max{0, z1 (ω ) + z2 (ω )q}                                 (15)


where z1 (ω ) is independently drawn from a log-normal with mean parameter µ1 and variance

parameter σ1 , and z2 (ω ) is drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance

σ2 . We allow for the rate at which productivity changes with quality z2 (ω ) to be firm-specific

because the model would otherwise predict a perfect correlation between sales and wages.26

    Let f (q) = f 1 q where f 1 is a parameter to be estimated. We assume f (0) = 0 because we

cannot estimate it without observing exit.27 Firms’ fixed costs of importing f M (ω ) are inde-

pendently drawn from a log-normal with mean parameter µ M and variance parameter σM , and

their fixed costs of exporting f X (ω ) are drawn from a log-normal with parameters µ X and σX .

                                         Φ L (u, q) = φ̄L (q; l1 , l2 )


where l1 and l2 are parameters to be estimated and φ̄L (q) is judiciously adjusted for every

parameter guess so that the CES price of labor w(q) = 1 for all q.28 Without φ̄L , l2 increases the

efficiency of producing high-quality goods and affects quality choices. With φ̄L , l1 and l2 only

affect skill intensity, as per equation (6).

    The data report the share of white- and blue-collar workers, not their skill. Firm character-

istics such as sales, importing and exporting are much more correlated with wages than with

the share of white-collar workers. Our interpretation is that firms observe skill better than we

econometricians and that wages reflect the true ranking of skill intensity across firms better

than the share of white-collars. Accordingly, we assume measurement error in skills. A share

πu (ω ) of firm ω’s unskilled workers are misclassified as white-collars, where πu (ω ) is inde-
  26 These    two dimensions of firm heterogeneity are akin to those in Hallak and Sivadasan (2013).
  27 Allowing for     f (0) to match a 10% exit, barely changes the counterfactual results below. The decrease
in firm sales is slightly lower and the increase skill intensity is slightly higher than the benchmark.

3.1.2   Simulation

We simulate the behavior of 5000 firms. Each firm has a fixed vector of five independent stan-

dard normal random variables. For each parameter guess, we transform these vectors to get

firm-specific productivity parameters z1 (ω ) and z2 (ω ), fixed costs f X (ω ) and f M (ω ) and mea-

surement error πu (ω ). Firms may exit or enter the market. If they enter, they choose a quality

level from a grid with 200 choices q ∈ [0, 10]. Together with the four choices on participation

of international trade—to import only, to export only, to import and export, or to do neither—

firms have 801 discrete choices over which we iterate.30

    Given firms’ discrete choices and wages, the vector of price indices P(q) is a fixed point

calculated iteratively for each quality level in the grid. Price indices are fixed points because

they enter into firms’ prices through material inputs. Given price indices, the demand function

χ(q) in equation (10) is also iteratively calculated as a fixed point for each quality in the grid.

Demand is a fixed point because firms’ demand for materials enter into χ(q) thereby affecting

sales and demand for materials.31 Given P and χ, we calculate the profit of each firm for each of

its 801 discrete choices and update its optimal choice. The equilibrium is attained when no firm

changes its choice. We then calculate each firm’s average wage, share of white-collar workers,

imports, exports, and sales. The parameter estimates minimize the squared distance between

the moments from these generated data and the observed moments, weighted by the inverse

of their variance.32 Implicitly, this procedure takes labor supply L(w) to equal firms’ demand
  29 We assume that skilled workers are not misclassified for several reasons. First, in the data, the wages
of white-collars vary a lot more than that of blue-collars across firms, suggesting that the presence of
college graduates among blue-collars is not common. Second, if classification errors also applied to
skilled workers, their share in the industry would be close to the white-collar share, which is about 50%,
much higher than the share of college graduates in Colombian manufacturing.
  30 Our results are robust to increasing the number of firms and quality choices. See appendix D.
  31 In estimating P and χ, instead of aggregating over 5000 firms, we use the results in Melitz (2003) to

aggregate over the representative firm in each of the 800 discrete choices. This significantly speeds up
computation, since less than one-quarter of the possible choices are picked in a typical iteration.
  32 The variance of moments is calculated by randomly drawing the set of firms with replacement and

recalculating the moments. To calculate moments on market shares, we multiply generated shares by
5000/438 where 438 is the number of chemical plants in the data.

3.1.3    Moments

The list of moments is on table 2. We match the 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% of the unconditional

distributions of the log of normalized domestic sales (market shares) and share of white-collar

workers.33 We classify firms according to their quartile of domestic sales, and for each quar-

tile, we match: The average of firms’ share of white-collar workers; the percentage of firms

importing and exporting; the spending on imported materials divided by total spending on

materials, and export sales divided by total sales. We classify firms into quartiles of domestic

sales and quartiles of average wages, and match the percentage of firms in each combination

of quartiles. That is, we match the percentage of firms in each of the sixteen bins in figure 6(a)

and (c). The classification of firms by quartile of wage in the model reflects firms’ actual skill
  33 This normalization of sales by absorption is standard (see Tybout (2003)).
                                                                           Between 1988 and 1994 the
Colombian economy grew, but since this growth is generally not associated with the trade liberalization,
normalizing sales by absorption eliminates growth. We calculate absorption as total sales plus sectoral
imports minus exports, where Colombian imports and exports of chemicals and machinery are taken
from Feenstra et al (2005).

intensity without measurement error. Finally, we match the ratio of the average wage of white-

to blue-collar workers. In all, these are 47 moments.


3.1.4   Identification

While the formal estimation procedure is above, we informally discuss parameter identifica-

tion here. The distribution of firm productivity z(q, ω ) captures primarily the distribution of

market shares, whose overall level depends on import penetration. And since p∗ = 1, param-

eter µ1 governs import penetration by increasing the productivity in Home relative to Foreign.

Parameter σ1 governs the variance of market shares. By allowing some firms to be relatively

more productive at skill-intensive high-quality goods, σ2 governs the joint distribution of sales

and wages. Given the size of the Home market, approximately Y/α with Y = 1, parameter Y ∗

governs export intensity.

   Fixed trade costs f X (ω ) and f M (ω ) govern firms’ import and export status and their corre-
                                                       exp(q− Q)
lation with sales. The assumption that Φ(q, Q) =      1+exp(q− Q)
                                                                    with Q = 0 normalizes the quality

scale, by eliminating the variance and mean of the logistic distribution. The fixed cost of pro-

duction f (q) = f 1 q governs the dispersion of quality choices across firms. If quality choices

are similar, firms’ import and export intensities do not depend on size or skill intensity. So,

systematic differences in these intensities help identify f 1 . Given quality choices, the quality of

foreign imports q∗ governs how import intensity varies with sales and skill intensity, and the

shifter of Foreign demand Q∗ governs how export intensity varies with sales and skill intensity.

   Given quality choices, l1 and l2 capture the distribution of shares of white-collar workers.

The smaller dispersion in the distribution of sales and wages relative to sales and shares of

white-collar workers help identify σπ . Parameter σπ also pins down the total share of unskilled

workers misclassified as white-collar workers. This share together with the wages of white- to

blue-collar workers helps identify the unobserved skill premium ws /wu .

   Finally, it may seem odd that we do not use prices to estimate a model of quality differ-

entiation. But for the same reasons as in Melitz (2003), the model has no implications for unit

prices. Function Φ captures only one agent’s valuation of a good of quality level q relative to

other agents’, and a firm’s productivity z(q, ω ) can be decomposed into its productivity and

a demand for its quality agreed upon by all agents.34 Technically, the model assumes only

that goods that are produced with increasing returns to scale use intensively inputs that are

themselves produced with increasing returns to scale. The estimated parameters suggest that

these goods are skill intensive and that their relative demand and supply are higher abroad.

We call these goods high-quality for exposition given our within-sector focus, but they can be

interpreted more broadly as high-tech or capital-intensive goods.



3.2     Results

The parameter estimates are on table 3. In both sectors, the relative demand and supply of

high-quality goods are higher abroad. In chemicals, the quality of Foreign goods q∗ = 9.0 is

well above 6.7, the highest-quality of Home firms, and the Foreign reference quality Q∗ = 5.5
  34 To match the overall relation between firm size and prices, we can also multiply Φ ( q, q0 ) every-

where by another function φ̄(q) that captures all agents’ common valuation for quality q, and multiply
productivity parameters z(q, ω ) everywhere by a common parameter z̄(q) capturing all firms’ efficiency
in producing quality level q. If φ̄(q)z̄(q)σ−1 = 1, revenues and hence firm choices would not change,
but unit prices would generally increase in q if z̄(q) decreased fast enough.
  Our data contain unit prices but sectoral definitions are too broad. Within sectors, the correlation
between unit prices and other firm characteristics, such as sales, skill intensity and wages, are generally
positive but statistically insignificant. Statistical significance arises if we pool across all sectors as Kugler
and Verhoogen (2012) do.

                             Figure 5: Distribution of quality choices


is well above the reference quality for Home consumer and most firms. In machinery, q∗ = 6.9,

Q∗ = 6.2 and the highest quality in Home is 6.0. The distribution of quality levels is in figure

5. It displays several peaks because of the discrete choices of importing and exporting, and it

is more spread for chemicals where the share of firms trading abroad is larger.

    Skill upgrading associated with international trade is large in both sectors. For example, if

we change the fixed costs of trading of a typical firm in chemicals, its skill intensity increases by

8 percentage points if it switches from not trading to importing only, by 6 points if it switches

to exporting only, and by 17 points if it switches to importing and exporting. In 2000 US$, the

average fixed cost of importing chemicals is 315,000 and of exporting is 238,000. Since firms

with lower costs self-select into importing and exporting, the average cost paid is 51,000 for

importing and 112,000 for exporting. For machinery where firms are generally smaller, the av-

erage fixed cost paid for importing is 30,000, and for exporting, it is 15,000.35 The estimated

variance of fixed importing costs is large in chemicals because in the data small and large firms

import, and only large firms export (see table 5). The opposite holds in machinery. These

variances govern the probability that a firm switches to importing or exporting in the counter-

factual trade liberalization, and the largest increases in skill intensity come from switchers. If

increases in trade occur only at the intensive margin, then changes in skill intensity are smaller.
  35 Estimated  fixed costs of trading are in line with Cherkashin et al. (2012) and Das et al. (2007). They
are large because they reflect the expected profits from importing and exporting. We infer fixed costs in
US$ in the model through the estimated ratio of average sales to fixed costs assuming that average sales
is the same as in the data, since average sales in the model are fixed through the normalization Y = 1.

∗ The Colombian average is from Attanasio et al. (2004). Their numbers are expected to be
lower than ours because manufacturing is generally more skill intensive than services and agri-
culture. † Measured skill premium is the only moment on this table directly targeted.


      The model matches very well the unconditional distributions on table 4 and the conditional

distributions on table 5. Only for machinery, the model slightly overestimates the spread of

the unconditional distribution of sales and underestimates imports and exports in the lower

quartiles of sales. In both sectors, firms in the upper quartiles of sales generally have higher

shares of white-collar workers, they are more likely to import and export, they export a higher

share of their output and import a higher share of their inputs. The model also replicates

well the increasing relation between sales and wages in figure 6.36 The large spread in this

distribution suggests that economies of scale are not important determinants of skill intensity,

especially in the machinery sector where the spread is larger.

      Table 6 presents measures of skill intensity and premium. Targeted wages of white- to

blue-collar workers are similar in the data and in the model. Considering that manufacturing

is generally more skill intensive than services and agriculture, the model’s predictions on non-

target, unobservable skill are very well aligned with Attanasio et al. (2004) who use Colombian

household survey data. They document that about 10% of heads of households in Colombia

had a college degree during the trade liberalization, and that the skill premium in 1988 was

ws /wu = 2.6 for university to elementary school and 1.9 for university to secondary school.

Our estimated skill intensity is 28% and skill premium is 2.7 in chemicals, a particularly skill-

intensive sector. For machinery, these numbers are 19% and 2.2, respectively.
    36 There are 5000 firms in the model.
                                      To avoid cluttering figures 6(b) and (d), we randomly select firms
in the model, 438 for chemicals and 557 for machinery, so that the number of observations in the model
and in the data figures are the same.

4      Pre- versus post-trade liberalization

4.1      Counterfactual procedure

The procedure to simulate the trade liberalization is here and the results are in section 4.2. We

exogenously decrease tariffs to match the Colombian average in 1988 and 1994. In chemicals, τ

goes market from 41.5% to 16.6%, and in machinery, from 21.0% to 10.1%. Although the trade

liberalization is unilateral, exports may expand for various reasons: The Colombian peso may

depreciate, or imported inputs may decrease the price and increase the quality of domestic

goods, making them more competitive abroad.

     The model, however, cannot predict changes in imports and exports without information

on non-tariff barriers, elasticity of labor supply and trade deficit. So, we allow Foreign prices

p∗ and market-size parameter Y ∗ to change to exactly match the aggregate change in imports

and exports. To be specific, between 1988 and 1994, chemical imports expanded from 21.5%

to 35.2% of total absorption in Colombia, and exports expanded from 7.1% to 9.7%. We match

this 13.7% points expansion of imports and 2.6% points expansion of exports. We similarly

match changes in trade flows for machinery, where imports expanded by 26.7% of absorption,

from 46% to 73%, and exports expanded only by 0.3%, from 3.0% to 3.3%. So, the counterfactual

studies the model’s changes in demand for skills given observed changes in trade flows. Changes in

Y ∗ may, for example, reflect movements in real exchange rates, and changes in p∗ /Y ∗ reflect

non-tariff barriers.

     The cross-sectional data contain no information on the elasticity of labor supply, only on

the supply of white- and blue-collar labor given pre-liberalization wages. To clearly under-

stand the workings of the model, we assume that labor is perfectly elastic and wages (wu , ws )

do not change. This assumption is reasonable given our within-sector focus, but if we consider

manufacturing as a whole, between 1988 and 1994, both the skill premium and the skill inten-

sity increased in Colombia, suggesting that labor supply is imperfectly elastic. Then, to explore

the implications of inelastic labor in the model, appendix C.1 makes the extreme opposite as-

sumption that labor is perfectly inelastic and labor supply ( Lu , Ls ) does not change.37
    37 Relative
            wages of skilled workers increase confirming the positive link between trade and skills
in the model. Relative to the elastic labor case, these wage changes dampen the incentives for firms to
upgrade quality and decrease the indirect Home-market effects, but the general messages do not change.


                                                  28
4.2    Counterfactual results

Consistent with the data, the model predicts large decreases in sales combined with large in-

creases in skill intensity. In chemicals, sales drop by 14% on average (-0.15 log-points), and skill

intensity goes from 28% to 35%. In machinery, sales drop by 34% (-0.42 log-points), and skill

intensity goes from 19% to 25%. Table 7 reports changes in the distribution of sales and skill

intensity. Both in the data and in the model, sales and white-collar shares increase in the up-

per tail relative to the rest of the distribution. Machinery, the comparative disadvantage sector,

displays larger decreases in sales and smaller increases in skill intensity.

    Quantitatively, changes in normalized sales are well aligned with the data because we

directly target changes in import penetration and export expansion, and absorption is total

sales plus imports minus exports.38 In chemicals, the model underestimates changes in skill

intensity—the share of white-collar workers goes from 51% to 56% in the model and from 49%

to 57% in the data. Changes in unobserved skill intensity are larger, but still short of the data.39

In machinery, increases in the share of white-collar workers are larger than in the data, but if

we consider that the Colombian skill premium increased by 12% between 1988 and 1994, the

model also underestimates the data. This underestimation occurs even though the model puts

together the literature’s most prominent explanations for the rise in demand for skills follow-

ing trade liberalizations in developing countries, and we show next that the effect of trade is

significantly amplified through domestic input linkages.
  38 More   specifically, let S1 and S0 be total normalized sales before and after the counterfactual, respec-
                               imports       exports           imports          exports
tively. Then, S1 = S0 − ∆ absorption + ∆ absorption , where ∆ absorption and ∆ absorption are exactly matched to
the data in the counterfactual. The only reason why log-changes in sales in machinery diverge from the
data is because initial total normalized sales is 57% of absorption in the data and 77% in the model. This
discrepancy arises because, in the data, import penetration of machinery by final consumers and other
sectors is much larger than the targeted import penetration of materials in the machinery sector on table
5. One way to mend the model to match initial normalized sales is to directly target this moment and
allow for the price of Foreign goods faced by consumers to differ from the price faced by firms.
   39 The labor market in the model is excessively simplified, with just two types, but some of the changes

in quality and skill intensity in the model may be reflected in the data. If there is more than two types
of workers, some of the mid-level workers, previously classified as blue- and white-collars, may have
been substituted for highly skilled workers who are less likely to be classified as blue-collars. Such an
extension of the model and its identification is beyond the scope of the paper.

4.2.1   Decomposition of changes in skill intensity

The model brings together various mechanisms through which trade affects the demand for

skills—the direct mechanisms proposed in the literature and the indirect effect of input-output

linkages. To get a sense of the relative importance of these mechanisms, we decompose the

counterfactual changes in skill intensity above into various effects. Results are on table 8. The

numbers are didactic but rough since all effects interact.

   The procedure is as follows. Given import status 1 M and export status 1X , firm ω chooses

quality q to maximize its profit


              1
                z(q, ω )σ−1 [µC (q, 1 M )]1−σ [χ(q) + 1X Φ(q, Q∗ )Y ∗ ]                                                (17)
              σ

    where     C (q, 1 M ) = w(q)α P(q)1−σ + 1 M P∗ (q)1−σ                                                              (18)
                                              Z
        and   χ(q) = Φ(q, Q) P( Q)σ−1 Y +             Φ[q, q(ω 0 )] PI [q(ω 0 ), 1 M (ω 0 )]σ−1 R I (ω 0 )dω 0 .       (19)
                                                  Ω



To construct table 8, we incrementally change each firm’s profit-maximization problem by re-

placing the pre-liberalization functions with post-liberalization ones. There are two effects on

input costs C in line (18). The effect of “cost of Home inputs” is a change in P(q) and the effect

of “cost of Foreign inputs” is a potential change in the firm’s import status 1 M and a change

in function P∗ (q) due to exogenous tariffs and Foreign price p∗ . There are three demand ef-

fects. In Home demand function χ(q), line (19), the effect of “Home market size” is a change in

market tightness through price indices P( Q) and PI [q(ω 0 ), 1 M (ω 0 )] and demand for materials

R I (ω 0 ), and the “Home demand shift” is a change in the relative valuation of different quality

levels through Φ[q, q(ω 0 )] as other firms ω 0 change their quality choices q(ω 0 ). In line (17), the

“export market” effect is a potential change in the firm’s export status 1X and in exogenous Y ∗ .

Functions z(q, ω ), Φ(q, Q), and Φ(q, Q∗ ) do not change with the counterfactual.

   For each firm and each of these incremental changes, we re-calculate optimal quality, and

demand for skilled and unskilled labor. We partition firms according to their participation in
                                                                                                  R

subset of firms. Since wages do not change, a firm’s skill intensity increases if and only if it

upgrades its quality. The overall changes in skill intensity on table 7—of 7.4 percentage points



                                                       31
in chemicals and 6.3 percentage points in machinery—correspond to the sum of the different

channels explored in table 8.


Results.      Increases in the skill-intensity of new importers, new exporters and continuing

exporters are large—16, 17 and 7 percentage points respectively in chemicals for example.40 In

chemicals, new importers are few because the estimated variance of fixed importing costs is

large (see section 3 above). New and continuing exporters, together, are 29% of firms and their

skill intensity increases by 8 percentage points, while new and continuing importers are 32% of

firms and their skill intensity increases by 5% points. So, even though chemical exports increase

by only 2.6% of domestic absorption they have a much larger impact in the Home market than

imports which increase by 14% of absorption. In machinery, new importers and exporters are

few, and Home-market effects are smaller.

   These Home-market effects are illustrated in the theory section 1.2.3 above: As importers

and exporters upgrade their product quality, they decrease aggregate cost of materials P(q) and

increase demand χ(q) for high-quality goods in Home. Cost effects are larger for firms without

access to foreign inputs. In chemicals, they add 6.4 percentage points to the skill intensity of

domestically-oriented firms and 3.0 points to sectoral skill intensity. Demand shifts add 2.1

percentage points to sectoral skill intensity, and they are positive only for the 41% highest-

quality firms. In machinery, where exports do not grow, Home-market effects account for a

2.2 (= 1.7 + 0.5) percentage-point rise in skill intensity compared to 5.1 (= 3.0 + 2.1) points in

chemicals.

   Trade also directly affects skill intensity. As Foreign inputs get cheaper, skill intensity in-

creases by 9.6 percentage points in machinery and by 3.7 points in chemicals. This effect is

much larger in machinery where the import intensity of firms grew by 25% points, from 37% to

63%, compared to 11% points in chemicals, from 43% to 54%. Import competition decreases do-

mestic demand. An 18% drop in domestic sales is associated with a decrease in skill intensity of

2.5 percentage points in chemicals. The expansion of export sales, in turn, increases skill inten-

sity by 0.6% for continuing exporters and 11% for new exporters. Perhaps counterintuitively,
  40 The finding that exporters, especially new exporters, disproportionately increase their skill-intensity

and innovation is in Bustos (2011b) and Lileeva and Trefler (2010). Larger firms disproportionately
increase their skill intensity in Kugler and Verhoogen (2012).

the signs of these two effects reverse for machinery. Continuing exporters experience two op-

posing effects when domestic sales fall. On the one hand, they downgrade quality because

scale of production decreases. On the other hand, exports as a share of their sales increase, and

Foreign has a higher relative demand for high-quality goods.

   The “export market” effect is negative in machinery. Decreases in tariffs and in the price of

Foreign inputs make Home goods more competitive abroad because their cost falls and quality

rises. To prevent exports from growing, the counterfactual then predicts that Y ∗ , the parameter

governing Foreign demand in equation (7), drops by 42%.41 Continuing exporters downgrade

because their scale decreases and because they face a lower relative demand for high-quality

goods. For these firms, the lines “Home market size” and “export market” are best seen to-

gether since their export intensity increases from 7% to 23% with the “Home market size”

effect and back to 12% with the “export market” effect. In all, changes in scale and composition

of sales between Home and Foreign add up to -2.2% = 9.0%-11.2% for continuing exporters.

Last, we note that in both sectors, the firms that decrease their skill intensity the most are ex

ante medium-quality firms that do not engage in international trade. These firms compete in

the same segment of the input market as new importers and exporters.

   Although table 8 show multifarious effects, general messages can be drawn. First, domestic

spillovers are large. In chemicals, the indirect effects of Home inputs account for an increase in

sectoral skill-intensity of 5.1 (=3.0 + 2.1) percentage points, while the direct effects of economies

of scale, Foreign sales and Foreign inputs exploited in previous papers together account for 2.4

(=3.7 -2.5 + 1.1) percentage points. Second, economies of scale play a minor role. Although

sales drop in 99% of chemical firms, skill intensity increases in 61% of firms, including 14% of

domestically-oriented firms. The average skill intensity of domestically-oriented firms does not

change despite a 22% drop in sales. In machinery, sales of continuing exporters drop by 33%

and their skill intensity goes from 26% to 38%. Third, the model’s link between international

trade and skill intensity is very robust. It explains sizable increases in skill intensity that spread

to domestically-oriented firms and to a comparative-disadvantage sector, machinery.
  41 This
        drop is consistent with an increase in Colombian absorption of machines by 85% due to an
investment boom between 1988 and 1994. See section 5 below for changes in Y ∗ and p∗ .




                                                 34
5      Scale, exports, and capital goods
The benchmark counterfactuals above under predict the effects of trade in the demand for

skilled workers, suggesting that other forces are at work. This section modifies the counter-

factuals to consider three other explanations: Economic growth, anticipation of future exports,

and capital inputs.42 Results are on tables 9 and 10.

     First, although normalized sales—i.e., sales/domestic absorption—decreased by 13% (0.14

log-points) in the chemical sector in Colombia between 1988 and 1994, there was economic

growth and real absorption increased by 30%. We repeat the counterfactual but allow Home

consumer spending Y to exogenously increase to match the 30% absorption growth. Results

are labeled as A1. Aggregate sales increase by 12%, but normalized sales are the same as in the

benchmark. The distribution of skill intensity shifts to the right but total skill intensity increases

by only 0.2 percentage points relative to the benchmark. In machinery, the increase in domestic

absorption was even larger, 85%, as Colombia underwent an investment boom between 1988

and 1994. But its effect on skill intensity is again negligible, confirming that economies of scale

have a small effect on skill intensity in the estimated model.

     Second, imports expand faster than exports between 1988 and 1994, but exports expand

faster thereafter. If firms invest and hire in anticipation of exports, our benchmark will un-

derestimate increases in skill intensity. As a crude exercise, we simulate a counterfactual with

an export expansion of 5.1% of domestic absorption in chemicals, instead of 2.6%, where 5.1%

is the increase in exports between 1988 and 1995. Results, labeled as A2, confirm the large

spillovers from exports in the model. Normalized sales increase relative to the benchmark

due to additional export sales. Sectoral skill intensity increases by 10.4 percentage points, well

above the benchmark’s 7.4 points. Among domestically-oriented firms, 40% of firms upgrade

quality, sales drop by 22%, skill intensity goes from 11.6% to 13.0%.

     For machinery, exports did not expand until a large real depreciation of Colombian pesos in

1999. Just for didactic purposes, we match the export expansion of 6.1% of domestic absorption,

from 3.0% to 9.1%, between 1988 and 2000. The indirect effects of exports are again huge.
    42 An
        additional explanation is a tendency in the data for the skill premium and skill intensity to rise
over time in Colombia, like in the United States and other countries. But estimating the long-run trend,
absent other changes, is difficult.

Average skill intensity increases for domestically-oriented firms, and for the sector, it goes from

19% to 43%. Indirect Home-market effects account for more than half of this sectoral change.

     Third, in specification A3, we interpret non-labor inputs in the model more broadly to in-

clude capital equipment, not just materials. We decrease the labor share in production from

α = 0.7 in the benchmark to 0.5, which in principle provides more room for input linkages to

affect quality choices.43 In machinery, skill intensity increases by 13 percentage points, com-

pared to 6.4 percentage-points benchmark. In chemicals, raising the input share magnifies

domestic spillovers from trade. Estimated skill intensity increases from 30% to 54%. Of these

24 percentage points, a whopping 20 points is associated with indirect effects in the domestic

input market. Rightward shifts in the distribution of white-collar shares are now larger than

in the data, suggesting that capital plays a large role in explaining the link between trade and

skills, especially if domestic spillovers are considered.44

     Table 11 documents changes in Y ∗ and p∗ , which are left as free parameters in all counter-

factuals to match changes in imports and exports in the data. The results render themselves

to interpretation even though the model is very stylized to capture all factors influencing sec-
  43 Parameter estimates are in appendix C.2 and the cross-sectional moments practically do not change.
  44 The model still under predicts the overall increase in demand for skills if we consider the 12% rise in

the Colombian skill premium. With inelastic labor and α = 0.5, a counterfactual liberalization increases
the skill premium by 7.7% in chemicals.

toral trade in the period. Changes in foreign prices p∗ reflect sector-specific non-tariff barriers

and economy-wide movements in real exchange rates—p∗ does not change much in chemicals

and decreases in machinery. Since changes in Y ∗ govern growth in export demand relative to

domestic absorption (approximately Y/α), the decrease in Y ∗ in the machinery benchmark by

42% is consistent with the large increase in Colombian absorption between 1988 and 1994. In

chemicals, where absorption grows more in line with other manufacturing sectors, changes in

Y ∗ reflect real exchange rate movements—a real depreciation of Colombian pesos increases Y ∗

relative to domestic absorption and wages.45

    Looking across counterfactuals within a sector, predicted changes in Y ∗ /Y are similar be-

tween the benchmark and A1. To generate a more exports in A2, Y ∗ /Y increases in both ma-

chinery and chemicals. Case A3 is more relevant. Without intermediate inputs, trade models

generally require a real depreciation of domestic currency (fall in domestic wages) in order for

exports to increase at all in unilateral liberalizations. In contrast, counterfactual A3 in chem-

icals predicts an appreciation of 18%. The high share of intermediate inputs (1 − α) = 0.5

leads to large Home-market effects, more quality upgrading and larger drops in costs rela-

tive to the benchmark. To prevent exports from growing further, Foreign demand Y ∗ falls by

18%. Between 1988 and 1994, Colombia experienced a real appreciation of its peso, and this

counterfactual is consistent with the prevailing view that casts investment and capital flows as

6      Conclusion
According to the infant-industry argument, trade barriers may act as coordination devices in

the development of an industry and the adoption of advanced technologies. Here, it is the

removal of trade barriers that acts as a coordination device: The direct effects of trade on a mi-

nority of plants percolate through the domestic economy through changes in cost and demand,

leading to widespread investments in quality upgrading and rises in demand for skilled work-

ers. All ex ante high-quality and some medium-quality firms upgrade their product quality

while low-quality firms downgrade—a heterogeneous effect consistent with previous empiri-

cal findings.47

     This interaction between firms’ decision to adopt skill-biased technology arises from the as-

sumption that skill- and unskill-intensive firms produce different types of goods—an assump-

tion from the classic model of factor-proportions that explains well cross-sectional correlations

of firm characteristics.48 We focus on unilateral trade liberalizations in developing countries

because the ensuing decrease in sales and increase in demand for skilled labor are together

particularly puzzling. But we hope the model will find its way to other applications within

and beyond the field of international trade.




    46 Counterfactual  Y ∗ /Y and Y ∗ /w decrease by 18%, but movements in Y ∗ relative to Home prices
P(q) are smaller, because prices fall. Relative to the consumer price index Y ∗ /P(0) decreases by 13%
and relative to the material costs of the highest-quality firms Y ∗ /P(6) decreases by 3%. These numbers
are not far from the 11% appreciation of Colombian pesos reported by the central bank.
   The investment boom is probably associated to capital liberalization reforms and to the trade liberal-
ization itself since firms need to invest in product and process innovation to upgrade quality and adopt
to the new economic environment. A dynamic model is required to study these movements.
  47 Amiti and Khandelwal (2013) find that decreasing tariffs leads to quality downgrading in sectors

and countries that are far below the world technology frontier and upgrading otherwise. See also Amiti
and Cameron (2012).
  48 Models of skill-bias technical change (e.g., Acemoglu (2002), Thoenig and Verdier (2003) and Wood

(1995)) ignore that firms’ products may change qualitatively when they adopt skill-biased technologies.
This omission may matter if the markets for high- and low-tech goods are different.
   The model is not necessarily at odds trade increasing the demand for skills in developed countries,
but mechanisms other than foreign relative demand and supply of high-quality goods may be at play.
Firms may upgrade their product quality to escape competition as in Aghion and Griffith (2005) and
Aghion et al. (2005) or to ship the good apples out as in Hummels and Skiba (2004).

A     Moments from overall manufacturing
Our estimations and counterfactuals have focused on Chemical and Machinery sectors. We

document here both aggregate and micro-level moments for pooled data across all sectors. The

purpose is to show that the impact of trade liberalization is broad and skill intensity increases

universally across sectors. Furthermore, data patterns of correlations between wage, skill in-

tensity, export, import, and firm size are qualitatively similar in pooled data too. The primary

reason we used specific sectors is to control for heterogeneity in input-output linkages and

tariff reductions. It is also useful to contrast cross-industry differences in firm response and

highlight alternative channels of skill upgrading.



    As illustrated by Table A.1, manufacturing sectors in Colombia experienced an overall in-

crease in the share of white collar workers by 4 percentage points. This is between the 8

percentage-point increase in Chemical and the 2 percentage-point increase in Machinery. In

addition, aggregate manufacturing imports increased significantly between 1988 and 1994 too,

from 23% to 35% of domestic absorption. This is comparable to Chemical and less than Ma-

chinery.

           Table A.1: Data aggregates of pooled data vs. Chemical and Machinery

                                           Manufacturing       Chemical     Machinery
            white collar share (1988)          0.31              0.49         0.33
            white collar share (1994)          0.35              0.57         0.35
            import penetration (1988)          23%               22%          46%
            import penetration (1994)          35%               35%          73%


    On table A.2, we report the key cross-sectional moments for pooled data of all manufac-

turing sectors. The unconditional distribution of white-collar share of manufacturing, as in

aggregate, is close to that of Machinery and dominated by Chemical. Nevertheless, we find

that, qualitatively, all correlations are very similar. A plant’s domestic sales are positively cor-

related with its export/import status, white-collar worker share, and the intensive margins of

exports/import. More importantly, we have illustrated that our model matches these patterns

quantitatively well.

B     Shifts in white-collar shares
We reconcile shifts in the distribution of white-collar shares with its aggregate changes on table

4. Consider the shifts in the unconditional distribution of the share of white-collar workers

in the benchmark counterfactuals on table B.1 (copied from table 7). In both sectors, shifts in

percentiles are smaller than the total. This appendix uses the example of chemicals to explain

how shifts in employment, from the less to the more skill intensive firms can generate this

result.

    Table B.2 partitions firms by quartiles of white-collar shares. It reports the share of white-

collar workers and the share of employment in each quartile. The sum of the product of lines

(A) and (B) yields the total share of white-collar workers before the trade liberalization, 0.51.

The sum of employment shares is 100%. Lines (C) and (D) repeats the exercise for the economy

after the counterfactual liberalization, and the last two lines report the differences. In line (E),

the difference between white-collar shares is smaller in each of the quartiles than the total—as

per table B.1. This result is explained through line (F): Employment shares shift from less to

more skill-intensive firms.

    Bustos (2011), Kugler and Verhoogen (2012) and Pavcnik (2002) provide evidence that ex-

ante larger firms grow and invest in product and process innovation relative to other firms fol-

lowing a trade liberalization. Since larger firms are typically more skill intensive, these findings

are consistent with shifts in employment on table B.2. But these shifts do not appear regularly

in the various sectors (including chemicals and machinery) in our data, possibly because of

large errors in our measure of skills and because we look at the raw data without controls and

interactions with tariff cuts.



C     Robustness
This appendix checks for robustness. Section C.1 presents the counterfactual with inelastic

labor, and section C.2 changes the values of parameters fixed in the estimation.



C.1     Counterfactual with inelastic labor supply

We repeat the counterfactual of section 4 assuming that labor is perfectly inelastic and the labor

supply ( Lu , Ls ) does not change. Since the counterfactual allows for Y ∗ and p∗ to change, in

principle, we can allow only for wu or only ws to change to clear the labor markets, but to make

the results comparable to the case of elastic labor, we allow both wu and ws to change and,

instead, impose no change in consumer spending Y = 1. Domestic absorption changes by less

than 1% since it is approximately Y/α.

    The results again link trade to higher demand for skilled workers. The skill premium in-
                                     ws
creases by 3.5% in chemicals, from   wu   = 2.70 to 2.80, and by 9% in machinery, from 2.2 to 2.4.
Increases in skill intensity in the benchmark were larger in the chemical sector, while here, in-

creases in the skill premium are larger in the machinery sector. Relative to the benchmark, the

rise in skill premium discourages firms to upgrade toward more skill-intensive, high-quality

goods, and thereby decrease the indirect effects of Home inputs. Since these indirect effects are

larger in the chemical sector, a smaller increase in skill premium decreases quality-upgrading

sufficiently to keep relative demand for skilled workers constant.

    Table C.1 shows the shifts in the distribution of sales and skill intensity. As in the bench-

mark and in the data, sales and white-collar shares increase in the upper tail relative to the rest

of the distribution. Drops in sales are in line with the data, especially in chemicals. Total skill

intensity does not change by construction, but the distribution of white-collar shares shifts to

the left as employment moves to more skill intensive firms (see appendix B). Firms are clas-

sified by participation in international trade on table C.2. New importers, new exporters and

continuing exporters significantly increase their skill intensity. In machinery, they increase by

8.7, 5.3, and 23, respectively. Since the stock of labor is held fixed, other firms decrease skill

intensity. As in the benchmark, the largest decreases come from ex ante medium quality firms

that compete directly with new importers and exporters. Skill intensity of continuing importers

falls relative to domestically-oriented firms in both sectors.

   With the rise in skill premium, only about one quarter of firms increase their skill intensity.

But because these firms are generally large, the effects of Home inputs are qualitatively the

same as before: Importers and exporters increase the supply and demand for high-quality

inputs in Home, leading other firms to upgrade.

C.2     Robustness: Fixed parameters

This appendix checks the robustness of the model with respect to fixed parameters. Section

C.2.1 checks the benchmark counterfactual, but some parameters matter only when labor is

inelastic as in appendix C.1 above. These checks are in section C.2.2. Cross-sectional moments

are not presented because they were almost unchanged for all experiments. Table C.3 presents

the parameter estimates for the machinery sector when α = 0.5 used to perform counterfactual

A3 in section 5. All other results in this appendix are refer to the chemical sector.

Table C.4 presents the parameter estimates for alternative values of α and σ. The counterfactual

with α = 0.5 is specification A3 in section 5. In the benchmark, the elasticity of substitution is

     ∗ benchmark α = 0.7 and σ = 5.0.



σ = 5.0, around the mean of elasticities in Broda and Weinstein (2004) for three-digit product

categories. We experiment here with σ = 2.0 corresponding to the median elasticity in Broda

and Weinstein and σ = 10. The only significant change in the cross-section is in the fixed costs

of importing and exporting. These costs reflect the expected operating profits from importing

and exporting. Since a lower elasticity of substitution implies that gross profits are a higher

share of sales, the estimated fixed costs nearly double when σ = 2.0 relative to the benchmark

and they are halved when σ = 10. In the counterfactual, a low-elasticity of substitution induces

a much larger increase in the demand for skilled workers. A low elasticity of substitution

implies that firms quality choices depends more on the quality of its inputs. So, firms’ choices

are more intertwined, the indirect effects of inputs are magnified, and the counterfactual trade

liberalization increases the share of skilled workers by 8.6 percentage points, compared with

7.4 points in the benchmark. For different reasons when σ = 7.0, increases in skill intensity

are also larger than the benchmark, 9.8 percentage points. Here, estimates of the direct shifts in

skill intensity associated with international trade are larger than in the benchmark. Shifts in the

distributions of sales and white-collar workers are on table C.5. Note that the largest increases

in the left tail of the white-collar distributions occur when σ = 2 and the domestic spillovers

are largest. Our choice of σ = 5 is conservative in the sense of predicting the smallest changes

in skill intensity, but the difference between σ = 2 or σ = 7 is not large and the results remain

qualitatively unchanged.


C.2.2    Fixed parameters & inelastic labor supply

The assumption that fixed costs use some perfectly elastic factor implies that these costs do not

change with the counterfactual or with changes in wages. This assumption is innocuous if labor

is elastic because wages do not change anyway. But in the counterfactual with inelastic labor,

average wages decreased by 10%. Allowing all fixed costs to decrease with wages, makes it

cheaper for firms to upgrade their product quality, but the increase in the skill premium during

the liberalization increases only from 3.52% to 3.54%. The elasticity of labor supply σL again

has no effects on the results if labor is elastic, but if labor is inelastic, the higher the elasticity, the

smaller the change in skill premium needed to clear the labor market after the liberalization.

Values for σL in the literature are σL = 1.1 in Lee and Wolpin (2006), σL ∈ [1.6, 1.8] in Acemoglu

and Autor (2010) and σL = 1.4 in Katz and Murphy (1992). The predicted change in the skill

premium in the counterfactual trade liberalization is 3.8 if σL = 1.1, 3.5 if σL = 1.6 (benchmark),

and 3.4 if σL = 1.8. So, again, the results barely change with σL .

D     Multiple equilibria and Monte Carlo simulations
There is a coordination element to the model: As some firms increase their output quality, they

increase other firms’ incentives to increase quality. We cannot rule out multiplicity of equilibria,

but it is unlikely that they exist at least for the parameter estimates. As described in section

3.1.2, for each set of parameters, we iterate over firms’ choices of quality and participation in

international trade until no firm wants to change its choices. To check for multiple equilibria

given the parameter estimates, we randomize over firms initial choices 1,000 times and see

if their choices converge to the same point. In all 1,000 experiments the choices of all 5,000

remained the exactly same.

    In estimating the model, we simulate the behavior of 5,000 firms. For each parameter guess,

we transform a fixed vector of random variables to get each firm’s productivity z(q, ω ) and

costs f M (ω ) and f X (ω ). The number of firms was chosen due to computational constraints,

but to assess whether the number is large we change the vector of random variables forty

times and re-run the optimization algorithm. If 5,000 is sufficiently large, the results should

not change much. About 60% of the parameter estimates are within 99% confidence interval of

the original estimates. The parameters that are worse identified are Q∗ , q∗ and µ M . When the

random draws change, the distribution of quality choices change and q∗ and Q∗ need to change

accordingly. Our parameter estimates also imply a large variance in firms fixed importing costs.

So, it is also natural that the mean cost is not well identified. The counterfactual results change

the increase in skill intensity varies by about one percentage point, but there is no qualitative

change. The results do not change at all if we double the number of quality choices q ∈ [0, 10]

from 200 to 400 or if we expand the choice set beyond the upper bound of q = 10.

    We also conduct Monte Carlo simulations. We generate data with random parameters

drawn from a uniform distribution with support of four standard deviations from the orig-

inal parameter estimates. For each generated data set, we run our simulation algorithm to

recover the original parameters. We repeat this exercise 100 times, and find that the parameter

estimates are within two deviations of the original estimates 80% of the time and that the me-

dian deviation is just 0.67 times standard errors, showing that the parameters are reasonably

well identified.49




  49 Toget our parameter estimates, we ran two algorithms, a simulated annealing and a simplex al-
gorithm, but for these Monte Carlo experiments, we only run the simulated annealing. Identification
would probably be even better if we had automated the process and ran also the simplex algorithm.
