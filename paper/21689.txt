Factors Determining Callbacks to Job Applications by the Unemployed: An Audit Study

                                              ABSTRACT

We use an audit study approach to investigate how unemployment duration, age, and holding a low-
level “interim” job affect the likelihood that experienced college-educated females applying for an
administrative support job receive a callback from a potential employer. First, the results show no
relationship between callback rates and the duration of unemployment. Second, workers age 50 and
older are significantly less likely to receive a callback. Third, taking an interim job significantly reduces
the likelihood of receiving a callback. Finally, employers who have higher callback rates respond less
to observable differences across workers in determining whom to call back. We interpret these results
in the context of a model of employer learning about applicant quality.

1      Introduction
In this project, we use an audit study approach (e.g., Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004),
where we send carefully constructed fictitious job applications to posted job openings, in
order to investigate how several characteristics of workers affect the likelihood they receive
a callback when applying for a job. We focus on the recent employment history and age of
applicants, paying special attention to the effects of unemployment duration and of taking
a low-level, interim job. The study is motivated in part by the persistently long duration of
unemployment spells experienced by workers in the Great Recession and its aftermath. This
pattern is illustrated in Figure 1, which plots the mean and median duration of unemploy-
ment spells in progress by quarter from 1976 through 2014. Mean unemployment duration
peaked in 2011 at almost 37 weeks and has exceeded 30 weeks in all quarters between 2010q1
and 2014q2. Both mean and median duration remain well above their levels at any point
prior to 2008.
     This shift toward longer unemployment spells underscores the importance of understand-
ing whether workers who have been unemployed for a long period face more difficulty in find-
ing a job. The labor force transition data suggests that this is the case. Figure 2 contains
a plot of the monthly job finding rate (the probability of a U-E transition) by unemploy-
ment duration in months based on matched Current Population Survey (CPS) data from
2008-2014. This figure shows a sharp decline in the monthly job finding rate from about 25
percent early in unemployment spells to about 10 percent after one year. In order to study

the effect of unemployment duration on the likelihood of callback, we randomly varied the
duration of the current unemployment spell across applications in our audit study.
   The study is also motivated by an interest in the obstacles that older unemployed workers
face in job seeking. Figure 3 highlights the fact the average duration of unemployment spells
in progress have historically been substantially longer for older workers. For example, from
2014q1-2015q2, the average duration of an in-progress unemployment spell was 28 weeks
those aged 25-34, 31 weeks for those aged 35-44, and 36 weeks for those aged 45-64. The

difficulty that older workers have finding jobs is further illustrated using data from the
Displaced Workers Survey (DWS) from 1984-2014. Figure 4 illustrates that older job losers
have historically had higher post-displacement unemployment rates (measured at the DWS
survey date). Since the Great Recession period (job loss from 2007-2013), job losers 25-
44 years old had a 26.3 percent unemployment rate while the unemployment rate was 29.9
percent for 45-54 year old job losers and 35.1 percent 55-64 year old job losers. The difficulties
faced by older unemployed individuals lead some to spend long stretches out of work, and
some never return to employment (Song and von Wachter 2014). Given these patterns, it is
important to understand the role of age in hiring and its interaction with work history such
as unemployment duration and interim jobs.
   Our interest in age affected our study design in two ways. In contrast to several recent
audit studies of the effect of employment history on call back rates, our sample consists of
mature and older workers, for whom job loss and long-term unemployment may be partic-
ularly costly. In addition, to address the question of how age itself affects the likelihood of
callback, we randomly varied applicant’s age on a subset of applications, and we measured
differences in callback rates.
   Finally, we were interested in whether ending a recent spell of unemployment with a
short-term, lower-level interim job (e.g., in retail sales) is an effective strategy for improving
call back rates. It is well documented that in the aftermath of a job loss the degree of
mismatch and non-standard work histories increases, in particular during recessions (e.g.,
Farber, 1999; Elsby, Hobijn, and Şahin, 2010). How interim jobs can affect call back rates

                                                                                                   3
has direct practical relevance for unemployed workers seeking to obtain a good job while
making ends meet. Additionally, it is important to understand the extent to which a rise in
the incidence in interim employment affects call back, job finding, and, hence, unemployment
duration. Yet relatively little is known about the consequences of taking a low-level interim
job. Simple theories suggest it could have countervailing effects on callbacks. It might
be that holding a low-level interim job signals that the applicant is ambitious and hard
working, increasing the likelihood of callback. Alternatively, it might be that holding a low-
level interim job suggests to the employer than the applicant is not suitable for the job for
which the application was submitted. This could be a conscious choice of employers or a
mechanical reading of the resume that rules out applicants whose most recent job was not
related to the job for which the application was submitted. To investigate the role of a
low-level interim job on the likelihood of a callback, we included such an interim job on a
random subset of some applications, and we measured differences in callback rates.
      In order to focus efficiently on the three variables of interest, we limit the range of vari-
ation in other dimensions as is common in studies of this type. Specifically, we limit our
applications to administrative support jobs and we restrict the applicants to all be female
and to have a four-year college education. While this does limit any claims we might make
regarding the workforce as a whole, the facts that motivated our analysis regarding the inci-
dence of long-term unemployment and the relationship of age with long-term employment do
hold for this subgroup of the labor force. Figure 5 shows average duration of unemployment
spells in progress from the CPS since 2003 for college-educated females in administrative sup-
port occupations. While the samples are considerably smaller than for those for the entire
unemployed sample from the CPS (figure 4), there is a sharp increase in the average duration
of unemployment for these women since the Great Recession, and the average duration of
unemployment is significantly longer for older women.1 Thus, the facts we presented in the
introduction to motivate our analysis are important for the particular jobs we study.
      Our findings are clear with regard to the three variables of interest. First, we find
no relationship between unemployment duration and the callback rate. This is different
from the results in Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013) (KLN) and Ghayad (2014) in
the U.S. Those papers find a negative relationship between callback rates and duration of
unemployment that is concentrated in the first six or seven months of an unemployment

      Mean unemployment duration for college-educated females in administrative support occupations over
the 2008-2014 period is 10.2 weeks longer for women aged 45-64 than for women aged 25-44 (p-value of
difference less than 10−18 ).

spell. For longer spells, those papers estimate that the relationship between unemployment
duration and the callback rate is flat. Our findings are closest to those in Nunley et al.
(2014), who find no effect of unemployment duration, either past or present, on callbacks for
relatively recent college graduates in the United States.2 Eriksson and Rooth (2014), whose
study of the Swedish market also found no effect of unemployment duration on callback rates
for jobs that require a university degree, additionally found no effects before 6 months for
lower-skilled jobs. As we discuss in detail below, there are many potential reasons for the
differences across studies in results with regard to unemployment duration and callbacks.
We can explore some of them with existing data, but more data collection is necessary to
understand fully what drives the differences.
      Second, we find that older workers (in their fifties) are significantly less likely to receive
a callback than workers in their thirties and forties. This is consistent with the results in
Lahey (2008), who large negative effects of age on callbacks for women seeking entry-level
positions in the U.S.
      Third, we find that taking a low-level interim job significantly reduces the likelihood of
receiving a callback. This last result is similar to that in Nunley et al. (2014). That paper
found that relatively recent college graduates in the U.S. had substantially lower callbacks if
they were currently employed in jobs that did not require a college education and were not

suited to the job for which they were applying.
   Our results have some important implications. First, our findings help to underscore that
the effect of unemployment duration on call back rates found for younger workers in KLN
(2013) do not hold universally in the labor market. For the more seasoned female clerical
workers we focus on, long-term unemployment has no causal effect on call back rates. To-
gether with the other mixed findings in the literature, our finding calls into question whether
the well-known decline in the probability of job finding with unemployment duration is pri-
marily driven by a causal effect of unemployment duration due to employer behavior rather
than arising from some other source, such as negative selection or changes in workers’ search
behavior. Future work should seek to understand better the heterogeneity in treatment
effects between studies and demographic groups. Second, our results strengthens Lahey’s
(2008) finding and underscores that age discrimination may be a relevant phenomenon in the
U.S. labor market. Since we focus on workers with longer labor force histories, our findings
suggest that even substantial relevant labor market experience on the resumes we use do not
diminish the negative effect of age on call backs. Third, at a practical level, the fact that
interim jobs negatively affect the incidence of call back implies that unemployed workers
may be better advised remaining unemployed rather than compromising on job quality (or
at least they should not to advertise an interim job on their resume). Finally, our findings
on interim jobs implies that employers do you use information on the resumes to make in-
ferences even about mature and older workers. Standard employer learning theory would
suggest that the availability of many signals for these workers reduces the effect of any given
signal (e.g., Farber and Gibbons 1996). This could rationalize our zero result on the effect
of unemployment duration, but not the significant effects of interim jobs we find. It is an
open question whether these latter finding implies presence of employer learning in the sense
of the theory even for older workers, or whether it is due to mechanical screening of CVs by
human resource departments that may, for example, eliminate ’bad matches’ based on the
last entry on the CV.
   An additional finding is that, among jobs that received four applications, the negative
effect of age and interim job on the incidence of callback is substantially weaker (the effect
of unemployment duration remains zero) for those employers with high callback rates (e.g.,
3 callbacks out of 4 vs. 1 callback out of 4). This finding can be interpreted as an indication
that employers with a high demand for workers become less selective in deciding whether or
not to call back. This is consistent with the idea that particular signals on the resume may
matter less for the incidence of callback in a tighter labor market.

    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes and motivates many
details of the experimental design. Section 3 develops a model of employer learning to guide
interpretation of results. Sections 4 presents the results of simple, univariate analyses of
the experimental treatments on duration of unemployment, age, and interim job. Section 5
presents a multivariate analysis to gain additional precision of the estimates. Section 6 offers
some analysis of the disparate findings in the literature, and Section 7 concludes.


2     Research Design
The design of our audit study reflects several considerations and constraints with implications
for interpreting the results. Since as with any experiment in the social sciences, our design
choices affect the internal and external validity of our results, we describe the design and
setting of our study in detail.
    An audit study consists in sending fake resumes to actual job postings and measuring the
incidence of callback rates. The main estimates consists in differences in callback rates based
on randomly assigned differences in resume characteristics, such as age, job characteristics,
or employment dates. It is therefore paramount that the fake resumes and the variation in
the informational content be constructed as realistic as possible.
    To facilitate the tailoring of resumes and reduce idiosyncratic variation in callback rates
by job type, we restricted both the type of jobs to which we sent our resumes and the
demographic characteristics of the applicants. Applications were limited to white collar office
jobs such as administrative or executive assistants, receptionists, secretaries, office associates,
and the like. Because these jobs are disproportionately held by women, and gender differences
are not our focus, all applicants had female names. Each applicant had a four-year bachelor’s
degree from a non-elite public university or college with a current admission rate higher than
65 percent. In contrast to previous studies, our fictitious applicants also had substantial work
histories. The work histories consisted of three to six white collar office jobs, depending on
age. Prior to the current spell, these work histories had no spells of unemployment longer
than a month in the previous five years. Age or birth year were not listed in the resumes
but could be inferred from year of college completion and work experience. There was no
information included on the resumes regarding race, marital status or number of children.
    The context of our audit study is nationwide in that we submitted job applications to
openings in selected cities across the United States. To further be able to tailor our fictitious
resumes to jobs and the local labor market, we selected eight cities. Because we also wanted

to allow for differences in treatment effects by local unemployment rates, four of the cities we
chose had relatively low unemployment rates at the start of our study (Dallas TX, Omaha
NE, Pittsburgh PA, and Portland ME) and four of which had relatively high unemployment
rates in 2012 (Charlotte NC, Chicago IL, Sacramento CA, and Tampa FL). Table 1 contains
city-level unemployment rates for the eight cities in 2012 (early in our study period) and
2014 (late in our study period). The table illustrates the general improvement in the labor
market during the extended recovery from the Great Recession. Unemployment rates fell
in both the low- and the high-unemployment cities, and the relatively ordering of cities by
unemployment rate was preserved across groups.
       To further enhance the external validity of the experiment, the resumes were crafted
to be plausible and tailored to prospective employers in each of the eight cities we study.
Plausibility was created, as in Bertrand and Mullainanthan (2004), by crafting the fictitious
resumes from actual resumes posted on a site we did not use for submissions. These actual
(source) resumes were posted for job openings in the occupations we study, but in a city that
was not in the experiment. Each element of each source resume was migrated to each of the
eight target cities in which the experiment was conducted. This migration was performed by
finding residential addresses, employers, and institutions of post-secondary education in the
target city that are similar to those listed on the source resume.3 Names were not migrated
but instead selected to be common, according to the Social Security Administration, among
people of the relevant age cohort, but not hispanic in origin. The names selected are neutral
with regard to race and ethnicity (e.g., not obviously Asian, African-American, or Hispanic).

   3
      Similarity for the address was defined by the (minimum) Mahalanobis distance between the source
address and the target by census tract age, race, education, and income level. Similarity for employers was,
for large businesses, achieved by replacing the source employer with its chief competitor in the target city.
For small businesses, similarity was achieved by simple search for a target business in the same industry
with approximately the same age and number of employees. For government work, the source employer was
simply switched to that of the target jurisdiction. Similarity of the post-secondary schools was identified by
simple search using national ranking, public/private status, size, and distance to the target city.

The appendix includes a sample of four resumes that vary with regard to the characteristics
of interest (unemployment duration, age, and interim job).
   The basic structure of the actual experiment follows now standard methods for “corre-
spondence studies;” see, e.g., Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), Lahey (2008), and KLN
(2013). Specifically, we sent our crafted fictitious resumes in matched pairs or quadruples to
openings posted on two online job boards. The experiment proceeded in four rounds, which
are explained in detail below. Round 1 only randomly assigns unemployment duration to
one of two resumes sent to the same job posting. Round 2 differs from round 1 in that both
resumes sent to the same job posting receive a random unemployment duration. Round
3 differed from round 2 in that also the presence of an interim job is randomly assigned
(independently of unemployment duration). Round 4 differs from round 3 in that also the
implied age of the resume is randomly assigned. Details by round are:

  1. (2,054 applications, 1,027 jobs.) Conducted between March and May 2012, the first
     round involved submitting two applications (treatment and control) to each of 1,027
     job openings spread across the 8 cities. In this and all other rounds, the number
     of applications was roughly proportional to city size. The control applicant to each
     job had always just entered unemployment, while the treatment applicant had been
     unemployed for a number of weeks drawn at random from the set {4, 12, 24, 52}. The
     beginning of the unemployment spell was indicated on the resume by the end date of
     the applicant’s most recent job. Thus the control applicant’s resume indicated that
     her most recent job had ended in the month just prior to month the application was
     made. The applicant’s age varied (35, 40, 55, or 56) across applications, but age did
     not vary within the applicant pair for specific job postings. Age was identified by year
     of graduation from college and re-enforced by the employment history. Formatting of
     resumes was randomly varied to avoid detection of the experiment.

  2. (2,430 applications, 1,215 jobs.) In the second round, conducted between July and
     September 2012, the experimental design was identical to the first round with one
     exception. In this second round, each applicant had been unemployed for a number of
     weeks drawn at random, without replacement, from the set {0, 4, 12, 24, 52}. This
     change in design allowed us to account for the possibility that the two applicants in
     a pair were being directly compared by an employer and the control applicant, newly
     unemployed, was being mistaken for someone currently employed.

  3. (1,668 applications, 834 jobs.) The third round of the experiment, conducted between

                                              9
        November 2013 and April 2014 used the same methods as in round two to submit
        applications in matched pairs.4 In this round, however, we introduced the possibility
        that the applicant held an interim job. Applicants holding an interim job had just
        started work, the month prior to the month of the application, in a relatively low-
        skilled position at a chain restaurant, a big box retail store, or a grocery store. These
        interim jobs involved serving food, stocking shelves, or assisting customers at a register
        or on a retail floor, and were thus quite different from the career work on the rest of
        the resume. The randomization with respect to interim job was conducted at the
        application level, within matched pair. Thus, both the control and the treatment
        could be: employed in an interim job with some unemployment spell or unemployed
        with some other unemployment duration. We did not update the start dates of the
        resumes in this round, and the applicants therefore “aged.” Applicant’s age varied
        across job postings from the set {36, 37, 41, 42, 56, 57, 58}.

   4. (6,072 applications, 1,518 jobs). In the fourth and final round, conducted between April
        and August 2014, we submitted 4 (rather than 2) applications to each of 1,581 openings
        spread across the eight cities. This increase in the number of applications per job was
        motivated by two interests. First, we wanted to speed data collection, which experience
        indicated could be done by without risking detection of the experiment by doubling the
        number of applications per job. Second, we wanted to produce experimental variation
        in age, within job. Thus, the four applications per job consisted of two each from two
        different groups. One pair consisted of younger applicants (37 or 42), and the other
        consisted of older applicants (57 or 58). Randomization with respect to holding an
        interim job and variation in unemployment duration was as in round three.

      While gradually providing additional sources of variation, the fact that the experiment
occurred in four stages does not affect our results. In the empirical work, we begin by
analyzing the four rounds separately. We then show that the results that are comparable
between the four rounds are sufficiently similar that we can analyze them together.

  4
      The delay between rounds two and three was unintentional, and the result of two of the authors
(Silverman and von Wachter) moving their primary appointments to different universities. Additionally,
data were inadvertently collected in Portland OR rather than Portland ME in round 3. Since the relevant
resumes were tailored to Portland ME, we do not include the Portland OR applications in the analysis.
Thus, there are only 7 cities in Round 3.

3         A Model of Learning about Applicant Quality
When employers evaluate an applicant for a job, they have incomplete information about the
quality of the worker. Employers use observable information available in the worker’s appli-
cation to form an expectation about the worker’s quality. This information includes, among
other things, worker demographics, education, work history, and unemployment experience.
In this section, we develop a very simple model of employer learning about applicant quality
in order to motivate the analysis and to provide clear predictions and a clear framework for
interpreting the results of the audit study.
        We assume a profit-maximizing, risk-neutral firm with a single worker. The output (Y )
of the firm is equal to the quality of the worker (µ). We assume all potential workers will
be paid the same wage so that the firm is interested in hiring the most able worker among
applicants for its job opening.5 Our model captures the employer’s process of integrating
available information to form an expectation of applicant quality.6
        Consider applicant i. The firm has incomplete information about µi and makes an infer-
ence based on a set of k noisy signals. For the purposes of our study, these signals include,
among other background information, the applicant’s unemployment experience, age, and
whether the applicant holds an interim job. Let sij represent the j th noisy signal of µi . We
assume this j th signal satisfies
                                                       1
                                               sij =      µi + γij ,                                       (1)
                                                       αj
where γij is a normally distributed random variable with zero mean and variance σj2 . The
parameters αj are normalizations that account for the fact that some signals are positive and
some are negative as well as for differential scaling of the signals. For example, unemployment
duration would have αj < 0, but interim job might have αj > 0. The employer’s inference
problem is to combine the available information on sij , j = 1, ..., k optimally in order to
derive an expected value for applicant quality (E(µi |si1 , ..., sik )).
        Think of sij as prior information on applicant quality so that the posterior beliefs about
applicant quality can be derived using a standard Bayesian procedure. Given the distri-
butional assumption regarding the γij , each signal sij about applicant quality is normally

    5
        Note that the quality of applicants will likely depend on the offered wage.
    6
     While we do not include sequential search in our model, such a model would clearly have the property
that the employer will set a reservation worker quality level as part of the search process and call back those
applicants whose expected quality exceeds this threshold. Thus, applicants with higher expected quality will
be more likely to receive a callback.



                                                        11
distributed with mean µi /αj and variance σj2 . In describing how information about sij is
combined to form the employer’s posterior distribution on applicant quality, it is convenient
to use the precisions of the random variables rather than the variances. The precision (h) of
a random variable is the inverse of the variance, so that sij with variance σj2 has precision
hj ≡ 1/σj2 . In this Normal Bayesian updating model, the posterior distribution of the em-
ployer’s beliefs about µi is normal with a mean that is a precision-weighted average of the k
signals. The posterior expectation is
                                                         Pk
                                                          j=1   hj αj sij
                              E(µi |si1 , ..., sik ) =    Pk                .             (2)
                                                              j=1   hj

   Consider the implication of the model for the effect of signal m on the likelihood of
callback. The marginal effect of a change in sim is
                                                "          #
                                  ∂E(µi )           hm
                                          = αm Pk                                         (3)
                                   ∂sim             j=1 hj

which takes the sign of αm . If signal m is unemployment duration then, presumably, αm ≤ 0,
and the marginal effect of unemployment duration is negative. Thus, workers with longer
unemployment duration have lower posterior mean worker quality. This makes their posterior
expected quality less likely to exceed the necessary threshold and reduces the likelihood of
callback. Analogously, if signal m is age and age is a negative signal of worker quality, then
αm ≤ 0 and older workers have lower posterior mean worker quality. Again, this makes
their posterior expected quality less likely to exceed the necessary threshold and reduces
the likelihood of callback. Given the opposing predictions regarding the value of holding a
low-level interim job, the sign of αm in this case is unknown, and we have no clear prediction
on how the likelihood of callback varies with the holding of a low-level interim job.
   There are at least two second-order predictions of the model. First, related to unem-
ployment duration, it is likely that there is more information about applicant quality in the
duration of unemployment when the labor market is tighter (lower unemployment rate). In
terms of the model, the precision associated with the unemployment duration signal is higher
where the local unemployment rate is lower so that there is relatively more updating based
on unemployment duration. Formally,
                                        "        #"            #
                         ∂ 2 E(µi )         1           hm
                                    = αm Pk        1 − Pk                                 (4)
                         ∂sim ∂hm         j=1 hj        j=1 hj

which has the sign of αm . Because αm ≤ 0 where sm represents unemployment duration, the
negative marginal effect of unemployment duration on the likelihood of callback (equation 3)

                                                  12
is larger in absolute value in tighter labor markets (equation 4). In other words, the negative
marginal effect of unemployment duration on the callback rate will be more substantial in
stronger labor markets.7
        The other second-order prediction of the model is that where there are more signals of
worker quality, the marginal effect of any one signal will be smaller in absolute value. This
is relevant when thinking about the role of applicant age. An older worker has more prior
work experience. This comes in the form of more and perhaps longer prior jobs. In the
context of the model, longer experience and more information increase the number of signals
(k). The marginal effect of a particular signal is given in equation 3. On inspection of
this relationship, an increase in k simply increases the denominator in the term in brackets.
The result is a reduction in the absolute value of the marginal effect any particular existing
signal. This predicts, for example, that the marginal effect of unemployment duration will
be smaller for older workers. Intuitively, older workers have a longer employment history
that will dilute the effect of recent unemployment on the likelihood of callback.
        A final prediction is not based strictly on the updating model. If an employer has a great
need for workers as indicated by a higher callback rate for applicants to the particular job,
then the employer may not be as selective. The result will be that the threshold posterior
mean worker quality necessary for a callback will be lower where demand is high. A clear
implication of this is that the marginal effect of particular worker attributes (unemployment
duration, age, and the holding of a low-level interim job in case) on the likelihood of callback
will be lower for less selective employers.
        The foregoing model presents only one way in which employers may use resume infor-
mation to draw inferences about applicant suitability for the job. Other approaches may
include mechanical screening of resumes to filter out workers that are an obvious mismatch.
Another approach would be screening based on tastes for particular worker attributes, such
as age. We will not be able to test between alternative approaches, but keep those in mind
when interpreting our findings.


4         Descriptive Analysis
We begin by separately analyzing the effect of our three main factors, duration of unemploy-
ment, worker age, and presence of interim job, separately. In the next section, we analyze

    7
        This is a result found by Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013).



                                                      13
the effect of these characteristics jointly. To set the stage, note that our mean callback rate
across all rounds is 10.4 percent. One plausibility check that our resumes work as intended,
is that the callback rate was significantly higher (12.2 percent) in our low-unemployment
cities than in our high-unemployment cities (8.9 percent) with a p-value of the difference
< 0.0005.


4.1       Duration of Unemployment
A primary focus of this study is to examine the effect of unemployment duration on the
likelihood of an employer callback to a job application. All four rounds incorporated variation
in weeks of unemployment including base values of 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and
52 weeks.8 Table 2 contains mean callback rates overall and by round for each of the five
baseline values for unemployment duration. There is no systematic relationship (positive
or negative) between the probability of callback and the duration of unemployment. The
hypothesis that the callback rates are equal across unemployment duration treatments cannot
be rejected (p-value = 0.53 overall).9
       The variation in unemployment duration treatment within job posting in each round
offers the opportunity to examine within-posting variation in callback rates by unemploy-
ment treatment. The fixed-effect conditional logit analysis due to Chamberlain (1980) is a
natural way to estimate this within-posting effect. Intuitively, the fixed-effect conditional
logit conditions on the number of successes (callbacks) within each job posting and asks
whether the applicants with longer unemployment durations were less likely to be among
those who received the fixed number of callbacks. This approach ignores the job postings
for which there was no variation in the outcome. In the 3076 job postings in rounds 1-3,
for which there were 2 applications per job posting, 2591 postings had no callbacks and 229
postings had 2 callbacks. This leaves 256 postings with 1 callback. In the 1518 job postings
in round 4, where there were 4 applications per job posting, 1215 postings had no callbacks
and 30 postings had 4 callbacks. This leaves 150 postings with 1 callback, 85 postings with
2 callbacks, and 38 postings with 3 callbacks.

   8
     These are the weeks of unemployment implicit in the applications at fixed dates. Since the applications
were submitted over a period of time following that date, the actual durations seen by potential employers
are somewhat longer. Actual unemployment duration exceed each base value by about 4 weeks on average
(standard deviation of about 1.1 weeks for each base value).
   9
    The hypothesis of equality of callback rates across unemployment duration treatments cannot be rejected
within any of the four rounds, with p-values ranging from 0.23 in round 1 to 0.71 in round 3.

   We postpone estimation of the full Chamberlain fixed-effect logit model until Section 5
and, for now, present just estimates of the average callback rates by unemployment treatment
conditional on the number of callbacks received for the job posting. Table 3 contains these
callback rates conditional on the number of callbacks received. Column 1 of the table contains
average callback rates by unemployment treatment for job postings in rounds 1-3 with a single
callback. There is no obvious relationship between the callback rate and the unemployment
treatment, and the hypothesis that callback rates are equal across treatments cannot be
rejected (p-value = 0.85). Column 2 shows average callback rates in round 4 for job postings
with 1-3 callbacks for each treatment. These appear to show, counter to expectations, that
callback rates are higher where a longer unemployment spell is indicated on the application.
However, once again the hypothesis that callback rates are equal across treatments cannot
be rejected (p-value = 0.46). The last three columns of table 3 shows average callback rates
in round 4 for job postings with 1, 2, and 3 callbacks respectively for each treatment. In no
case can the hypothesis that callback rates are equal across treatments be rejected (p-values
= 0.78, 0.32, and 0.91 respectively).
   Overall, while we will revisit this question in more detail later, the simple comparison
of means suggests that the length of unemployment spell indicated on a job application
does not affect the probability of receiving a callback for the type of job we are considering
(white-collar office support jobs).

    The theory outlined in Section 3 implied that the marginal effect of unemployment dura-
tion will be larger in tighter labor markets. This suggests that there might be a relationship
between unemployment duration and the probability of callback in the low unemployment
cities but not in the high unemployment cities. While we do not show the results here, we
repeated our analysis separately in the low- and high unemployment cities. No perceptible
relationship between unemployment duration and the callback rate was found in either group
of cities.


4.2     Age
Figure 4 showed that older job losers are more likely to be unemployed at a fixed date
subsequent to a job loss. It has been a long-standing question in labor economics whether
the stark differences by age shown in the figure may partly reflect a reluctance by employers
to hire older job applicants. More generally, age may be an important factor for employers
when selecting new employees. This motivated the random variation of age of applicant in
the resumes we submitted as part of our audit study, and, in this section, we present our
estimates of callback rates as a function of applicant age.
    Two applications were submitted to each of 3076 job postings in rounds 1-3, and each

job posting was randomly assigned to an age category. Both applications to each job posting
listed the same birth date as implied by the year of graduation from college.10 Approximately
one-third of the job postings were randomly assigned in each age category (32.5 percent
aged 35-37. 33.5 percent aged 40-42, and 34.0 percent aged 55-58). Four applications
were submitted to each of 1518 job postings in round 4. Two applications per posting were
randomly assigned to be in the oldest age category (55-58) and the remaining two applications
were assigned to be in a younger category. The result is that in round 4, roughly one-quarter
of the applicants are 35-37 years of age, one-quarter of the applicants are 40-42 years of age,
and half of the applicants are 55-58 years old.
       The first column of table 4 contains the callback rates for all four rounds, both overall
(last row) and by age group. The overall callback rate is 10.4 percent. There is not a
significant difference between the callback rates for applicants aged 35-37 and applicants
aged 40-42 (p-value of difference = 0.97). However, the callback rate for applicants aged 55-
58 is substantially and significantly lower (by about 2 percentage points) than the callback
rate for younger workers (p-values of differences < 0.01).
       The remaining columns of table 4 contain the callback rates separately by round. While
mean callback rates for workers age 55-58 are lower than the average callback rates for 35-42
year olds, these differences are not statistically significant from zero in the first three rounds.
However, there is a substantial difference by age in round 4. In round 4, applicants aged

  10
     In fact, the actual ages of the two applications for a posting could differ by one year given that age is
determined by birth date and the applications were sometimes submitted on different dates.

   0.5 for postings with 2 callbacks, and 0.75 for postings with 3 callbacks. Numbers

55-58 have a 7.6 percent callback rate compared with callback rates in the 10 to 11 percent
range for younger applicants (p-values of differences < 0.005).
   The variation in age of applicant within job posting in round 4 offers the opportunity to
examine within-posting variation in callback rates by age. As we did earlier with respect to
the unemployment treatment, we focus on the job postings for which there was variation in
the outcome. We ignore the job postings for which there was no variation in the outcome
(The 1215 of 1518 postings with no callbacks and the 30 of 1518 postings with 4 callbacks).
This leaves 150 postings with 1 callback, 85 postings with 2 callbacks, and 38 postings with
3 callbacks). While we do not estimate Chamberlain fixed-effect logit model directly at this
point, we do present estimates of the average callback rates by age group conditional on the
number of callbacks received for the job posting.
   Table 5 contains mean callback rates in round 4 for postings that received 1 to 3 callbacks.
The evidence is clear. Applicants in the oldest age groups received callbacks at a significantly
lower rate than applicants in either of the two younger groups. For the 150 postings in which
one of four applications received callbacks (for an aggregate callback rate of 25 percent),
applicants in their 50s received callbacks at a rate 16 percentage points less than applicants
their 30s or 40s (about a 50 percent lower callback rate). For the 85 postings postings
in which two of four applications received callbacks (for an aggregate callback rate of 50
percent), applicants in their 50s received callbacks at a rate that is 16 percentage points less
than applicants in their 30s (about a 30 percent lower callback rate) and 30.3 percentage
points less than applicants in their 40s (about a 47 percent lower callback rate). There is no
difference in callback rates by age for the 38 postings in which three of the four applications
received callbacks. Applicants in each of the three age groups had callback rates very close

                                              18
to the 75 percent overall rate.
   Overall, Table 5 confirms the negative effect of age on callback even holding the job-
specific callback rate constant. In addition, the finding of no difference in callback rates
by age category for job postings with three callbacks is consistent with our hypothesis that
worker characteristics are less important when employers are less selective, as indicated in
this case by callbacks to 3 of 4 applicants. The high callback rate may reflect a need by the
employers to fill a large number of jobs quickly. In this case the employer would accept most
of the applicants and be less sensitive to individual characteristics. This implies that these
employers should be less sensitive to other worker characteristics as well, and we examine this
directly below. However, the overall pattern is clear. Employers are generally substantially
less like to call back older job applicants.


4.3    Interim Jobs
An important decision facing an unemployed worker is whether to take an interim job at a
lower level than, and not directly relevant to, the job the worker is seeking. The obvious
positive aspect of taking such a job is that it provides income to the unemployed worker,
particularly if the worker is not receiving unemployment compensation. Another possible
advantage is that potential employers may infer from the fact that the worker has taken
such a job that he/she is hardworking and strongly motivated to stay employed. However,
it is possible that potential employers will infer that the worker is not of appropriate quality
precisely because the he/she has been working in a lower level job. In some cases, this
may be the result of the employer using some kind of automated or cursory screening of job
applications that rejects applications if their most recent job is not relevant to the job for
which the applicant is applying.
   Which of these potential mechanisms is at work or which dominates is an empirical ques-
tion that we address. Beginning in round 3, we introduced a treatment to interrupt a spell
of unemployment with work at a low-level interim job. We defined an interim job as one
with low wages and for which the candidate appeared ill-matched (in terms of education
and previous experience). For example, the interim jobs included sales associate or cashier
at a big box or grocery store, and restaurant server. The resumes with such jobs indicate
that the job was currently held by the new applicants and started in the month just prior
to the application. These jobs interrupted an unemployment spell of varying duration iden-
tical to those unemployment spells we investigate directly (0, 4, 12, 24, or 52 weeks). The
randomization with respect to interim job was conducted at the application level, within job

posting. Interim jobs appeared on an application with probability 0.5. In round three, with
two applications per job posting, there could be 0, 1, 2 applications with an interim job. In
round four, with four applications per job posting, there could be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 applications
with an interim job.
   Of the 834 job postings analyzed in round 3, for 219 (26.3 percent) neither of the appli-
cations indicated an interim job, for 391 (46.9 percent) one of the two indicated an interim
job, and for 224 (26.9 percent) both applications indicated an interim job. Of the 1518
job postings analyzed in round 4, for 77 (5.1 percent) none of the applications included an
interim job, for 438 (28.9 percent) one of the applications included an interim job, for 516
(34.0 percent) two of the applications included an interim job, for 419 (27.6 percent) three
of the applications included an interim job, and for 68 (4.5 percent) all four applications
included an interim job.
   The applications in rounds three and four varied randomly in unemployment duration
and age, and this variation is independent of the variation in interim job. We account for
these other dimensions of variation in the multivariate analysis below.
   Table 6 contains mean callback rates for rounds 3 and 4 by whether or not an interim job
was indicated on the application. The overall callback rate in rounds 3 and 4 was 9.2 percent.
The call back rate was 9.8 percent where there was no interim job versus 8.5 percent where
there was an interim job. This difference of 1.3 percentage points (15 percent) is statistically
significant (p-value = 0.038). When analyzed separately by round, there is no difference
in round 3 and a larger statistically significant difference in round 4 (9.9 percent with no
interim job versus 8.4 percent with an interim job).
   Given the within-job randomization of the existence of an interim job, we once again
examine how callbacks vary with an interim job within job posting. Again, this analysis is

   Note: By construction, the average callback rate in round 3 is 0.5 for postings with
   1 callback. Similarly, the average callback rate in round 4 is 0.25 for postings with
   1 callback, 0.5 for postings with 2 callbacks, and 0.75 for postings with 3 callbacks.

restricted to applications to job postings for which there was variation in callback. Table
7 contains mean callback rates for postings in round 3 that received 1 callback and in
round 4 for postings that received 1 to 3 callbacks. Although the point estimate of the
difference in call-back rates for single-callback postings in round 3 is negative and substantial
in magnitude, this difference is not statistically significant given the small number of postings
(59) that meet the sample criteria. The difference in call-back rates for postings with one to
three callbacks in round 4 is a statistically significant 7.1 percentage points (p-value=0.015).
This difference is driven by a large negative difference in callbacks by interim job status (13.0
percentage points) for the 150 postings that received a one call-back (p-value < 0.0005). The
differences in callback rates by interim job status for postings with 2 or 3 callbacks are not
statistically significant.
   The overall pattern of results suggests that holding a job that is lower skill and irrelevant
to the job for which the individual is applying reduces the likelihood of a callback, at least
for selective employers. It appears that an unemployed worker is better off remaining unem-
ployed and searching for work rather than being employed in a low-level job while searching.
Alternatively, if an applicant has taken a low-level interim job, they may be better off not
listing this job on their resume.
   In addition, again the finding of a significant difference in callback rates by interim job
status in round 4 only for job with one callback and not for jobs with more callbacks is (as
with age) is consistent with our hypothesis that worker characteristics are more important
when employers are more selective, as indicated in this case by callbacks to a single applicant.

5        Multivariate Analysis
We now turn to a multivariate analysis that models the probability of call-back as a function
of unemployment duration, age, and interim job. This analysis first uses both within- and
between-posting variation in application characteristics. We choose the logit model for sev-
eral reasons. In principle, it should provide a better approximation of the funcational form
for binary choice probabilities with a relative low incidence.11 Given the canonical sample
design of recent audit studies that provide random variation within, a particular advantage
of the logit model is that it provides a consistent approach that allows us to obtain esti-
mates for that rely on within-posting variation via the Chamberlain fixed-effect logit model.
Finally, the logit model allow us to contrast the fixed-effect estimater with a random effects
logit, our preferred specification.
       The random effects model accounts for the fact that job postings are randomly drawn
from the underlying population and may differ in their mean callback rate. This model is
appropriate (yields consistent estimates) where the baseline variation across job postings
in their callback rates is uncorrelated with the observed applicant characteristics of inter-
est. Given our approach in sending resumes to job listings with key characteristics varying
randomly, we would not expect the job-specific callback rate to be correlated with resume
characteristics so that estimates derived using the random effects model should be consistent.
More generally, since the three treatments were assigned independently to resumes, there is
no reason to expect that the multivariate analysis in general, and the conditional logit in
particular, will affect our main results.
       Table 8 presents the main results of our multivariate analysis. We report our findings in
terms of odds ratios, which for small probabilities are approximately the ratio of probabilities
of callback given a treatment vs. no treatment.12 Age enters as a dummy variable for whether
a worker is 55-58 years of age (rather than 35-42). The first three columns present results
for the logit, random effects logit, and fixed-effects logit, respectively, pooling four rounds.
       Recall that there is 1) within opening variation in unemployment duration in all rounds,
2) within opening variation in age only in round 4, and 3) within opening variation (or any

  11
      We have reproduced these findings with linear probability and probit models, and the results are not
affected by the choice of functional form.

     Let p(1) ≡ P r{Callback = 1|X, D = 1} and p(0) ≡ P r{Callback = 1|X, D = 0}, where D represents
one of our right hand side dummy variables, and X represents the remaining variables in the model. Then
the odds ratio R is defined as R ≡ p(1)/(1−p(1))

variation for that matter) in interim job holding only in rounds 3 and 4. The simple logit
and random-effect logit models (columns 1 and 2) use all available variation for all factors,
even if they were not randomly assigned within jobs. The between-job variation yields valid
estimates, since the pairing of resumes with jobs was effectively random with respect to job
and resume characteristics. To make sure our our results are not affected by the inclusion of
variation between jobs, we then implement the fixed-effects logit model, which relies only on
within opening variation. The within variation for unemployment duration is coming from
all four rounds; it is coming from round 4 for age; it is coming from rounds 3 and 4 for
interim job. To examine a specification where all three factors are treated symmetrically,
we then restrict the analysis to round 4, where there are four applications per opening and
within-opening variation in all three factors. The logit, random-effects logit, and fixed-effects
logit for data from round 4 only is shown in in columns 4 to 6 of Table 8.
   Given we have purposefully chosen to work with a homogeneous groups of workers, the
only control variable (other than dummies for rounds in columns 1 and 2) is a dummy
for whether the city was initially classified as one of our low unemployment cities (Dallas,
Omaha, Pittsburgh, Portland ME) or as one of our high unemployment cities (Charlotte,
Chicago, Sacramento, Tampa). This effect is identified only from between job-opening vari-
ation.
   Overall and as expected, the results in Table 8 confirm our three main findings from the
previous section. There is no detectable effect of unemployment duration on callback rates.
The χ2 test statistic and corresponding p-value we present are for the null hypothesis that
the four coefficients on the unemployment duration dummies are jointly equal to zero. In
none of our models can we reject this null hypothesis. Again, we find there is a precisely
estimated negative effect (an estimated odds ratio less than one) of age on the callback
rate. Finally, there is a substantial negative effect of reporting holding an interim job on the
callback rate.
   The first column of table 8 shows basic logit estimates pooling all four rounds, clustering
standard errors at the job level. The second column adds random effects. As expected,
controlling for random variation in the callback rates across openings improves the fit of
the model substantially (as indicated by the improvement in the log-likelihood value) and
reduces standard errors slightly. The odds ratio on age drops from 0.8 to 0.57. We have no
economic explanation for this, since the random effects are not correlated with the indepen-
dent variable. However, their presence change the interpretation of the coefficient. Whereas
the coefficients of the logit model can be interpreted as the average effect in the population,

coefficients of the random effects model are the effects holding constant the within-opening
callback propensity. Third column contains estimates of the Chamberlain fixed-effect logit
model, which uses only those job openings for which there was variation in callback rates (one
callback in rounds 1-3 and one to three callbacks in round 4). As expected given the random
assignment of characteristics to resumes, the fixed-effect estimates are virtually identical to
the random-effect estimates in column 2. In order to formally compare the random and fixed
effects models, we performed a Hausman test. The value of the χ2 -test statistic (6 degrees
of freedom) is 2.69 with p-value of 0.85, implying we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
fixed effects are uncorrelated with the factors included in the model.
   Columns 4-6 show the results of repeating the analysis using only data from round 4,


                                                  24
where there are four applications per opening and within-opening random variation in all
three factors. The results are very similar compared to the model pooling all rounds. The
only notable difference is that the coefficient on the dummy for a low local unemployment
rate in columns 4 and 5 is not statistically significant (odds-ratio not significantly different
from 1) anymore. Note, however, that round 4 was fielded substantially later than the earlier
rounds, and, while differences in unemployment rates across labor markets persisted, they
are smaller in 2014 (when round 4 was fielded) than earlier.
   Column 6 then presents findings for the fixed-effect logit model for round 4. As we noted,
the model is identified only from qudruplets of job applications in which callback varies (1-
3 callbacks to 4 applications). Dropping the 1215 job postings for which we received no
callbacks and the 30 job postings for which all four applications received callbacks leaves
leaves 1092 observations for 273 job postings, a reduction of over 80% with respect to the
full round 4 model in columns 4 and 5 (6072 observations for 1518 job postings). Nevertheless,
the results in column 6 are very similar to those from the random effects logit in column
5, particularly with regard to the effect of age and interim job. Once again, we performed
a Hausman test of the hypothesis that the fixed effects are uncorrelated with the factors
included in the model. The value of the χ2 -test statistic is 1.63 with p-value of 0.95, implying,
as with the estimates for all four rounds, that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the fixed
effects are uncorrelated with the factors included in the model.
   Overall, the results in Table 8 confirm our main findings using the full power of the
pooled sample. We tried various alternative specifications, none of which yielded additional
statistically meaningful findings. In particular, we tried to assess whether the effects of
unemployment duration, age, and interim jobs vary with the local unemployment rate. This
is particularly interesting, because a key result of KLN’s analysis was that the effect of
unemployment duration on callback rates is lower in markets with higher unemployment
rates. Not surprisingly, our finding, that unemployment duration on the resume does not
affect the callback rate, does not vary with the local unemployment rate. We also do not
find that the effect of age or interim jobs varies by the state of the local labor market.
   Again mirroring our univariate analysis, in Table 9 we replicate the main logit model
using observations only from round 4 separately for jobs with different numbers of callbacks.
Column 1 from the table simply replicates column 4 from Table 8. Column 2 then shows
the results when we drop jobs for which either all or none of the resumes we sent received
a callback. Our results on age and interim jobs are unchanged, with older applicants and

applicants who report holding an interim job substantially less likely to receive a callback.13
Columns 3 to 5 in Table 9 then show the results for different number of callbacks per
application. Consistent with the findings in our univariate analysis, the effect of age is
present for only applications to jobs with one or two callbacks. There is no significant
difference in callback rates by age for jobs with three callbacks. The effect of reporting the
holding of an interim job is present only for applications to jobs with one callback. There is
no significant difference in callback rates by interim jobs for jobs with two or three callbacks.
Consistent with the earlier results, there is no relationship between the likelihood of callback
and unemployment duration for any group we study.

  13
     Note that column 2 in Table 9 uses the same sample as column 6 in Table 8, and the results are very
similar.


                                                  26
    The pattern of results in Table 9 confirms our finding from the descriptive analysis in
Section 4 that employers who are eager to hire – and hence have a higher callback rate
for their job posting – are less choosy, i.e., resume characteristics appear to matter less in
determining callback. When employers are “hungry” for workers, they are less selective.
This supports the view that a strong labor market can play an important role in reducing
the disadvantage of particular types of applicants (e.g., older applicants) in searching for
jobs.


6       Reconciliation with Earlier Work
Our finding of no relationship between the duration of unemployment and the likelihood of
a callback for mature and older workers is consistent with some prior audit studies and at
odds with others. The closest parallel studies that find important effects of unemployment
duration is that of Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013) and Ghayad (2014). Those studies
finds that in the U.S. in 2011-2012 shorter unemployment spells reduced callback significantly
for younger workers. In contrast, Nunley et al (forthcoming) finds that for relatively recent
U.S. college graduates unemployment duration has no effect on callbacks. The results of
a Swedish audit study of Eriksson and Rooth (2014) also pertain to younger workers, and
imply no effect of shorter ongoing unemployment spells or past unemployment spells on the
callback rate, but a negative effect of long current unemployment spells on callback.
    While these studies follow a comparable basic blueprint, it is important to recognize that
there are subtle and not-so-subtle differences in the implementation that could affect the
results. In particular, our study is narrowly targeted at one type of worker in one type of
job. By focusing on female administrative support workers with a 4-year college education,
we have a relatively clean design without having to control for confounding variables. But
this is at the cost of potentially limited external validity. Additionally, while we cover a
fairly wide age range, we do not include the very young workers who are the focus of some
of the earlier studies.
    In this section, we explore differences among the studies that could account for the
difference in results. We focus particularly on the Kroft, Lange and Notowidigdo analysis
because 1) like ours, it is U.S. based in the post-Great-Recession period and encompasses
most of our cities; 2) many of the jobs in their analysis are of the same type as ours, allowing
for a direct comparison in callback rates; 3) the data are publicly available, allowing us
to comparable models on their data and our data; 4) the paper has already been highly


                                              27
influential. All of this provides strong motivation to carefully assess the extent to which
their approach is comparable to ours.14 For ease of exposition, we refer to this study as
“KLN” and to our study as “FSvW”.
       In the following we focus on five key differences in the design and implementation of the
KLN and FSvW studies that could account for the difference in results: 1) outcome measure,
2) type of job for which applications are submitted, 3) time period, 4) choice of cities, 5)
education level, and 6) age range of the applicants. We consider each of these in turn.


6.1       The Outcome Measure
The KLN analysis focuses on callbacks that include a request for an interview while our study
and those of Ghayad (2014) and Eriksson and Rooth (2013) focus on all callbacks, regardless
of whether or not there was an interview request. This is reflected in a difference in reported
callback rates. Our callback rate was 10.4 percent while the KLN callback-w/interview rate
was 4.7 percent. Using data supplied by KLN, we calculate that the overall callback rate in
KLN was 12.1 percent, comparable in magnitude to the callback rate we found.
       The key question here is whether the KLN overall callback rate is negatively related to the
length of unemployment spell. In order to address this question, we obtained a copy of the
data KLN used. Using both these data and the data from our study, we estimate a simple
model of the effect of unemployment duration on the probability of callback. The model
we use is a simple logit model with only a constant and the duration of unemployment in
months. Table 10 contains the results of this analysis. The first row of this table contains the
estimate of the marginal effect of unemployment duration on the callback rate for the overall
FSvW sample, and it confirms the finding of no significant relationship in our sample. The
second and third rows of this table contain estimates of the marginal effect of unemployment
duration on the callback rate for the overall KLN sample for the two definitions of callback.
The estimate in row 2 uses KLN’s preferred callback/interview measure and confirms their
finding of a significant negative effect of unemployment duration. Our reanalysis of the KLN
overall callback measure in row 3 shows an even stronger negative relationship between the
duration of unemployment and the probability of callback. Thus the difference in outcome

     Ghayad (2014) collected data in the U.S. in 2012 for 3 broad occupations (administrative, sales, and
professional) in four broad industries. Eriksson and Rooth (2014) collected data in Sweden in 2007 for 7
occupations (business sales assistant, cleaner, construction worker, machine operator, motor-vehicle driver,
restaurant worker, and shop sales assistant). In contrast, our data were collected from 2012-2014 for a
single broad occupation (white collar office jobs such as administrative or executive assistants, receptionists,
secretaries, and office associates).

measure is not a factor that can explain the difference in findings. The point estimate in
row 3 of the table implies a reduction in the probability of callback of about 0.8 percentage
points per month of unemployment. This is a reduction of about 7 percent at the mean of
12.05 percent, a substantial effect!
   In order to maintain comparability with our analysis, our reanalysis of the KLN data
continues using the measure of the overall callback rate rather than the callback/interview
measure.




                                                29
6.2       Variation in Job Type
All job applied for in the FSvW analysis were white-collar office support jobs and all ap-
plicants were female. The KLN analysis included applications for three types of jobs: 1)
administrative support and clerical, 2) customer service, and 3) sales. The first KLN occu-
pational group, administrative support and clerical, is comparable to the office support jobs
in the FSvW analysis, and 96.4 percent of the 2690 applicants for these jobs in the KLN
sample were female.
       Row 4 of table 10 contains results of the analysis for the KLN administrative support
and clerical jobs. The first thing to note is that the overall callback rate for these jobs
in the KLN data is extremely low at 3.61 percent. There were only 97 callbacks to 2690
applications for this type of job. Still, there is a statistically significant negative relationship
between unemployment duration and the probability of a callback. However, it is only about
56 percent as large as the estimated effect in the overall KLN sample. The point estimate in
row 4 of the table implies a reduction in the probability of callback of about 0.5 percentage
points. This is a reduction of about 13 percent at the mean callback rate of 3.61 percent,
comparable to the implied effect for the full sample in row 3. We conclude that variation in
the type of job does not account for the qualitative difference between our results and those
of KLN.


6.3       Education Level
Related to job type is the skill level of the applicants. All applicants in the FSvW analysis
were graduates of 4-year colleges. In contrast, the KLN analysis included applicants who
had completed high school (20 percent), community college (42 percent), and 4-year college
(38 percent). There is no difference in callback rates by education level in the KLN analysis,
but it is worth investigating whether the relationship of the likelihood of callback with
unemployment duration holds up for the KLN 4-year college graduates.15
       Row 5 of table 10 contains results of the analysis for the KLN applicants who have a four-
year college degree. The callback rate for these applicants is very close to the overall callback
rate in the KLN data. The marginal effect of unemployment duration on the probability
of callback is significantly negative for the KLN four-year college graduates and larger in
magnitude than for the overall sample (compare rows 6 and 3 of table 10). We conclude that

  15
       The p-value for test of independence of callback and education in a two-way table is 0.497.



                                                      30
variation in the education level of applicants does not account for the qualitative difference
between our results and those of KLN.16


6.4       Time Period
The KLN analysis is based on job applications submitted between June 2011 and July 2012
while the FSvW analysis is based on applications submitted between March 2012 and August
2014. Clearly, the KLN analysis is much earlier in the period of recovery from the Great
Recession. This may be part of the explanation for the fact that KLN find a much lower call-
back rate to their applications for comparable jobs (3.61 percent for administrative/clerical
jobs) than we find (10.4 percent).17 However, the information-based theory highlighted by
both KLN and FSvW suggests that, to the extent employers infer worker quality partly from
unemployment duration, the negative effect of unemployment duration on the callback rate
should grow as the recovery proceeds and the labor market strengthens. in fact, even for our
data from round 1 in 2012 we find a zero effect, in contrast with the basic updating model.18
       A potential source of reconciliation between the disparate findings of KLN and FSvW is
suggested by our within-posting analysis. The results in (Table 9) suggest that observable
characteristics are more important when callback rates are lower (e.g., 1 callback from 4
applications as opposed to 3 callbacks from 4 applications). The generally lower overall
callback rates found by KLN are consistent with employers exercising more discretion in
callbacks so that unemployment duration could play a more important role in the time
period covered by their sample.


6.5       Geographic Variation
As explained in Section 2, FSvW analysis was designed to cover 8 metropolitan areas, 4 with
relatively low unemployment rates (Dallas, Omaha, Pittsburgh, and Portland ME) and 4

  16
     We also examined the smaller subset of the KLN sample that consisted of four-year college graduates
applying for administrative/clerical jobs. The marginal effect of unemployment duration on the probability
of callback is negative but not significantly different from zero in this smaller sample (p-value = 0.14). Given
the small size of the sample (936 applicants), we do not draw any conclusion from this result.
  17
     Eriksson and Rooth (2014) find a callback rate of 25 percent in their 2007 Swedish study. Ghayad
(2014) finds a callback rate of 8.3 percent in his 2012 (post Great Recession) U.S. study. Note that these
aggregate statistics refer to broader distributions of worker type.
  18
    Indeed, KLN investigate cross-sectional variation in the marginal effect on call-back rates of unem-
ployment duration by local unemployment rates (a second-order effect) and find that the marginal effect of
unemployment duration on callback becomes more negative as the unemployment rate falls.


                                                      31
with relatively high unemployment rates (Charlotte, Chicago, Sacramento, and Tampa). In
contrast, the KLN analysis covers 100 large American metropolitan areas.19 Their analysis
includes observations on 7 of the 8 cities used by FSvW, the exception being Portland ME.
We investigate the extent to which differences in geographic coverage can account for the
difference in findings across the two studies by using the 7-city subset of the KLN data
to estimate our simple model of the effect of unemployment duration on the probability of
callback.
      Rows 6 and 7 of Table 10 contains the results of this analysis. Row 6 of the table contains
estimates of the marginal effect of a month of unemployment on the probability of callback
for the KLN subsample for the 7 FSvW cities. There are only 1130 applications in these cities
so it is not surprising that the marginal effect of unemployment is estimated less precisely.
However, the estimate is negative and significantly different from zero (p-value =0.042). The
estimated marginal effect for the 8106 applications from the remaining 92 cities in the KLN
sample, presented in row 7 of the table, is comparable in magnitude and significantly negative
at conventional levels. These results imply that differences in the geographic composition of
the KLN and FSvW samples are not likely to account for the differences in results.


6.6      Variation in Age
The differences in the implied age range of the resume is the most striking contrast between
our and other audit studies of the effect of unemployment duration on callback. The dis-
tributions of age of applicants in the KLN and FSvW samples are largely non-overlapping.
Applicants in the KLN sample range in age from 19-39, with 99 percent between 21 and 33,
while applicants in the FSvW sample range in age from 35-58. As explained in our model in
Section 3, this contrast has the potential to account for the different findings with regard to
the relationship between unemployment duration and the probability of callback. KLN note
themselves in their conclusion that it is important to assess whether their findings hold for
older workers.
      Rows 8-11 of table 10 contain analyses of the callback rate separately for four age groups
in the KLN sample. Callback rates are similar across all four age groups, ranging from 10.7
percent to 12.8 percent.20 The marginal effect of unemployment duration on the callback
rate is estimated to be negative for all age groups. There are significant differences in the

 19

 20
      A χ2 test of independence of age and callback fails to reject independence (p-value =0.28).


                                                     32
marginal effect across age groups (p-value of test that all marginal effects equal = 0.047),
but the absolute magnitude of the effect does not decline monotonically with age. The
effect is largest by far in absolute magnitude for the youngest applicants (19-22 years old)
then declines for applicants aged 23-26 before rising somewhat for applicants 27-30 and for
applicants 31-39 (97.5 percent of whom are 31-34).
    Given the substantial difference in the age ranges covered by KLN and our analyses,
it is difficult to conclude anything from the age variation in the effect of unemployment
duration within KLN’s sample. However, age may be an important factor in accounting
for the difference in findings. The older applicants used by FSvW have significant longer
work histories that may outweigh any recent unemployment experience when resumes are
evaluated by potential employers. The younger applicants used by KLN do not have nearly
as extensive a history and so recent unemployment experience may get higher weight in the
evaluation of applicants. We also note that the applicants in the Eriksson-Rooth (2014)
Swedish study and the Ghayad (2014) U.S. study are all in their twenties with no more than
about 5 or 6 years of experience, which may account for their findings of significant effects
of unemployment duration on callback.
    To summarize the comparison with KLN regarding the effect of unemployment duration
on the callback rate, the differences in the outcome measure and the choice of cities do not
appear to be important factors in understanding the difference in findings. The differences
in job type and time period have the potential to explain some but not all of difference
in findings. The differences between the studies in applicants’ age is a strong candidate
to explain the difference. However, the lack of overlap in the ages of applicants in the
FSvW and KLN studies make it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion in this regard.
Without a single study that includes a full range of ages, our conjecture that the importance
of unemployment duration in determining callbacks declines with age remains suggestive
rather than conclusive.


7     Final Comments
Based on our audit study of the determinants of the likelihood of callbacks to job applications,
we find clear evidence that employers are less likely to call back older applicants (those in the
fifties) than younger workers (those in their thirties and forties). This is consistent with work
based on the Displaced Workers Survey and administrative data showing that older displaced
workers are less likely to be employed subsequent to job loss (Farber, 2015) and to suffer


                                               33
long-term nonemployment (Song and von Wachter 2014), and it has potentially important
implications for the employment prospects of older job losers. We also find clear evidence
that holding a relatively low-level interim job at the time of job application significantly
reduces the likelihood of a callback. This suggests that employers may, either mechanically
or by rule-of-thumb, over-weight the most recent employment spell in screening applications
and suggests that those individuals who do take a lower-level interim job should not report
such jobs on their applications.
   Recent work reports contrasting findings between unemployment duration and the like-
lihood of callback for younger workers. While prominent papers find a negative relationship
between short unemployment durations and callback for the U.S. (Kroft, Lange, and No-
towidigdo, 2013; Ghayad, 2014), another study finds no such relationship (Nunley et al.
2014). Again focusing on younger workers, a related paper for Sweden finds no effect of
short unemployment spells but negative effects of long unemployment spells on callback
(Ericksson and Rooth, 2014). In our work we unambiguously find no relationship between
unemployment and callback for mature and older workers. We attempt to reconcile our
finding in this dimension with the work of KLN using their data and definitions comparable
to ours, but cannot completely resolve the issue. Part of the difference may be time period
since all of the earlier studies were fielded much earlier in recovery period from the Great
Recession when the labor market was weaker. Another difference, and one we think worthy
of further exploration, is that all of the earlier studies focus on younger job applications
(mostly in their twenties) while our study focuses on job applicants from their mid-thirties
to mid-fifties. While there are good theoretical reasons to suspect that unemployment dura-
tion could be less important for older job applicants, a single study that covers the full age
spectrum is needed to draw a definitive conclusion on this issue.
   Finally, our analysis of within-job-posting variation in callbacks, suggests that observable
worker characteristics (age, interim job) are less important when employers are calling back a
higher fraction of their applicants. Our interpretation of this finding is that when employers
are hungry for workers, they are less selective in who they call back. This suggests the
power of stimulating aggregate demand as a strategy to improve the employment prospects
of applicants who otherwise would not “make the cut” of receiving any positive response to
a job application.
