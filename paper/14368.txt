                                             ABSTRACT

Until recently the Consumer Price Index consisted solely of "matched model" component indexes.
The latter are constructed by BLS personnel who visit stores and compare prices of goods with the
same set of characteristics over successive periods. This procedure is subject to a selection bias. Goods
that were not on the shelves in the second period were discarded and hence never contributed price
comparisons. The discarded goods were disproportionately goods which were being obsoleted and
had falling prices. Pakes (2003) provided an analytic framework for analyzing this selection effect
and showed both that it could be partially corrected using a particular hedonic technique and that the
correction for his personal computer example was substantial. The BLS staff has recently increased
the rate at which they incorporate techniques to correct for selection effects in their component indexes.
However recent work shows very little difference between hedonic and matched model indices for
non computer components of the CPI. This paper explores why.

We look carefully at the data on the component index for TVs and show that differences between the
TV and computer markets imply that to obtain an effective selection correction we need to use a more
general hedonic procedure than has been used to date. The computer market is special in having well
defined cardinal measures of the major product characteristics. In markets where such measures are
absent we may need to allow for selection on unmeasured, as well as measured, characteristics. We
develop a hedonic selection correction that accounts for unmeasured characteristics, apply it to TVs,
and show that it yields a much larger selection correction than the standard hedonic. In particular we
find that matched model techniques underestimate the rate of price decline by over 20%.

1    Introduction

This paper provides hedonic techniques which enable the construction of better price indexes.

Along the way we explain why the “biases” in both matched model and in prior hedonic indices

seem to differ; (i) across component indexes and (ii) with the time interval between successive price

observations.

    Pakes (2003) used a model of a differentiated-product market as a framework for clarifying

the role of hedonic regressions in the construction of price indexes. The regressions do not identify

either utility or cost parameters. Nevertheless under the conditions supplied in that article they can

be used to bound the transfer needed to compensate consumers for changes in their choice sets (for

the “compensating variation”). The bound is not tight because it does not account for either the

inframarginal rents to consumers who would have purchased the good at the highest observed price,

or for the substitution possibilities caused by the changes in prices over time. However the bound

is typically tighter than that given by the matched-model index. This is because it takes partial

account of the selection bias in the matched model indices caused by the exit of goods. Goods that

exit, and hence whose price changes are not included in the index, are disproportionately goods

whose characteristics have been obsoleted, and hence whose prices have declined. So omitting these

goods tends to remove price changes from the left tail of the distribution of price changes, causing

an upward bias in the estimate of the average price increase.

    Hedonic indexes partially correct for this bias by using the price prediction from a hedonic

regression for the exiting period prices of the goods that exit. Since the relationship between the

prices of goods and their characteristics changes with almost any change in market conditions (entry,

exit, shifts in demand and/or cost,...), for the hedonic prediction to bound the needed compensating

variation the hedonic regression on which it is based must be done separately in every period. That

regression should include all relevant characteristics and should not be constrained in any way.

Subject to these requirements, any sufficiently rich functional form can be used.

    The relationship between the hedonic prediction for the price of exiting goods, and that implicit


                                                  2
in the matched model index, clarifies the difference between the indexes. The matched-model index

implicitly imputes its own value, which is an average of the values for all continuing goods, as the

predicted price relative for every exiting good. The hedonic prediction weights more heavily the

predicted prices of continuing goods that have characteristics more similar to those of the exiting

good. So a matched-model index takes the index weight intended for an exiting good and redis-

tributes it to the continuing goods proportional to their index weights, whereas the hedonic index

implicitly redistributes an exit’s weight more towards those continuing goods with similar charac-

teristics. In Pakes’ (2003) computer application the use of the hedonic rather than the matched

model prediction changed the index rather dramatically. This because the value of the observed

tuples of characteristics that were similar to those of exiting computers fell rather dramatically –

largely in response to the entry of newer machines that obsoleted them.

   Until very recently hedonic predictions that were based on regression functions that were up-

dated every period were difficult, if not impossible, to do within the BLS’s monthly time constraints.

The fact that the BLS has modernized its data gathering procedures by providing their data gath-

erers with hand held computers and instructing them to download their data nightly onto a central

BLS data management system has changed what the BLS can do. It now is possible for the BLS

to implement a version of our hedonic index. Before doing so, of course, the index would have to

be shown to satisfy all the rigorous monthly production requirements of the CPI.

   However when standard hedonic procedures were tried on some of the BLS’s component groups

most of the resultant indexes were not much different from the relevant matched model indexes

(see the results reported in Table 5 of the survey by Johnson, et. al, 2006). Take our TV example.

The sample gathered for the TV index has 20% turnover over the two month sampling interval

(an almost identical rate to that in computers), and as we show below there is ample evidence

indicating that the goods that exit have prices that are falling disproportionately. The BLS now

does use a hedonic regression in constructing the TV component index. Their hedonic regression

has a large set of explanatory characteristics and is run only once a year (see Moulton, Lafleur



                                                  3
and Moses, 1998, for more detail on the current CPI TV component index, and Pakes, 2003, for

a comparison of the CPI’s hedonic adjustment and that obtained from the more standard hedonic

procedure used here).

   Table 1 presents the index we obtained using hedonic predictions from a linear in logs hedonic

regression that was done separately in every period and a set of twenty four characteristics that

are similar to the set of characteristics used by the BLS, and compares it to a matched model

index based on the same data (see below for details on the data). The hedonic generates an index

which is about the same value as that produced by the matched model procedure (and the hedonic

is more variant across months). Moreover were the BLS to use a characteristic set this large the

amount of data cleaning needed would imply that they could not produce an index which used a

new hedonic regression every period and still abide by their time constraints. Since the hedonic can

not be justified in terms of a bound on the compensating variation unless the regression underlying

it is done separately for every period, we also computed a hedonic index from regressions based

on a ten variable characteristic set which does not require extensive cleaning and could be used

in a production setting (we come back to these variables below). When we use standard hedonic

procedures with these nine characteristics we get a hedonic index which falls at a much slower pace

then the matched model index.


   The reason that the standard hedonic produces results which are similar to the matched model

index is not that there is no selection bias, rather it is because standard hedonic procedures do

little to correct for this bias. The TV market is different from the computer market in that it

does not have sharp cardinal measures of most of the characteristics that consumers value. Instead

most of our TV characteristics are dummy variables indicating the presence or absence of advanced

features (see Appendix 2). Moreover exit is disproportionately of high priced goods that have most

of these features. They exit because they are obsoleted by newer high priced goods with higher

quality versions of the same features, and we do not have good quality indexes for those features.

As a result in the TV market, and we suspect in many other markets, selection is partly based

in Appendix 2. Screen size is logged, and two additional regressors are obtained by multiplying
log-screensize times itself and the dummy indicating projection TV. S10 refers to a 10 regressor
specification consisting of the first 7 variables in Table 12 (with screensize logged) plus the two
second-order regressors from S24 and a dummy indicating when an observation is from either NYC,
Chicago, or Los Angeles, the only cities sampled on a monthly basis. The dependent variable in
both specifications is the log of price.

specifications, spanning the 31-month interval from June 2000 to Dec 2002. The rates in the table

where a hedonic index is less than the matched-model index (% l.t. mm).


on characteristics the analysts cannot condition on, i.e., on what an econometrician would call

“unobservables”.

   Standard hedonic predictions do not account for the price differences generated by characteris-

tics the analyst does not condition on. One alternative is to augment the standard hedonic with a

good-specific “fixed effect” to account for the unobserved characteristics of the good, and then use

the coefficients from a regression for the differences of prices of continuing goods on observed char-

acteristics to predict the change in price of the exiting goods. We show that though this procedure

does move the index in the expected direction, it only corrects for a small part of the problem.

This should not be surprising. We expect the hedonic evaluations of different characteristics to

vary across periods. Since the residual summarizes the effects of many unobserved characteristics

each of whose value is changing over time, the value of the residual should change over time thus

invalidating the fixed effect procedure.

   The goal of this paper is to develop hedonic procedures which: (i) at least partially account



                                                  5
for the contribution of unobserved characteristics; (ii) maintain the Konus-Laspeyre’s bound on

compensating variation; (iii) are robust to the properties of data sets in ways we will make pre-

cise; and (iv) can be implemented within the BLS’s time constraints. We note that though our

assumptions insure that our predictions for the exiting goods price are an upper bound to their

expected price, the bounds we suggest are not tight. On the other hand they are relatively easy

to implement within the BLS’s time constraints and seem to not be sensitive to estimation error.

Moreover despite the non-tightness of our bounds, the fact that our hedonic techniques do partially

control for the role of unmeasured characteristics generates indexes which falls at a rate over twenty

per cent faster than does the standard hedonic index.

   We begin with a description of the characteristics of our primary sample (which is an extract

from the data the BLS uses to compute their TV component index). This section of the paper also

provides evidence that the prices of exiting goods are falling at a faster rate then those of continuing

goods and illustrates the features of the data that underlie why our new hedonic techniques are

likely to do a better job than standard hedonic techniques. We then turn briefly to the formulae

for alternative price indices conditional on estimates of price changes.

   This brings us to section 4 which begins by presenting evidence on the importance of accounting

for selection on unobserved characteristics in obtaining price predictions. Section 4 then goes on to

develop hedonic formulae for price predictions which partially account for the role of unobserved

characteristics. We provide two of these. The second uses more of the variables in the data than the

first and the extra variables should enable us to produce a tighter index; but since those variables

are only available for a subsample the second is also likely to have larger estimation error. Section

4 concludes with a third alternative for price prediction; one that has intuitive appeal but which

uses assumptions which are harder to justify (at least as a period-by-period index). If all our

assumptions are correct the average (over periods) of the third alternative should lie between the

averages of the first two, so we use the third index as a robustness check on our procedures.

   Section 5 provides the empirical results from using the various hedonic procedures to obtain



                                                   6
price indexes for our primary sample period (from May 2000 to January 2003). They indicate that

standard hedonics overstate inflation by over 20%. Moreover they are striking in their consistency

with the theoretical arguments given in the paper.

        We wondered whether our prior experimentation with the data influenced the nature of these

results, and wanted to know how direct application of our procedures would fare in alternative

environments. So we drew a new sample (from February 2005 to November 2006) and applied

our procedures directly, i.e. without any prior experimentation, to this data. Section 6 of the

paper notes that the new sample is different in important ways from our primary sample, and then

reports the price indices obtained from our “out of sample” experiment. They reinforce our earlier

conclusions.

        There is a short concluding section which contains a summary and a reminder that the issues

of selection and unobserved characteristics dealt with in this paper are not the only issues with the

component indexes that underlie the CPI and that different issues are likely to be more important

in constructing different component indexes.


2        Background: Properties of the Data and Biases in the Index.

Our data consists of CPI price quotes for the 35 months between March 2000 and January 2003

and a matching characteristic data set built up from the characteristic set used by the CPI industry

analyst in the procedure currently used to construct hedonic adjustments for the TV component

index1 . The average monthly sample contains prices and characteristics from 234 observations, and

prices in this data ranged from $66 to over $10, 000, reflecting the rather extreme differences in

products that the BLS includes in this commodity group.2
    1
     A ”cleaned characteristics” subset of each period’s July and August data was prepared by the CPI industry
analyst for use in their current hedonic procedure. We assigned the cleaned characteristics to all months by matching
model numbers. The resulting 35-month data set contains 8, 195 prices, or 79.9% of all prices. On average the months
have mean, median, minimum, and maximum prices equal to $725, $366, $81, and $7836 respectively. Comparing,
where possible, statistics for the full and cleaned data sets shows that the latter data is very similar to the full data.
Noteworthy departures are slightly lower entry and exit rates (making our problem harder) and a mean price that is
about $40 higher than that for the full data.
   2
     As in most markets, the entry and exit of particular TVs tends to disproportionately influence, and be dispro-
portionately influenced by, prices of close competitors. To insure that the hedonic predictions for one good were
not overly sensitive to goods which were in very different parts of the product space, an early version of this paper


                                                            7
    Just over three quarters of the CPI price quotes are collected at 2-month intervals from odd and

even numbered month subsamples each of which are regionally defined. The other one quarter of

the quotes are from New York, Los Angeles and Chicago and are collected at one month intervals.

As a result we focus on price relatives, exits, etc. over two month periods (our sampling interval),

though all the sample observations available for the two months period are used (whether from the

one month or one of the two month subsamples).

    On average, 22.5% of the TVs present in any period are not present in the following period,

with 19.7% being permanent exits. The non-permanent exits are goods that were available in the

prior period, are not available in the current period, but returned to the shelf in next period.

Similarly, 24.0% of TVs in the current period were not present in the prior period, with 17.0%

being substitutes (the good that was to be sampled for comparison period prices was not present

at the outlet so another good had to be substituted for it) and 4.1% being scheduled additions to

the sample (goods that were scheduled to be rotated out of the sample). An average of 2.9% of the

exits are temporary, while 2.9% of entering TVs are returning from temporary absence.3


Price relatives from different subsets of the data.                      Price relatives for different subsets of

the data play a key role in this paper. We partition the price relatives between any two periods

into three groups; a group for which there is a price relative in the prior period but which exit

before the next period (our about to exit or “a-exit ” price relatives), a group for which there is a

price relative in the following period but not in the preceding period (our recently new or “r-new”

price relatives), and a group for which we have price relatives in both adjacent periods (our “other”

price relatives). The “full sample” of price relatives refers to the union of these three groups. On
included hedonic indexes based on local-linear nonparametric hedonic regressions. We have omitted those results
because they did not differ substantially from the results based on the log-linear approximations given below.
   3
     A good that is temporarily off the shelf may be absent for quite different reasons than goods that have permanently
exited. In particular temporary exits may be caused by a stock-outs, while permanent exit is more likely to be caused
by obsolescence. However the number of temporary exits was too small to cause any noticeable differences in the
results reported below. We note that the numbers above come from slightly different series. The exit rates are
computed on a series that excludes the last 4 months from each bimonthly subsample, the deleted months used
to determine which exits eventually return. Computation of the entry rates exclude the earliest months from each
subsample for analogous reasons.




                                                           8
average (over months) there were 183.45 price relatives between any two periods and of these; 40.2

(22.4%) are about to exit relatives, 46.0 (25.5%) are recently new relatives, and the remainder (

97.25 or 52.1%) are the other price relatives4 .

    A good which exits on the day prior to the last period’s sampling date will not have a price

relative for the current two periods while a good which exits the day after the sampling date will,

and the sampling dates are spread across the two month sampling interval. Consequently the

behavior of the price relatives for about to exit goods should be more like that of goods which do

in fact exit than that of a randomly drawn price relative. We show below that what evidence exists

lends strong support to this belief. As a result we will use the a-exit price relatives for clues as

to the unobserved price relatives for goods that were in the sample in the first period but exited

before the second.

    Table 2 provides some summary statistics on the price relatives for the full sample and for these

three subsets of the data. Note that 61.55% of all price relatives relatives equal 1; that is there are

a lot of ”sticky” prices. Since we use this fact below, the table provides summary statistics for the

subsample of non-sticky prices as well as for the overall sample.

    We begin with the data on the about to exit goods. The first point to note is that their price

relatives show a faster rate of price decline then the other group of goods. The about to exit goods

prices decline at about twice the average rate of decline and the difference is highly significant (with

a t-ratio of about six). Second the about to exit goods have a significantly lower fraction of sticky

prices (the standard errors for these fractions vary from .006 to .015). Moreover if we look just

among non-sticky prices the absolute difference between the mean price relative for goods about to

exit and the other group is even more pronounced. That is among prices that do change, the prices

of the goods that are about to exit fall substantially more than a randomly chosen price change5 .

If goods that are about to exit have prices relatives that behave more similarly to the prices of
    4
      Since we need to be able to check for the existence of a prior price relative to determine whether a price relative
is r-new and for the existence of a following price relative to check whether the price relative is a-exit, this table is
based on a data set which drops out the first and the last two months from our data series.
    5
      The about to exit goods also have higher price variance than other goods, though most (though not all) of this
increased variance is because they have a larger fraction of non-sticky prices.


                                                           9
goods that do exit, then these numbers reinforce the belief that, by throwing out the goods that

exit, matched model procedures overestimate inflation.

   The last panel of this table uses the data from the quarter of the sample with monthly observa-

tions. By calculating the first month price relative decline rates of the goods that exit in the second

month of the two month sampling interval we can provide direct evidence on the price relatives

for exiting goods in the first month of the two-month period in which they exit. We then compare

these rates to the rates for the same goods in the period in which they are classified as about to

exit.

   On average the two month rate of decline of the price relatives for the sample with monthly

observations is similar to that of the overall sample, as is that sample’s average two month price

relative for about to exit goods. 52% of the monthly observations that exit over the two month

sampling intervals have observed prices after the first month. The average price relative of these

goods for the first month is .9756, which is noticeably lower than the average two month price

relative for the full sample of monthly data (.9835). Similarly the sticky price rate in the first

month for the goods that exit in the second month is .627 which is lower than the two month sticky

price rate for the goods that continue (.6569). The average two month rate price relative for about to

exit goods in the monthly sample is .9679, which is lower than the average one-month price relative

of the goods that exit in the second month of the sampling interval. However were we to assume

that the rates of price decline were lower in the one-month period of exit then in the one-month

period before exit, say because the periods in which goods exit tend to be periods in which goods

are under increased price pressure, then we would know that the goods that exited in the second

month of the two month period had two month price relatives lower than (.9756)2 =.9518. Below

we weaken the assumption that the rate of price decline in the month of exit is greater than in the

preceding month and then use the monthly data to get lower bounds to the rate of price decline for

exiting goods under the weaker assumptions. However the “back of the envelope results” presented

here are illustrative of the more conservative results below.



                                                  10
       Interestingly recently introduced goods also have price relatives that on average fall at a faster

pace than the other goods, though the difference is not nearly as striking as it is for about to exit

goods (it is only 1/4 to 1/5 the differential for a-exit goods, and for r-new goods the difference with

other goods is not statistically significant). Sill this finding has interesting implications for price

index construction procedures. As noted by Pakes (2003) introducing new goods earlier into the

index will only ameliorate new goods biases if prices fall in their introductory periods. It seems

that early introduction of new goods would indeed ameliorate new goods biases in TVs.

       Finally we note that the results in Table 2 go a long way towards explaining the difference in

results for matched model indices based on different intervals of time. Compare, for example, the

average of the matched model indices with a two month sampling interval with that from a four

month sampling interval. The latter omits price changes of two types of goods that are included in

the two month interval data; (i) goods that are “about to exit” in the first two month interval, and

(ii) goods that are “recently new” in the second two month interval. Both these subgroups of goods

have prices that fall at a faster rate then a randomly drawn continuing good. So the four month

interval index misses two groups of prices changes whose prices are falling disproportionately.

       The fact that the longer sampling interval data omits price changes of about to exit goods

accentuates the selection bias we study here. The fact that it omits initial price changes of recently

entered goods, will, in markets where initially prices fall, accentuate a bias we do not attempt to

correct for in this paper. This is the bias caused by the fact that the index does not attempt to

capture the inframarginal rents which accrue to individuals who would have bought the new good

at a price higher than the highest price at which the new good entered the index (see Pakes, 2003,

for further discussion). To get some indication of how these biases increases with the length of the

sampling interval, we used our data to calculate the matched model indexes when we assumed two,

four, and twelve month sampling intervals. The annualized rate of deflation for the three intervals

were, respectively, -10.59%, -8.99%, and -6.48%.6 So going from a two month to an annual interval
   6
    Unlike the rest of the indexes in this paper these use equally weighted price relatives (instead of expenditure
relatives) and cover only a twenty four month period.

Prices of Entering and Exiting Goods.            The next table summarizes information on the prices

of entering and about to exit goods which will help with an understanding of the role of selection

in this market. It has coefficients and t-values from regressions of log prices on a constant and

two dummies, one for the goods that just entered and one for goods that are about to exit. The

regressions are done differently for odd and even numbered periods as the BLS samples different

cities in those periods.

   The point made by this table is that both the newly entering goods and the about to exit

goods have prices that are higher than those of continuing goods. This is not surprising for newly

entering goods as new goods typically enter at the high quality end of spectrum. What is somewhat

surprising is that this is also true for goods that are about to exit. This differentiates the TV market

from the market for computers where almost all exits are from the low end of the quality spectrum

in the period before they exit. Like in computers, in TV’s most new good enter at the high end

of the price spectrum. However at least in this period the TV’s exitors are also typically high end

goods (presumably displaced by the high end entrants). The “low-end” products in the TV market

do not turnover nearly as much.

   We will see that though our characteristics can differentiate between high and low quality TV’s,

they have more difficulty with distinguishing between two high quality TV’s one of which is based

on older technology and hence has been obsoleted. For example we know which TV’s are projection,

but we do not have a good measure of the improvements that have occurred in sharpness of their

display over time. This is a second feature which differentiates the TV market from the computer

market. In the computer market the major characteristics that are improving over time have

natural cardinal measures which make them easy to compare across products (e.g., speed, RAM,

hard drive capacity, ....).

3        Inputs For the Indexes.

We require; (i) a formula which enables us to calculate the price index from a given set of price

relatives, and (ii) the hedonic regressions that underlie our hedonic price predictions. We start with

the index formula.

3.1       Index Formulae.

We begin as simply as possible and use indexes that are linear in the logs of price relatives. This

makes the indexes linear in the regression error from the logarithmic hedonic regressions we and

others have used, and this in turn makes the relationship of our results to the underlying data

transparent7 .

        Letting t index our two month sampling period, all indexes we present are versions of
                                                      X
                                              Gt =            wq,t−1 ỹqt                                         (1)
                                                     q∈St−1

where q denotes a quote, wqt is period-t weight, ỹqt is an actual or imputed log-relative, and St−1

is a subset of all quotes available for period t − 18 . This is the log of a geometric mean index. The

weights wq,t−1 are obtained by dividing each period-(t − 1) regional TV expenditure-share equally
                                                                                        P
among all the quotes for that region and then renormalizing them so that                   q∈St−1   wq,t−1 = 1. The

regional expenditure shares are estimates from the CPI data base.9

        Denoting an actual log price-relative by yqt = log(pqt /pq,t−1 ) and an estimate of a log price

relative as ŷqt , hedonic and matched-model indexes can be written as
                                                         X

                                                                 wq,t−1 ŷqt                                      (2)

                                                         X
                                          Gmm
                                           t  =                   mm
                                                                 wq,t−1 yqt ,                                     (3)

    7
     We intend to come back to more complex indexes that work directly with this regression error at a later date,
as they have a larger role to play in other indexes. In particular to construct the Laspeyre’s index we need to
exponentiate the logs and hence exponentiate the hedonic regression error. Since the Laspeyre’s index is the only
index that has an interpretation in terms of a bound on compensating variation, there are good reasons for thinking
the indices that deal directly with the regression error might be important.
   8
     This mimics the BLS’s bimonthly sampling procedure. Their monthly indexes are derived from these by a linear
splicing procedure.
   9
     Past values of the CPI subindex for TVs are used in making the estimate for any period t. We take these estimates
as given; we do not prepare our own estimates based on past values of any of our research indexes.


                                                         14
where At−1 is the set of quotes for which prices were successfully collected in period t − 1, and

Ct−1 = At−1 ∩ At . That is matched model indexes average the price relatives for goods for which

price information was collected in both periods, while the hedonic averages predicted price relatives

for all goods whose prices were collected in period t − 110 .

3.2    Hedonic Regressions.

The results presented here are based on a linear regression model for the (log) price levels of goods

in a given period.11 Let Zt be the n × K matrix of characteristics of those TVs for which prices

were collected in period t and pt be the corresponding n × 1 vector of log prices. Then a typical

period-t hedonic regression coefficient is given by

                                                              −1
                                                dt = Zt0 Zt         Zt0 pt ,                                        (4)


and the prediction for log price is p̂t = Zt dt . As noted above there are no restrictions on these coef-

ficients and there is no necessary relationship between the coefficient vectors estimated in different

periods.

    We fit this regression to every month in each bimonthly sample, using each of three different

sets of regressors for Z, all of which include a column of ones. The three sets of regressors, to be

denoted by S5, S10, and S24 are


    • S5: log of screensize in inches, a dummy indicator for projection TVs, the interaction between

      these two variables, the square of log-screensize, and a dummy variable for whether the

      observation comes from the monthly subsample12 ,
  10
     An early version of this paper also computed the hybrid indexes introduced in Pakes (2003). These impute

                     t
                          P
                         = q∈Ct−1 wq,t−1
                                                P
relatives only for TVs that exit between t − 1 and t, and use actual price relatives for goods that were available in
both periods, i.e. Ghyb               hed                        hed
                                           yqt + q∈At−1 −Ct−1 wq,t−1  ŷqt . The attraction of hybrids is that they have
no estimation error in their price relatives for the continuing goods, and they eliminate much of the selection bias
in the matched model index by using hedonic predictions for the goods that exit. On the other hand they treat the
error from the hedonic regression differently for the two types of goods, and this can cause a (different) selection
bias. We decided that the tradeoff between bias and variance was not an issue we wanted to deal with in this paper
and hence omitted the hybrids. The actual values of the hybrids we calculated for our sampling period are, however,
available on request from the authors.
  11
     An earlier version of the paper also presented results based on a local linear non-parametric kernel hedonic
regression for the four and ten characteristic data sets. The non-parametric results did not differ in any substantive
way from the results reported below.
  12
     As noted in Pakes, 2003, the hedonic regression can differ with the characteristics of the population in which


                                                          15
    • S10: the variables in S5 plus dummy indicators for picture-in-picture, flat-screen CRT display,

      HDTV-ready, a high-quality reputation Brand A, and a low-quality reputation Brand Z,


    • S24: the variables in S10 plus the additional variables listed in the notes to Table A1 at the

      end of the paper.


    The values for the variables in S5 and S10 can be verified with minimal effort on the part of

CPI staff, and therefore can be used to fit an up-to-date hedonic regression in the time interval

available to the BLS when producing their index. This is not so for the additional variables in S24.

The current hedonic procedure of the CPI index for TVs uses a different but similarly lengthy list

of regressors as our S24, most of which have values that are difficult to verify in the short period

of time between when the BLS obtains the new price quotes and when it has to have produced the

index. This is the reason why the current hedonic method used by the BLS fits a regression no

more than once a year.

    The first three rows of Table 4 show that any of the three sets of characteristics does quite

a good job of accounting for variance in the traditional dependent variable of hedonic regression,

log-price. Even S5 has very high R2 ’s. It is not unusual to get high R2 ’s in hedonic regressions on

differentiated product markets, indeed it is a major reason for the increased use of characteristic

models in demand estimation. However these R2 ’s are higher than usual, which probably attests

to the quality of the BLS data.

    There is a noticeable improvement in fit in moving from S5 to S10, but not much further

improvement in adding the 14 characteristics needed for S24.13 Part of the reason for the closeness

of the S10 and S24 measures of fit is that the TV’s with S10 features have most of the S24 features.

So perhaps the more striking fact illustrated by table 4 is just how well we do in predicting price;

the residual from either the S24 or the S10 regression accounts for only a relatively small fraction
the goods are marketed as well as with the characteristics of the goods per se. We found that the only population
distinction which helped to predict price in our analysis was the dummy variable indicating the observation was one
of the three big cities which define the monthly subsample
   13
      The improvement in fit in going from S10 to S24 is very close to the improvement we got in moving from the
linear regression in S10 to the non-parametric local linear kernel regression in those variables.

         Indeed the variance accounted for by the residual is small enough to call into question the need

to worry about omitted variables when correcting for selection in matched model indexes. It is true

however that; the price variance is large, exit is concentrated in particular parts of the product

space, and the variance accounted for by the residual may well be be a larger portion of overall

variance in that part of the characteristic space where exit is concentrated. This worry about

omitted characteristics is accentuated by the fact that other than screen size all the characteristics

in S10 are dummies for the presence or absence of advanced features. In particular we do not have

a measure of the quality of the advanced features and the fact that the turnover is concentrated

in the high end of the product price spectrum is indicative of a process of obsolescence in those

qualities. So we now turn to a more careful look at the role of unobserved characteristics.


4         Unobserved Characteristics and Hedonic Bounds.

Under standard assumptions on consumer behavior the prices of two goods with identical charac-

teristics should be the same. So if we observed all relevant product characteristics we should be

able to predict the prices of goods that exit the sample from the prices of goods with similar char-

acteristics that remain in sample14 . This prediction problem, however, gets more complicated when

there are characteristics of the goods that consumers value but Econometricians do not observe
    14
   For a statement of this property, and a demand estimation algorithm that makes intensive use of it, see Bajari
and Benkard (2005). They require a choice set that fills up a subset of characteristic space. For justification of
hedonic indices when the choice set is not this rich see Pakes (2003).



                                                       17
(and hence can not condition on). So we begin by asking whether there is a need to pay attention

to unobserved product characteristics in predicting exiting goods prices.

   We look first to the properties of the hedonic regression function per se. Part of the impact of the

unobserved product characteristics on price in that regression will be captured by the relationship

between unobserved and observed characteristics, but the rest will appear as the residual. If the

relationship of the residual to the observed characteristic were no different for exiting goods than

for a randomly drawn good, then we could obtain an unbiased estimate for the price of a good

that exited the sample between two periods from the hedonic regression coefficients in the second

period and the characteristics of the good that exited (even though this regression is only done with

observations on the continuing goods and the new entrants). However if unobserved characteristics

are important determinants of whether a good exits, then simple economic arguments should lead

us to believe that; (i) the regression function for goods that exit is different from that for continuing

goods, and (ii) that the prediction for the price of the good that exits obtained from this regression

function will be systematically biased in a particular direction.

   For simplicity assume the true hedonic function is linear and let η measure the contribution of

unobserved characteristics to price, so that



                                             p = zβ + η,                                             (5)

where we have normalized the coefficient of η to be one. Our hedonic equation is obtained from a

regression of p on z. To analyze its properties we need the properties of the regression of η on z.

   If we let j = x denote exiting goods, j = n denote new entrants, and j = c denote continuing

goods, then

                                  E[η|z] = Σj={c,x,n} P {j|z}E[η|z, j].

Though the theory that tells us that goods with the same characteristic should sell for the same

prices implies the coefficients on z in equation (5) should not differ between entering, exiting and

continuing goods, it says nothing about whether E[η|z, j] differs by j. Moreover a standard selection

                                                   18
argument would lead us to believe this regression function does differ by j.

   To see this we need a model for which goods exit. Temporarily assume that a product exits

if its price falls below its marginal cost, denoted m(z, η), and that ∂m(z, η)/∂η < 1 (everywhere).

Our normalization implies that price increases one to one with η, so we are assuming that price

increases more than marginal cost when unobserved quality increases (this rationalizes the extra

sunk costs usually required to develop higher quality products). Then there is a function m(z),

such that the good exits if and only if η ≤ m(z) − zβ, and



                            E[η|z, j = x] = E[η|η ≤ m(z) − zβ] ≤ E[η|z].

In particular when the good’s observed characteristics lead to a small m(z) − zβ then the good will

continue even if it has a low value of η, while if m(z) − zβ is large the good will only continue if it

has a relatively large value of η. So the distribution of η conditional on z (its support, its mean,....)

will be different for the continuing than for the exiting goods.

   To see whether such logic leads to a significant differences in the relationship between z and η

for exiting, continuing and newly entered goods in our data set, we estimated hedonic regressions

for each period which allowed each of the three groups of goods to have different z-coefficients.

Using the S10 regressor set of the last subsection, we then tested whether these coefficients differed

from each other. The results are presented in Table 5. They clearly reject the null that the new

and exiting good interactions are all zero.

    We can go one step further here. If unobserved characteristics are an important determinant

of whether a good exits and marginal costs are relatively constant over time, then we would ex-

pect there to be a negative correlation between the change in the hedonic prediction for price of

continuing goods and the values of the residual for those same goods. This because if costs are

constant then goods whose zβ increase disproportionately will continue even if their η value de-

creases disproportionately, while goods whose zβ decreases disproportionately will only continue

if their η values increase disproportionately. The correlation of the change in the observed and

unobserved components of price for the continuing goods in our sample was -.53, just as a model

where selection is partly based on the unobservable would predict.

    The data contains at least two more pieces of evidence on the difference between the unobserved

characteristics of the exiting and continuing goods. First we can compare the estimates of the

unobserved characteristics (i.e. the residuals from the hedonic regression) of exiting goods to those

of continuing goods in the period prior to exit. Second we can compare the change in the estimate

of the η 0 s of the exiting goods over the period immediately preceding the period in which they exit

to the change in estimate of the η’s of the continuing goods over that period.

    The change in η results also throw light on the appropriateness of an alternate procedure for

correcting for selection bias; one based on the assumption that the contribution of unobserved

characteristics to price does not change over time. If selection was based only on observed charac-

teristics and a time invariant unobserved characteristic, or a “fixed effect”, the average of ηt+1 − ηt

should not differ between exiting and continuing goods. So under the fixed effect assumption we

can form an unbiased prediction for exiting goods prices by regressing the difference of the logs of

the prices of the continuing goods onto their characteristics, and then using that regression function

to predict the price change for the exiting goods from the change in the valuation of their observed

characteristics15 . Note the arbitrary difference in the way the fixed effect assumption treats the
   15
      This because the fixed effect assumption guarantees both that; (i) the contribution of the unobserved character-
istics to price does not change over time, and (ii) that the regression of the log price relatives provides an unbiased
estimate of the changes in prices caused by the market’s re-evaluation of observed characteristics.




                                                          20
unobserved and the observed characteristics; it calculates its price change predictions from differ-

ences in the contribution of the observed characteristics to price over time but assumes, a priori,

that the contribution of unobserved characteristics to price never changes.

   The average difference between the η’s of exiting goods and those of continuing goods in the

period prior to exit was negative, but only slightly so, and the difference was not statistically

significant. Table 6 presents the results from splitting the data into three groups – the goods that

are about to exit (they exit during the next sampling interval), those recently new (they enter in

period t), and the remaining goods – and then calculating the average change in the residual for

each. About to exit goods have an average change in residual which is significantly negative (with

a t-value above five). Moreover, though the average change in residual of all goods which continue

is also negative, it is less than a fifth the absolute value of the average of the change for about to

exit goods. So though the values of the unobserved characteristic of the exiting goods in the year

prior to exit are only marginally lower than that of the continuing goods, the values of η of the

exiting goods are falling at a dramatically faster pace than those of the continuing goods.

   There are a number of implications of this table that are worth noting. First since the con-

tribution of the unobserved characteristic to price is falling at a rather striking rate just prior to

exit, it is likely to be falling during the exiting period (and probably at a faster rate, as the exiting

period is the period in which the changes in the environment actually caused exit). That is the

assumption that the unobserved characteristic’s contribution to price is constant over time seems

inconsistent with the data. Second the fact that average change in the residual of all the continu-

ing goods is also negative indicates that the new goods that enter have unobserved characteristics

that, on average, have larger values then do those of continuing goods (which, given the above

discussion, should not be surprising). This fact also has the implication that we would improve on

standard hedonic correction for selection, a correction which ignores unobserved characteristics, by

making an adjustment for the change in the market’s value of the unobserved characteristics of the

exiting goods equal to the measured change in the evaluation of the unobserved characteristics of

the continuing goods – a point we come back to in a more formal way below.

    The results in this section make it doubtful that we can get an adequate correction for the

selection bias in exiting goods by simply re-evaluating the observed characteristics of those goods

in the period in which they exit. So we now consider alternative selection corrections.

4.1    Hedonic Bounds With Unobserved Characteristics.

Adding an i subscript to differentiate goods and a t subscript to differentiate time periods, our

hedonic equation (equation 5) becomes



                                             pi,t = zi βt + ηi,t .                                   (6)

Note that the observed characteristics of the good (the zi ) are constant over time, though the

market’s evaluation of those characteristics (the βt ) changes with changes in market conditions.

The additive disturbance is now not the contribution of unobserved characteristics per se but

rather the residual from regressing price onto the observed characteristics.

    Our problem is that we do not observe the value of pi,t+1 for the goods that exit between t

and t + 1. This section introduces method for predicting pi,t+1 − pi,t conditional on (zi , ηi,t ) which,

given our assumptions, maintains the hedonic bound in the sense that the resultant predictor for

pi,t+1 − pi,t will have an expectation which is larger than the expectation of pi,t+1 − pi,t conditional

on zi and ηi,t .

    We develop two bounds. The first only uses the information in the bimonthly sample. The

                                                      22
second adds information from the monthly sample on prices at the end of the first month of the

bimonthly sampling period for the goods that exited during the second month of that period. We

conclude by noting that there is another computation which, at least intuitively, should provide a

lower bound to the average price adjustment over the entire sample period, and, at the very least,

it can be used to check the robustness of our results.

4.1.1   Hedonic Bounds From the Bimonthly Data.

From equation (6) we have



                    E[pi,t+1 − pi,t |zi , ηi,t ] = zi [βt+1 − βt ] + E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t |zi , ηi,t ],                   (7)

where
                                                 X
                E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t |zi , ηi,t ] =          E[ηi,t+1 |ji,t , zi , ηi,t ]P r{ji,t |zi , ηi,t } − ηi,t .
                                                 ji,t

   We can estimate the probability of continuing and the expected change in η when the good

continues; i.e. when ji,t = c. However to get an upper bound for the price index we also need an

upper bound for this conditional expectation when ji,t = x. To obtain this bound we need a rule

for when the good exits. The rule we use is contained in the following assumption.


Assumption 1 (Exit Rule.)


                                    ji,t = x ⇔ ηi,t+1 ≤ η t+1 (zi ).                    ♠




Note that there are no restrictions on η t+1 (zi ). It is a free function of the zi in every period and

that function can change over time.


   If we were in a world in which goods were taken out of the market when the price they could

be sold at was lower then their marginal cost, then Assumption 1 would be equivalent to the




                                                               23
assumption that price increases in η more than marginal costs does.16 Indeed it is the increase

in the difference between price and marginal cost as quality increases that is often viewed as the

justification for the sunk cost of developing higher quality goods.

       Assumption 1 implies that


               E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ji,t = x, zi , ηi,t ] = E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ηi,t+1 ≤ η i,t+1 (zi ), ηi,t , zi ] ≤            (8)


        E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ηi,t+1 ≥ η t+1 (zi ), ηi,t , zi ] = E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t ] ≡ gb(zi , ηi,t+1 ).

That is the assumption guarantees that the conditional expectation of ηi,t+1 − ηi,t for continuing

goods, an expectation we can estimate, provides an upper bound for the unobserved conditional

expectation of ηi,t+1 − ηi,t for exiting goods.

       We have already shown that the η of about to exit goods fall at a faster pace than other

continuing goods (see Table 6). What equation 8 shows us is that Assumption 1 is sufficient

to extend this inequality to goods that do exit. To see whether the bound is likely to help we

computed the R2 ’s from the regression of ηt+1 − ηt on a polynomial in η and z for continuing

goods on the bimonthly data (see Table 7). The η’s used here are the residuals from the cross

sectional hedonic regressions done separately for each period. As a result the η’s from the full

sample are uncorrelated with the z’s by construction. So if selection were not partially based on

the “unobserved” characteristics (our η), we would expect the adjusted R2 ’s in the second column

of table 7 to be zero. The fact that they are highly significant is evidence that the selection into

continuing goods is at least partly based on our unobservables. More importantly for present

purposes, the fact that the adjusted R2 ’s go up significantly when we add ηt to the regressions (see

column 4 of table 7) indicates that using the information on the ηt of exiting goods together with
  16
     There are at least two situations when the conditions underlying Assumption 1 might not hold, though there is
an industry analyst for each component index who is able to amend the index in cases where either condition might
overturn our bounding argument. First the cost of the unobserved characteristics may increase enough relative to
the price it can command to warrant an exit decision. Second a merger or an acquisition could lead to a situation
where a good exits even though Assumption 1 is satisfied. Note also that the logic underlying Assumption 1 is based
on their being a single index of unobserved quality which determines its impact on the exit decision. The obvious
generalization is to allow for multiple indices of unobserved characteristics and relate the values of those indices to
the exit decision. This would require a significantly more complex set of assumptions and computational algorithms,
see for e.g. Bajari and Benkard (2005a), and generate an index whose relationship to the data is less transparent.


                                                               24
the conditional expectations of ηt+1 − ηt for continuing goods will help bound the change in η for

the exiting goods17 .

    Of course the bound in (8) may not be very “tight”. In particular the last subsection showed that

the unobservables for exiting goods had: (i) systematically lower values of ηi,t and (ii) systematically

lower values of ηi,t+1 − ηi,t given ηi,t . The bound from equation (8) will make a correction for the

lower values of ηi,t of exiting goods, and for the negative trend in ηi,t+1 − ηi,t of continuing goods

(see table 6). However it does not account for the fact that the ηi,t+1 − ηi,t for exiting goods tends

to be less than that for continuing goods.

    This source of the upward bias in the bound in equation (8) can, at least in principal, be

corrected if we are willing to make one more assumption; that the stochastic process generating η is

Markov and independent of z. Recall that each period’s ηi,t is uncorrelated with zi by construction.

The additional assumption we need for the tighter bound corresponds to the movement from zero

correlation to full independence.18 Appendix 1 shows that with the Markov assumption a procedure

analogous to that used to correct for selection in production functions by Olley and Pakes (1994)

can be used to tighten our bound (this without restricting the Markov process in any way). However

when we tried to implement this procedure we found that the estimates we obtained were quite

unstable. There are two possible reasons. First the additional assumption could be inappropriate.

Second, as we explain in appendix 2, the tighter bounds, even if appropriate, are quite sensitive

to estimation error. Since our intention is to produce a bound which is both robust and can be

automated for use by BLS analysts, we ignore the Olley-Pakes bound below. This does however

leaves us with a bound which we know is not tight, and this is part of the motivation for turning

to the information in the monthly data in the next subsection.
  17
     Formally we can replace the expectations in equation (8) with expectations conditional on anything in the
information set in period t that help predict ηt+1 − ηt and the inequality still holds. We noted earlier that the
regression function for ηi,t+1 − ηi,t for newly entered goods might be different than that for other continuing goods,
and when we did the ηi,t+1 − ηi,t regression once using a dummy for newly entered goods we got a small improvement
in fit. This explains the last two columns in table 7 and we use predictions that allow for this dummy in what follows
(though we get very similar results when predictions without this dummy are used).
  18
     We have done the same analysis using local linear kernel regressions. Since, at least in the limit, these give us non-
parametric estimates of conditional expectations, the additional assumption then moves us from mean independence
to full independence. The results from using the local linear kernels were virtually identical to those described below.

    One final point on implementation. When we included ηt the fit of the regression for ηt+1 −ηt for

the continuing goods whose prices change was noticeably better than the fit of that same regression

forall continuing goods. The value of ηt+1 − ηt for the goods whose prices do not change is, by

definition, pi,t −zi βt+1 −ηi,t . So instead of estimating gb(·) = E[ηi,t+1 −ηi,t | zi , ηi,t , ji,t = c] directly,

we make use of the information in the price change variable to obtain a more precise estimate of

the the conditional expectation of ηt+1 − ηt . That is we let q ∈ {∆, s} indicate whether a good’s

price changes (q = ∆) or stays the same (q = s) and rewrite our bound as

                                  X
              gb(zi , ηi,t ) =             E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | q, ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t ]P r{q | ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t }   (9)

Our estimated bounds are found by substituting nonparametric estimates of E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | q =

∆, ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t ] and of P r{q = ∆ | ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t } for their true values in equation (9).

4.1.2     Hedonic Bounds That Use The Information in the Monthly Data.

The monthly data contain the price changes in the first month of the two month sampling period

for about half of the exiting goods in that subsample; the half that exited during the second month.

Table 8 is based on all the data in the monthly sample and compares the behavior of prices during

the first month of the two month sampling period of goods that exit in the second month to that

of goods who continue over the entire two months. It is clear from the table that the first month

price fall and fraction non-sticky for goods that exit in the second month are quite a bit larger than

the same figures for the goods that continue.



                                                               26

   Indeed comparing these figures to those in table 2 we see that the first month price fall for

the goods that exit (.976) is larger than the two month price fall for the goods that continue

(.984). Moreover the latter figure is quite close to the square of the one month price relative for

the continuing goods (.9932 = .986). If we were to assume that the two month price relative for

the goods that exit in the first month was less than the square of their price relative in the first

month, we would estimate an average annual rate of deflation of about 28% for those goods, almost

three times larger than the rates from either the standard hedonic or the matched model reported

in Table 1. The assumption that the two month price relative for exiting goods is bounded by the

square of the one-month price fall can not be justified without assumptions which are harder to

justify than those used in this paper. On the other hand we can use assumptions very similar to

those used in the last subsection to justify a bound which uses the monthly data and should be

tighter than the bound which uses only bimonthly data provided in the last subsection.

   In particular we use the monthly analogue of Assumption 1 to relate the observed first month

price change of goods that exited in the second month to the unobserved first month price changes

of goods that exited in the first month. I.e. the assumption that conditional on the observed

characteristics (our zi ) and the initial value of the unobserved characteristic (ηi,t ), the η change of

goods which continue into the second month of the period is greater than or equal to the η change

of goods which exited in the first month of the sampling period. Formally if we let j − = x (j + = x)

denote the event that the good had exited by the end of the first (second) month of the sampling




                                                   27
period we assume that

          E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ji,t = x, ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t ] ≥ E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ji,t = x, ji,t = x, zi , ηi,t ],   (10)


and then develop bounds for the left hand side of this equation.

    If the good is in sample at the end of the first month, we know its price and can estimate its
                 +                                +
value of η, say ηi,t , at that time. Adding this ηi,t to the conditioning set and recalculating the

expectation on the left hand side of equation (10), that expectation becomes

  + −                                                                            +
(ηi,t , ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t ) observed in the monthly sample. We do not observe ηi,t for the three quarters

of the price quotes that are sampled at a two month interval, and we need a bound on the η change

for the exits from that subsample; i.e. we need a bound which only conditions on (zi , ηi,t ). To

obtain that bound from the estimates of the right hand side of equation (11), we can average over
                     +                    +         −
the distribution of ηi,t conditional on (ji,t = x, ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t ) in the monthly panel. These averages

are: (i) only a function of (zi , ηi,t ), and (ii) from equation (10) are consistent bounds for the average

of E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t |ji,t+1 = x, zi , ηi,t ] across all exiting observations.

    There is an empirical problem with implementing this procedure. As noted the subsample with

monthly quotes is about 25% of the total sample. Since about 80% of that 25% continues into

the next bimonthly sampling period, we can use about 20% of the original sample to estimate
            + +             + −
E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t |i,t = c, ηi,t , ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t ]. However since only 10% of the monthly subsample exit

in the first month of the sampling period, we only have about 2.5% of the original sample available

                                                            28
                                +                    +         −
to compute the distribution of ηi,t conditional on (ji,t = x, ji,t = c, zi , ηi,t ). That is not enough

information to estimate the needed distribution with sufficient accuracy, and when we tried to do

so our estimates were not robust to reasonable changes in estimation methodology and conditioning

sets. As a result we move to an alternative procedure that is still based on the inequality in (11),

but restricts the difference between the regression functions for ηt+1 − ηt conditional on (z, ηt ) for

those who exit and those who do not to be a difference in the constant term.

   The steps in the alternative are as follows. We first use equation (11) to obtain a bound for

ηt+1 − ηt for the late exits from the monthly sample that conditions only on (zi , ηt ). To get this
                                 +                                                       +
bound we first regress ηi,t+1 − ηi,t for the continuing goods in the monthly sample on (ηi,t , zi , ηi,t ).

Under our assumptions the predictions obtained from this equation for the ηi,t+1 − ηi,t of late exits

are upper bounds to their values, which makes them an upper bound for the values of the early

exits as well. Next we augment the sample for the regression of ηi,t+1 − ηi,t for the continuing goods

in the bimonthly sample with these predictions and rerun the regression for predicting this change

using the augmented sample and adding a dummy variable to the list of regressors which takes the

value of one when the observation is a predicted value. The prediction for ηi,t+1 − ηi,t then becomes

the prediction from this equation with the dummy variable set to equal one if the good exited,

and with the dummy variable set to equal zero if it did not. We implemented this procedure in

several different ways, weighting the predicted observations in the ηt+1 − ηt regressions differently

and using different interactions in that regression. The results were quite stable across the different

specifications.

4.1.3   A Robustness Check.

Partly as a result of the fact that we know that our bounds are not tight, and partly to check

the robustness of our procedures, we also consider an alternative bound for the price relatives of

exiting goods. The alternative assumes that the change in the evaluation of the exiting good’s

characteristics in the period in which it exits is, on average, at least as negative as was the price

fall for the same good in the period prior to it exiting. We expect exiting goods to be goods which


                                                    29
are being obsoleted. The intuition for this bound is that the period in which exit occurs is likely to

be the period when the impact of changes in market conditions on the value of the characteristics

of the good that exited was particularly sharp.

    There is both a conceptual and a practical problem with this bound. Conceptually it is possible

for the about to exit price fall to be larger than the fall in the value of the goods characteristics in

the exiting period. This worry would be accentuated if either; (i) there were “clearance” sales just

before exit and a disproportionate fraction those sales were caught in our about to exit sampling

period instead of in the period the good exits, or (ii) if there were period effects in the prices of

goods due to, say, cost changes (or for some other reason). The practical problem is that this index

mixes up information on price declines in the current period with information on price declines in

a prior period. Though this may not be an important problem for some uses of the CPI, it might

be important to a monetary authority that is interested in high frequency movements in price.

    If we ignore these problems and accept the reasoning that leads us to expect larger price declines

in the period of exit than in the period preceding exit we can simply use the price change between

periods t and t − 1 for the unobserved price change for the goods that exit between t + 1 to t. Of

course we can only do this for the goods that exited between t and t + 1 but were present in period

t − 1. This is about 85% of the goods that exit between t and t + 1. The other 15% entered between

t − 1 and t and then exited before t + 1. For this latter group of goods we use one of our other

bounds.


5    Geomean Indexes for TVs: Empirical Results

Table 1 showed that a standard hedonic index (one that does not correct for unobserved charac-

teristics) has an average value about equal to the matched model index when a set of twenty five

characteristics are used in the hedonic regression, but falls at a noticeably slower rate than the

matched model index when only the ten variable regressor set is used. The matched model and

the standard hedonic differ in two ways. The matched model does not account for the change in



                                                  30
value of either the observed or the unobserved characteristics of exiting goods, but it does account

for the change in value of the unobserved characteristics of the continuing goods. The standard

hedonic, on the other hand, does account for the change in value of the observed characteristics of

the exiting goods, but it does not account for the change in value of the unobserved characteristics

of either the exiting or the continuing goods. Apparently when only ten characteristics are used

the fall in value of the unobserved characteristics of the continuing goods captured by the matched

model index more than compensates for the fall in value of the observed characteristics of exiting

goods captured by the hedonic. Moreover, as noted in the introduction, if the BLS is to use a

hedonic index that can be justified in terms of a bound on the compensating variation, it must use

a bound based on a characteristic set similar to our ten variable characteristic set.

    Table 9 provides the results from computing hedonic indexes based on the ten characteristic

regressor set when we use the procedures developed in the last subsection to correct for both

unobserved characteristics and selection. Panel A provides the results when it is assumed that

the contribution of the unobserved characteristics to price is constant over time (the “fixed effect”

assumption)19 . As argued in the text this is unlikely to be true, but use of the fixed effect assumption

does account for some of the impact of unobserved characteristics. The index based on the fixed

effects assumption falls at about a 5% faster pace than does the matched model index, at -10.6%

compared to -10.11% for the matched model.

    Panel B of the table provides the hedonic index obtained when we use our first suggestion

for a non-parametric selection correction, the one based only on the bimonthly data. It corrects

for the change in unobserved characteristics with the results from regressing the residuals of the

continuing goods on their observed characteristics and the estimate of the value of their unobserved

characteristic in the initial period. This simple correction procedures produces an index of -11.2%,

which is 11% lower than the matched model index. Note also that use of this non-parametric
  19
     This index is constructed by first regressing the change in the log of the price levels (i.e. the log of the price
relatives) of the continuing goods on their observed characteristics, and then constructing predicted price relatives
for both exiting and continuing goods from these regression coefficients.




                                                          31
selection correction also lowers the standard deviation of the index across months; it is now less

than that of the matched model index.

     Panel C adds information from the monthly data on the price change of the goods that exit in

the first month of the two month sampling period to the selection correction procedure. It uses;

(i) the fall in value of the unobserved characteristics of the goods that survive the first month but

exit in the second to correct for the fall in value of the unobserved characteristics of the exiting

goods in the first month, and (ii) the fall in value of the unobserved characteristics of the continuing

goods to correct for the fall in value of the unobserved characteristics of exiting goods in the second

month of the sampling interval. This results in a further 16% fall in the index. The index is now

12.88, almost 28% lower than the matched model index.

                                      the S10 regressor set.



     The index that uses the monthly data is also more variant across months then the other indexes.

The variance across months could either be caused by estimation error, or by true variance in the

value of the index. If the increased standard deviation of the index which uses the smaller monthly

samples is due to estimation error, and not due to real variance in index values across months that


                                                  32
the courser bimonthly sample does not pick up, it is undesirable. However we should keep in mind

that the CPI itself is an average over many component indices, and the averaging process should

do away with much of the worry about estimation variance in the component indexes.

   Tables 1 and 9 taken together make two points. First if we are to base a hedonic adjustment

on hedonic regressions with variable sets that enable a different hedonic regression to be used in

each period and we do not take account of the value of unobserved characteristics in components

where they are important, we are likely to significantly understate the rate of price decline. In the

case of the TV component index for our period we would understate it more than a matched model

procedure would understate it. Second if we do account for the change in value of unobserved

characteristics then the hedonic correction generates price falls that are substantially larger than

that obtained from the matched model index. Moreover as we try corrections that theory tells us

should get closer to the true price change, we obtain progressively larger falls in the index.

   Table 10 asks whether these results are consistent with the estimates obtained from assuming

that the rate of fall in the evaluation of the characteristics of exiting goods in the year they exit is

at least as large as the price fall those goods experienced in the period before they exit (the “a-exit”

price falls). The indexes in this table average; (i) hedonic price relatives for continuing goods with,

(ii) the price relative in the period prior to the period in which goods exit for exiting goods for

which there was an observed price relative in the period prior to exit, with (iii) estimates of price

relatives from one of our other procedures for exiting goods which did not have an observed price

change in the period prior to exit.

   Both estimates of the rate of deflation in Table 10 lie between the estimates in panels B and C

of Table 9. That is when we use the observed price falls in the period before the good exits as a

bound on the fall in the period in which the good exits we obtain rates of price change which are

larger (in absolute value) then the indexes which only take account of the change in the values of

the unobserved characteristics of continuing goods, but lower than the estimates that take account

of the actual change in value of the unobserved characteristics in the first month of the goods that



                                                  33
exit in the second month of the two month sampling period. This is exactly what we would expect

if all of our assumptions were correct (the assumptions underlying both the Table 9 and the Table

10 estimates). We take this as strong evidence in support of our assumptions.

Notes: Also see the notes to Tables 1 and 9. The average (over all months) fractions of goods that
are continuing, exiting-with-a-previous-relative, and exiting-without-a-relative are, respectively,
(.793, .171, .036).



   The indexes in table 10 have two attractive features. First substituting the price changes in the

year prior to exit for the missing data on the price changes of the exiting goods would provide an

easy way for the BLS to correct for most of the missing data. Moreover, if the results in Table 10

are indicative, this simple substitution would tighten up the matched model bound significantly.

Second use of this procedure decreases the standard deviations across months noticeably; the table

10 standard deviations are comparable to the lowest standard errors in table 9. On the other hand

recall that there is reason to worry whether the assumptions needed for these indexes to actually

bound the compensating variation will always be satisfied, and the index that results will be a mix

of the price falls over two periods, rather than over the period of interest.

6         An “Out of Sample” Application.

The results presented in the last section were obtained after considerable experimentation, experi-

mentation which would not be possible if the index would have had to be constructed between the

time the BLS receives its data and its deadline for publishing the index. To see whether our index

could be used in “production mode” we took a sample from a later period, from February 2005 to

November 6, and re-ran all the tables and indexes in this paper with the new data. We made no

change to the procedures used in the computation, but we did change the observed characteristic

set used in the hedonic regression to reflect changes in the TV’s marketed that we were quite sure

the BLS’s industry analyst for TV’s would have picked up on.20 As it turns out the later period was

a period in which the market for TV’s evolved differently than the earlier period, so the exercise

also provides a test of the robustness our procedures to different underlying market conditions.

         The later period data replicated virtually all of the qualitative features of the data from the

earlier period that were discussed in the first four sections of this paper,21 though magnitudes did

change in notable ways. In particular the later period was a period where there was more rapid

rates of turnover in the TV’s marketed, with average exit and entry rates over the two month

sampling period of 37.6% and 36.1% respectively, about 50% larger than in the earlier period. The

turnover was still largely at the high end. Just as in the earlier period, the prices of goods in the

period before their exit were both significantly higher and falling at a faster pace then the prices of

a randomly chosen good. So the higher turnover rates may well be indicative of a more rapid rate of

obsolescence of advanced features in the later than in the earlier period. Further since the average

R2 for the hedonic regressions in the later period was less than that for the earlier period (.90 vs

about .95), the unobserved qualities of these advanced features may have also played a larger role
    20
      The most important change in the characteristic set was replacing the flat screen indicator for a “flat panel”
indicator, and interacting that with the screen size variable. Almost all TV’s in the later period were flat screen
TV’s. The flat panel category includes both liquid crystal display and plasma TV’s. We also eliminated the brand
dummies as the two brands were a smaller (and decreasing) portion of the market in the later period.
   21
      The sole exception was that in the later data the rate of fall of price relatives for recently introduced goods was
slightly less than that for all continuing goods, while in the earlier data it was slightly more.




                                                           35
in the later period.22

    Table 11 shows that, as one might expect, the more rapid rate of turnover in the later period goes

hand in hand with a more rapid rate of price decline, no matter which index one uses to measure

price declines. Both the rate of deflation, and the standard deviation in the rate of deflation, almost

double in absolute value in the later period. Most of the difference between periods is picked up by

the matched model index; i.e. in the later period goods prices were falling at a more rapid rate in

the periods before they exited. Despite this difference between the periods, the indexes we suggest

each provide a correction to the matched model index of about the same magnitude in the later as

they did in the earlier period. The later period corrections are actually slightly larger in absolute

value than they were in the earlier period, but noticeably smaller as a ratio of the matched model

index. Equally important from a methodological point of view, the order of the various indexes in

the later period is precisely the same as it was in the earlier period which, recall, is exactly the order

our theoretical reasoning predicts. We conclude that our indexes seem to do generate corrections

which abide by our priors when applied directly to new data without any prior experimentation,

and this even when the new data differs from the old in ways that have significant effects on the

magnitude of the indexes.


7     Conclusions and Caveats.

Standard hedonic procedures correct for the market’s re-evaluation of the observed characteristics

of exiting goods, but do not correct for the re-evaluation of the unmeasured characteristics of either

continuing or exiting goods. Matched model indexes correct for the markets re-evaluation of the

unmeasured characteristics of continuing goods but do not correct for the change in value of either

the observed or unobserved characteristics of exiting goods. As a result when there is substantial

turnover and important unmeasured characteristics both indices are likely to be inadequate, and

either index can be larger than the other.
  22
     This also points to the desirability of adding variables to the observed characteristic set in the later period.
Perhaps the most obvious candidate is an indicator which would let us keep separate dummies for plasma and liquid
crystal display. These are now lumped together in the flat panel dummy.

   Unmeasured characteristics can arise either because there are no sharp cardinal measures of

important characteristics of the good available, or because the measures that are available can not

be used without an extensive data cleaning procedure. Extensive data cleaning is inconsistent with

the combination of the time constraints of the BLS and the need to compute new hedonic regressions

every period in order to insure that the resultant index does in fact abide by the Konus-Laspeyres

bound to the compensating variations.

   This paper provides several ways of constructing hedonic-like indexes that at least partially

correct for both the selection bias induced by exit and for the contribution of unmeasured char-

acteristics. We have shown both that, at least in our example, the indexes we suggest can be

produced in a timely way. Moreover they produced values which were consistent with the economic

arguments that lead to them and were noticeably lower than both the matched model and standard

hedonic indices.

       We want to conclude by noting that the problems of selection and of unmeasured characteristics

are not the only problems with the component indexes that underlie the CPI. A number of other

problems remain and just as it was more important to account for unmeasured characteristics in

the TV than in the personal computer component index, the importance of these other problems

is likely to vary across component indexes.

       We already noted that none of the indexes make any adjustment for the inframarginal rents that

accrue to consumers that would have bought a new good at the highest price at which the good is

observed. Also none of the component indices take account of changes in either the environment,

or in the availability of related goods, which impact on the utility of the goods in the particular

component index of interest. For example the fall in the price of clothing as the season that the

clothing was designed for ends is partially a result of the fact that the utility the consumer derives

from that clothing falls when the season ends. Finally the sampling scheme used to construct the

component indexes attempts to measure changes in the price of a (sales weighted) average purchase

from the commodity group in question. In fact different consumers purchase at different points of

time. At least in markets for goods which are somewhat durable and in which there are seasonal

or intra model-year patterns in prices, we might think it more in line with the compensating

variation rational for price indices to compute an average of price changes over the intervals at

which consumers’ purchase the good, rather than an average over the purchases in a given interval

(for an application of this idea to automobiles see Ana Aizcorbe et. al, in process).23

Appendix 1 “Tighter” Hedonic Bounds.

This appendix assumes, in addition to Assumption 1, that the {ηt } in equation (8) follow a Markov

process. If for simplicity we assume that process is first order, the formal statement of the additional

assumption would be that the stochastic process generating {ηt } is given by the family of probability

distributions

                                               Fη = {F ( ηt+1 | ηt ); ηt ∈ R}.                                            (12)

This plus the exit rule in Assumption 1 implies that the expectation of ηi,t+1 − ηi,t conditional on

survival is given by


                                                 R         h             i
                                               η   (zi )   ηi,t+1 − ηi,t   d F (ηi,t+1 | ηi,t )                     
   E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | zi , ηi,t , ji,t   = c] = t+1                                            ≡ g η t+1 (zi ), ηi,t .   (13)
                                                         1 − F η t+1 (zi ) | ηi,t

We have an estimate of ηi,t from the hedonic regression that uses all of the data. However we need

an estimate of η t+1 (zi ).

    As in Olley and Pakes (1994) the estimate of η t+1 (zi ) is obtained from the exit equation which

is given by


                                                                              
                   P r{ηi,t+1 ≥ η t+1 (zi ) | ηi,t } = 1 − F η t+1 (zi ) | ηi,t ≡ F(η t+1 (zi ), ηi,t ).

The function F(·) maps values of (η t+1 (zi ), ηi,t ) into the interval (0, 1) and, provided F (·|ηi,t ) has

a density which is positive everywhere, is monotone decreasing in η t+1 (zi ) for any given value of

ηi,t . This implies that for any ηi,t there is an inverse which provides η t+1 (zi ) as a function of the

value of F(·) and ηi,t . Call that inverse Fη−1 , so that


                                                               h                     i
                                             η t+1 (zi ) = Fη−1 F(η t+1 (zi ), ηi,t ) ,

                                                                40
and substitute it into equation (13) to obtain

                                                             h                     i
               E[ηi,t+1 − ηt | zi , ηi,t , ji,t = c] = g(Fη−1 F(η t+1 (zi ), ηi,t ) , ηi,t ) ≡ h(Fi,t , ηi,t ),              (14)


where Fi,t ≡ F(η t+1 (zi ), ηi,t ).

       Both Fi,t and ηi,t can be estimated, and hence, if we temporarily ignore estimation error, can

be treated as observable. So, after conditioning on the fact that the good is in sample in period

t+1, we can substitute equation (14) into equation (7) to obtain


                         E[pi,t+1 − pi,t | zi , ηi,t , ji,t = c] = zi (βt+1 − βt ) + h(Fi,t , ηi,t ).                        (15)


This equation can be taken to data to estimate both the function h(·), and (βt+1 − βt ).24

       We now move to the prediction for exiting goods conditional on both observed and unobserved

characteristics. First note that



                                               0 = E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | zi ] ≡

         Fi,t E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ηi,t+1 ≥ η t+1 (zi ), zi ] + [1 − Fi,t ]E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ηi,t+1 ≤ η t+1 (zi ), zi ].

Consequently



                                                   Fi,t E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ηi,t+1 ≥ η t+1 (zi ), zi ]         Fi,t h(Fi,t , ηi,t )
E[ηi,t+1 − ηi,t | ηi,t+1 ≤ η t+1 (zi ), zi ] = −                                                       ≡−                         .
                                                                     [1 − Fi,t ]                                [1 − Fi,t ]

So the hedonic prediction for the price relatives of exiting goods conditional on both observed and

unobserved characteristics could be obtained by

                                                                                    Fi,t h(Fi,t , ηi,t )
                      E[pi,t+1 − pi,t | zi , ηi,t , ji,t = x] = zi (βt+1 − βt ) −                        .                   (16)
                                                                                       [1 − Fi,t ]

       We found that the estimates we obtained in this way to be quite imprecise and to vary a great

deal with the way one estimates the non-parametric function. There are two possible reasons. First
  24
    Formally the estimator is a two-stage semiparametric estimator. The non-parametric components are the func-
tions F (·) and h(·) and the parametric components are βt+1 and βt . For the econometric details of semiparametric
techniques see Andrews (1994) and Newey (1994) and the literature they cite.


                                                             41
the independence assumption in equation (12) might be inappropriate. Second in the empirical work

Fi,t must be estimated and if its true value is near one even a small amount of estimation error will

cause very imprecise estimates of the truncated expectation.
