Is Inflation Just Around the Corner? The Phillips Curve and Global Inflationary Pressures

                                         ABSTRACT

The length of the recovery since the Great Recession and the low reported levels of the
unemployment rate in the U.S. are increasingly generating concerns about inflationary pressures.
We document that an expectations-augmented Phillips curve can account for inflation not just in
the U.S. but across a range of countries, once household or firm-level inflation expectations are
used. Given this relationship, we can infer the dynamics of slack from the dynamics of inflation
gaps and vice versa. We find that the implied slack was pushing inflation below expectations in
the years after the Great Recession but the global and U.S. inflation gaps have shrunk in recent
years thus suggesting tighter economic conditions. While we find no evidence that inflation is on
the brink of rising, the sustained deflationary pressures following the Great Recession have
abated.

Notes: Data for the Eurozone, France, Germany, and Denmark are taken from Arioli et al. (2018). The time series of inflation expectations for
Italy is adjusted for the fact that in the early part of the survey firms were provided with recent inflation expectations which strongly influences
inflation expectations (see. Coibion et al. 2018 for more details). In the later part of the survey, a subset of firms is not provided with recent
inflation. We find that inflation gap for firms that are not provided with recent inflation is 1.8 times larger than inflation gap for firms that are
provided with recent inflation. Hence, we multiply the time series of the inflation gap by 1.8.

inflation expectations of households or firms, 𝑢 is unemployment rate, 𝑢∗ is non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment rate (NAIRU) provided by the OECD. We residualize inflation gap and unemployment gap, i.e.,
we remove country fixed effects (and country-specific linear time trends for Czech Rep., Chile, Turkey, Israel and the Euro zone).

Note: The figure plots time series of inflation gap, i.e. the different between actual inflation and one-year-ahead inflation expectations of households or firms. The global inflation gap is measured as the time fixed effects 𝜆

disinflations (Czechia, Turkey, Chile, Israel) or major monetary changes (the Euro zone). The global inflation factor and the U.S. inflation gap are scaled to have zero mean over the 2000-2007 period. The time series are
smoothed using one-year moving averages.

Note: The figure presents a scatter plot of inflation gap (𝜋 − 𝐸 𝜋 , ) versus unemployment gap (𝑢 − 𝑢∗ ) where i and t index countries and time (quarter), 𝜋 is year-on-year CPI inflation rate, 𝐸 𝜋 is one-year-ahead
inflation expectations of households or firms, 𝑢 is unemployment rate, 𝑢∗ is non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment rate (NAIRU) provided by the OECD.
