                  SECOND MORTGAGES AND HOUSEHOLD SAVING


                                 ABSTRACT




     Second mortgages accounted for 10.8% of the stock of out-
                                              from 3.6% at the
standing mortgage debt at the end of 1987, up
                         This paper investigates the determinants
beginning of the 198Os.
of second mortgage borrowing and the characteristics of second

mortgage borrowers.       We first calculate the outstanding stock of

home equity that remains to be borrowed against on tax-preferred

terms, recognizing the limits on interest deductions in the 1986
Tax Reform Act and the 1987 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.
                                                 two trillion
Despite these limits, we estimate that more than
dollars of housing equity remains to be borrowed against by

current homeowners.       We then present cross-sectional evidence

suggesting that households who obtain second mortgages after
                                                         with
purchasing a home ace less wealthy than other households
similar characteristics.       Each dollar of second mortgage borrowing

is associated with a seventy-five cent reduction in household net

worth.    While these results cannot be given      a   causal interpreta-
                                                                 to
tion,    they are consistent with the view that increased access
second mortgages has reduced personal saving.

     Second mortgages are one of the most rapidly growing

financial products of the 1980s.       While the real value of first

mortgage debt climbed at an annual rate of 4.3% during
1987 period,   junior mortgage debt grew at 23.3% per year.
Second mortgages accounted for 10.8% of the stock of mortgage
debt outstanding at the end of 1987, up from 3.6% just seven

years ago. While some second mortgages are incurred
is purchased, the most rapid expansion has involved post-

acquisition second mortgages.
      The growth of second mortgages reflects increased utiliza-

tion of traditional mortgage instruments       as well as financial

innovation.    Home equity credit lines have become increasingly

popular since their introduction in the early 1980s.        They

accounted for approximately one third of outstanding second
                                                                       -

continued growth of second mortgage borrowing.

     One of the central issues associated with the increased
                                                          the
availability and utilization of second mortgages concerns

impact of these instruments on private saving.  Summers and

Carroll (1987) argue that the growth       i   mortgage debt during the

last eight years has spurred consumerspending         and depressed

private saving.    While   advertising for home equity lines may
have encouraged households to accelerate spending plans,        the

adverse effect of second mortgage borrowing on private saving is
                                   2


not obvious.     Households may have used second mortgages to

finance investments in other assets,     or substituted second

mortgages for other types of borrowing.      This view is supported

by   a   recent Survey Research Center study showing that more than

half of those with home equity lines report using them at least
in part to repay other debts.

         This paper investigates the recent rise in second mortgage

borrowing and examines its impact on private saving.      The first

section places the recent increase in second mortgage activity

in context, documenting broad trends in residential borrowing

during the last three decades and providing specific evidence on
the recent growth in home equity credit lines.      Section two

examines the magnitude of potential home equity borrowing,

recognizing that second mortgages have not diffused completely

through the population.      We explicitly account for recent

limitations on the amount of tax-deductible second mortgage

interest and show that even assuming households refrain from

non-deductible borrowing, over two trillion dollars of home

equity remains to be borrowed against.
           The next two sections present evidence on the link

between second-mortgage borrowing and wealth accumulation.

Section three explains why aggregate evidence on the coincidence

between declines in private saving and increased home equity

borrowing is weak, and describes the data set drawn from the

Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) that underlies
our results.      Section four presents cross-sectional tests of the

The results show thst on sversge, s household with one sddition-

1.   Trends in Residential Financing. 1950-1988

      The rise in second aortgage borrowing during the l980a has

helped propel    the debt-to-value ratio on owner-occupied housing

to its highest level   since World War II.     Table 1 shows the time

series for this ratio, which rises from the early l950a through

the mid-l970a.   In part because owner-occupied house prices rose
                                                    the debt-to-value
by 35 percent in real terms during the 1970s1,

ratio declined from 42% in 1970 to 36% in 1980.       The combination

of natural turnover, with its tendency to raise loan-to-value

ratios, and second mortgage borrowing has raised this ratio

tive explanations for house price movements during the 1970a.

during the 1980s.
        The rise in the debt-to-value ratio coincides with rapid

growth of second mortgage borrowing.         While loan-to-value ratios

for new mortgages have not changed substantially during the

1980s    (see Table 1),      the debt-to-value ratio was three per-

centage points higher than in 1970.         If second mortgage borrow-

ing as    a   share of the housing capital stock had remained

constant at its 1980 level, the debt-to-value ratio would have

been only 41.5% in 1987, slightly below the level of 1970.2           In

part,    the rapid growth of second mortgages may reflect changes

in nominal interest rates during the 1980s.         Since lending

institutions usually determine lending capacity by relating
nominal interest payments to household income, falling interest
rates    enabled households to qualify for larger mortgages.        Some

households may have exercised their new borrowing power by

obtaining      a   second mortgage rather than by refinancing their

first mortgage.

        The rise of second mortgage borrowing is significant in

comparison to the decline        in household saving during the 1980s.

Since    1980,     the annual flow of new second mortgage borrowing has

averaged just below one percent of disposable income.         The

private saving rate in the 1980s has averaged 2.2 percent below


        2Our analysis focuses on second mortgage borrowing since
this is one way for households to borrow against accumulated
housing equity.  Refinancing the first mortgage on a residence
could also achieve this end. Quigley (1987) discusses the
determinants of refinancing behavior and references recent
studies

its level in the 1970s.      The present paper attempts to provide

some insight on whether such a link between saving and second

mortgages is appropriate.
    The characteristics of actual and potential second mortgag-

ors raise doubts about the role of second mortgages in reducing

saving.   Table   2   presents evidence on the fraction of homeowners
in different age groups who have second mortgages, based on

tabulations from SIPP.      The table distinguishes between second

mortgages that were obtained when the house was purchased, and
those obtained after home purchase.       The incidence of second

mortgages peaks for households with heads between 35 and 44

years of age: more than 15% of households in this group report
second mortgages.       The rate is only slightly lower    (14.3%)   for

households headed by 45-54 year olds.       These two age groups

account for more than two-thirds of the outstanding second

mortgages. The lowest rates of second mortgage borrowing are for
the very young (<25) and the elderly (>64),      two groups that have

low marginal propensities to save.

     The reasons second mortgagors incurred their         debts   also

raise questions about how these mortgages affect saving.

Results from the 1980 Census of Housing on why second mortgagors

obtained these debts are informative.       Of those who responded,

51% of respondents cited the need to make home improvements as

motivating their borrowing decision, 18% cited other investments
either in real estate or other assets, 4.6% cited education or
medical expenses,      and 26% cited other reasons.   More than half

of the households with second mortgages reported investment,

rather than consumption, factors as motivating their decision to
borrow.   The national accounts define some expenditures on

renovations, as well as medical and educational expenses, as

consumption.      Part of these expenditures should be viewed as

investments in human capital or consumer durables, and could

therefore arguably be excluded from consumption.3

      A   1987 survey by the Survey Research Center directed at

second mortgagors with home equity lines (HELs) yielded similar

findings.      For these households,       53% reported that the first use

of their HEL was to pay off other debt.           One quarter indicated

they obtained their home equity loan principally to finance             a

home improvement, although another 19% of the respondents indi-

cated some subsequent use of the home equity loan to finance
renovations.      In addition, 12% of the respondents indicated the

loan was used to finance a new car purchase, while only 8% used
                                          4
the HEL for medical or education expenses.   Measured consump-

tion is clearly higher for these two groups,           although the link
with home equity loans is unclear.           Many car buyers may have
used HELs, which offer lower interest rates than other types of

consumer debt, in place of other forms of automotive debt.              The

results do not reveal how many households initiated HELs for

non-consumption reasons,     but subsequently used these instruments


     3These 1980 survey results precede the recent growth in
home equity borrowing, which may have changed the rationale for,
and uses of, second mortgage debt.
     4More detail may be found in Canner, Fergus, and Luckett (1988
to finance consumption outlays.      The impact of second mortgage

borrowing on household consumption is therefore an empirical
question.


2.    How Much Home Equity Is Still Locked Up?

       The previous section noted the rapid rise in second

mortgage borrowing during the 1980s, but provided no evidence on
the magnitude of potential future borrowing.       Since the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) raised the attractiveness of home

equity borrowing in comparison to other types of consumer debt,
an increasing fraction of households are likely to incur second

mortgages.     While   it is straightforward to calculate the

household sector's net equity in owner-occupied real estate,

recent tax changes restrict the amount of mortgage interest that
households may deduct from their taxable income.       Estimating the
amount of home equity that could be borrowed against at favora-

ble after-tax interest rates therefore requires information on

the fraction of households that would be affected by the legal

caps on interest deductibility, and the amount of housing equity

they hold.      In this section we describe the limits   on tax-

deductible borrowing, and then use the SIFF data base to

estimate the amount of home equity that remains to be levered in

a    tax-deductible form.


2.1     Limitations on Tax-Deductible Home Morteage Interest
        The TRA phased out deductions for all consumer interest
                                              8


except that on debt secured by first or second homes.                     Interest

on original purchase home loans of less than $1 million remains

fully deductible under the TRA, and this upper limit binds for

relatively few households.               Mortgages obtained after purchase
are subject to tighter restrictions.                 While the TRA instituted

"tracing rules"              that made interest deductibility contingent on

the purpose for which debt was incurred, these complex rules

were superceded by provisions in the 198] Omnibus Budget

Reconciliation Act.              A taxpayer can deduct unlimited interest on

post-acquisition borrowing provided the debt is used to finance
additions or alterations to the residence.                 For other-purpose

debt incurred after October 13, 1987, however, a taxpayer may
deduct interest on mortgage debt of D      min(V, D     .    +        .


                                      cap           original

and   fl     .   .
           or i ginal   is   the outstanding principal on the original

purchase loan.5               Early in   a   taxpayer's tenure as a homeowner,
the home's current market value is likely to be the binding

constraint on the amount of debt.                 At some stage,   however, if
debt repayment and home appreciation raise accumulated home

equity above $100,000,             the second constraint binds.

             A homeowner can never deduct interest on non-renovation

mortgages in excess of the original purchase mortgage principal

plus $100,000, regardless of what mortgage instruments are
combined in reaching this total.                  For a household incurring a

most households will probably avoid borrowing more than the

limit except in circumstances of financial distress.                                                           Our next

section calculates the amount of accumulated home equity that

could be levered at tax-favored rates.


2.2     Estimates of Available Home Equity

        To estimate the amount of equity that might be borrowed

against for purposes other than home renovations, we make three

assumptions:                (1)    households cannot borrow more than 90% of the

value of their home,                     (ii) households borrow up to, but not more

than,       the amount of debt that they may incur while still

completely deducting interest payments from their taxes, and
(iii) half of the existing second mortgage debt was used to

finance renovations and therefore would not be counted against
                                  10

the $100,000 limit on post-acquisition indebtedness.     For most

households, these assumptions lead to straightforward calcula-
tions of the amount of available tax-deductible borrowing.      For

households who refinanced their first mortgage, we do not have

information on the remaining principal on their acquisition

loan.   We impute   this using aggregate data on fixed-rate

mortgage terms in the year when the home was purchased.6
        Table 3 presents our tabulations on the stock of available

home equity.    The average property value for homeowners in our

sample was $79,500 (1988 dollars), with equity of $58,000.      The

total home equity represented by our sample    is therefore $3.03

trillion.7     The average amount of tax-deductible equity is

$45,800;   this translates to a potential stock of $2.53 trillion

in unused borrowing.     If the $100,000 limit on tax-deductible

second mortgage debt had been in place in 1985, only 10.5% of
homeowners would have been affected.8 Many elderly households


     6We assume that households that refinanced initially
borrowed eighty percent of the purchase price of their home
using a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at the FHLBB's average
mortgage interest rate.
     7The sampling weights for households in our sample trans-
late into 55.2 million households, somewhat smaller than the
Census Bureau's estimate of 55.5 million homeowning households
in 1985.  The 1985 home equity in our sample, weighted to
correspond to the population, is $2.75 trillion.  This is higher
than the Federal Reserve Board's estimate of net housing equity
($1.96 trillion) for 1985. The difference between SIPP and Flow
of Funds estimates has been noted before, for example in U.S.

appear reluctant to borrow against their home equity,          although

the reasons for such behavior are not well understood (see Venti.

and Wise (1988)).      Assuming that households headed by someone
over age 65 would not borrow,      the stock of available equity is

$1.86 trillion.
     We also calculated the pool of tax-deductible borrowing

that would be associated with limits below $100,000 on the
amount of second mortgage debt.         A limit   of $50,000 would reduce

the stock of available equity to $1.90 trillion.          Even with such

modest limits on borrowing, the diffuse distribution of home

equity makes the amount of potential borrowing quite large.
      Our final calculation concerns the amount of consumer debt

that could be replaced by home equity borrowing.          We tabulated

the fraction of reported consumer debt that was held by homeown-

ers and that could be replaced by mortgage debt.           For example,

if a homeowner reported $120,000 of consumer debt,          we assumed

that only D          would be borrowed as deductible housing debt.
              cap2
[f a non-homeowner reported $120,000 of consumer debt,          we

assumed that none would be replaced with housing debt.           Our

tabulations show that 52.2% of unsecured consumer debt (which
totalled $254 billion in the 1985 SIP? population) could be

replaced by tax-deductible housing debt.           For a broader credit

aggregate consisting of unsecured consumer debt plus vehicle
debt ($403 billion), 55.9% could have been replaced with
                                    12

borrowing backed by home equity.9 This suggests that the long-
run effects of the 1986 and 1987 tax reforms may be a sig-

nificant reallocation of consumer borrowing from traditional

consumer debt to mortgage debt.



3.   Second MortEages and Wealth Accumulation: Data           arid   Methods

        The extent   to which increased access       to and utilization of

second mortgages has depressed private saving is difficult to

gauge from aggregate time-series         evidence.    The data suggest a

rough correspondence between the rise in second mortgages during

the early    1980s   and the decline in private saving.        The limited

information on second mortgage borrowing before 1980, however,

largely precludes formal statistical         analysis of the link
between changes in mortgage borrowing and consumption.

        This suggests the need for alternative data sources for

addressing the impact of second mortgages on household saving.
An ideal data set for this project would include longitudinal
information on household income and consumption,           first and
second mortgage debt and other types of consumer borrowing, and

other factors such as wealth that might affect spending decis-

ions.    Panel   data might permit some controls for the obvious

problem of population heterogeneity that clouds the interpreta-
tion of any cross-sectional results         on saving behavior.



     9Our calculations assume that household behavior and asset
prices will not adjust in response to the new rules on interest
deductibility. Manchester (1988) discusses a variety of such
general equilibrium effects.
                               13

Moreover, it would need evidence on access to second mortgage

debt, since it is difficult to interpret the simple correlation

between borrowing and consumption without some exogenous

variation in borrowing opportunities.

     While some data sets (i.e. the PSID) include the data

outlined above, they are ruled out for this project because they
                                                                   10
were conducted before the recent growth of second mortgages.

The data set that comes closest to satisfying our requirements

is the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)   ,   the
Census Bureau's new longitudinal data base on household economic

status.   Each SIPP panel consists   of nine sets of interviews at

four-month intervals, with information on income,    employment,

and transfer receipt collected in each interview.     Supplemental

information on asset holdings, housing finance,    pension wealth,

and other topics is queried sporadically.     The data we analyze

were collected in 1985, after the rapid growth of second

mortgages at the beginning of the 1980s but prior to the recent

growth of home equity lines.
     The crucial drawback of SIPP is the lack of data on

household consumption expenditures.     This limitation severely

restricts our analysis.   Instead of comparing consumption

outlays by households with and without second mortgages, we
follow an indirect procedure that has been used in previous


     10Skinner (1988) examines the links between housing capital
gains and consumption outlays using data from the 1983 Panel
Survey of Income Dynamics. His sample therefore precedes much
of the recent growth in second mortgages which may have helped
finance consumption from housing gains.

 studies of how pensions and Social Security benefits affect

household saving (see King and Dicks-Mireaux (1982) and the

studies cited there).         We study the correlatton between second

mortgage borrowing and household net worth             rather than consump-
tion.      If individuals    are homogeneous except     with respect to

mortgage decisions,     and if consumption is unaffected by mortgage

borrowing      then we should find evidence that households with
second mortgages also have other assets --            stocks and   bonds,
more valuable homes,        or businesses --   that   offset these debts.
If second mortgages provide a way of financing

cruises,    however, households with such mortgages will exhibit
lower net worth than those without.            We begin by comparing the

net worth of households with and without second mortgages, and

then study how net worth changes when households obtain such

mortgages.
        Before examining the data, we must urge caution in inter-

prettng our results.         When households are heterogeneous and
variation in second mortgage borrowhig is correlated with

unobserved household characteristics, it         is   difficult to use
correlations to draw inferences about how policy changes              such
as restrictions on second mortgage
                                   tax-deductibility, would
affect consumption.         A simple example illustrates this.       Imagine
two types    of households: lucky and unlucky ones.         Lucky ones
experience unexpected capital gains on their portfolio assets
such as stocks    or human capital,     and can finance      high level of
consumption without resort to borrowing.          Such households would

 incidence and effect of second mortgage financing,
 suffers from several limitations.  First, while the survey

 follows the sharp increase in traditional second mortgage
                               the 1980s, it predates the recent
 borrowing at the beginning of
 growth in home-equity credit lines.  Interviews for Wave IV
                                        16

(Wave VII) were conducted between September and December, 1984

(1985).      Federal Reserve Board estimates suggest that home

equity lines were four times as large at the end of 1987 as at
the end cf 1985,        so our data may fail to reflect the behavior of

recent home equity borrowers.

        The second limitation of SIPP results from steps to protect

respondent anonymity.            The public use file reports total

mortgage debt top-coded at $100,000 and does not separate first
and second mortgages.            The market value of the respondent's home

is top-coded at $200,000 and monthly income           is also capped,

although the upper limit varies across households.11            We filed a

Freedom of Information Act request and obtained supplemental

information on total mortgage debt topcoded at $200,000, as well
as the share of that debt accounted for by junior mortgages.

Only 33 of the 8943 homeowners in our sample (.4%) were affected
by the upper limit        on mortgage debt.    A somewhat higher fraction

--   4.8%   --   were affected    by the topcoding on the total market

value   of their home.

        Broad characteristics of our sample are presented in Table

4.   We report sample means of several variables for all homeown-

ers, for those with one or more mortgages, and for those who

have second mortgages.           Homeowners with multiple mortgages are

younger, have higher annual incomes, and have more valuable
homes than homeowners with just first mortgages or with no

outstanding mortgage debt.12    The net worth of households with

second mortgages averages approximately $22,000 below that of

all other homeowners, and roughly $4,000 below that of homeown-

ers with one mortgage (the "with one mortgage" category can be

calculated from the data in Table 4).      Net worth is defined

inclusive of investments in individual retirement plans, such as

Keoghs,   but exclusive of the pension assets that employees may

be entitled to.    The measure also excludes Social Security

wealth,   which may be the principal asset for some retired or

nearly-retired households.
     Households with second mortgages have more total mortgage

debt than other households --   $32,500   more than the average for

homeowners without second mortgages, and $15,000 more than the

average for homeowners with only first mortgages.       This
evidence indicates that households with second mortgages have

lower net worth, but not by the full amount of their second

mortgages, relative to households without such debts.     Comparing
means is suspect, however, because there are no controls for

household characteristics; this   is   why the next section presents

regression analysis.

3.2 Second Mortgages and Household Wealth: Cross Sectional Tests

     Our specification for household net worth follows that of


      120ne disturbing feature of the SIPP sample is its higher
incidence of second mortgage holders than in the population at
large.   The 1985 National Housing Survey reported 56.15 million
owner-occupied housing units, of which 3.3 million (5.9%) had
outstanding junior mortgages. In our sample, the fraction with
second mortgages is 9.8%.

but may not be captured in our simple specification, as well as

an indicator variable for whether household mortgage debt or

housing equity was top-coded.
         We construct three variables to measure a household's

mortgage debt position.         The first is the outstanding

tion indebtedness on the current property, the second is the
                                          and the third is post-
 liability on refinanced first mortgages,

 for either of two reasons:        interest rates may have declined

 since the first mortgage was obtained,         or the household's
                                 19

consumption or inve:-tent demands may dictate an increase in
home   leverage.   The latter possibility suggests that refinancing

a first mortgage is an alternative to second mortgage borrowing,

implying that the net worth of households with refinanced first
mortgages may be lower than that of households with acquisition
first mortgages.

       Zero coefficients on the various mortgage debt measures in

a   regression explaining net worth would indicate that households
with greater mortgage debt aLso hold greater assets.    If alA, of

the cross-sectional variation in mortgage behavior arises

because different households had decided to buy houses of

different sizes, consequently 'orrowing different amounts and

possibly resorting to second mortgages to raise their loan-to-
value ratio, net home equity might be relatively constant and

therefore mortgage debt might not help predict net worth.     If

households that take out second mortgages after their homes

or businesses, we would again expect no relationship between the

second mortgage or refinanced-mortgage variable and net worth.     13

       If households use second mortgages and refinanced first

mortgages to finance consumption outlays, then these debt
variables should be negatively correlated with net worth.    As we

noted above, however, such a negative correlation could also

view that the division of total mortgage debt between first and
second mortgages is simply an artifact of the way acquisition

larger housing capital gains and used second mortgages

liquidate them.
         The importance of housing capital gains in the second

mortgage decision     suggests    controlling for these gains in the

net worth equation.     SIPP includes      a   question on the purchase
                                            this could be used
price of the current home, and in principle
to calculate housing capital gains.            However, many reported

purchase prices seemed erroneous,         especially for homes purchased

more than thirty years prior to the survey.            Several households
                                               current market
reported purchase prices equal to their home's
value, even though it was purchased long ago, perhaps because

 they misunderstood the questionnaire.

homeowner who spends significant amounts on renovations will

report   s   current market value well above the purchase price, but

may not have a capital gain.

        We avoided these difficulties by developing an alternative

measure of accrued gains.           Since 1963, the Census Bureau has

compiled an index of the purchase price for constant-quality

single-family houses in four different regions.                     Using the
household's reported date of purchase in conjunction with the

regional identifier we constructed             a   variable measuring house

price appreciationJ4       This variable also has disadvantages: it

ignores land values and it neglects location-specific price
moves that are not reflected in regional aggregates.                           It is

nevertheless the housing capital gain variable used in the

subsequent regressions.
       The regression model we estimate is

4.     Estimation Results: Cross Sectional Evidence

        We estimate equation (3) on three different data samples:

all of the homeowners on 51FF, all homeowners except those with

incomes in the top decile of the income distribution, and all

homeowners except those with net worth in excess of one million

dollars.  Our sample choices are partly designed to mitigate the
effect of mortgage debt topcoding, a problem that is more severe

for higher income households.        In addition, these    sampling rules

may shed light on behavioral differences in the population.
     The estimation results are shown in Table 5. Most of the

estimated coefficients seem plausible: net worth is a higher
                                                than for younger
multiple of current income for older households
                                                           are

                                                         smaller
wealthier, but otherwise larger households have somewhat
net worth,     and higher education yields higher net worth.

        A consistent pattern emerges       from the mortgage debt

coefficients. Acquisition indebtedness has a small positive

effect on net worth.       The effect is statistically insignificant

for the full sample,      although the hypothesis of no effect can be

rejected in the smaller samples.          For refinanced mortgage debt,

there is a negative and statistically significant association

with net worth.     Each dollar of refinanced mortgage is as-

sociated with between a twenty and thirty cent reduction in net

worth, with a stronger effect when high-income and high-wealth
households are included.

     The coefficients on the post-acquisition second mortgage

debt variable are even larger than those on refinanced debts.

Each dollar of second mortgage borrowing is associated with
between a sixty and a seventy-five cent reduction in net worth.

The samples excluding millionaires and the high income house-

holds yield similar results.     Although the standard errors on
these estimates are sizable,    the null hypothesis that second

mortgages do not affect net worth can be rejected at standard
confidence levels.     The hypothesis that each dollar of second

mortgage borrowing translates into a one dollar reduction in
household net worth is also rejected.
         The house price appreciation variable affects net worth in

a positive and significant manner.          The coefficients suggest

that an additional dollar of real housing capital gains         is

associated with roughly one dollar and thirty cents of addition-

al net    worthj5   Since these equations include the stock of

     15                                                                -

capital gains on consumption, consistent with our evidence that
for non-second mortgage households, most housing capital gains
augment net wealth.  Our equations are concerned solely with
capital gains on the current residence, however, so if a
household with a large gain consumes it in part by moving to a
new house, our analysis will not reflect this.

second mortgage debt,        the capital gain variable indicates the

net worth effect of      a   capital gain with no post-acquisition
second mortgage.     Our finding     of a more than one-for-one effect

from housing gains could reflect our omission of capital gains

on land:    land prices may have appreciated by more than house

prices,    generating   a Timultiplierli   effect for the house price in-
crease.

       The principle objection to the ordinary least squares

results in Table    S is that    mortgage borrowing and net worth are
simultaneously determined.        This makes it impossible to inter-

pret the resulting correlations as evidence of what would happen
if,   for example, mortgage borrowing were restricted by law.

Identifying the structural coefficient that measures the net
worth effect of an exogenous shift in second mortgage borrowing
is difficult, since it requires us to find instrumental vari-

ables that affect a household's demand for second mortgages but

not its net worth.      We are not convinced that valid instruments

exist,    although one possibility for future work might involve
interstate variation in banking practices.
         We explored the robustness of our OLS findings by treating

second mortgage debt as endogenous,         performing instrumental
variable estimation with imperfect instruments.          The instrumen-

tal variable results ranged widely,         depending on the instruments
we used.    When the household's outstanding medical and tuition
bills were used as instruments,        on the grounds that they might

reflect shocks to liquidity that would induce borrowing, the
                                      25

estimated coefficient on MORT2 was
                                             -   .96 with   a   very large

standard error.       Adding indicator variables for the presence of
such debt, or for Census region, to the first stage equation

caused the coefficient on MORT2 to change signs and often
                                                   The lack of robustness in
yielded large positive coefficients.
these equations reflects the low correlation between the

instruments and the mortgage debt variables.

     Much of the policy concern surrounding the low rate of

private saving is motivated by concern that corporations are

foregoing investment opportunities because of an inadequate

supply of loanable funds.         On this view, not only the level of

household net worth but its allocation between different assets

may be important.        If second mortgage borrowing finances

residential additions and alterations,              the ultimate effects on

the corporate capital stock are different than if households use

their second mortgage proceeds to invest in corporate stock.

Fortunately,       SIPP records   some detail on portfolio composition

that enables us to address this            issuej6
     Table     6   reports estimates of disaggregated asset holding


     l6     may yield somewhat misleading information on the
disaggregated structure of household portfolios. Net worth
                                                               and
income are reported on a household basis, while disaggregated
assets and liabilities are reported on an individual basis.     For
assets held jointly, such as a husband-wife checking account,
the survey attributes the asset's full value to kQ.sj. owners.
Our analysis focuses on detailed balance sheet information for
only the head of household, since the other alternative
aggregating all assets held by household members, will overstate
actual asset holdings. Our procedure therefore omits assets
held individually by household members other than the household
head, although the consequent bias in our results is unclear.

For some,   the full amount   of the second mortgage may be ploughed

back into home improvements.      This would imply no change in net

housing equity provided marginal "q" on these projects equals

unity, while net housing equity would decline if marginal "q" is
less than one.    Alternatively, some households may obtain second

mortgages and finance current consumption,     causing   a   decline in

net home equity by the full amount of their second mortgage.

     Our regression results merely indicate the association

between second mortgage debt and other financial characteristics

of the homeowning population.      They do not permit us to draw
conclusions about what would happen if second mortgages were
made less accessible,     for example by tightening restrictions on

tax deductibility.      Such restrictions might instead lead to

other forms of borrowing or asset sales to finance spending
needs.   Further work developing a structural model for borrowing
and saving decisions is needed to resolve these questions.



5.   Second Mortgage Borrowing Decisions

      SIP? respondents were asked about their housing assets         and

mortgage liabilities twice during the survey.     The first set of

questions were part of the Topical Module for Wave       IV,   ad-

ministered during the last four months of 1984.      One year later,

a similar (but not identical) set of questions was included as

part of Wave VII.    Our cross-sectional tests focus on the Wave

VII data,   the most recent data available on the incidence of

second mortgages.    It is also possible to investigate the
                               28

characteristics of households acquiring second mortgages by

studying differences in second mortgage liabilities between
Waves IV and VII.   We use these data to study the determinants

of new second mortgage borrowing and to test the importance of

accrued housing capital gains in motivating household decisions

to obtain second mortgages.

     The average second mortgage principal for households

obtaining new, non-acquisition second mortgages between these
two surveys was $18,952 and the average decline in net worth was

$6855,   or 36% of the borrowed amount.18   This is roughly half

our cross-sectional estimate that each dollar of second mortgage

debt reduces net worth by approximately seventy-five cents.        The

smaller longitudinal estimate might reflect the time lag between
                                                         for a
mortgage borrowing and spending: asset balances may rise

period after the debt is incurred while the household

purchases.    Households obtaining new loans also experience an

average reduction of $2071 in unsecured consumer debt, or

approximately eleven percent of the new second mortgage
amount. 19


     18We identified 381 households with second mortgages in
Wave VII but without second mortgages in Wave IV.  This appears
to be an unusually large increase in second mortgage borrowing,
since only 904 households in Wave VII have second mortgages. We
have not yet identified the source of this faster-than-national-
average growth in second mortgage debt in our sample.
     19We also estimated regression models for the change in net
worth as a function of changes in second mortgages outstanding
and other factors.  The point estimates were inconsistent with
those from the cross section: an additional dollar of second
                                                            in

net worth, although the large standard error for this coeffi-

        Our principal interest in the longitudinal data is in

exploring what determines second mortgage borrowing.             In the

last section we discussed the possbility that second mortgages

are used to reduce net housing equity when unanticipated capital

gains raise net worth above the desired age-net worth trajec-

tory.     This view implies that households with large accrued

capital gains should be more likely to incur second mortgages
than households without such gains, conditional on the level of

housing equity before second mortgage borrowing.             If a household

has accumulated a significant stock of housing equity by paying

down its first mortgage according to          a   lifecycle plan, it will
not have an elevated remortgaging probability,            while if the

equity results from capital gains, it will.
        We test this proposition by estimating a probit model for

the decision to obtain a non-acquisition second mortgage between

SIPP Waves IV and VII,         The explanatory variables include the

net value of home equity before second mortgages, other net

worth, household income, our measure of house appreciation, as
well as the demographic,        occupation,   and regional indicator

that net worth declines by thirty to forty percent of the second
mortgage amount.

accumulated net worth at different points in the lifecycle. In
these equations we include the age dummy variables without interactio

the four variables of principal interest.21              The equation is

estimated for two data samples:      one including all homeowners

without second mortgages in Wave        LV,       and the other all such

homeowners who were less than 65 years of age in Wave IV.               The

results provide striking confirmation for the view that second

mortgages are used by households with significant accrued

capital gains.    The household's net home equity has a statisti-

cally insignificant and substantively trivial effect on second

mortgage probabilities (a ten thousand dollar increase in

housing equity lowers the chance of obtaining a second mortgage
during 1985 by below one tenth of one percent, when the average
risk of acquiring a mortgage was 6.5%).              In contrast, the

accrued stock of capital gains has an important and statistical-

ly significant effect     on borrowing probabilities.          A ten

thousand dollar housing capital gain raises the one-year

borrowing probability by .007.       The other variables have

plausible signs   -
                      households with   more non-housing wealth are

less likely to obtain new second mortgages, with one thousand
dollars of net worth predicted to reduce the chance of obtaining

a second mortgage by half as much as one thousand dollars of

capital gain raises     it.   Households with higher incomes are more

likely to obtain second mortgages; this may in part reflect
their ability to qualify for such borrowing.

6.   Conclusion

     Our findings suggest a significant negative correlation

between    a   household's stock of secondrnortgage debt and its net

worth.     On average, each additional dollar of second mortgage

borrowing is associated with      a   seventy-five cent reduction in

household net worth.       These results are consistent with the view
                                                             L980s has
that the rise in second mortgage borrowing during the

financed higher levels of personal consumption and depressed

private saving.       Our results do not provide definitive evidence

in support of this view, however, because it is difficult to

isolate exogenous variation in mortgage borrowing.         Conclusions

on the potential effects of tighter limits on second mortgage

borrowing or of restrictions on interest tax deductibility must
await a structural model of the borrowing decision.

         Our analysis of the second mortgage market has considered

only one channel by which these instruments affect capital
formation.       A central question for future work is how the rise

of HELs and second mortgages has altered incentives for residen-

tial capital formation.       The U.S. tax code encourages investment

in owner-occupied housing rather than nonresidential capital;

the relative illiquidity of housing investments partly counter-

acts these tax incentives.       The evolution of new institutions

that facilitate borrowing against housing equity may ultimately

encourage resource allocation toward the housing sector.
Increased housing liquidity may also affect housing market

dynamics.       The increased availability of second mortgage borrow-
                                 32

ing may reduce household mobility, both because the incidence of

discress sales may fall and because households will find it

easier co borrow and expand cheir exiscing homes instead of

moving.    This may affect the set of homes which "trickle down"

from one set of homeowners co another, with unclear welfare

effects.   Recenc tax rules chac treac acquisition debt more

favorably than subsequent borrowing may have an opposite effecc,
however, and raise   turnover.   These issues warrant investiga-

cion in future work.
