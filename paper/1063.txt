                     The Demand for International Reserves
                        and Exchange Rate Adjustments:
                         The Case of LDC's, 1964—1972


                                   ABSTRACT


     In this paper the relationship between the demand for international

reserves and exchange rate adjustments is empirically investigated for a

group of LDC's. It is shown that countries that have maintained a fixed

exchange rate for a long period of time have a different demand function

than countries that have occasionally used exchange rate adjustments for cor-

recting payments imbalances. The dynamics of the adjustment for both groups

of countries are also analyzed. The results show that while both groups

tend to eliminate reserve disequilibria fast, those countries that have maintained

 a fixed rate tend to do it more slowly than countries that have occasionally

devalued their currency. It Is also shown that the year prior to a devalua-

tion, international reserves have been, on average, 30% below their short—run

desired level. These results are important since they indicate that not all

LDC's should be aggregated for prediction purposes. The results also have

implications for the analysis of the adequacy of international reserves in

less developed countries.

 1. INTRODUCTION


     In most recent empirical studies of the demand for international reserves a

 distinction has been made between developed and less developed countries, and

 separate functions for these two groups have been estimated.-' However,

 classifying countries only according to their degree of economic development

 does not allow one to discriminate between their willingness to use alternative

 tools to correct international payments imbalances. In particular, most of

 the recent empirical work on the demand for international reserves does not

 distinguish between countries that have been willing to use exchange rate

 adjustments (i.e., devaluations) to correct international payments difficulties

 from those countries that have practically ruled out the exchange rate as a

 policy tool.'

     From a theoretical point of view, however, the demand for international

reserves will be different in countries that rely exclusively on expenditure—

changing policies, and in countries that are also willing to use expenditure—

switching policies to solve temporary payments problems. In general, it

would be expected that countries that are willing to use the exchange rate as

a tool for correcting transitory payments imbalances would want to hold less

reserves (on average) as a buffer stock to finance those payments problems.--'

This fact has been recognized by a number of authors. Kelly (1970, p. 656),

for example, argues that "the final option is to alter the peg...[s]uch a

policy would also require the holding of less reserves." Hipple (1974,

page 30), on the other hand, has pointed out that "if a nation is willing to

change its exchange rate frequently, it will have a reduced need for reserves."

See also Clark (l970a), Crockett (1978), Claasen (1976), Flanders (1971) and

Makin (1974). If this is the case, then it would be incorrect to pool these

two groups of countries for prediction or other purposes. In particular,

studies on the adequacy and distribution of international reserves based on

common (for all LDC's) demand estimates will be highly tnisleading.-'

     In this paper, the demand for international reserves by less developed

countries (LDC's) is analyzed, making an explicit distinction between countries

that have maintained a fixed exchange rate for a long period of time and

countries that have occasionally used devaluations as a means to correct pay-

ments imbalances. The results obtained indicate that both groups of countries

have different demand functions for international reserves, with devaluation

countries holding, on average, less reserves, and that they should not be pooled,

as has often been done. Furthermore, the results indicate that the demand for

international reserves function for those LDC's that have maintained a fixed

exchange rate is very similar to estimates previously obtained by other authors

(i.e. ,   Frenkel,   1980) for developed countries. The dynamics of the adjustment

of international reserves for these two groups of LDC's is also analyzed, and

it is found that fixed exchange rate countries tend to correct discrepancies

between actual and desired reserves slower than countries that occasionally

adjust their exchange rates. Finally, the relationship between the devaluation

episodes included in the sample, and reserves holdings, is investigated. The

results show that the year prior to the devaluation, international reserves

in these countries have been, on average, 30% below their short—run desired

level.


2.    The Demand for International Reserves by Less Developed Countries

      This section presents estimates of the long—run demand for international

reserves for a group of 23 LDC's that maintained a fixed exchange rate during

1964—1972, and for a group of 18 LDC's that devalued their currencies at least

once during this period. In this study fixed rate countries were defined as

those that adjusted their parities less than 1% a year. On the other hand,

devaluation countries were defined as those that had devaluations of at least
                                        —3--


    Most recent studies on the demand for international reserves have assumed

that reserves are held both to finance international transactions and as a

buffer stock to face unexpected payments difficulties.          These studies have

assumed that the demand for international reserves is a stable function of

a small number of variables reflecting the scale of the country, the variability

of its payments, its degree of openness and the opportunity cost of holding

reserves. It has been postulated (Frenkel, 1974; Heller and Khan, 1978)

that the larger the scale of the country in question, the larger will be

the volume of reserves it would want to hold. The scale of a country has

usually been measured by its total imports or total income.


    With respect to external disturbances, most authors have assumed that the

higher the variability of a country's external payments, the higher the level

of reserves it would desire to hold (Clark 1970a, Kelly 1971, Hipple 1974,

Claasen 1976). Also, most models assume that the more open a country is to

the world economy, the more vulnerable it will be to external shocks and,

as a consequence, the higher the level of reserves it will demand (Frenkel 1974,

Ripple 1974, lyoha 1976). The degree of openness of a particular country has
                                                               6/
usually been associated with its marginal propensity to import.—

    Finally, since by holding resources in the form of international reserves

a country foregoes income, it has usually been assumed that the higher the

alternative cost of holding these reserves, the lower the demand for them

(Heller, 1966; Kelly, 1970; Clark, 1970a; Frenkel and Jovanovic, 1981).

However, most empirical studies on the demand for international reserves

have found that the coefficient of the opportunity cost of holding reserves ——

usually   measured by the domestic interest rate ——   is   not significant.2'

For these reasons, and considering the difficulties in obtaining reliable

data on interest rates in LDC's, in this study, as in those by Clark (1970b),

Frenkel (1974, 1978, 1980), Heller and Khan (1978), Bilson and Frenkel (1979),
                                      —4—


and Saidi (1981), the opportunity cost variable has been dropped from the

empirical analysis. Based on these considerations, the following demand

function for international reserves —— suggested by Bilson and Frenkel (1979) ——

was estimated, using cross—section data for 1964—1972, for both groups of

LDC's (for alternative specifications, see Edwards, 1981):


log R = b     + b log Y + b log m + b log G + un                               (1)
     n    o      1    n    2     n   3     n


where Y is income, and is included as a measure of the country's scale; m is

the average propensity to import —— used as a proxy for the marginal propensity
                                                                         8/
to import; G   represents payments variability; and u is a random element.—
According to the above discussion, it would be expected that b1>0, b2>0, and b3>0.

    According to the hypothesis that countries willing to use exchange rate

adjustments have a different demand function than fixed exchange rate countries,

it would be expected that (at least some of) the b's would be significantly

different for these two groups of countries. In this paper, this hypothesis

is tested using Gujarathi's (1970) dummy variable procedure.

    Tables 1 and 2 present the cross—section results obtained from the esti-

mation of equation (1) for fixed exchange rate LDC's and for countries that

have adjusted their parity, or devaluation countries.     As may be seen,

these results are quite different for both groups. While for the case of

fixed—rate countries most coefficients (except the constants) are significant,

for the case of devaluation countries only the coefficient of log Y is sig-

nificant in all periods. The results for fixed exchange rate LDC's (Table 1)

contrast sharply with the results obtained by Frenkel (1980) for a group of

32 LDC's that include both countries that have adjusted their parity and

fixed rate LDC's.      While in Frenkel's case the variability term was only

significant in two of the nine years, in the results reported in Table 1

it is significant in all but two of the nine years.

    These results (Tables 1 and 2) indicate that while for the case of

fixed—rate countries (Table 1) the variability (c)   term plays an important
role, it is of no importance in determining the level of reserves demanded

by the devaluation countries. On the other hand, the scale and openness

variables (Yand m) are in most years significantly different from zero for

both groups of countries. These results suggest that while fixed—rate

countries demand reserves both for transactions and precautionary motives,

devaluation countries tend to neglect the precautionary motive in their
                                      9/
holdings of international reserves.

    From Tables 1 and 2 it may also be noted that the coefficients have been

quite stable through time for both groups of countries. The proposition of

stable demand functions through time was tested using an F—test. This

statistic had a value of F(32,175) = .545 for fixed exchange rate countries,

and F(32,130) = .930 for devaluation LDC's, indicating that for both groups

of LDC's the demand functions for international reserves had been stable

through 1964—1972.

    In order to formally analyze if the long—run coefficients of the demand

for reserves functions for both groups of countries are statistically

different, Gujarathi's (1970) dummy variables method was used.      In Table

3 the estimated values for dummy variables for each coefficient (excluding

the constants) corresponding to devaluation LDC's are presented.i" As may

be seen, with the exception of two cases, these dummy variables are always

negative. Furthermore, in most cases, they are significantly different from

zero: out of 27 dummy variables coefficients, 17 are significant, indicating

that the long—run coefficients of the demand for reserves tend to be sig-

nificantly different as between these two groups of countries. These demand
                                      —8—

functions seem to be particularly different with respect to the variability

(o) and openness (m) coefficients. For each of them, in six out of nine years,

the dummy variables are significant. These results suggest that studies that

constraint the coefficients for both groups of countries to be equal tend to

generate misleading conclusions. Additionally, an analysis of the residuals

from common (for all countries) regressions show that, on average, these are

significantly negative for devaluation countries, being significantly positive

for fixed—rate countries (see Edwards, 1981). This result indicates that, as

expected, countries willing to use exchange rate adjustments tend to hold less

reserves on average than fixed—rate countries.

     The results presented in this section suggest that the decisions to hold

international reserves and to adjust the exchange rate should be viewed as

jointly determined endogenously. Once these two decisions are jointly de-

rived from an optimizing problem, it should be possible to explicitly incor-

porate the determinants of a devaluation into the empirical analysis of the

demand for international reserves, allowing the reunification of the two

groups of countries considered in this paper. This could be done, for example,

by simultaneously estimating the demand for reserves and the probability of

devaluation using a maximum likelihood procedure.

     Finally, it is worth mentioning that there might be an alternative inter-

pretation to the results reported in this section. It is possible that some

of the devaluation countries adjusted their parities because they were "forced"

to do so, and not because they were more willing to do it. This possibility,

discussed in Harberger and Edwards (1982), is consistent with the hypothesis

that fixed—rate countries have a more prudent attitude towards international re-

serve holding than devaluation countries.

3. The Dynamic Adjustment of the Demand for International Reserves by Less
      Developed Countries

    The estimates presented in the preceding section assumed that countries

are permanently "on" their long run demand for international reserves. However,

in a well—known article, Clark (1970a) has developed a model that distinguishes

between long—run and short—run demand functions for international reserves.

According to this model there is a trade—off between the speed of adjustment

and the level of reserves a country is willing to hold. Depending on the

country's preferences, the monetary authority chooses an optimal combination

between the speed at which disequilibria are corrected and the optimal level

of reserves. If a country chooses a higher speed of adjustment, it will

require a lower level of reserves in order to face a given probability of

running out of reserves.         In this section the dynamics of the adjustment of the

demand for international reserves is investigated for both groups of countries.

In particular, I inquire whether the fact that devaluation countries hold, on

average, less reserves than fixed—rate countries can be partially explained

by a higher speed of adjustment by these countries.

    If it is assumed that, at any period of time, a country adjusts (the log

of) its actual reserves in a proportion of the discrepancy between desired

and actual reserves, the following expression can be written:

    log Rt —   log Rtl = r(log   R - log R1)                                    (2)

where iT is the speed of adjustment coefficient and R*t is the desired stock

of reserves in period t. The higher is ii, the faster will a current disequilibrium

in the stock of reserves be corrected. If it is assumed that the long—run demand

for international reserves is represented by equation (1), the following equation

can be estimated:
                                              —11—


log R =      lTb    + lTb1 log   + Trb2 log ' + irb3 log ct + (1—iT) log Rt_l + e      (3)



A problem with the estimation of (3) is that the time period for which data

is available for any particular country is extremely short. A solution for

this problem is to use pooled time—series and cross—section data. This pro-

cedure to estimate dynamic relationships has been previously followed by a

number of authors (i.e., Balestra and Nerlove, 1966; Nerlove, 1971; Bilson

and Frenkel, 1979; Edwards, 1980). The equation to be estimated then is:


log Rnt =     lib   + Trb1 log 'tnt + irb2 log in + lTb3 log   + (l—Tr) log Rnti + ent (4)


where n=l           K refers to the K countries in the sample and tl       T

refers to the T time periods considered for each country.

    In the estimation of this kind of model, it has generally been assumed

that the error term is of the following form (see Balestra and Nerlove, 1966;

Nerlove, 1971; Anderson and Hsiao, 1981):


    e
        nt
             un +wnt                                                                   (5)


where,

    E(u) =                = 0
                   E(w)               for all n and t


    E(un wnt) = 0                     for all n, ni and t


                                     forn=m
    E(un u m) =
                     0               fornni
                                     forn=mandt=s
 E(w
   nt wms)           0               otherwise


   Clearly, if the error structure is represented by (5) the estimation of

of (4) by OLS will result in Inconsistent estimates)-" Furthermore, the
                                                        —12—


     coefficient of Rtl will be seriously biased upwards, incorrectly indicating

     that once off their long—run demand function, countries will only tend to

     return to it very slowly. In order to avoid this problem, equation (5) was

     estimated using Nerlove's (1971) two rounds GLS estimation)'

           In the estimation of (4) the variables were expressed in real terms.

     The reason for this is that, from a theoretical point of view, reserves are

     demanded as a buffer stock to finance payment problems of a certain real magni—
           13/
     tude.— Using Nerlove s (1971) procedure, the following result was obtained

     for fixed—rate countries:




    R = — .957
log nt            + .501 log Y
                               nt
                                  + .264 log m                         + .042 log
                                                                                     nt   + .679 log R— .      (6)
            (.343) (.105)          (.131)                               (.023)             (.057)


             p =     .844
    where p is the estimated intra—class correlation coefficient (see Nerlove, 1971) and


    where the numbers in parentheses are the asymptotic standard errors. Ac-

    cording to these results, fixed—rate LDC's will correct 32.1% of a unitary

    disequilibrium in the stock of reserves in one year. The long—run coefficients

    of the demand for reserves for these countries are b = —2.981; b1 = 1.560;

    b2 =   .822;     and b3 =   .130.   On the other hand, the estimation of (4) yielded

     the following result for the devaluation countries:



log Rt = -1.602 + .404 log '            - .155    log    in        -    .040 log         + .580 ba R           (7
                                                              nt                    nt              nt—i
                                                                                                           ;
            (.415) (.118)                (.145)                        (.084)             (.071)

                 =   .775
                                      —13—


As may be seen, in this case the speed of adjustment coefficient is higher

than for fixed—rate LDC's ——   (1—) = .420   ——   indicating   that devaluation

countries tend to correct disequilibria in the stock of reserves faster than

fixed—rate countries.--' According to (9), the long—run coefficients of the

demand for reserves by devaluation LDCts are b = —3.814; b1 = .962;

b2 = —.369; and b3 = —.095.

    The speed of adjustment coefficients obtained in this study, using

Nerlove's two round estimates, are higher than most of the results obtained

in previous works, and they indicate that, for devaluation countries, after

five years, 94 percent of a reserves disequilibrium would be corrected.

For the case of fixed—rate countries, after five years, 85% of a unitary

disequilibrium would be corrected. This is an important result, since it

indicates that not only is there a stable long—run demand for international

reserves by LDC's, but that these countries tend to correct reserves dis—

equilibria quite fast.


4. Devaluation Crises and International Reserves

    It has usually been argued that countries devalue their currencies when

they "run—out" of international reserves (See Bilson, 1979, and Harberger and

Edwards, 1982). However, the level of international reserves that triggers a

devaluation should be measured in relation to the desired level of reserves, and

not with respect to some absolute arbitrary level. In this section the re-

lationship between the level of international reserves actually held by these

countries the year before the devaluation and the short—run desired level of

reserves in that year is analyzed. This analysis gives additional information

on the behavior of LDC's, indicating by how much, on average, actual reserves

have fallen under their desired levels prior to a devaluation. In addition,
                                                —14—


  this analysis would provide useful information that would help predict de-

  valuation ?!crisesI in LDC's.


     An analysis of the residuals from Nerlove's two—round estimation procedure

 for devaluation countries (equation 7) shows that, for most countries, these

 residuals are negative the year prior to the devaluation. This indicates

 that when approaching a devaluation decision, reserves have indeed fallen

 below their short—run desired level. In order to investigate the magnitude

 of this reserves deficiency, equation (4 ) was estimated using a dummy variable

 for the year previous to the devaluation. The result obtained using Nerlove's

 two—round estimate was:




log Rflt = —1.775 ÷ .436 log
                                     — .165 log tmnt — .067 log nt
          (.417) (.120)               (.145)             (.084)



              + .561 log R   -1
                                  — .309 0EV,          = .750
               (.071)              (.085)

  where DEV is a dummy variable for the year previous to a devaluation and

  the asymptotic standard errors are in parentheses. This result indicates

  that the year before a devaluation crisis countries are, on average, 31

  percent short of their short run desired level of real international

  reserves.

5. Concluding Remarks

    The results reported in this paper indicate that not all LDC's behave

in the same way with respect to their demand for international reserves.

In particular, it was shown that countries that have maintained a fixed

exchange rate for a long period of time have a different demand for inter-

national reserves than countries that have occasionally used devaluations to

correct payments imbalances. It was found that while devaluation countries

hold, on average, less reserves than fixed—rate countries, they tend to adjust

towards desired reserves faster. This tends to confirm Clark's (1970) hy-

pothesis of the existence of a trade—off between the level of reserves a

country wants to hold and the speed at which disequilibria are corrected.

    These results are important in at least three ways. First, they indicate

that not all LDC's should be pooled for the analysis of international reserves.

This is particularly important for the analysis of the distribution and

"adequacy" of international reserves. Usually, in these studies the "adequacy"

of reserves is measured by comparing actual reserves with desired reserves,

as computed from some demand function (See Kenen and Yudin, 1965, and Bird, 1978).

However, if, for one group of countries, the demand function used as a bench-

mark for the comparison does not correspond to the actual demand function, the

results from these adequacy studies will be misleading. Second, these results

may help explain why, in studies that have not made an explicit distinction be-

tween countries that are willing to adjust their parity, and countries that

maintained a fixed rate, persistent negative residuals were found for some

countries (i.e., the United Kingdom and New Zealand), and persistent positive

residuals were found for others (i.e., Switzerland). (See Frenkel, 1978, p.

128.) In light of the results presented in this paper, the reason for these

persistent patterns of residuals is that these countries have different demand

functions for international reserves. In fact, both the U.K. and New Zealand
                                     —16—


had used exchange rate adjustments (even before 1973) to correct payments im-

balances, while Switzerland had traditionally ruled out a devaluation as a

policy tool. Also, the results obtained indicate that LDC's tend to correct

disequilibria situations between desired and actual reserves quite quickly.

Finally, the analysis presented in this paper suggests that the decisions

about reserve holdings and exchange rate adjustments should be viewed as

simultaneously determined endogenously. This indicates that international

reserve models should be able to generate, from a maximizing framework, the

joint determination of these decisions.

                                FOOTNOTES


In the studies by Bilson and Frenkel (1979), Clark (1970b), Frenkel (1974),

(1978), (1980), Heller and Khan (1978), Hipple (1974), and Kelly (1970),

for example, different demand functions for developed and less developed

countries were estimated. The literature on the demand for international

reserves has been extensively reviewed. See, for example, Clower and

Lipsey (1968), Gruebel (1971), and Williamson (1973). See also the studies

published by the International Finance Section of Princeton University and

by the International Monetary Fund. On the demand for international re-

serves by LDC's, see Bird (1978).


An exception to this are the studies by Kelly (1970), Flanders (1971) and

Ripple (1974). These authors have used dummy variables to capture countries'

attitudes towards maintaining a fixed exchange rate. Their results, how-

ever, have been inconclusive.


This proposition can be easily derived from a model of the demand for

international reserves for precautionary motives. In this case, the de-

sired level of reserves can be written as (see Whalen, 1966)

     R* = (2
               2   C)1/3

where C is the (fixed) cost of running out of reserves,    is the varia-

bility of net external payments, and I is the opportunity cost of holding

reserves. In this context, it is possible to think that both     and C

will be lower in countries that are willing to adjust their parity to

correct payments imbalances than in fixed exchange rate countries.

     In a more complicated model, derived by Frenkel and Jovanovic (1980),

it can be shown that if 2 is different for both groups of countries, the

elasticities of the demand for reserves with respect to its determinants

will differ among groups of countries.
                                        —19—


Ripley and Suss (1974), for example, estimate a common demand function to

analyze reserves "needs" and distribution for 104 countries. However,

their results ——   that   show that reserves are unequally distributed —— depend

heavily on the incorrect assumption that all countries have the same demand

function.


The period of analysis has been confined to 1964—1972 for two reasons:

first, in this way, the problem that arises after 1972, when the inter-

national monetary system turned to a (managed) floating system, is avoided.

Second, in this way we can make sure to have enough observations for the

cross—section analysis for fixed exchange rate countries. For a list of

the countries considered, see the Appendix. Most of these countries had

one devaluation during the period considered, not allowing to test the rele-

vance of alternative country groupings (i.e., groupings according to the

number of devaluations). By only including countries with devaluations of

at least 10%, a distinction is being made between countries that adjust their

exchange rate in order to correct international payments imbalances (or balance

of payments crises) and countries that have followed managed float, crawling

peg, or institutionalized devaluation systems. For further discussion on

these countries' classification, see Harberger and Edwards (1982).


However, some authors ——    Heller   (1966), Kelly (1970), Heller and Khan

(1978) —— have considered the marginal propensity to import as a measure

of the adjustment cost. In this case there should be a negative relation-

ship between the marginal propensity to import and the demand for inter-

national reserves.


See, for example, Frenkel (1974, 1978), Hipple (1974), Heller and Khan

(1978) and Saidi (1981). A possible reason for these findings is that

international reserves are usually held in some form of interest—bearing

assets. lyoha (1974) and Frenkel and Jovanovic (1981) have been able to
                                       —20—

   find significant coefficients for the opportunity cost of holding reserves.


   See the Appendix for the exact definition, and sources, of the variables

   involved.


   On the precautionary motive to hold reserves, and exchange rate adjust-

   ments, see Makin (1974). See, also, Frenkel and Jovanovic (1981).


   This method consists of estimating a common equation with dummy variables

   for the coefficients corresponding to one of the groups. If these dummy

   variables are significantly different from zero, then the hypothesis of

   a common demand function is rejected. See Gujarathi (1970). The dummies

   for the constants were never significant.

       reason for this is that the e s will be serially correlated [i.e.,

   E(e e1) = 21         in the presence of a lagged dependent variable.


   This procedure consists of estimating, in the first round, the U's as

   the first round regression variance. In the second round,           and       are used
                                                                   U         W
   to obtain the GLS estimator.      See Nerlove (1971) for further details.

   Recently Anderson and Hsiao (1981) have suggested an equivalent consistent

   e st ima to r.




    Traditionally, however, most studies have used nominal data. Machlup

    (1976) challenged this practice, and Von Furstenberg (1980) has recently

    argued that the demand for reserves should be estimated in real terms.

    Recent studies have recognized that the correct specification of the

    demand for international reserves should be in real terms. See, for

    example, Saidi (1981). In the present case, however, the results are

    not altered in any sisnificant way if (4 )   is   estimated in nominal terms.

    See Edwards (1981).

It is important to note that the estimated speed of adjustment coeffi-

cients using Nerlove's (1971) GLS procedure are, as expected, significantly

higher than those obtained using OLS.
