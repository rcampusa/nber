         Unionization and Productivity: Micro—Econometric Evidence



                                  ABSTRACT



      It is widely agreed that unionization affects the rules and procedures

governing the employment relation in organized establishments. The effect of

these changes on establishment productivity, however, is unclear. Existing

evidence is based on a comparison of union/non—union differences in value added

per hour worked. Although positive union effects have been estimated, possible

differences in prices and technology in the union and non—union sectors render

the results inconclusive. The effect of unions on productivity is examined

in the present paper using establishment level data from the U.S. cement in-

dustry. The cement industry provides a useful empirical framework. Output

is easily measured in physical terms, and data on both union and non—union

establishments permit estimation of the union effect controlling for differ-

ences in technology. The results suggest that unionized establishments are

6—8 percent more productive than their non—union counterparts. This conclu-

sion is supported in time series data, where a comparison of productivity

before and after unionization reveals a positive union effect of similar mag-

nitude. Since the statistical analysis controls for capital—labor substitu-

tion, scale effects and technological change, the evidence suggests that

unionization leads to productive changes in the operation of the enterprise.

The results are relatively robust. Specification changes and adjustments for

omitted variables leave the basic findings intact.

     Trade unions have a perceptible influence on the production process

in organized establishments.' Even a cursory glance through a modern

labor agreement reveals the depth of union involvement in the operation

of the enterprise. Contract provisions extend beyond flatters of compen-

sation and promotion to include the introduction of new technology,

the assignment of workers to specific tasks, the size of crews, and the

amount of work to be performed. Perhaps more important than specific

rules, the typical labor agreement establishes a formal system for

setting rules and resolving disputes.

     With the extent of union interest and involvement in the production

process it seems natural to question the impact of the union on enter-

prise performance, and in particular on productivity. Yet the question

has received little analysis. In the late 1890's and early 1900's

Marshall and Moore examined the union productivity effect theoretically,

but the ideas they advanced were not followed up with empirical analysis.2

Without evidence, discussions in the literature rarely rose beyond an

inconclusive exchange of opinions.3 However, in the recent papers by

Brown and Medoff, and by Frantz attempts have been made to provide

econometric analysis of the union impact.4 Using value added per

manhour to measure productivity, bothstudies find positive union effects.

While the evidence is suggestive, the findings rest on untested assumptions

about technology and pricing behavior. Since value added has been used

to measure output in these studies, what appears to be an output effect

may well be a difference in prices. Moreover, possible differences in

technology between union and non—union establishments are not controlled

for in the analysis. Brown and Medoff find the empirical results to be

very sensitive to assumptions about differences in the parameters of the

production process.5

       This paper extends previous work by relaxing the technology and value

added assumptions. The analysis focuses on the effect of unionization on

productivity using establishment level data from the U.S. cement industry.

The output of a cement plant is measured in physical terms, and data on

both union and non—union establishments permJt estimation of the union

effect controlling for differences in technology. Furthermore, the availability

of time series data on productivity before and after unionization makes

possible estimation of the union impact while controlling for firm specific

effects, as well as changes in labor quality.    The paper is divided into

five sections. After laying out the analytical framework in section I, the

empirical model and the data are briefly described in the second section.

Section III presents the basic empirical results, while section IV contains

an analysis of firm specific effects and quality adjustments. Conclusions

are found in section V.

Section I: An Analytical Framework

        The theoretical description of the production process used in this

paper is quite simple. Output is treated as a function of capital and labor

input, where capital is presumably adjusted for the effects of depreciation,

and labor is measured to reflect variations in quality. Given the level of

inputs, output may also depend on organizational and institutional factors —

i.e.   methods of organization, effectiveness of management, and the motivation

of workers. Within this simple framework, labor productivity, defined as the

ratio of output to labor input, depends on the capital—labor ratio, the scale

of operations and the various organizational factors.6

        Unionization may affect each of these determinants. The traditional

channel of influence links the union wage effect to capital—labor substitu-

tion.7 In response to a rise in the relative wage, the firm seeks to raise

the marginal product of labor by raising the capital—labor ratio. The net

effect, however, is an increase in unit costs and a misallocation of re—

sources.    A second channel of influence_recognizes that the rules   governing   -
                                  —3—
the employment relation under trade unions are likely to affect methods of

organization and other aspects of the internal operation of the firm.

     While the traditional union effect is inefficient, the direction of

the organization effect is unclear. If unionization puts pressure on management

to improve operations the production process may yield a larger volume

of output for any combination of capital and labor.8 The opposite conclusion

holds if unionization reduces motivation or otherwise impedes the effective

operation of the enterprise. Thus, both the sign and magnitude of the organ-

ization effect are open to empirical question and analysis. The organization

effects must be combined with the traditional substitution effects to assess

the overall union impact on efficiency.

      The link between unionization and the organizational determinants of

productivity depends on changes in the labor contract under unions and on

adjustments made by workers and management to new provisions. The dis-

tinction between changes in the rules of the employment relation, and the

resulting changes in behavior which link the contract to productivity has

often been overlooked in discussions of this issue. The existence of a

rule, on its face inimical to productivity, has been treated as prima facie

evidence of a negative organization effect.9 Yet few contract provisions

directly affect the determinants of productivity. Most operate indirectly

through changes in incentives whicI affect the decisions of workers and

managers.

      Rules, both formal and informal, are conunon to all work situations.1°

In a non—union setting management generally determines the formal rules

governing the terms and conditions of employment. Under trade—unions, the

introduction of a mechanism for collective voice affects both the substan-

tive rules governing the employment relation and the procedures for rule

making and dispute settlement. Union influence extends beyond mere codif i—

cation of existing rules. While workers may   affect   rules in a non—union
                                        —4—

setting through individual mobility, this channel is indirect and depends on

management's ability and willingness to make complex inferences relating con-

tract provisions to turnover.11 Collective bargaining establishes a more power-

ful, direct means of influence, and may provide a more effective channel of

information about worker preferences and potential trade—of fs implicit in

alternative contract provisions.

         By introducing new procedures and new channels of information, and by

altering the substantive rules of the workplace, unionization is likely to

lead to changes in the behavior of workers and managers. For workers, per-

haps the most significant change is a shift in relative power and increased

control over conditions of work. Freeman has argued that the existence of

collective voice under unions creates an alternative to "exit" behavior

(quitting, absenteeism) and, ceteris paribus, can be expected to, reduce

turnover, with clear consequences for productivity2 Firms with lower rates

of turnover are likely to have a higher level of investment in firm specific

training, and may have more effective work groups. A similar effect may

follow   from the use of seniority rules, which tend to be more prevalent in
union contracts. In those production processes where skills obtained on the

job areimportant, seniority rules may reduce rivalry among workers and in-

crease incentives for assistance and cooperation3 In addition, the arbi-

trariness inherent in rankings based on management's assessment of ability

(or other subjective criteria) may adversely affect workers' perception of

their jobs. introduction of seniority criteria may thus have positive

effects on motivation and morale.14

      For managers, the introduction of a trade union affects the viability

of previous methods and procedures. In the face of a rise in the price of

     The physical characteristics of the product have iraportant implications for

the structure of the industry and consequently for the analysis of productivity.

Finished cement has a low value—to—weight ratio and shipping costs are a

high proportion of the delivered price. The consequence of high shipping costs

is a regional market structure. In 1972, fewer than five percent of industry

shipments exceeded 300 miles, while close to 60 percent were less than 100 miles.19

While the regional nature of the industry creates conditions of apparent oligopoly,

historically the homogeneous nature of the product and the capital intensity

of production have led to intense price competition° Overt attempts to limit

competition through a basing point pricing system were declared illegal in

1947, and there is substantial evidence of moderately competitive pricing be-

havior in the 1960's and early 1970's.21

     The regional character of the cement product markets is reflected in the structure

of collective bargaining where single employer agreements with substantial

local negotiations are the rule. The dominant union in the industry is the

United Cement, Lime and Gypsum Workers International Union which represents

about 75 percent of all cement plants2 The UCLGWIU is relatively decentra-

lized, and local and regional officers play a significant role in shaping the

substance of negotiations. Slightly less than 9 percent of the plants in the

 industry are non—union, with the remainder divided among the Steelworkers,

 joint councils and independent unions. Taken together the regional nature of

markets and the decentralized character of the union suggest that the impact

 of the union may vary by region. The empirical analysis allows for regional

 union effects, with primary focus on the South and Southwest where most com-

 petition between union and non—union plants takes place.

The Data

      Since 1919 the Portland Cement Association has conducted an annual survey

of association members requesting information on the production of clinker,

finished cement, cement shipments, and manhours for each of the respondent firm's

establishments. This survey constitutes the basic source of data used in the

empirical analysis.23

      The survey provides annual data on tons of finished cement produced, which

is the output measure used here. The data on manhours is broken down by depart-

ment, permitting the construction of variables measuring production and super-

visory or non—production labor input. The supervisory category includes plant

management, supervisors, clerical staff and laboratory personnel.

The production category includes workers in the quarry, the raw grinding and

finishing departments, and the general labor group.

      Beginning in 1973 information is available on location, plant capacity,

fuel usage, and the installation date and "practical" capacity of individual

kilns. The location data permits construction of five regional categories —
                                                      "4
Northeast, North Central, South, Southwest and West Total capacity of the

plant determines grouping into size categories, which provide an alternative

to total manhours as a measure of scale effects. Data on kiln age and capa-

city have been used to construct a measure of the capital stock in the ith

plant in year t given by

                                                O<A< 1                    (1)
                            Kjt=XtJCjjt
where C. is the capacity of kilns of the jth vintage?5 The adjustment parameter

reflects the effects of depreciation, obsolescence and vintage, and is deter—

mined empirically by searching for the value which minimizes the error sum of

squares in the regression equation.
                                      —9—

      The data set is completed with information on union status. We initially

obtained a record of plants operating under a collective bargaining agreement

from the Cement Employers Association. Separate verification of union status

was obtained from the staff of the United Cement, Lime and Gypsum Workers Inter-

national Union. In one situation, the question of union status was answered

through direct contact with the plant in question.

      Table 1 presents a summary of the sources and definitions of the variables

used in the analysis, and compares the cement industry data set with a hypothet-

ical ideal. The ideal analysis would place establishments in the two sectors on

a comparable basis by controlling for differences in the amount and quality of

labor and capital, the parameters of the production function and returns to scale.

In general, the cement data set measures up quite well to this standard. The

existence of well known ASTM standards enables us to compare the output of dif-

ferent establishments in physical terms. Productivity and unionization can be

examined at the establishment level with controls for possible union/non—union

differences in technology. Reasonably good measures of the vintage of the plant

and the operating kilns are available, and we have two measures of establishment

size which should provide a reasonably good fix on returns to scale.

      The principle weakness in the data Is the absence of good measures of labor

quality. The regional controls capture structural differences in labor quality,

but fail to control for any substitution of higher for lower quality labor in-

duced by the union wage effect. However, the likely effect of quality adjustments

on productivity can be estimated from time series data on plants which change

union status. In a time series context, the labor quality effect not only

depends on technology and changes in compensation, but on the extent of

turnover as well. Together with an estimate of the union wage effect, information

on turnover can be used to determine the extent of bias induced by the omission

of quality measures.26

The Empirical Model

       The cement data set provides measures of output (Q) and three inputs:

capital (K), production worker hours CL) and the hours of supervisory personnel

(S). These data may be summarized, and the effect of unionization measured

using standard production function analysis. Output is assumed to depend on

the three inputs, and organization factors. Apart from organization effects,

labor productivity depends on the capital—labor ratio, the ratio of 8upervisory

to production worker hours, and the scale of operations. Productivity also may

differ between union and non—union establishments because of differences in the

parameters of the production function. To control for these possibilities, and

thus to identify union/non—union differences which stem from organization

factors we specify a Cobb—Douglas production function for each sector.27

       In intensive form, the two production processes may be written as:



and
             ln(Q/L)k =    ln(A)   +
                                       u"k    +Yuln(S/L)k +   (Ou_l)Lk            (2)




              ln(Q/L). =   ln(A)   +c ln(K/L) +Yln(S/L) + (O—l)lnL
                                                                                  (3)


where u and n indicate union and non-union respectively, k and j index establishments

 in the two sectors and returns to scale is given bye = c. +    iB   +   y,where is   labor's

 share. The parameter A captures the organizational determinants of productivity,

 and is assumed to be invariant across establishments within the sector.

        Equations (2) and (3) control for union/non—union differences in the pro-

 duction parameters, but within the tio sectors, technology and productivity may

 vary because of vintage and region effects. While the basic production process

 in cement is much the same today as it was in 1920, changes in technology have

 increased the extent of mechanization      and automation, increased the size and

 speed of machinery, and significantly altered plant layout and design. Since
                                     — 12 —


the vintage of the plant clearly affects the level of productivity, the appro-
priate union/non—union comparison is between plants of the same vintage.   Two

approaches to this problem are examined below. We first confine estimation of

(2) and (3) to plants with roughly the same vintage. This procedure not only

establishes the appropriate union/non—union comparison, but also allows the

entire production function to change with the vintage of the plant. A second

approach is to specify a common production function, but to allow the union

effect to differ by vintage through union—vintage interaction terms.

      Interaction terms may also be used to introduce regional union effects.

As we noted earlier, ceinnt is priced and sold in regional markets and the

pattern of collective bargaining has a distinctly regional character in which

local and regional union officers play key roles in determining the nature

of labor—management relations. For these reasons we introduce region dummies

and allow different union effects in different regions.

      If region effects were absent and the union and non—union sectors were tech—

nologically identical except for differences in organizational factors, the union

impact could be estimated using a simple dummy variable.   The organizational differ-

ences could be written as A
                          U
                            = Afl
                                (1 + b), and the coefficient on the union

dummy would provide an estimate of b, the productivity differential. In

equations (2) and (3), however, the input ratios have different effects on

productivity in the two sectors, so that the estimated union effect not only

may vary by region and vintage, but also may depend on parameter dilierences and

 the level of the input ratios at which the union/non—union comparison takes

 place. To see the implications of differences in technology, we make

 use of covariance analysis in which all parameters are allowed to vary between the

sectors. Ignoring problems of heteroscedasticity, the union and non—union parameters
                                        — 13 —


may be estimated jointly using interaction terms between the basic
                                                                   independent

variables and the union dummy.28 If we confine the analysis to plants of the

same vintage, the most general form of the model is given by:

      ln(Q/L)i =   lnA + bU + u -
               + 0u -
                                      an)/iu          —

                             )1nL1U +a ln(K/L)i +ylfl(S/L)i               (4)
               +        -
                   0n       l)lnL +     - n)kREGkU
               +En REG
                k nk k
where U takes a value of 1 if the plant is unionized and zero otherwise, and

REG indicates the region dummies. By specifying the model at this level of

generality we can assess the implications of constraining the region and pro-

duction parameters to be identical.

      The coefficients on the interaction terms provide estimates of the differ-

ence between union and non—union parameters, while the non—union parameters are

given by the coefficients on the regular independent variables. In this formu-

lation the union impact depends on region, the extent of differences in tech-

nology and the particular value of the independent variables chosen for com-

parison. The union productivity effect in the kth region is given by:

     [lfl(Q/L) b + u )ln(K/L). +           u 'mn)1i
                                                 -
                                                                          (5)

                                        nk
Equation (5) makes clear that if production parameter differences are large,

and we ignore them in estimating             a substantial bias may be introduced.

In addition, the choice of comparison values of the input ratios may be of some

consequence. In the work which follows mean values will be used in calculations

of the productivity effect.

Section III: The Empirical Results
    This section summarizes the cement industry data and presents estimates of

several variants of the basic model developed in Section 11. The means and

standard deviations of the variables used in the empirical analysis are pre-

sented in Table 2. The data cover the period 1973 — 76 and include 29 non-

union observations (9 plants) and 436 observations (119 plants) in the union sector

Each plant—year has been treated as a separate observation.29

     Turning first to data from the complete sample (columns 2 and 3),

evidence on average productivity (line 1) in Table 2 reveals that non-

union establishments are 18 percent more productive than establishments

which are unionized. Part of the reason for the difference is evident in

the higher non—union capital—labor ratio (22 percent) in line 2, and the

higher rate of capacity utilization in line 3. The non—union sector also

has a higher supervisor ratio, but the difference is quite small. Similarly

small differences in size are found in line 5, with plants n the union

sector about two percent larger.


     The importance of controlling for vintage in comparing union and non-

union establishments is evident in line 6, which contains data on average

kiln age. Unionized establishments are significantly older than the plants

in the non—union sector. The difference primarily reflects the almost com-

plete organization of the industry by 1950, and the entry of new plants in

the 1960's which have remained non—union. The average kiln age actually

understates differences in the vintage of the capital stock. It is common

practice in the industry to install new kilns in old plants. Thus two plants

of the same kiln age may have very different grinding and crushing equipment,

very different plant designs and manning requirements. The problem is

especially acute in the case of union/non—union comparisons, since most non-

union plants have been constructed since the late 1950's. To more fully

correct   for differences in the vintage of the plant, we have calculated means

and standard deviations for plants built since 1957. The results are presented

in columns 4 and 5.

     The contrast between union/non—union comparisons based on the total sample

and those based on the new plants is instructive. Among new plants, unionized

establishments are more productive by 3.6 percent. As in the previous com-

parison, however, non—union establishments have a higher capital—labor ratio,

and operate at higher rates of utilization. The data for newly constructed

plants are thus not inconsistent with the existence of a positive union pro-

ductivity effect. Union establishments are more productive in spite of oper-

ating at lower rates of utilization, and with a lower capital—labor ratio. In

addition line 6 reveals that even among plants built since 1958, non—union

establishments are significantly newer. Taken together these patterns suggest

the plausibility of a positive union effect.


Estimates of the Basic Model

     The basic model to be estimated has been laid out in equation (4 ).     Sev-

eral variants of the model are examined in this section, beginning in Table 3

with a version in which all parameters except the intercept are constrained to

be identical in the union and non—union sectors. The estimated union effects

 are average effects across regions under the assumption of a common technology.

 The equality constraints on the region effects and on the parameters of the

 production process will be examined subsequently. The ana-

 lysis in Table 3 does allow for vintage effects, first by estimating the model

 for the plants built since 1957, and second by using the complete sample and

 distinguishing between old and new union and non—union establishments. Finer

 vintage distinctions are not possible given the number of non—union observa—

tions.   Furthermore, since most plants in the industry were unionized by 1950,

the data set contains little information about the union differential among

older plants.

     The results with the new plant sample in line 1 appear to provide a

reasonable description of the cement production process among newer plants.3°

The size of the coefficient on the capital—labor ratio is consistent with

the capital intensive nature of cement production, and with evidence from

the Census of Manufacturers?1 Other production function parameters are

similarly consistent. We find that a 10 percent increase in the supervisor—

worker ratio will increase productivity by 1 percent. In addition there is

no evidence of a clear relationship between productivity and the scale of

operations. The coefficient on total production manhours per establishment

in line lb is quite small, with a large standard error, suggesting that the

sum of the output elasticities is not significantly different from one.

Moreover, the size dummies referred to in line lc show no consistent pattern.

That does not imply, however, that productivity does not differ signifi-

cantly between establishments of different size. Empirically, the size

dummies provide a significant increase in explanatory power, even though

the relationship between size and productivity is not monotonic.

     The evidence on the union effect in line 1 supports the view that union-

ization in the newer plants increases productivity. A positive union effect

is found in all specifications. In line la, which assumes constant returns,

we estimate that unionization raises productivity by 7 percent. The addition

of total production manhours in lb has little effect on the estimated union

effect. However, the union impact is significantly larger when size dummies

are used to capture scale effects. With size dummies present, we estimate a

union effect of 10 percent.32

      In   lines 2a — 2c the model is estimatedwith union effects by
                                                                     vintage using
 the complete sample. The results indicate that the older union and non—union

plants are both less productive than the newer plants, and not significantly dif-

ferent from one another. The difference between the coefficients in line 2a,

for example, is —    .038(.070).   The size of the coefficient and its standard error

is not surprising given the small number of non—union observations.       The addition

of information from the complete sample does not affect the positive union effect

among the newer plants. Under each specification, the estimated coefficient for

new union plants is virtually identical to the estimates in line 1.       !Iowever,

when the new and old plants are forced to have the same union coefficient in

lines 3a — 3b, the averaging process yields an insignificant negative coeffi-

cient and obscures the vintage effects.

 Union Effects by Region and Differences in Technology

      The estimates of the basic model in table 3 assume no regional dif-

 ferences in the union effect and identical
                                                 production parameters in the
union and non—union sectors. These assumptions are examined in table 4

by introducing region interaction terms (line 1) and by estimating the         full
unconstrained model with separate coefficients for the union and non—union

establishments (line 2). The estimates of the union effect by region in

line 1 are based on the new plant sample and cover the South and Southwest

since these are the only regions in which new union and non—union

plants co—exist.33 The evidence clearly suggests a substantial difference

between the two regions, with the effect in the Southwest much larger.

The union effect in the South is negative in two of the specifications,

although the coefficient is small, and about one—fifth the size of

its standard error. The imprecision in the estimates reflects the few

number of flOfl—uflio   observations   (4) in the South. More information is
available   in the Southwest, which contain many of the non—union I [rms in
the industry. The regional pattern evident in table 4       is conststcni with
one interpretation of the relative prevalence of non—union firms in the

      The effect of relaxing the technology constraint is examined in line 2

 where estimates of the union effect from the full unconstrained model are

 presented (see equation (5)). The estimates are based on the new plant

 sample with the addition of older non—union plants. The use of all available

 non—union plants is designed to improve the precision of estimates in the

 non—union sector. While the use of older non—union plants may bias the

 union effect, our primary interest is not in specific estimates, but in

 the change in the union effect when the technology constraint is

 relaxed. Thus, the estimates in line 2 are to be viewed as no more than

 illustrative of the impact of specification changes.

     In order to provide a basis of comparison, line 2a contains estimates

of the model without region or technology effects. The assumption of

constant returns has been imposed and is maintained when the region and

technology constraints are relaxed. It is clear from comparison with the

results in line la of table 3 that the use of older non—union plants has only

minor effects. The production function parameters are very similar, and

the union effect of 8 percent is only marginally higher. It appears that

the larger sample conveys much of the same information as obtained when

the older non—union plants are excluded. A greater measure of divergence

Ia evident in line 2b where estimates are presented with the regional

constraints relaxed. The production parameters are similar to those

found in line 1, but the union effect shows greater variation across

regions. The most striking change is found in the South, where the union

effect is much more negative. The effect In the Southwest is quite close

to the sample average, while the North Central estimate Is large and

positive. As with the earlier results, the union effect in the South

is based on relatively few observations and there appears to be a good

deal of divergence in productivIty among the non—union plants within that
                                 — 22 —


region.   The result is a large standard error on the Southern effect, so

that when the three regions are averaged, the effects in the North Central

and Southwest dominate.

     In line 2c we present estimates of the model without constraining

the productionparameters in the union and non—union sectors to be identical.

The results provide evidence of no significant differences in technology

between the two sectors. Although the union sector emerges with a lower

capital coefficient, and a higher coefficient on the supervisor—worker

ratio the interaction terms have large standard errors?4 The union

effect by region has been calculated using equation (5) and mean values

of (K/L) and (S/L) in each region. The results suggest that

technology differences explain little of the union/non—union

productivity differential. The estimated union effects in line 2c are

very close to the effects estimated with the technology constraint imposed.

The evidence thus suggests that constraining the production functions to be

identical in the union and non—union sectors does not obscure important

technological distinctions, and does not affect inferences about the union effect.

Section IV: Firm Effects and Quality Adjustments

      The empirical analysis in section III found unionized establishments

to be more productive than their non—union counterparts. The evidence suggests

that unionization leads to productive changes in the operation of the enterprise.

This conclusion, however, rests on two assumptions. First, the union coefficient

only can be identified as a measure of the productivity effect of unionization

if we assume the absence of individual firm effects, or that any effects specific

to the enterprise are independent of union status and other determinants.

Second, it is necessary to assume that quality adjustments are non—existent or

small. The statistical design in section III failed to control for union

induced changes in worker quality. The union coefficient, therefore, may

capture more than organization effects.
                                        — 23   —




      These issues have been examined at lehgth in Clark (1979)

and will be addressed only briefly here. To estimate the impact of

the union holding constant firm specific effects, we make use of

data on productivity in six establishments before and after unionization.

Information on turnover in each establishment sheds light on the extent of

quality differences after the union is introduced, and permits a rough

calculation of the bias caused by omission of quality measures.

Productivity Before and After Unionization

      Empirical analysis of productivity using time series data on a given

establishment requires modifications to the basic model developed in section III.

Since the focus is on a change in union status in a specific establishment,

controls for region and vintage may be omitted. However, changes in methods

of organization and management which improve productivity are likely to occur

over time and should be controlled for in estimating the union effect.35

Assuming that disembodied technological change in the ith firm is of the

sample exponential form, the basic model may be rewritten as:

             ln(Q/L) =   in A0 + 5t       it +
                                      + bU.        cx
                                                              it
                                                        in(K/L). + y ln(S/L).
                                                                            it (6)
                               + (S    — 1)
                                            inL. +

where 5   is the rate of technological change, v is the error term and all other

variables are defined as before.

      As specified in (6), the parameters of the production process are assumed to

be identical in each firm, but productivity may vary across establishments

because of differences in organizational factors. It is common in production

function analysis, for example, to attribute part of any unexplained variation

in output to firm specific differences in managerial ability.36 If specific

differences in organizational factors exist, ignoring them may lead to biased

estimates of production parameters, including the union productivity effect.

Firm specific effects may be held constant by assuming that the error term has

the following "fixed effects" structure:

Under this specification, consistent estimates can be obtained by introducinc

individual establishment intercepts.

      Time series data from the PCA survey has been developed for six cement

plants which were unionized in the 1953—1976 period. Since several of the

establishments were constructed after 1953, we do not have data on each plant

in each year of the period. There is an average of 17 years of data per

establishment.36 Table 5 presents a summary of the estimated union coefficient

under alternative specifications. The sign of the union effect is invariably

positive, while the exact order of magnitude and precision of the estimate

depends on model specification. The evidence supports the conclusion, however,

that unionization leads to gains in productivity within an establishment, with

the size of the effect ranging from 8—10 percent.           These results are not

sensitive to adjustments in the model to allow for variation in capacity

utilization or other omitted variables.37

Quality Adjustments

      Both the cross section and the before/after analyses suggest that

unionization leads to productive changes in the operation of the enterprise.

Yet neither control for possible changes in labor quality. If unionization

induces firms to acquire workers of higher quality, the estimated               effect

may reflect quality differences as well as changes in organization. While

sufficient data is not available to address tile extent of union/non—union

differences in quality, it is possible to place an upperbound on the potential

bias due to omission of quality measures in the before/after analysis.

           The change in productivity which follows from union induced changes

in labor quality depends on technology and the union wage effect. If unioniza-

tion raises the wage, the firm will attempt to reduce costs by substituting

higher for lower qualilworkers. But a distinction must be made between

changing the quality of the workforce and changing workforce productivity.

While it is clear that productivity and quality are related positively,

the magnitude of productivity change resulting from a change in quality

depends on the technology of production. Without precise specification of

the way in which workers of different quality interact with each other and

with other factors of production few conclusions can be drawn about the extent

to which the firm can recover the incremental cost of an exogenous wage

increase by hiring workers of higher quality. It is possible, however, to

place an upper bound on the change in productivity. In order for the firm to

achieve a stable equilibrium, a given change in quality must lead to a more

rapid increase in the wage than in productivity.38 This condition is intuitively

reasonable, since if it were not true, the firm could lower unit costs by

raising the wage. The implication is that the effect of quality adjustments

on productivity is bounded by the union wage effect.

      The stability condition can be used to gauge the effect of omitting

quality adjustments in the before/after analysis. Assume that unionization

raises the wage by c percent. Because of contract rules and associated legal

problems the firm is not likely to adopt the optimal overall level of worker

quality immediately. Until the workforce has turned over completely, the

firm will have old and new workers and the new workers will be of higher

quality. The stability conditLon implies that the efficiency advantage of

new workers will be less than   percent. If we assume that unionization does

not change the basic technology of production, the effect of unionization on

productivity can be written as: b + hD3, where b is the organization effect as
                                   — 27 —


before,   h is the efficiency advantage of new workers, D is the proportion of new

workers in the workforce and 3 is the elasticity of output with respect to

changes in production labor input.39 The empirical analysis summarized in

table 5 implicitly assumed hDI3=0 so that the union coefficient could be

identified as the organization effect. A more realistic upper bound on the

quality effect can be estimated from available information on labor's share,

the union wage effect, and turnover in the six plants.

      Based on the estimation results in table 3, a likely value for 13 is

0.45. Evidence in Clark (1978) suggests that the union wage effect lies in

the range from 12—18 percent. This, estimate is based on data on the entry wage,

with adjustments for fringe benefits, and changes in job classifications. Since

the efficiency advantage of new workers is less than the wage effect, we shall

use values of 11 and 16 percent for h in the calculations which follow. As

part of a general case study of the effects of unionization in the six

before/after plants, information has been obtained on the percentage of the 1976

workforce who were employed at the time the plant was organized (see Clark

(1979) for details of the case studies). The average value of D in 1976 was

0.34, with estimates ranging from .05 to .65. This overstates the proportion

of new workers relevant for present purposes, since D should be measured by

an average value over the sample period. If the rate of growth of D was

constant throughout the union era, then the estimated value at the midpoint

of the period would be appropriate. Both midpoint and endpoint values will

be used in calculations below.

      Table 6 summarizes the assumed values of (3, h and D arid presents

alternative calculations of the effect of quality on productivity. These

calculations support the conclusion that changes in quality are likely to have

had a small effect on productivity. Under the most generous assumptions,

quality improvements raise productivity by a litt over two percent. Under

more realistic assumptions about turnover, the effect is close to

Given that these calculations provide upper bounds, the evidence suggests

that omission of quality measures introduces at most a small bias into

estimates of the union effect in the before/after analysis.    Correcting for

changes in quality leaves the basic findings intact.

Section V: Conclusion

      The empirical evidence suggests that unionization increases the

productivity of otherwise comparable establishments. This finding emerges

in both cross section and time series data and is relatively robust with

respect to model specification. Controls for capital—labor substitution,

economies of scale, individual firm effects, technology differences and changes

in labor quality have been introduced with only moderate effects on the

magnitude of the union differential. Since the traditional channels of union

influence have been held constant, we interpret the finding as a measure of

the effect of unionization which works through changes in the internal operation

of the firm.


      The finding of a positive union effect in a particular situation does

 not warrant the conclusion that unionization
                                                raisesproductivity everywhere,
 lways. Indeed, evidence from the coal industry suggests that the

 deterioration of industrial relations in that industry in the l970's

 led to a significant decline in productivity in unionized establishments.40

 It is evident that the union effect in
                                          a particular setting will vary with
 the character of industrial relations. As
                                              Marshall argued long ago,
 the effect of unionization on
                                 productivity depends on union policy as well

 as management adjustment. Research reported here and elsewhere has uncovered

positive union effects, but remains incomplete. The task ahead is to

 identify the actual channels of union influence and
                                                       those practices and
procedures which yield gains in productivity.

23. The survey covers about 80 percent of the establishments in the
     industry. While the composition of the sample varies slightly from
     year to year, there appears to be no systematic variation in partici-
     pation by region, union status, size or productivity.

24. The regions were defined as fo]lows: North East — Maine, New Hampshire,

25. It is important to note that the assumption that all capital is
     proportional to kiln capacity could result in a biased estimate
     of the union effect. If, for example, unionization raises the
     wage—rental ratio, firms will have incentive to substitute capital
     for labor. In the case where some part of the capital stock is not
     proportional to kiln capacity, our measure of the capital—labor
     ratio will understate the true ratio in union establishments, and
     so lead to an upward bias in the union coefficient. It is our
     view that this bias is quite small. Given the nature of the
     production process, the fraction of the capital stock not proportional
     to the size of the kiln is likely to be relatively small. If, for
     example, we set this fraction as high as 0.20, and assume a union
     wage effect of 15 percent, then with an elasticity of substitution
     equal to one, and a capital share of 0.4, the bias amounts to a little
     over one percentage point.

26.   Brown and Hedoff found that measured labor quality explained very little of
      the variation in productivity in aggregate, data. In research iii
      progress Chamberlain has used the Brown—Medoff data to estimate the union
      productivity effect with a model in which both observed and unobserved
      components of labor quality were introduced. He found that accounting
      forunobserved quality differences had little impact!on the union
      productivity effect.

27. The Cobb—Douglas form is restrictive, but useful for its simplicity.
     Other functional forms leave basic conclusions unchanged. Using a
     CES specification, for example, we obtain a union effect of .093 (.050)
     in the Southwest region, and an effect of .015 (.100) in the
     South. These results should be compared with those in line 1 of
      table 4.

28. The formulation in (4) assumes that the standard deviations of the
     error terms in the union and non—union equations are identical.
     Re—running the equations separately results in standard errors of
     estimate not significantly different from one another, and con-
     sequently little change in the standard errors. of the coefficients.

29. The treatment of each plant year as a separate observation ignores
     the time series —cross section nature of the data. The most serious
     problem with the procedure is the failure to take into account
     firm specific effects which may lead to understatement of the standard
     errors a well as bias in the union effect. Because union
     status changes In only one establishment in the 1973—76 period
     it is not possible to identify both the effect of unionization
     and individual firm effects. We have assumed that the average
     firm effect in the union and non—union sector is identical, so that
     firm effects net Out in any union/non—union comparison. We have
     examined the impact of entering a time trend in the analysis, and
     allowing for a time—varying Intercept through year dummies. Neither
     of these adjustments affects the results. With year dummies, for
     example, the average union effect is .068 (.043) compared to .064 (.045)
     with a trend term, and .070 (.046) in the results'reported
     in table 3.

30. Since gross output has been used to calculate productivity in table 3,
     the results rest on an assumed; proportionality between materials
     (including energy) and gross output. The assumption is likely to
     be reasonably accurate for raw material, but there Is evidence
     that the ratio of energy to output has changed quite substantially
     over the last 10 years. Even if energy use and unionization are
     uncorrelated, omission of energy may bias the results. As long as
     energy (or more accurately the ratio of energy to other inputs)
     is correlated with included variables which are in turn correlated
     with unionization, the union coefficient will be biased. The sign
     and extent of the bias will depend crucially on the relationship
     between the union dummy and the capital—labor ratio.

     For example, a regression of :ln (K/L) on U using the new plant
     sample and other control variables from line la, yields a
     coefficient of —.067 (.080). Assuming that the relationship
     between energy and capital is positive, as seems likely, the result
     implies that the omission of energy actually Induces a dowTiward bias
     in the union effect. In any case, given the magnitude of the
     coefficient, the extent of the bias is likely to he quite small.
     Similar conclusions apply to the question of bias induced by
     measurement error in the capital stock.

31. Calculation of the ratio of the wage bill    to value added yields
     a value of 0.30, which implies a capital    share of 0.7. Since
     (value added—wage bill) contains elements   which are not payments
     to capital, this calculation considerably   overstates capital's
     share.

32. The magnitude of the union impact in table 3 is roughly comparable
     to the estimated change in unit costs arising from the union wage
     effect. Using data on the entry wage in union and non—union
     establishments, Clark (1978) finds that rates in unionized
     establishments are about 12—18 percent higher than in comparable
     non—union establishments. This translates into an effect on cement
     costs of about 5—8 percent. With a productivity effect of 7 percent
     the evidence suggests that unionization has no effect on unit costs.

33. To preserve degrees of freedom, the West and Southwest have been
     grouped together in table 3 and table 4. In separate runs, these
     regions had almost identical coefficients; combining the two regions
     has no effect on the results.

34. The coefficients on the ineraction terms are: —.098 (.108) on the
     capital—labor ratio, and .055 (.111) on the supervisor—worker ratio.

35. In principle, variation in the utilization of the capital stock should
     also be included. In practice, controlling for utilization rates has
     only moderate effects on the estimated union coefficient. For example,
     under constant returns to scale, introduction of the utilization rate
     yields a union coefficient of 0.l00(.040); when corrected for atuo
     correlation, the result is .064(.040).

36. There is an average of 8.7 years of data following unionization.

37. It might be argued that abrupt changes in the firm's environment, which raise
     productivity, may be correlated with unionization. Using data
     on plants which do not change union status Clark (1979) finds that
     omitted variable bias of this sort is not important. Controlling for
     variation in productivity in other plants, the union effect is .092(.046)
     under non—constant returns, and .069(.043) under constant returns.

38.   This result holds in a model in which quality augments the efficiency
      of labor and in which the wage is an increasing function of quality.
      See Clark (1979).

39. After unionization the production process is Q AK1(L + (l4h)
     where o and n indicate old and new respectively. We not that
     A = A (i+b), L = L + L and D =(L/L). Pooling union and
     non uion observatigns w have in (Q/L) = in A0 + [b + hE3]U + (i-) in (K/L),
     where U is the union dummy.

40. These results are based on work in progress by Margaret Connerton,
     Richard Freeman and James Medoff.
