                                              ABSTRACT

Hospitals are currently under pressure to control the cost of medical care, while at the same time improving
patient health outcomes. These twin concerns are at play in an important and contentious decision
facing hospitals—choosing appropriate nurse staffing levels. Intuitively, one would expect nurse staffing
ratios to be positively associated with patient outcomes. If so, this should be a key consideration in
determining nurse staffing levels. A number of recent studies have examined this issue, however,
there is concern about whether a causal relationship has been established. In this paper we exploit
an arguably exogenous shock to nurse staffing levels. We look at the impact of California Assembly
Bill 394, which mandated minimum levels of patients per nurse in the hospital setting. When the law
was passed, some hospitals already had acceptable staffing levels, while others had nurse staffing ratios
that did not meet mandated standards. Thus changes in hospital-level staffing ratios from the pre-
to post-mandate periods are driven in part by the legislation. We find persuasive evidence that AB394
did have the intended effect of decreasing patient/nurse ratios in hospitals that previously did not meet
mandated standards. However, our analysis suggests that patient outcomes did not disproportionately
improve in these same hospitals. That is, we find no evidence of a causal impact of the law on patient
safety.

1. Introduction

         Hospitals are currently under pressure to control the cost of medical care, while at the same time

improving patient health outcomes, especially though the reduction of medical error (Kohn, Corrigan, and

Donaldson, 1999). These twin concerns are at play in an important and contentious decision facing

hospitals—choosing appropriate nurse staffing levels.

         Intuitively, one would expect that relatively high nurse staffing ratios to be associated with

improved patient outcomes, and if this intuition is correct, these patient benefits should be a key

consideration in the determination of nurse staffing levels. Ideally, hospitals’ decisions about nurse

staffing should be guided by clear empirical evidence on this matter, and indeed a number of recent

studies have examined this issue. The best known of these papers are the seminal contributions of Aiken,

et al. (2002) and Needleman, et al. (2002). Using data from 168 hospitals in Pennsylvania covering a 20-

month span Aiken, et al. (2002) demonstrate that cross-sectional variation in nurse staffing levels is

negatively correlated with patient mortality, measured as risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and failure to

rescue rates.1 The Needleman, et al. (2002) analysis of administrative data from 799 hospitals in 11 states

over a one-year span also found higher levels of nurse staffing to be associated with lower failure to

rescue rates, and they also reported improved patient outcomes along a variety of other specific

dimensions, e.g., rates of urinary tract infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, and shock or

cardiac arrest.2

         The regression analyses of Aiken, et al. (2002) and Needleman, et al. (2002), provide important

evidence about cross-sectional correlations, but concerns remain about causal relationships. In this

regard, there are two important potential problems.

         The first issue is a particular form of omitted variable bias. There exists considerable variation

across hospitals in the level of resources devoted to patient care. This variation exists in nurse staffing

practices, of course, but also along many other dimensions—the quantity and quality of medical

1
  Failure to rescue indicates patients who have died after developing a complication while in the hospital—patients
who, under normal circumstances of care, might have been “rescued” from the complication.

equipment, the adoption of educational efforts to keep medical staff current on best practices, the efficacy

of management practices, etc. (e.g., McClellan and Staiger, 2000; Bloom et al., 2009; Propper and Van

Reenen, 2010). In cross-sectional regression analyses, attempts are made to control for such factors, but

researchers typically have an extremely limited set of covariates to work with. If, as one might suspect,

hospitals that have relatively high nurse staffing levels also have above-average levels of other

(unobserved) factors that affect patient care, cross-sectional regression analysis will tend to overstate the

impact of a high nurse/patient ratio on patient health outcomes.

        The second problem has to do with endogenous sorting. In general we would expect that medical

providers will devote relatively high resources to patients for whom these resources are likely to have the

highest impact—often to those patients who are at greatest risk of adverse outcomes. For example, we

expect high mortality rates on medical units with high nurse/patient ratios. Again, a researcher can

attempt to control for the severity of patients’ medical conditions, but this is difficult to do with available

data. In this case, researchers will tend to underestimate the beneficial impact of high nurse-to-patient

ratios on patient outcomes.

        Similar concerns pertain to evaluations based on hospital-level panel data (e.g., Sochalski, et al.,

2008). Thus, hospitals that experience improved nurse staffing levels might well be increasing resources

along other (unobserved) dimensions. Conversely, hospitals that increase their nurse staffing levels might

well be doing so in response to increases in general acuity levels of their patients.

        A sensible response to these concerns is for the researcher to search for exogenous shifts to nurse

staffing, and then use that variation to explore the impact on patient outcomes. Although truly exogenous

variation (e.g., randomized assignment) is unavailable for this purpose, there are some attempts to find

“natural experiments” for generating plausibly exogenous changes in nurse-per-patient ratios. A good

example of this approach is the innovative work of Evans and Kim (2006). Their identification strategy is

to exploit natural variation that occurs in hospital admissions, which in turn create variation in patient

loads. Using this approach, Evans and Kim find that patients admitted when the patient loads are high
                                                       2
tend to have higher mortality, but effects are estimated to be quite small and are not statistically

significant in several of their specifications. As the authors acknowledge, interpretation is difficult

because they “have no independent data about how hospitals deal with a sudden influx of patients.” Thus,

if hospitals respond by offering overtime shifts to nurses, in fact the nurse-to-patient ratios might not be

changing much when there is a surge in hospital admissions. This could lead the authors to underestimate

the impact of patient loads on patient outcomes.3

           Our paper contributes by providing a new analysis that exploits an arguably exogenous shock to

nurse staffing levels for the purpose of studying the relationship between nurse staffing levels and patient

outcomes. Specifically, we look at the impact of California Assembly Bill 394, which mandated

maximum levels of patients per nurse in the hospital setting. When the law was passed, some hospitals

already had acceptable staffing levels, while others had nurse staffing ratios that did not meet mandated

standards. Thus changes in hospital-level staffing ratios from the pre- to post-mandate periods are driven

in part by the legislation. Our goal is to look at the impact on key patient health outcomes.



2. California Assembly Bill 394

           In 1999 the California legislature passed AB394, which started a process whereby maximum

patient-to-nurse ratios were set for the State’s hospitals. After the Bill initially passed, the California

Department of Health Services (DHS) spent two years holding hearings in which stakeholders were

invited to make recommendations regarding the appropriate nurse staffing levels. In response to the

invitation, the top two nurse unions, the California Nurses Association and the Service Employees

International Union, along with the California Healthcare Association (an organization representing many

of California’s hospitals), proposed ratios that they considered appropriate (Spetz, 2004). In addition, the

DHS presented their own draft nurse staffing ratios (in January of 2002). In mid-2002, the DHS



3
    See also Dobkin (2003) and Bartel, et al. (2009) for studies which employ similar identification strategies.
                                                             3
announced the final standards, which were initially to be implemented in July 2003. This proposed

mandate was finally implemented on January 1, 2004.4

         The hope, of course, was that increased levels of nurse staffing would be beneficial to patient

outcomes. But from the outset nursing unions noted two major concerns about the legislation that could

undermine that goal. The first issue was enforcement. Under the current guidelines, the DHS is only

permitted to require an “action plan” created by the hospital, which would address any violations that

occur in the hospital, and how these deficiencies will be rectified, but assesses no fine or set period in

which the plan must be implemented (Spetz, 2004). Below we present evidence that in fact patient-to-

nurse ratios did decline in hospitals that did not meet standards prior to the legislation implementation.5

The second concern was that in the process of complying with the patient-to-nurse ratio requirements,

hospitals might reduce employment of non-nursing personnel, and ask nurses to perform tasks previously

undertaken by these employees (Coffman, Seago, and Spetz, 2002; Clarke, 2003; and Spetz, 2004). Such

actions would presumably reduce the effectiveness of the legislation in promoting improved patient

outcomes. While we cannot directly analyze this issue directly, we do of course look at the key issue—

the impact on patient outcomes. First we describe our data.

  The ratios are implemented for the following hospital units in general acute care, acute psychiatric, and specialty
hospitals: critical care unit, burn unit, labor and delivery unit, post-anesthesia service area, emergency department,
operating room, pediatric unit, step-down/intermediate care unit, specialty care unit, telemetry unit, general medical
care unit, sub-acute care unit, and transitional inpatient care unit.

  See also Spetz, et al. (2009) and Matsudaira (2009), who likewise show that nurse staffing increased as a
consequence of the regulations.

3. Data and Descriptives



    A. Data Sources and Key Variables

        This study utilizes data from California’s Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development

(OSHPD) financial reports and patient discharge database for nonfederal hospitals for the years 2000

through 2006. The annual hospital financial reports contain information on financial status, service mix,

staffing levels, patient loads, and cost allocations. The administrative patient discharge data provide

information on each patient discharged, including patient characteristics, the patient’s medical condition,

the condition severity, and any procedures performed on the patient before discharge. As we have

mentioned, AB394 was implemented in January 2004, but was under discussion for two years prior to

implementation. Thus, we treat the years 2000-2002 as the “pre-implementation” period. We use 2005-

2006 as the “post-implementation” period, which allows for a one-year period for hospital adjustment to

the regulation.

        The use of administrative discharge data is quite common in the study of patient outcomes.

These publicly available data include all non-federal California hospitals, and they include all the

necessary variables (age, sex, DRGs, MDCs, etc.) to obtain risk-adjusted rates for the patient safety

indicators that we will be analyzing in this study.6 These data do, however, likely have measurement

error (due to self-report information), and we should note that the staffing hours do not differentiate

between patient-care hours and those hours spent employed in such non-patient work as administration,

teaching, attending educational functions, etc. (a point noted also by Dobkin, 2003).

        Our focus is general medical/surgical hospital units, which represent roughly half of all inpatient

discharges in non-federal California hospitals. General medical/surgical units treat patients with medical

and/or surgical conditions who do not require an intensive care setting. We concentrate on these units as


6
 We use Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) software to create the patient safety indicators, as
discussed below. See http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/psi_overview.htm.
                                                       5
the OSHPD data only provide the necessary nurse labor information for such units.7 One difficulty

concerning OSHPD patient discharge data is that there are no identifiers for the unit where a patient was

treated. To create such units from the available OSHPD data, we use a methodology created by the

Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy (Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy, 2001)

whereby an RN expert panel is used to assign DRGs (diagnosis related groups) to one of seven hospital-

level units (intensive care unit, burn care, definitive observation, medical/surgical, pediatrics,

psychiatrics, and obstetrics). Appendix A provides a discussion.

         The first key variable is an approximation useful for examining the nurse staffing level. The

OSHPD Annual Hospital Financial Data provide information sufficient for this purpose. In particular,

OSHPD requests that hospitals report unit-level productive hours worked for RNs, LVNs, and

aides/orderlies. Productive hours worked are total hours worked by each staffing level, excluding

vacation, leave, etc. OSHPD also provides unit-level information on patient census days (total days

patients spend in the unit). Thus, to obtain ratios, we first must calculate productive hours per patient day

(PHPD), as the ratio of “productive hours worked” to “patient census days.”8 For the purpose of this

study, productive hours worked include hours for both registered nurses (RNs) and licensed vocational

nurses (LVNs). Then, to obtain an approximation of nurse-to-patient staffing ratios, we divide PHPD by

24.9 For the analysis below we use the reciprocal of this measure—the patient-to-nurse ratio—as the key

nurse staffing variable.10




7
  We considered analyzing two additional types of hospital units, critical care and step-down/telemetry. However,
critical care units already had strict patient-to-nurse requirements and were thus unaffected by this legislation. We
did not have sufficient observations to evaluate patient health outcomes in step-down/telemetry units.
8
  We remove hospital units with missing information on productive hours worked and/or patient census days. We
also removed 5 hospital units that had implausible PHPD outlier values, as depicted on page II-7 in Kravitz and
Sauve (2002). (This happened when a hospital unit had a PHPD value above 24, as it is not possible to work more
than 24 hours per day.)
9
  This calculation implicitly assumes that the average patient day is 24 hours—an assumption that is generally not
correct. In this respect our patient-to-nurse ratio can be thought of as an upper bound.
10
   Analyses based on the nurse-to-patient ratio values yield qualitatively similar results.
                                                          6
         Our study uses two patient safety indicators (PSIs) created by the Agency for Healthcare

Research and Quality (AHRQ) to measure adverse health outcomes in the patient hospital population,

both of which are potentially affected by nurse staffing—estimated rates of “failure to rescue” and

“decubitus ulcers.”11

         Failure to rescue indicates patients who have died after developing a complication while in the

hospital—patients who, under normal circumstances of care, might have been “rescued” from the

complication. There are six complications associated with this indicator: pneumonia, deep vein

thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute renal failure, shock/cardiac arrest, and gastrointestinal

hemorrhage/acute ulcer. Medical personnel in high-quality hospitals are expected to identify these

complications promptly and treat them aggressively. AHRQ has designated this outcome as potentially

sensitive to changes in nurse staffing (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2003). As we discuss

above, in both Aiken, et al. (2002) and Needleman, et al. (2002) high patient-to-nurse ratios are

associated with relatively higher rates of failure to rescue.

         Decubitus ulcers are bedsores which develop when there is a failure to frequently move an

immobile patient. Knowledge of decubitus ulcer formation and prevention is a topic that is carefully

covered in nursing school curriculum (Rosdahl and Kowalski, 2007). Several cross-sectional studies

indicate that high patient-to-nurse ratios are associated with relatively higher rates of decubitus ulcers.

Examples include Lichtig, et al. (1999), Unruh (2003), Stone, et al. (2007), and Spetz, et al. (2009).12



     B. Descriptive Statistics

         Tables 1 through 3 show mean levels for key variables—the patient-to-nurse ratio (PNR), the

failure to rescue rate (FTR) and rate of decubitus ulcers (DU)—for each year in the study period. In


11
  See Appendix B for more details.
12
  However, Needleman, et al. (2001) and Donaldson (2005) find no evidence of this relationship, and Cho, et al.
(2003) actually discover a somewhat higher probability of bedsores with the rise in nurse staffing. Below we
discuss difficulties in interpreting the relationship between the patient-to-nurse ratio and the rate of decubitus ulcers.
                                                            7
presenting these means, we categorize units by the units’ average PNR as calculated over the 2000-2002

period. AB394, as implemented in 2004, requires the PNR to be 5 or lower on medical/surgical

units. We divide our sample into four groups: two groups of hospitals not compliant with the regulation

(hospitals with PNR > 6, and 6 ≥ PNR > 5) and two groups of hospitals with PNRs that conform to the

regulation (those with 5 ≥ PNR > 4, and those for which 4 ≥ PNR). Using these four groups allow us to

distinguish between hospitals that are closer to the boundary of the regulation versus those that are well

above or well below the required ratio.

        Consider Table 1. The first three columns show that there was considerable variation in observed

PNRs among California’s non-federal hospitals. For example, 53 hospitals averaged PNR > 6 over the

2000-2002 period, and the averages in these units were 6.64, 7.17, and 7.36, respectively, in 2000, 2001,

and 2002. At the opposite extreme, there were 51 hospitals with PNR averages of 4 or less, with average

ratios of 3.23 in 2000 and 3.55 in both 2001 and 2002.

        Table 1 thus suggests that many hospitals were using patient loads that substantially exceeded the

mandate established by AB394. Statistics presented in the Table also show that these same hospitals

substantially reduced patient/nurse ratios post-regulation—likely in response to the regulation. In

particular, those hospitals that initially had the highest patient/nurse ratios in 2000-2002 experienced

sharply declining ratios by 2005-2006, while in contrast, those hospitals that initially had the lowest

patient/nurse ratios in 2000-2002 on average had little change in the average PNR.

        Table 2 provides sample means for failure to rescue (FTR) rates, using the same structure as

Table 1. Two important features of the Table merit emphasis. First, we observe that in the pre-regulation

years, FTR rates were generally highest in units that had high patient/nurse ratios. Second, we notice that

FTR rates generally declined from the pre-regulation period (2000-2002) to the post-regulation period

(2005-2006). These declines were observed in each category of hospitals, i.e., in hospitals that initially

had high patient/nurse ratios (and which were therefore likely affected by the new regulation) and in


                                                      8
hospitals that initially had relatively low patient/nurse ratios (and which were not likely affected by the

regulation). 13

         Table 3 again follows the format used in Tables 1 and 2—dividing hospitals by PNRs observed in

the pre-regulation period—and tracks the rates of decubits ulcers (DU). We notice that in the pre-

regulation period (2000-2002), hospitals with low patient/nurse ratios tended to have relatively low DU

rates. Over time, though, these same hospitals are observed to have increases in DU rates (while DU rates

remain roughly stable in units that initially had high patient/nurse ratios).

         Below we will provide a systematic analysis of the trends shown in these tables. Before doing so,

though, we provide summary statistics for some characteristics of the medical/surgical hospital units used

in the multivariate analyses. See Table 4. For our regression analysis below, we will often estimate

“difference equations” in which we treat 2001-2002 as the “pre-regulation period” and 2005-2006 as the

“post-regulation period,” so in this Table we present statistics for both of these periods.14 We see from

this table that hospitals that have high patient/nurse ratios (PNR>6) tend to be generally smaller than

other hospitals, as measured by “discharges.”15 The “case mix” variable, which indicates the severity of

illness in each hospital unit, is calculated by taking the average of the relative weighting factor for all

diagnosis related groups (DRGs) in the hospital unit during the period analyzed.16 The larger the case

mix value, the more severe is patient acuity on the unit. Finally, the “skill mix” variable is the percent of

productive hours provided by licensed nurses (RNs and LVNs combined) in a hospital that were provided




13
   Hospital FTR rates are positively correlated across time, even given changes induced by AB394. For example, we
computed a correlation between 2000-2002 rates and 2005-2006 rates of 0.32 (p-value<.0001).
14
   We leave 2000 out of the “pre-regulation period” here because we use that year for forming instruments to use in
our instrumental variable analysis.
15
   Discharges are defined as the number of inpatient population who are medically cleared to leave the hospital in
the given period analyzed. In our case, this would be the number of discharges averaged between 2001 and 2002 or
between 2005 and 2006.
16
   The relative weighting factor for each DRG in a given year is obtained from the Federal Register in the
corresponding year that contains this information. The volume and number of the Federal Register differs in each
calendar year. This information is available upon request.

by RNs. In general, this percent is quite high for all observed units. Also, this variable is increasing

slightly over time; hospitals were not generally substituting away from RNs in response to AB394.



4. Regression Analysis

        As we have noted, the goal of AB394 was to increase nurse staffing levels, thereby reducing

adverse patient health outcomes. As we also noted, much of the evidence pertaining to the hoped-for

improvements has come from cross-sectional analysis. With this in mind, we begin by looking at the

cross-sectional relationships between our patient outcomes and the patient-to-nurse ratios. In particular

we estimate cross-section regressions of the form:

(1)     PSIi = α0 + α1PNRi + α2Xi + εi ,

where PSIi is a measure of hospital unit i’s patient safety indicator (PSI) rate, averaged over the period

under study, PNRi is a measure of the unit patient-to-nurse ratio averaged over the period, and Xi is a

vector of unit-specific covariates averaged over the period (discharges, RN skill mix, and case mix).

        We begin by estimating equation (1) using failure to rescue as the PSI. Results are given in Table

5, for two time periods, the pre-regulation period (2000-2002) and the post-regulation period (2005-

2006). We estimate this regression without and with covariates. In both specifications and in both

periods, the PNR is positively correlated with failure to rescue. As in the previous literature using cross-

sectional data, we observe higher failure to rescue where there is a higher patient/nurse ratio. The

relationship is statistically significant, and the estimated effect is small but non-negligible. For example,

in the 2000-2002 regression that includes “controls,” an increase in the number of patients per nurse by 1

is associated with an increase in the rate of failure to rescue of 0.003—an increase of approximately 2%,

given that average failure to rescue is approximately 0.17. Of course, as we discuss above, interpretation

is problematic, given the potential problems of omitted variables and patient selection.

        We next estimate equation (1) using the decubitus ulcer (DU) rate as the PSI, again for the two

time periods, 2000-2002 and 2005-2006. Results are in Table 6. The estimated coefficients for the 2000-
                                                     10
2002 period are as one would expect. Higher patient/nurse ratios are associated with higher DU rates. An

increase of 1 in the number of patients per nurse is associated with an increase in the DU rate of 0.0012 (a

5% increase, given that the average rate is 0.025). Surprisingly, the relationship reverses in 2005-2006.

In this time period, relatively low patient/nurse ratios are associated with higher DU rates.

         To get an idea of what might be happening with reported DU rates in our data, we return to Table

3. Consider those hospitals that in the 2000-2002 period had the lowest patient loads (fewer than 4

patients per nurse). In 2000, DU rates were very low in these hospitals, but DU rates increased steadily in

these same hospitals, so that by 2006 these units had the relatively high DU rates. Notice that this

increase in reported DU rates occurred even though those same units continued to have generally low

patient/nurse loads (see Table 1) and were steadily improving on our other key PSI—failure to rescue (see

Table 3).

         A plausible explanation has to do with the nature of reported decubitus ulcers. Over the past

several years, there has been considerable attention given to this condition, in hospitals and even in the

public press. Part of this attention has been due to legal suits, in which patients with DUs have won

substantial awards. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have been

pushing a well-publicized migration to a severity-based payment system, under which payments to

hospitals have been reduced for patients that develop DUs.17 The consequence is that nurses on well-run

units have become increasingly sensitive about diagnosing DU cases present on admission (POA). This

is a potentially important issue because previous research indicates that in California in 2003, 89% of DU

cases were POA (Houchens, Elixhauser, and Romano, 2008). The point here is that the increasing DU

rates reported for the “best hospitals” (i.e., the hospitals that use low patient/nurse rates) might be an

indication that medical personnel in these hospitals are especially attentive to diagnosing DU cases POA.




17
   These new rules went into effect in October 2008, but attentive health care providers no doubt began to pay closer
attention to DU rates during the years leading up to the implementation of this policy.
                                                         11
In principal this should not be a problem since we exclude DU cases that are indicated as POA. But it is

difficult to know the level of accuracy of these records.18

        Given the concerns we have raised in the previous paragraphs, we do not conduct further analysis

on DU rates using our data. Instead, we view this case as underscoring previous work cautioning

researchers who use DU rates as a PSI (e.g., Houchens et al., 2008, and Polancich, et al., 2006).19

        We turn now to our primary analysis, which is intended to measure the causal relationship

between patient/nurse ratios and our other PSI, failure to rescue. As we have emphasized, cross-sectional

analysis is suspect for the purpose of estimating this relationship. Our concern is that the true relationship

between patient safety and the PNR is given not by (1), but instead by

(2)     PSIi = α0 + α1PNRi + α2Xi + α3Si + εi ,

which includes an additional (unobserved) set of variables, Si. If we estimate (1) rather than (2), the OLS

estimate of α1 is of course inconsistent if Si and PNRi are correlated, as seems quite plausible. In our case,

we can make headway as follows. We first take a “first difference” of equation (2),

(3)     ΔPSIi = β0 + β1ΔPNRi + β2ΔXi + [ β3ΔSi + Δεi] ,

where differences are taken between the 2005-2006 and 2001-2002 time periods. We have no data for

ΔSi (indeed we do not even know what variables appropriately should be included in the vector S) and if

we were to estimate (3), treating the term in brackets as an error term, that error term might well be

correlated with PNRi, If so, OLS would obviously still give inconsistent estimates of regression

parameters.

        Given the new regulation, though, we have a reasonable way to proceed. As we have seen in

Table 1, hospitals that initially had high levels of PNR generally had substantial decreases in PNR from


18
   Polancich, Restrepo, and Prosser’s (2006) validation study, which matched AHRQ patient safety indicators with
patient medical charts, suggests that the AHRQ methodology substantially over-estimates DU rates. (They point out
that many patients who transfer from nursing facility are admitted via an order from an emergency department
physician, and are therefore recorded as an emergency department admission.)
19
   Also, results reported in Tables 3 and 5 clearly provide reason to be concerned about previous work, based on
cross-sectional analysis that attempts to links nurse staffing ratios and DU rates.
                                                       12
the pre-regulation time period to the post-regulation time period. This makes sense. After all, the 2004

regulation mandated that all hospitals maintain the mandated staffing minimum, which meant that some

hospitals had to substantially increase staffing levels, while others did not. To capture that idea, we

define Di to be the difference between the required nurse staffing level (as implemented in 2004) and

hospital i’s staffing level in 2000. Clearly, we expect that the change in the patient/nurse ratio, ΔPNRi , to

be correlated with Di, and we expect that relationship to be nonlinear, so we use Di, Di2, and Di3 as

instruments. Thus we have a standard two-stage instrumental variables (IV) procedure: The first stage

regression has

(4)      ΔPNRi = θ0 + θ1 Di + θ2Di2+ θ3 Di3 + θ4ΔXh + νh .

Then in the second stage we use the predicted value of ΔPNRi in estimating regression (3).20

         Table 7 provides the results. The first two columns show OLS estimates for two specifications

based on (3)—one without covariates and one with covariates. Estimates of the key parameter of

interest—the association between PNR and failure to rescue—are very close to 0. Turning to the IV

estimates, we note, first of all, that in the first stage the instruments are both individually and jointly

highly significant.21 As is clear, though, from the second set of columns in Table 7, we find no significant

effect of the change in the patient/nurse ratio on failure to rescue. Estimated effects are very small and

are imprecisely estimated.

         As a check on this key result, we separated our sample into 108 hospitals in Northern California

and 186 hospitals in Middle/Southern California, and repeated the analysis given in Table 7. Similarly,

we separated the sample into 177 non-profit hospitals and 68 “investor hospitals,” and conducted analysis

20
   Notice that ΔPNRi is measured from 2005-2006 to 2001-2002, while the instruments Di, Di2, and Di3 are formed in
2000. Our reason for using a different year for the instruments is concern about measurement error. As discussed
above, our PNR variable is measured with error. Thus if we had formed instruments using the same year as our
ΔPNRi variables, it is possible that the correlation might be due simply to this measurement error. Our strategy then
relies on an assumption that measurement error in our PNR measures are not correlated between 2000 (data used to
form instruments) and either 2001-2002 or 2005-2006 (data used to form differences in PNR).
21
   Estimates of the coefficients for D, D2, and D3,and their standard errors (in parentheses) are, respectively, 0.464
(0.074), -0.109 (0.032), and -0.013 (0.010). The F statistic for the joint significance of the instruments is 17.0, so we
clearly do not have the problem of “weak instruments” (as discussed, e.g., in Staiger and Stock, 1997).
                                                          13
separately for these samples. The results were similar across these sub-samples; in no cases did we find a

statistically significant impact of the change in the patient/nurse ratio on failure to rescue.22

           In sum, we find no evidence of a causal impact of patient/nurse ratio on failure to rescue. The

basic story is seen clearly from Tables 1 and 2. From the pre-regulation period to the post-regulation

period, there was apparently an impact of AB394 on nurse staffing levels in some hospitals. Table 1

shows that hospitals which initially had high patient-to-nurse ratios substantially increased nursing levels,

bringing them closer to those hospitals that initially had relatively low patient/nurse ratios. However,

Table 2 shows that improvements in the failure to rescue rates were similar among all categories of

hospitals—those with initially high patient/nurse ratios and those with initially low patient/nurse ratios.

Regression results reported in Table 7 confirm these basic observations.



4. Discussion

           This paper presents an analysis of California’s AB394, a law that mandated minimum nurse

staffing levels in that State. We examine rates of decubitus ulcers, and conclude that such analysis is not

helpful in measuring the impact of the law on patient safety. More helpfully, we examine the impact on

failure to rescue rates.

           We find persuasive evidence that AB394 did have the intended effect of decreasing patient/nurse

ratios in hospitals that previously did not meet mandated standards. However, our analysis suggests that

failure to rescue rates did not disproportionately improve in these same hospitals. That is, we find no

evidence of a causal impact of the law on patient safety.

           There is an important caveat to our analysis. Our empirical results suggest that a mandate

reducing patient/nurse ratios, on its own, need not lead to improved patient safety. This is not to say,

though, that nurse staffing decisions are unimportant as a component in a hospital’s overall strategy for

ensuring high patient safety. In particular, it is worth emphasizing that in our data there is a statistically

significant positive cross-sectional relationship between patient/nurse ratios and failure to rescue (as in

much of the previous literature). We have noted the difficulties associated with drawing causal inferences

on the basis of such results. Nonetheless, apparently those hospitals that are most effective in ensuring

patient safety generally find it optimal to employ more nurses per patient. Perhaps there are

complementarities between nursing inputs and other (possibly unobserved) inputs and policies that lead to

better patient safety. Thus, improved nurse staffing might be crucial in improving patient safety, but only

in combination with other elements. It is important that analysts, policy-makers, and healthcare providers

sort out these important issues.

        OSHPD inpatient discharge data does not possess information identifying the hospital unit from

which the individual was discharged. We found only one documented attempt to create such units from

available OSHPD data (Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy, 2001). In this study, the authors

use a RN expert panel to answer survey questions, including a request to assign DRGs (diagnosis related

groups) to one of seven hospital-level-units (intensive care unit, burn care, definitive observation,

medical/surgical, pediatrics, psychiatrics, and obstetrics). This methodology seems to present a sound,

reputable approach to grouping patients into specific hospital units. Thus, we use it as the basis for

defining the general medical/surgical hospital units we analyze in this study. Below, we present the

DRGs that make up general medical/surgical units.

Appendix B

        One of the most difficult decisions to make when analyzing how nurse staffing affects patient

health outcomes is determining which outcomes are most appropriate to use. Ideally, the quality

indicators should represent patient outcomes that may be influenced by nurse staffing interventions.

Clarke (2003), Naylor (2007), and Needleman, Kurtzman, and Kizer (2007) all provide very informative

discussions regarding what characteristics are relevant when attempting to create indicators that connect

nurse staffing with patient care. Yet, there is no current consensus or definitive support of data to show

which patient outcomes are considered suitable (Hodge, et al., 2004; and Lankshear, Sheldon, and

Maynard, 2005), and thus, the literature provides numerous possibilities. The most common

methodologies for determining appropriate quality indicators are the following: using an expert panel

(usually comprised of nurses) to identify outcomes; and reviewing previous literature to determine which

studies provided indicators potentially sensitive to nurse staffing (Lichtig, Knauf, and Milholland, 1999;

Kravitz and Sauve, 2002; and Needleman, et al., 2002).

        We have read a considerable amount of the literature to evaluate which quality indicators are

justifiable for a study that analyzes how changes in nurse staffing affect quality of patient care. Of these

articles, only one (Evans and Kim, 2006) actually explains the justification for using the outcomes that

they study. Some researchers just take indicators that “seem appropriate.” Others use the literature as a

guide when choosing outcomes. The strongest justification is to reference outcomes that have been

advocated by organizations who conduct quality assurance research on potential nurse-related patient

health outcomes. These groups include the American Nurses Association (ANA), the California Nurses

Outcome Coalition (CalNOC), the National Quality Forum (NQF), and the Agency for Healthcare

Research and Quality (AHRQ). The three “nurse-affected” PSIs we analyze have all been studied and

advocated by these groups (AHRQ, 2003; and Naylor, 2007).

        The three AHRQ patient safety indicators (PSIs) that we use for this study indicate the probability

of problems suffered by patients due to exposure to the healthcare system, and that have a high
                                                      1
probability of prevention by changes at the provider level (AHRQ, 2003). These problems are referred to

as complications or adverse events. These indicators, initially entitled HCUP QIs (Healthcare Cost and

Utilization Project Quality Indicators), were created in the mid-1990s in response to the availability of

detailed hospital discharge data and hospital firms who desired quality measures that could be analyzed

using routine hospital administrative data. Since the creation of the HCUP QIs, the understanding and

study of quality indicators has increased significantly. Methods that include risk-adjustment by age,

gender, DRG, and co-morbidity have become more prevalent, as have the development of additional

indicators. In response to such advances, AHRQ funded the UCSF-Stanford EPC to enhance and

continue to develop the original quality indicators. The current AHRQ PSIs were created through a four-

step process that consisted of a literature review, sub-setting the literature review results, face validity

testing by clinician panels, and finally empirical testing. Even with the rigorous method by which the

AHRQ PSIs were created, there still remain limitations to these outcomes. These include the following:

1) concerns about clinical accuracy of discharge-based diagnosis coding (due to measurement error,

selection issues, and sensitivity/specificity problems); and 2) concerns that administrative data may be

limited in distinguishing adverse events in which error did not occur from actual medical errors (due to

clinical condition code similarities, lack of event timing data, and limited risk adjustment information).

        We used AHRQ software to create the two PSIs we employ from OSHPD administrative

inpatient discharge data. In order to calculate risk-adjusted PSI rates, the AHRQ software requires

information on age, gender, DRGs, and co-morbidities. However, we are using public-use data, and

certain information has been “masked” to protect patient confidentiality. Because of this “masked” data,

we are only able to use 82% of the inpatient discharges. Nevertheless, we have determined the

information that remains is still representative of the California inpatient discharge population, and thus,

our results should not be affected.
