                                              ABSTRACT

Using a sample of control cross-border acquisitions from 61 countries from 1990 to 2007, we find
that acquirers from countries with better governance gain more from such acquisitions and their gains
are higher when targets are from countries with worse governance. Other acquirer country characteristics
are not consistently related to acquisition gains. For instance, the anti-self-dealing index of the acquirer
has opposite associations with acquirer returns depending on whether the acquisition of a public firm
is paid for with cash or equity. Strikingly, global effects in acquisition returns are at least as important
as acquirer country effects. First, the acquirer’s industry and the year of the acquisition explain more
of the stock-price reaction than the country of the acquirer. Second, for acquisitions of private firms
or subsidiaries, acquirers gain more when acquisition returns are high for acquirers from other countries.
We find strong evidence that better alignment of interests between insiders and minority shareholders
is associated with greater acquirer returns and weaker evidence that this effect mitigates the adverse
impact of poor country governance.

1. Introduction

    There is a vast literature showing that a country’s governance is related to characteristics of its

financial markets as well as of its firms. In particular, countries with better governance are countries with

more developed financial markets, more initial public offerings, less unmet financing requirements,

greater valuation of cash held by investors, and so on.1 We expect corporate investments in countries

with better governance to increase shareholder wealth more. In particular, shareholders in countries with

better governance should be better able to protect themselves against expropriation by insiders, by the

state, as well as by other parties. Further, investments by corporations should face fewer obstacles in

countries where the government works better, regulation is less burdensome, and corruption is weaker.

However, firms can also take actions that offset the weaknesses of their country’s governance. For

instance, greater insider ownership can help align interests between insider and minority shareholders

(Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Shleifer and Wolfenzon, 2002) and cross-listing enables firms to rent

institutions from countries with better governance and investor protection (Coffee, 1999; Stulz, 1999). As

a result of these opposing effects, it is an empirical issue whether and how a country’s governance affects

the extent to which investments create wealth for shareholders.

    In this paper, we investigate whether a country’s governance explains the shareholder wealth created

by investment decisions by studying the stock-price reaction to cross-border control acquisitions.

Acquisitions are typically the largest discrete operating investments firms make (Jensen and Ruback,

1983). Cross-border acquisitions offer an ideal setting to study this issue. The cross-border acquisitions

firms make are typically acquisitions that are available to firms from many countries, so the price a firm

pays for an acquisition is generally set in a global market. Cross-border acquisitions make it possible,

therefore, to separate the investment decision from the investment opportunity set in a way that is not be

possible for domestic acquisitions. Importantly, this separation enables us to focus more directly on the

country governance of the acquiring firm. In the absence of this separation, it is difficult to separate the

impact of country governance on the acquirer versus its impact on the target. In this paper, we can
1
 See Olsen (1996) on the importance and implications of country governance. La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer,
and Vishny (2002) review some of the literature from the perspective that the key determinant of country
governance is a country’s legal origin. The result on the value of cash is in Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (2006).

                                                          1
identify separately the impact of acquiring-firm country governance and target-firm country governance.

We find, for the whole sample of acquisitions, the gains to acquiring-firm shareholders are higher in

countries with better governance and firms in such countries make more acquisitions.

    We construct a sample of 37,414 control acquisitions by firms in 61 countries from 1990 to 2007. Out

of these acquisitions, 8,090 are cross-border acquisitions. It is not surprising that most acquisitions are

domestic. It is well-known in the acquisitions literature that the returns to acquiring-firm shareholders

from acquisitions differ depending on the type of acquisition (see, for instance, Fuller, Netter, and

Stegemoller, 2002). We therefore consider all types of acquisitions together as well as each type of

acquisition separately. Acquisitions of private firms constitute the most frequent type of acquisitions both

domestically and cross-border. The relative frequency of acquisitions paid for with stock is much lower

for cross-border acquisitions than for domestic acquisitions. Strikingly, we show that, for all acquisitions

except acquisitions of public firms for cash, there is no difference in the average stock-price reaction to

domestic acquisitions and cross-border acquisitions. In the case of acquisitions of public firms for cash,

we find that cross-border acquisitions have an abnormal return that is greater by 0.56%. As in the

literature for U.S. acquisitions, all types of acquisitions but those of public firms paid for with common

stock generate a positive stock-price reaction.

    We investigate next how country governance and other country characteristics are related to acquirer

shareholder returns. We expect better country governance to lead to acquisitions that benefit shareholders

for several reasons. First, better governance makes it less likely that proceeds from investments will be

expropriated by the state, insiders, stakeholders, or others. Second, it makes it harder for insiders to make

investments that benefit them at the expense of shareholders. Third, better country governance gives an

advantage to firms in creating synergies through acquisitions. For example, poor respect for the rule of

law and poor control of corruption have an adverse impact on how well a firm conducts its operations. As

a result, a firm from a country with good governance that acquires a firm from a country with poor

governance can make the target more efficient. We use as our main measures of country governance the

World Governance Indicators published by the World Bank (see Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi

[KKM], 2009). These indices are time-varying and are obtained by averaging a large number of surveys.

                                                     2
They measure separately how well a country controls corruption, the respect for the rule of law, the

degree of political stability, the effectiveness of government, regulatory quality, and how well a country’s

citizens can participate in selecting the government and the extent to which they enjoy various freedoms.

We investigate the relation between acquirer gains and each one of the individual indices as well as with

the aggregate index for the acquirer’s country. For the whole cross-border sample, the average acquirer

abnormal return is 1.5%. A one standard deviation increase in the average country governance index

increases the stock-price reaction by 23 basis points, or 14.97%. We find that, in general, acquirer gains

increase with better control of corruption, better rule of law, and better government effectiveness in the

acquirer’s country. In addition, the acquirer gain for acquisitions of public firms for cash increase

significantly with these three indices as well, but also increase strongly with the index of government

stability. The effect of a one standard deviation increase in the average governance index on the abnormal

return for acquisitions of public firms paid for with cash is an increase of 60.65%. In multiple regressions,

country governance of the acquirer has a positive significant coefficient for the whole sample, for cash

acquisitions of public and private firms, and for stock acquisitions of private firms.

    We investigate other country characteristics expected to be related to the gains shareholders make

from acquisitions. We find that the stock-price reaction to acquisitions of public firms for cash increases

in an economically significant way with the acquiring country’s accounting transparency and its anti-self-

dealing index, an index that measures the ability of insiders to engage in self-dealing transactions (see

Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer, 2003), but acquiring-firm returns for acquisitions of

public firms paid for with equity fall with the anti-self-dealing index. Though the literature has devoted

considerable attention to the role of the anti-director index in the frequency of acquisitions and in merger

premiums since Rossi and Volpin (2004), we find no evidence that acquirers from countries with a higher

anti-director index gain more from acquisitions. Characteristics related to a country’s economic or

financial development are typically not significant.

    In all our regressions, we include a country characteristic both for the acquirer’s country and for the

target’s country. A striking result is that the coefficient of the characteristic for the target’s country has

often the opposite sign of the coefficient for the acquirer’s country. Most importantly given our focus, the

                                                       3
coefficient on the governance index of the target’s country is generally negative, so that the gain from

acquisitions for acquiring-firm shareholders is generally lower if the acquisition is made in a country with

better governance. This result implies that the benefits of good country governance are portable, in that a

firm from a country with good governance carries the benefits of that good governance with it when it

goes abroad.

    The results we have discussed generally hold in many different regression specifications. In

particular, we estimate regressions with only one country characteristic at a time as well as with multiple

country characteristics. We would expect firm and deal characteristics to be endogenous to country

characteristics. We therefore estimate regressions without firm and deal characteristics as well as

regressions with these characteristics. Our main results hold in all of these specifications.

    We then explore whether two firm-level governance choices, namely insider ownership and the

choice of an ADR program, mitigate the effect of poor country governance. Though there is evidence that

corporate control mechanisms affect acquirer returns in the U.S. (Masulis, Wang, and Xie, 2007), U.S.

evidence on the relation between bidder returns and insider ownership is mixed (for instance, while

Hubbard and Palia (1995) find a nonlinear relation between bidder returns and managerial ownership,

Loderer and Martin (1997) find no relation). In contrast, we find strong evidence that acquirer returns

increase with insider ownership in our cross-country sample. The economic significance of a one standard

deviation increase in insider ownership for the whole sample is an increase of 18% in the acquirer return.

There is some evidence that the benefit from insider ownership decreases as the quality of a country’s

governance increases, but this evidence is significant only for acquisitions of private firms. Surprisingly,

the existence of an ADR program is negatively related to returns of acquisitions of public firms for stock.

A possible explanation is that the information environment is better for ADR firms (see Bailey, Karolyi,

and Salva, 2006), so that stock issuance has more signaling value for such firms.

    As Black (2000) observes, merger waves have become global. The frequency of cross-border

acquisitions shows that there is a global market for control. We would therefore expect global factors to

affect the gains from acquisitions and the frequency of acquisitions. To capture global effects, we first use

year and industry indicator variables. For the whole sample, we find that these indicator variables have

                                                      4
more explanatory power than country characteristics, suggesting that global determinants of stock-price

reactions to acquisitions are important. We show further that an acquirer’s return for an acquisition is

related to acquirer returns in other countries for the same type of transaction and form of payment. This

effect is strong for the whole sample and for acquisitions of private firms and subsidiaries; it is not for

acquisitions of public firms.

    If a country’s governance is a valuable input in the production function of firms, we would expect

firms from countries with poor governance to find it more difficult to compete for acquisitions. As a

result, governance should affect not only the gains of acquisitions but also whether acquisitions take

place. We find that this is indeed the case. We show across all types of acquisitions that the frequency of

acquisitions is strongly positively related to the governance of a country. In other words, if a firm is in a

country with better governance, it makes more cross-border acquisitions. Other country characteristics are

generally insignificant after controlling for industry and year.

    We proceed as follows. In Section 2, we review the relevant literature. In Section 3, we explain how

we construct our sample and how we estimate abnormal returns. We show estimates of the stock-price

reaction to cross-border and domestic acquisitions in Section 4. In Section 5, we investigate the relation

between acquiring-firm shareholder gains from cross-border acquisitions and characteristics of the

acquiring firm’s country using several different approaches. In Section 6, we show that country

governance is positively related to the frequency of acquisitions. We conclude in Section 7.


2. Review of the literature

    There is a growing literature on cross-border acquisitions. Part of this literature focuses on

understanding the frequency of such acquisitions. Another part of the literature tries to explain

shareholder gains. In this brief review, we discuss only the literature addressing control acquisitions by

publicly traded firms, which is the topic of this paper.

    Early papers on cross-border mergers and acquisitions are more concerned about issues related to the

benefits of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the value created by international corporate



                                                      5
diversification. An early paper by Harris and Ravenscraft (1991) approaches cross-border acquisitions

from the same perspective as the FDI literature does.2 It shows that cross-border acquisitions are more

frequent in R&D intensive industries. The more recent literature on country determinants of mergers and

acquisitions activity starts with Rossi and Volpin (2004). Like us, they focus on control acquisitions and

include private firm targets in their sample (22% of their acquisitions have a public company as the

target). In their analysis of target countries, they find that countries with weaker shareholder protection

are the targets of fewer cross-border acquisitions. They do not focus on characteristics of acquiring

countries separately. In their analysis of acquirer/target country pairs, they show that acquirers typically

come from countries with better accounting standards and stronger shareholder protection than the targets.

In contrast to Rossi and Volpin (2004), Erel, Liao, and Weisbach (2010) also consider partial acquisitions

and include in their sample acquisitions made by non-public firms (Karolyi and Liao (2010) show that

state-related entities are important acquirers as well). Their study shows that firms from countries whose

currency has appreciated tend to invest in countries whose currency has depreciated. Ferreira, Massa, and

Matos (2009) show that cross-border acquisitions are more likely to occur in countries where foreign

institutional investors hold a higher fraction of the local stock market. Finally, Ahern, Daminelli, and

Fracassi (2010) examine the impact of cultural values on cross-border activity and find that the frequency

of cross-border acquisitions is lower between pairs of countries that are more culturally distant.

    Papers that investigate stock-price reactions to cross-border acquisitions tend to have two different

perspectives. Some papers focus on acquirer returns trying to assess whether international corporate

diversification benefits shareholders and do so often from the perspective of the corporate diversification

literature. Other papers study instead whether the gains to acquirers or targets are related to country

characteristics. Many papers focus only on cross-border acquisitions involving a U.S. firm.

    Papers focusing on the benefits of international corporate diversification include Doukas and Travlos

(1988), who show that firms that enter a new geographic market earn a higher abnormal return. Eun,

here.

Kolodny, and Scheraga (1996) provide evidence that cross-border acquisitions of U.S. targets create

positive synergies. Dos Santos, Errunza, and Miller (2008) look at changes in the diversification discount

around cross-border acquisitions. They conclude that diversifying cross-border acquisitions destroy value.

Moeller and Schlingemann (2005) investigate acquisitions of foreign firms by U.S. firms from 1985 to

1995. They find that acquirer returns for cross-border acquisitions are lower by about 100 basis points

than for domestic acquisitions. They attribute this result to transactions that increase the acquirer’s global

diversification and industry diversification. Harris and Ravenscraft (1991) fail to find evidence that target

premiums can be explained by industry considerations, but they show that premiums are related to

exchange rate movements, so that the higher premiums they document for acquisitions by foreign firms

seem to be partly explained by weakness of the dollar.

    Bris and Cabolis (2008) focus on the premium in cross-border acquisitions. Their sample includes

partial acquisitions. They consider only acquisitions of public companies and do not analyze the returns to

acquirers. They show that 100 percent control acquisitions of target firms in weak shareholder protection

countries made by acquiring firms in strong shareholder protection countries result in a higher premium

than comparable domestic acquisitions in the weak shareholder protection countries. Starks and Wei

(2004) conclude that takeover premia received by U.S. firms acquired by foreign firms from 1980 to 1998

are decreasing in the quality of corporate governance in the acquiring country and that acquiring-firm

returns are increasing in the quality of corporate governance in their country when the acquisition is paid

for with stock but not otherwise. Kuipers, Miller, and Patel (2003) examine acquisitions of U.S.

companies by foreign companies. They find that the acquirer’s return increases in the degree of

shareholder protection in the acquirer’s country, but falls in the product of the degree of shareholder

protection and the respect of the rule of law, so that shareholder protection does not seem to be related to

acquirer returns in countries where the respect of the rule of law is high. Martynova and Renneboog

(2008) find that the three-day announcement return is lower for cross-border acquisitions than for

domestic acquisitions for acquisitions from European countries. Using indices of the quality of corporate

governance at the country level, they show that acquisition returns for bidders and targets in cross-border

                                                      7
acquisitions are higher when the bidder comes from a country with better corporate governance than the

target. Burns, Francis, and Iftekhar (2007) examine the role of ADR programs in cross-border

acquisitions. They find that foreign firms with ADR programs pay less for U.S. targets, but they also

show that the existence of an ADR program does not offset poor investor protection at home for a foreign

firm.

    Several recent papers investigate other determinants of acquisition returns besides investor protection

and corporate governance. Chari, Ouimet, and Tesar (2009) find, using a sample of acquisitions from

1986 to 2006, that developed-market acquirers earn 1.16% on average when an emerging-market firm is

acquired, but do not earn a significant positive abnormal return when acquiring targets in developed

countries. Their total sample of cross-border acquisitions is slightly more than a third of ours despite

including acquisitions of minority stakes. They find that acquirer returns increase as respect for the rule of

law in the acquirer’s country increases relative to the target’s country, but only for control acquisitions.

Ferreira, Massa, and Matos (2010) also obtain estimates of abnormal returns for acquirers. They show a

negative average acquirer return of -0.78% for a sample of 176 acquisitions. They focus on the combined

return to the acquirer and the target. They conclude that this combined return increases in the foreign

institutional ownership of the bidder and the foreign institutional ownership of the target. They use

acquirer insider ownership as a control variable, but do not report the coefficient. Ahearn, Daminelli, and

Fracassi (2010) investigate the value created by cross-border acquisitions. However, they only pursue that

investigation focusing on the combined return to the acquirer and the target and do not evaluate whether

acquirers benefit from cross-border acquisitions. Because of their investigation of combined returns, they

have a sample of 938 cross-border mergers across 38 countries. The size of this sample is comparable to

the size of our sample of cross-border acquisitions with public targets. They conclude that the combined

returns in acquisitions are lower when the countries of the acquirer and the target are more culturally

distant.

    In summary, the existing literature has mixed results on whether acquirers gain from cross-border

acquisitions, as the estimated stock-price reaction to cross-border acquisitions is negative in some studies

                                                      8
and positive in others. The literature also reaches mixed results on how country and firm characteristics

are related to the stock-price reaction. For instance, some papers find evidence of an impact of country-

level investor protection for some types of transactions but not for others. Our paper adds to that

literature, among other reasons, by demonstrating that the return from cross-border acquisitions is

affected in an economically important way by country governance, globalization, and corporate

governance.



3. Data

    We discuss first how we construct the sample of acquisitions and then how we estimate abnormal

returns. In the final part of the section, we describe the firm and country variables we use.



3.1. The sample of acquisitions.

    To obtain our sample of acquisitions, we use the Securities Data Company’s (SDC) Global Mergers

and Acquisition database for the merger and acquisition sample. We begin with collecting data on all

acquirers and targets in completed deals for control from 1990-2007. We consider only deals for control

where the acquirer owns less than 50% of the target before the acquisition and more than 50% afterwards.

We only include deals where the target is public, private, or a subsidiary, and therefore exclude spin-offs,

recaps, buybacks, self-tenders, or exchange offers. We delete deals where SDC classifies the target as

private, yet the stock price information is available. A difficulty with subsidiary targets is that the

subsidiary could be located in a foreign country but the parent could be located in the same country as the

acquirer. Since we are investigating how shareholder gains from acquisitions are related to characteristics

of the country of the target as well as characteristics of the acquirer, we include in our sample only

subsidiary targets where the ultimate parent’s country is the same as the subsidiary’s country. The initial

sample includes 45,875 acquisitions. We then limit the sample to public acquirers, which reduces the

sample to 24,463 acquisitions. As we are only interested in deals that are important investments from the

acquirer’s perspective, we eliminate all deals where the value of the transaction reported by SDC is less

                                                      9
than 1% of the acquiring firm’s market value of equity two days before the announcement. The deal

value is only available for 12,393 acquisitions and of these acquisitions only 9,036 have a deal value in

excess of 1% of the acquiring firm’s market value of equity. Finally, we need stock returns to estimate

abnormal returns and eliminate an acquirer (target) from the sample if the acquirer (target) is involved in

multiple acquisitions within a five-day window surrounding the announcement of the deal, which leaves

us with 8,090 acquisitions. Using the same sample selection criteria for domestic acquisitions yields a

sample of 29,324 acquisitions.

    Our final sample contains 37,414 deals. Panel A of Table 1 shows how the sample is distributed over

the sample period. The distribution through time of the domestic deals and cross-border deals differs

somewhat. Both domestic and cross-border deals are represented disproportionately during the 1998-2000

merger wave. However, relatively more of the cross-border deals occur after the merger wave and

relatively fewer occur before the merger wave compared to domestic deals. In particular, 47.34% of the

cross-border deals occur after 2000, compared to only 41.47% for domestic deals. The correlation

between the number of deals per year during the sample period for cross-border and domestic deals is

86%.

    Panel B of Table 1 shows some interesting differences between the industry representation of cross-

border and domestic deals using the ten SIC-based main industry classifications (e.g., Kahle and

Walkling, 1996). For example, while manufacturing represents the industry with the most domestic and

cross-border deals, the representation of more than 46.2% for cross-border deals is substantially larger

than the 27.8% for domestic deals. In contrast, cross-border deals (10.3%), compared to domestic deals

(23.0%), are much less likely to involve financials, which is likely due to regulatory issues. After

manufacturing, services represent the largest industry for both domestic and cross-border deals.

    Finally, Panel C shows the distribution of the sample across acquirer nations. While the U.S. accounts

for more than half of the domestic transactions (55.7%), only 23.3% of the cross-border transactions have

a U.S. firm as the acquirer. In fact, the U.K. has a slightly higher representation (24.2%) in the cross-

border sample than the U.S. In contrast to the U.S., the U.K. represents a larger fraction of the cross-

                                                    10
border transactions than of the domestic transactions (17.9 percent). In terms of cross-border transactions,

the top ten countries in terms of sample representation are respectively U.K., U.S., Canada, Australia,

France, Sweden, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Singapore. These ten countries, out of a total of

56 countries in the sample with at least one firm making a cross-border acquisition, represent nearly 80%

of the cross-border deals in our sample.



3.2. Abnormal returns

    Stock returns are obtained from Datastream. All our analysis uses dollar returns. We use SEDOL

from SDC to merge with Datastream to obtain event returns for the acquirer. SDC reports a Primary

SEDOL and an Ultimate Parent SEDOL as firm identifiers.              If the primary SEDOL matches to

Datastream we use the Primary SEDOL, otherwise we use the Ultimate Parent SEDOL.

    Estimating acquirer stock-price reactions across 61 countries presents several challenges. A possible

approach is to follow the traditional approach carried on for U.S. acquisitions and estimate the market

model at the country level to estimate abnormal returns over a three-day window. Some of the studies

discussed in Section 2 do exactly that (e.g., Ahearn, Daminelli, and Fracassi, 2010; Chari, Ouimet, and

Tesar, 2010). There are two potential problems with such an approach. First, the number of firms differs

sharply across countries, so that in some countries the acquirer might be an extremely large fraction of the

market portfolio. For instance, Statoil ASA of Norway acquires North American Oils Sands Corp. Statoil

ASA’s market capitalization represents 27.80% of the market portfolio of Norway. In such a case, the

acquirer abnormal return would be pulled to zero because of the weight of the firm in the country market

portfolio. To account for this issue and to make abnormal returns comparable across countries, we use a

market model where the proxy for the market return is a proxy for the world market portfolio. Second, an

acquisition announcement may take place first in the country of the target when the market is closed in

the country of the acquirer or may take place in the country of the acquirer when the country of the target

is closed for business. Further, stock market liquidity differs across countries and so do regulations for

disclosure and stock trading. Differences in microstructure and disclosure could lead to a lag in the extent

                                                    11
to which the market reacts to an acquisition in some countries. For instance, during our sample period,

some countries stop trading in a stock for the day after it has moved by some percentage (i.e., South

Korea). Consequently, the announcement effect may be spread over several days. To allow for enough

time to incorporate the announcement information, we use a five-day announcement window instead of a

more standard three-day window to estimate the cumulative abnormal return (CAR).

      The parameters for the estimation of the market model are estimated over the period starting 205 days

to 6 days prior to the announcement. We use the world index from Datastream as the regressor in the

market model. All event returns are winsorized at the 0.5% level and the 99.5% level.3 We examine the

robustness of our average CAR estimates to alternative specifications of the market model. In particular,

we use the country index for event returns and also implement a method where we use the country index

only if the country index is available and the market cap of the firm is less than 5% of the total market cap

of the country index and the world index otherwise. Our estimates of average CARs are not affected by

these choices.



3.3. Country and firm-level data

      The first group of country-level governance variables includes the anti-self-dealing index (ANTI_SD)

from Djankov et al. (2008), the anti-directors index (ANTI_DIR) from La Porta et al. (1998) as revised in

Djankov       et   al.   (2008),   and   private   and    public enforcement       indices   of   securities   laws

(SECLAW_PRIVATE; SECLAW_PUBLIC) from La Porta et al. (2006). The literature, including Rossi

and Volpin (2004), often uses the product of the anti-director rights index and the rule of law index

(RULE_LAW), which measures the extent to which laws are enforced, from La Porta et al. (1998). This

product is interpreted in the literature as a measure of shareholder protection (SHARE_PROTECT), and

we do the same. We use an index from La Porta et al. (1998) measuring the quality of fiscal-year 1990

annual reports on their disclosure of accounting information (ACCOUNT) and an index of the quality of

disclosure (JM_DISC) developed by Jin and Myers (2006). We also use the measure of creditor rights

3
    We correct for Datastream return errors based on the recommendations in Ince and Porter (2006).

                                                          12
(CREDITOR_RIGHTS) from Djankov et al. (2007). While the existing literature on cross-border

acquisitions has focused on shareholder rights indices, the FDI literature has shown that FDI flows are

higher towards countries with poorer creditor rights (see Razin and Sadka, 2007). The argument in that

literature is that foreign investors have more of an advantage over local firms in countries with poor

creditor rights because they have better access to funding. We would therefore expect acquirer returns to

be positively related to the creditor rights of the country of the acquired firm and negatively related to the

creditor rights of the target’s country. We expect that higher values for these indices in the acquirer’s

country are associated with higher stock-price reactions as better investor protection makes it harder for

insiders to expropriate investors through the use of acquisitions or from the gains created by acquisitions.

We would expect the opposite result for the target country’s index if a firm from a country that protects

investor rights can better export the advantages resulting from better investor protection, for instance by

having a lower cost of capital.

    For the second group of country-level governance proxies, we use the country-level indicators of

KKM. These indicators are obtained from combining several hundred individual variables measuring

political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, enforcement of the rule of law,

corruption, and the extent to which a country’s citizens are able to participate in selecting their

government. They vary annually since 1997. We use the index for the year of the acquisition

announcement or 1997 if the acquisition takes place earlier. We follow Kaufman et al. (2008) and

consider the mean of the six variables for each country (WDI_GOV_AVG). We also use the scores for

the control of corruption (CONTROL_CORR), government effectiveness (GOVT_EFFECT), political

stability (POL_STAB), regulatory quality (REG_QUALITY), rule of law (RULELAW_WGI), and voice

and accountability (VOICE_ACCT).4 Again, we would expect acquirer returns to increase with the

governance indices of the acquirer’s country and decrease with the governance indices of the target’s

country.


4
 Note that RULE_LAW used to create the variable SHARE_PROTECT is different from the RULELAW_WGI
variable. See the Appendix for a detailed description of these variables.

                                                     13
    We follow Bhattacharya and Daouk (2003) and define indicator variables equal to one if,

respectively, insider trading laws (IT_LAW) and enforcement actions of insider trading laws (IT_ENF)

are in place at least one year prior to the acquisition announcement year and zero otherwise. We would

expect less insider trading to be associated with higher stock-price reactions in absolute value since the

element of surprise in acquisition announcements would be higher.

    Other country-level variables measure economic and financial development as well as the

performance of markets in a country. Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2006) show that firm-level governance

measures are more effective with greater financial and economic development. We include the Gross

Domestic Product (GDP_PCAP) per capita based on the World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset

from the World Bank. GDP per capita is measured in 2007 dollars. Also, we construct a ratio of the

aggregate market capitalization of the equity of publicly listed companies to the GDP of that country

(MKTCAP_GDP) and a turnover ratio equal to the ratio of the annual dollar volume to the total market

capitalization (CRTY_STK_TURNOVER). We would expect firms to be more valuable and to have more

resources when the domestic market has done well in dollars. Trailing one-year stock returns per country

(CTRY_RET_1YR) are collected from Datastream. Note that since we are considering dollar returns, a

country’s stock index could perform well because the country’s stock market increased in value in local

currency or because the local currency appreciated. Consequently, our stock returns measure subsumes

the foreign exchange effect that some papers discussed earlier have shown to affect target returns and the

frequency of cross-border acquisitions. One of the best-known theoretical papers on cross-border

acquisitions, Adler and Dumas (1975), focuses on the role of such acquisitions in arbitraging barriers to

portfolio investment. Consequently, we use a measure of such barriers. We would expect acquirers to gain

more from acquisitions in countries with barriers to international investment and we would expect

acquirers to have an advantage if they come from a country that has no such barriers. Bekaert (1995) and

Edison and Warnock (2003) consider a measure based on the ratio of the market capitalization of the

constituent firms comprising the International Finance Corporate (IFC) Investable Index to those that



                                                   14
comprise the IFC Global index for each country (LIB_INTENSITY_AVG). We update this index

annually, but it does not vary over the sample period for developed countries.

    We use Compustat Global for firm-level characteristics (except for insider ownership for which we

use Worldscope) and SDC for deal-level characteristics. Firm-level characteristics as well as deal size are

measured in dollars. Requiring firm-level characteristics reduces our sample by 23%. We are especially

interested in the issue of whether firm-level governance characteristics reduce the importance of country-

level governance. This is an issue that has been studied extensively in the literature. Doidge, Karolyi and

Stulz (2007) find an extremely large country-level fixed-effect in firm-level governance for less-

developed countries. We use two firm-level governance measures. First, we use insider ownership from

Worldscope measured as the percentage of closely held shares relative to the total shares outstanding

(INSIDEPCT). The theoretical literature shows that one would expect insider ownership to be higher in

countries with worse investor protection, so that insider ownership would mitigate the adverse impact of

poor investor protection. La Porta et al. (2002) provide evidence in support of this prediction. The

limitations of the Worldscope insider ownership data are well-known (see Dahlquist et al., 2003).

However, there is no substitute for this data that has close to the same coverage. We also include

indicator variables for whether non-U.S. acquirers have an ADR program (ADR). The literature shows

both theoretically and empirically that ADR programs are a way for foreign corporations to rent U.S. laws

and institutions (see Karolyi (2010) for a review of the literature).

    The Appendix of the paper provides a detailed description of the country-level and firm-level

variables we use.



4. Gains to shareholders from acquisitions: Domestic versus cross-border acquisitions

    In this section, we assess whether cross-border acquisitions create wealth for acquiring-firm

shareholders and whether the wealth they create differs from domestic acquisitions. Such an inquiry is

important both generally and for the investigation of our paper. As discussed in Section 3, there is a large

literature that assesses the benefits from international diversification at the firm level. One way to assess

                                                      15
whether international diversification is valuable is to compare the gains to acquiring-firm shareholders

from domestic acquisitions to those from cross-border acquisitions. In the context of our study, it is

important to assess whether shareholders make gains from cross-border acquisitions to better evaluate our

later results. If stock-price reactions were insignificant across cross-border acquisitions, abnormal returns

might be too noisy to assess their relation to country characteristics with precision.

    Table 2 shows the estimates for stock-price reactions to domestic and cross-border reactions. Average

abnormal returns are statistically significant at the one-percent level for all types of acquisitions, except

for the cross-border acquisitions of public targets paid for with stock, which is significant at the five-

percent level. In our analysis we focus on the results for the full sample and for the following subsamples:

Public targets paid for with cash, public targets paid for with stock, subsidiary targets paid for with cash,

private targets paid for with cash, and private targets paid for with stock. We do not provide a separate

analysis for acquisitions for which the means-of-payment is mixed or unknown, but these acquisitions are

included in the whole sample analysis.

    For the whole sample, the average stock-price reactions for domestic and cross-border acquisitions

are astoundingly similar, 1.42% versus 1.50%. Obviously, the difference in the stock-price reaction

between these two types of acquisitions is not significant. We consider next the stock-price reaction to

different types of acquisitions. We find that acquisitions of public firms for cash represent 5.20% of the

domestic acquisitions and 9.30% of the cross-border acquisitions. Perhaps not surprisingly, acquisitions

of public firms for cash benefit the acquiring-firm shareholders. However, they benefit acquiring-firm

shareholders significantly more with cross-border acquisitions than with domestic acquisitions. The

difference in the stock-price reaction between domestic and cross-border acquisitions is 0.56% and is

significant at the ten-percent level. In contrast, acquisitions of public firms for stock are over three times

more likely for domestic acquisitions than cross-border acquisitions (7.47% versus 2.30%). This finding

is not surprising as it is also observed in several of the papers discussed in Section 2. Acquisitions of

public firms paid for with stock have negative stock-price reactions, whether they are domestic or cross-

border. The average abnormal return for cross-border acquisitions is -2.02% in contrast to the average

                                                     16
abnormal return for domestic acquisitions of -1.18%. The difference between the two average abnormal

returns is not significant.

    All types of acquisitions involving subsidiaries or private firms have significant positive abnormal

returns. Such a finding is not surprising in light of the existing literature for acquisitions in the U.S. (see

e.g., Fuller et al., 2002; Moeller et al., 2004, 2005). The frequency of subsidiary acquisitions is similar for

cross-border acquisitions (19.90%) and domestic acquisitions (21.20%). The average abnormal returns for

these two types of acquisitions are almost the same at respectively 1.71% and 1.66%. The frequency of

cross-border acquisitions of private firms for cash is about one third higher than the frequency of

domestic acquisitions of private firms for cash (32.89% compared to 24.91%). Again, there is no

meaningful difference in abnormal returns. Finally, as for acquisitions of public firms with stock,

acquisitions of private firms with stock in cross-border acquisitions are infrequent. Only 4.68% of the

cross-border acquisitions are acquisitions of private firms paid for with stock, which is roughly half the

frequency of domestic acquisitions of private firms paid for with stock. The average abnormal return of

such domestic acquisitions, 2.80%, is insignificantly higher than the average abnormal return for

comparable cross-border acquisitions, 2.59%. With the large number of observations, all differences in

relative frequencies between domestic and cross-border deals for the various sub-samples are significant

at the one-percent level.



5. Gains to acquiring-firm shareholders and country characteristics

    In this section, we investigate the relation between acquirer shareholder returns and the acquirer’s

country governance and investor protection characteristics as well as its economic and financial

development. As Doidge, Karolyi and Stulz (2007) show, there are important reasons why firm-level

governance is more effective when economic development and financial development are higher.

However, in addition and perhaps more importantly, greater economic development and financial

development could offer advantages to firms in making cross-border investments as they can draw on



                                                      17
better resources if globalization is limited because of cross-country differences as discussed in Stulz

(2005). For instance, it might be easier for firms from more financially developed countries to raise funds.

    Two important issues need to be addressed before we can proceed to our regression analysis. First, it

is known that firm and deal characteristics are related to stock-price reactions to acquisitions. For

instance, we know that acquirer returns fall with acquirer size (see Moeller et al., 2004) and increase with

acquirer leverage (see, e.g., Maloney, McCormick, and Mitchell, 1993). An important issue is therefore

whether we should control for such characteristics. Second, the literature shows that stock-price reactions

differ across types of acquisitions. This raises the question of whether we should consider the stock-price

reactions to all acquisitions in a country or only consider stock-price reactions for each type of

acquisitions. We explain how we resolve these issues next before turning to regressions.

    The problem with controlling for firm and deal characteristics in regressions that attempt to explain

the stock-price reaction to acquisitions across countries is that both firm and deal characteristics are

endogenous to country characteristics. In a U.S. study, all firms have an equal opportunity to choose to

proceed with a hostile offer or to proceed with a tender offer. However, in a cross-country study, firms in

some countries will be limited in their ability to choose some deal characteristics. Similarly, firms are

larger in some countries than others and differences in firm size across countries are often attributed to

differences in institutions (see Kumar, Rajan, and Zingales, 2002). Yet, we know within the U.S. that

large firms generally make acquisitions that have lower stock-price reactions. Hence, controlling for size,

we might reach a different conclusion about the impact of institutions on the gains from acquisitions, but

we would then ignore that part of the effect of institutions might work through size. We therefore choose

to focus on regressions that have purely exogenous variables. In these regressions, the variables are

country characteristics and indicator variables for a firm’s industry and its calendar year. We then discuss

which results are affected when we control for firm and deal characteristics. Specifically, at the deal level

we control for relative size, whether the deal is classified as hostile, whether the deal is classified as a

tender offer, and the worldwide liquidity of the market of the assets of the target (see e.g., Schlingemann

et al., 2002). Our firm-level control variables include the natural logarithm of the market value of the

                                                     18
acquirers’ equity two days prior to the announcement, Tobin’s Q (defined as the market value of assets

divided by the book value of assets, where the market value of assets is the book value of assets minus the

book value of equity plus the market value of equity), the operating cash flow divided by the book value

of assets, and the market value measure of leverage (debt divided by the market value of assets).

    As already discussed, acquisition returns are positive and significant for acquisitions of private

companies and negative and significant for acquisitions of public companies paid for with equity.

Consequently, if a country’s firms make relatively more cross-border acquisitions of public firms paid for

with equity, the stock-price reaction to acquisitions, everything else equal, will be worse in that country.

This outcome raises a concern. There is a substantial literature that shows that firms that pay for

acquisitions with equity signal to the market that their equity is overvalued (see e.g., Moeller et al., 2007).

As a result, conditional on the market assessing the equity’s value correctly, an acquisition might increase

shareholder wealth even though the stock-price reaction is negative. This issue would suggest looking at

acquisition types separately. However, this approach also suffers from a problem, which is that

acquisition types are most likely endogenous to country characteristics since there is evidence (discussed

in Section 2) that investors are reluctant to accept shares in payment for an acquisition when the shares

trade in a country with poor governance.

    A constant issue with research using country characteristics is that many of these country

characteristics tend to be highly correlated, so that multicollinearity may make it difficult to assess the

effect of independent variables in multiple regressions. We therefore start in Section 5.1. with estimating

regressions with one country characteristic at a time, while controlling for calendar year and the industry

of the acquirer. Next, in Section 5.2, we turn to regression analysis where we use multiple country

characteristics for the bidder and the target in the same specification to assess whether a country

characteristic is significant in Section 5.1. because it proxies for other country characteristics. In all

regressions, we use the country characteristic for the acquiring firm as well as the same characteristic for

the target. This approach allows us to assess how target country characteristics affect acquirer returns, but

it also makes sure that if there is strong correlation among target and acquirer country characteristics, our

                                                      19
assessment of the relation between acquirer returns and acquirer country characteristics is not biased.

Finally, we cluster the residuals by country.



5.1. Regressions using one country characteristic at a time

    The regression estimates are presented in Table 3. For each country characteristic, we show the

coefficient on the country characteristic for the acquirer’s country and for the target’s country, as well as

the number of observations and the adjusted R-squared of the regression. The first three country

characteristics we consider are, respectively, the anti-self-dealing index (ANTI_SD), the anti-director

index (ANTI_DIR), and the product of the anti-director index and the rule of law index

(SHARE_PROTECT). We find no evidence that these indices are associated with acquirer returns for the

whole sample. However, acquirer returns for cash acquisitions of public firms increase as the anti-self-

dealing index of the acquirer country increases and as the anti-self-dealing index of the target country

decreases. This pattern that a country characteristic has opposite effects depending on whether it is a

characteristic of the acquirer’s country or of the target’s country is observed a number of times in the

table. The coefficients are economically significant as a one standard deviation increase in the anti-self-

dealing index is associated with an increase in the abnormal return of almost half a percentage point. The

negative relation between abnormal returns and the anti-self-dealing index for acquisitions of public firms

paid for with equity raises the possibility that a higher governance country has a higher quality

information environment, so announcements of equity offers have greater signaling value. The anti-self-

dealing index of the acquirer’s country is not significant for other acquisition types. Acquirers gain more

from acquisitions in countries where the anti-director index is lower for acquisitions of public firms paid

for with equity and is insignificant for the whole sample and all other types of acquisitions. Acquirer

returns fall with the anti-director index of the target’s country for the whole sample. Finally, we find that

the product (SHARE_PROTECT) of the anti-director index and the rule of law index is never significant.

    There is no evidence that the creditor rights index (CREDITOR_RIGHTS) is correlated with acquirer

returns. Interestingly, strong creditor rights in the target country are associated with lower gains for the

                                                     20
acquiring firm, a finding that is consistent with the predictions of Razin and Sadka (2007). They argue

that acquirers have an advantage if they have cheaper access to funds than firms in the target country

because of better creditor rights in their home country. The securities law indices (SECLAW_PRIVATE;

SECLAW_PUBLIC) are not related to the acquirer gains at all. The final index we consider in this group

of indices typically associated with investor protection is an index of accounting transparency

(ACCOUNT). We find that the index of the acquirer country is positively associated with acquirer gains

and the index of the target is negatively associated with these gains for acquisitions of public firms for

cash. We also use the quality of disclosure index (JM_DISC) of Jin and Myers (2006). The coefficient on

that index is never significant for acquirer returns (not reproduced in the table).

    After considering indices that are related to investor protection, we turn to the World Bank

governance indicators. The first index we consider is related to the control of corruption

(CONTROL_CORR). We find that acquirers from countries that control corruption better gain more

from acquisitions for the whole sample and for cash acquisitions of public firms; further, acquirers gain

more for the whole sample and for cash acquisitions of public firms when the target country controls

corruption less. We obtain similar results using World Bank governance indicators for government

effectiveness (GOVT_EFFECT), political stability (POL_STAB), regulatory quality (REG_QUALITY),

rule of law (RULELAW_WGI), and voice (VOICE_ACCT). Not surprisingly, therefore, we also find

these results when using the average governance index (WDI_GOV_AVG). The standard deviation of the

average governance index across the whole sample is 0.369. As a result, an increase of one standard

deviation in the average governance index increases the stock-price reaction to cash acquisitions of public

firms by 66 basis points and increases the stock-price reaction for the whole sample by 23 basis points.

Another way to evaluate the economic significance of a change in the average governance index for the

acquirer’s country is that an increase of one standard deviation increases the acquirer’s gain by 14.97%

for the whole sample and by 60.65% for acquisitions of public firms paid for with cash.

    We then consider two variables that measure, respectively, whether a country has a law limiting

insider trading (IT_LAW) and whether that law is enforced (IT_ENF). Acquirer country enforcement has

                                                      21
a positive significant coefficient for the whole sample while target country enforcement has a negative

significant coefficient for the whole sample. The only significant coefficient for the existence of a law is a

negative significant coefficient for the indicator for the acquirer’s country for stock acquisitions of public

firms. A possible explanation for this result is that the signaling effect of an offer to acquire a public firm

for stock might be stronger in countries with less leakage due to insider trading.

    The next four variables are related to the economic and financial situation of the country of the

acquirer and target. We find no evidence that GDP per capita (GDP_PCAP) is related to acquirer gains in

acquisitions, which might appear surprising in light of the findings of Chari et al. (2010). However,

emerging countries have a number of common characteristics, so that acquirer returns from acquisitions

in such countries might be higher because they have lower country governance rather than because they

have lower GDP per capita. Greater stock market capitalization of the acquiring country

(MKTCAP_GDP) is unrelated to acquisition gains except for a negative coefficient for acquisitions of

private firms paid for with equity. The stock market capitalization of the target country has a negative

coefficient   for   the   whole     sample.    Stock    market    turnover    of     the   acquirer’s   country

(CTRY_STK_TURNOVER) has a positive coefficient for acquisitions of public firms paid for with

equity and a negative coefficient for acquisitions of subsidiaries. The target’s country stock market

turnover is never significant. We then use a country’s stock return in the year preceding the acquisition

(CTRY_RET_1YR). This variable is never significant for the country of the acquirer; the stock return of

the country of the target has a positive significant coefficient for stock acquisitions of public firms. Lastly,

we consider the impact of the liberalization intensity index (LIB_INT_AVG). In interpreting the results

for this variable, it is important to be aware that relatively few countries in the sample have acquisitions

made when their liberalization intensity index is below one (only four acquisitions of public firms paid for

with equity and only 40 acquisitions of public firms paid for with cash). The index has a positive

significant coefficient for acquisitions of public firms, but a negative significant coefficient for

acquisitions of subsidiaries. The coefficient is not significant for other types of acquisitions. This

evidence would suggest that acquirers of countries with no barriers to international portfolio investment

                                                       22
have higher returns when they acquire public firms. The index for the target country is not significant

except for acquisitions of private firms paid for with equity. The Adler and Dumas (1975) theory would

imply that acquirers would gain more from acquisitions in countries that have barriers to international

investment. None of our results are consistent with that prediction.

    Finally, we consider regressions with firm governance characteristics. We find that acquirer abnormal

returns increase significantly with insider ownership (INSIDE_PCT) for the whole sample and all

acquisition types but acquisitions of private firms. The standard deviation of insider ownership across our

sample is 23.16%. As a result, a one standard deviation increase in insider ownership increases the stock-

price reaction by 27 basis points for the whole sample and by 59 basis points for the sample of

acquisitions of public firms for cash. Roughly, therefore, the impact on the stock-price reaction of a one

standard deviation increase in insider ownership is approximately the same as the impact of a one

standard deviation increase in the average country governance index. Restricting the sample to foreign

firms only, we use an indicator variable for whether a firm has an ADR program (ADR). For the whole

sample, the existence of an ADR program is negatively associated with the acquirer return and positively

associated with the existence of an ADR program for the target firm. Acquirers of public firms with ADR

programs have marginally lower returns (p-value of 0.10) when they make acquisitions financed with

equity using the sample of non-U.S. acquirers and targets. This result may simply reflect the better

information environment of ADR firms (e.g., Bailey, Karolyi, and Salva, 2006), so that issuance of equity

has more signaling value.



5.2. Regressions using multiple country characteristics

    We now turn to multiple regressions. The concern with the regressions of Table 3 is that country

governance could derive its significance from its correlation with other variables. Further, we know from

our earlier discussion that there are good reasons for financial development and economic development,

which are correlated with country governance, to affect abnormal returns. For instance, even though GDP

per capita is not significant in Table 3, it could be that country governance is significant only because it

                                                     23
partly proxies for GDP per capita. We therefore estimate regressions with country governance where we

control for economic and financial development. Our proxy for economic development is GDP per capita;

the proxy for economic development is the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP. We see in Panel A

of Table 4 that, when controlling for economic and financial development, country governance remains

significant for the whole sample and for cash acquisitions of public firms, but also becomes significant for

private firm acquisitions paid for with cash.

    The regression estimates of model (1) are for the whole sample and show that country governance

remains significant when we control for financial and economic development. It is interesting to note that

while GDP per capita is not significant in Table 3, GDP per capita of the target country is positive and

significant for the whole sample in Table 4. This is further evidence that acquisitions in emerging markets

may have higher acquirer returns not because these countries are poorer, but because they have poorer

governance.

    We estimate the same regression for each type of acquisition in models (2) to (6) of Panel A of Table

4. The coefficient on country governance of the acquiring firm is significantly positive for acquisitions of

public and private firms paid for with cash. The country governance of the target firm is significantly

negative for acquisitions of public firms paid for with cash and of private firms paid for with equity. GDP

per capita of the target has a positive significant coefficient for acquisitions of subsidiaries and

acquisitions of private firms. There is no evidence that acquirers gain more from acquisitions in countries

with lower GDP per capita.

    Though we do not reproduce the results in a table, we also investigate regressions where we use

accounting transparency (ACCOUNT), the securities law index (SEC_LAW), and the anti-self-dealing

index (ANTI_SD). In these regressions, accounting transparency of the acquirer has a positive significant

coefficient and accounting transparency of the target country has a negative significant coefficient for the

whole sample. Further, the anti-self-dealing index of the acquirer’s country has a significant negative

coefficient and the coefficient on securities laws of the target is significantly positive. The negative

coefficient on the anti-self-dealing index is solely due to acquisitions of public firms paid for with equity.

                                                     24
In another set of regressions, we use as country characteristics the country stock market return, the index

of political stability, and the level of GDP as a proxy for country size. We find that the country return of

the target is positively significant and the political stability of the target is negatively significant. The

coefficient on the country return of the target is driven by acquisitions of public firms paid for with stock.

    We re-estimate the regressions of Table 4 with the product of the anti-director index and the rule of

law index (SHARE_PROTECT) for both the target and acquirer added as explanatory variables, but do

not report these regressions in a table. For the whole sample, the coefficient on SHARE_PROTECT is

insignificant for the acquirer’s country and for the target’s country. The acquirer’s country coefficient is

negative and significant in acquisitions of public firms for equity. The target’s country coefficient is

positive and significant in acquisitions of private firms for cash.

    Table 3 shows that bidder insider ownership is positively related to bidder returns. We re-estimate the

regressions of Panel A of Table 4 with insider ownership of the acquirer (INSIDE_PCT) as an

explanatory variable. Doing so reduces the size of the whole sample by a quarter. Yet, as shown in Panel

B of Table 4, the coefficients on the country governance indices are significant and the ownership

variable has a coefficient of 0.0149 that is significant at the one-percent level for the whole sample. The

coefficient on insider ownership is positive and significant for all types of acquisitions except acquisitions

of private firms. The coefficient on acquirer-country governance is positive and significant in all cases

except for acquisitions of public firms paid for with equity and of subsidiaries.

    Since La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (2002), the literature has examined whether

insider ownership mitigates the adverse impact of poor laws or poor country governance. We find some

evidence (but do not tabulate it) that greater insider ownership reduces the adverse impact of worse

country governance. We estimate regressions with acquirer country governance, acquirer insider

ownership, and an interaction between insider ownership and country governance. If insider ownership

mitigates the adverse impact of poor country governance, we expect that interaction to have a negative

coefficient. For acquisitions of private firms, we find that all three coefficients – i.e., the signs on

ownership, governance, and the interaction – have the predicted sign. For the whole sample and the

                                                      25
acquisitions of public firms paid for with cash, all three variables have the predicted sign, but the

interaction is never significant. We repeat the exercise with the anti-director index. The interaction is

negative and significant only for acquisitions of public firms with equity. In all other cases, the interaction

is insignificant.

    We next estimate all the regressions discussed so far controlling for the firm and deal characteristics

described earlier. We do not report these regressions in a table. We lose about one quarter of observations

in the regressions that use these characteristics. For the whole sample, we find that the acquisition return

increases in the relative size of the acquisition, falls in the size of the acquirer, and falls if the acquisition

is a tender offer. The results are consistent with results for U.S. domestic acquisitions and therefore firm

and deal characteristics do not appear to play a significantly different role for cross-border acquisitions.

For the various types of acquisitions, the signs of these coefficients are generally consistent, but not

always significant. No other deal or firm characteristic is consistently significant. The estimates for the

country characteristics are generally consistent with the estimates discussed earlier, but they sometimes

lose significance as firm characteristics are correlated with country characteristics for reasons discussed

earlier.



6. How important are countries in acquirer returns?

    We turn to assessing the economic importance of global versus country effects. We have seen that the

country governance of the acquiring (target) firm is positively (negatively) related to the acquirer return

and these results are economically significant. In these regressions, we use as regressors year and industry

indicator variables as well as country characteristics. We therefore investigate the relative explanatory

power of year and industry indicator variables compared to country characteristics. Because the

coefficients on year and industry indicator variables are determined globally, we consider them to

represent global factors in the determination of acquirer returns.

    In Table 5, we present regressions using year, industry, and country indicator variables for the whole

sample and for each acquisition type. By definition, the coefficient of the acquirer country indicator

                                                       26
variable measures the impact of the acquirer’s country on the acquisition return. We are interested in the

explanatory power of the indicator variables. This is best measured by the R-squared of regressions that

have different subsets of these explanatory variables. We estimate five regressions for each sample:

calendar year dummies only, country dummies only, industry dummies only, target country dummies

only, and all indicator variables in one regression. We only include countries and industries with five

acquisitions at least. We only show the R-squared of each regression, the p-value for an F-test of the joint

significance of the indicator variables, and the number of observations. The first set of regressions in

Table 5 is for the sample as a whole. It is immediately apparent that together the year of an acquisition

and the industry of the acquirer explain more than the country of the acquirer. However, the country of

the target explains about the same as all these variables together. It follows that the global effects

dominate the acquirer country effects.

    We estimate the same regressions for each type of acquisition as well. In all cases except for

acquisitions of private firms paid for with cash, year and industry indicator variables explain more than

acquirer country indicator variables. Further, it is always the case that the country of the target is more

informative than the country of the acquirer. Strikingly, for acquisitions of public firms paid for with cash

none of the sets of indicator variables are significant. For acquisitions of public firms paid for with stock,

the industry indicator variables are jointly significant. The year, industry, and target country indicator

variables are each jointly significant for acquisitions of subsidiaries, but the acquirer country indicator

variables are not jointly significant. Similar results hold for acquisitions of private firms for cash. Finally,

with acquisitions of private firms for equity, the indicator variables for the acquirer’s country are jointly

significant, but the year and industry indicator variables are not significant.

    Another way to identify the existence of a global effect on acquirer returns is as follows. For each

sample, we measure the average acquirer return for acquisitions made in other countries in the same year.

We then estimate a regression of acquirer returns on the acquirer returns for the same type of acquisitions

in other countries during the same year, which we refer to as GLOBAL_EFFECT. The results for this

analysis are reported in Table 6. The coefficient on GLOBAL_EFFECT is positive and significant for the

                                                      27
whole sample and for the sub-samples of acquisitions of private firms and subsidiaries. For the whole

sample, a one standard deviation increase in the average acquirer CAR outside a country leads to an

increase in the average CAR in the country of 24 basis points. The coefficient is insignificant for

acquisitions of public firms. These results show that the acquirer gains in a given year are higher when the

gains made on similar acquisitions by acquirers in other countries are higher, so that there is a global

factor in the gains from acquisitions. The regression models in Table 6 include industry indicator

variables (not reported), but the results are robust to excluding these.



7. How important are countries in cross-border acquisition intensity?

    We have shown that country governance has an economically significant effect on the returns from

cross-border acquisitions. We have also shown that global effects play an important role in acquirer

returns. In this section, we examine whether country governance affects the frequency of acquisitions in

our sample. The sample we have used so far requires the deal value to be known. As we saw, this sample

reduces the sample size considerably. To evaluate the determinants of the frequency of acquisitions, this

sample suffers from a selection bias. Therefore, we consider in this section a sample of acquisitions that

does not require deal value to be reported in SDC as well as the restricted sample we have considered so

far. The less restrictive sample includes acquisitions by private firms as well, but it only includes control

acquisitions, so our results are not directly comparable with those of studies that include partial

acquisitions. This sample is much larger as it includes 45,875 acquisitions. Slightly more than 21,412 of

these acquisitions are by private firms.

    We estimate regressions of the frequency of acquisitions relative to the number of listed firms in a

country (effectively, the number of firms with returns on Datastream). Since these regressions are

estimated using country-level data, we cannot use the industry indicator variable and therefore we only

use calendar year indicator variables as our global variables. We use as our country variables the country

governance index, GDP per capita, the index for liberalization intensity, the index for securities laws, the



                                                      28
anti-self-dealing index, the country’s market capitalization to GDP ratio, and the country’s stock return in

the previous year. We report the results in Table 7.

    The first regression uses the sample without restrictions. We find a very strong effect of the country

governance index (WDI_GOV_AVG) on the frequency of cross-border acquisitions. In contrast, none of

the other variables are significant. Though we do not reproduce the results in the table, we also estimate

model (1) without GDP per capita and without the country governance index. The country governance

index has roughly the same coefficient when GDP per capita is not included in the regression. When the

country governance index is not included, GDP per capita is significant at the 5% level with a coefficient

of 0.0035. These results suggest that when the country governance index is not included in the regression,

GDP per capita proxies for that index. Strikingly, when we omit the country governance index the

adjusted R-squared drops from 0.43 to 0.30. In contrast, it essentially does not change when we omit GDP

per capita. We also estimate the model without year indicator variables. When we do so, the coefficient

on the country governance index is not affected. None of the other variables are significant. Model (2) is

for the acquisitions that meet the sample requirements of the earlier section. We see again that the country

governance index is the only significant variable. However, the coefficient on that index is much lower.

Again, GDP per capita has no explanatory power. We then estimate the regressions for the different

acquisition types omitting the GDP per capita. The governance index is significant with a positive

coefficient in each of the regression specifications. The stock market capitalization variable is significant

and positive for acquisitions of public firms for cash. Finally, the country return is not significant for

acquisitions of private firms and subsidiaries when we omit the year indicator variables (not reported in

the table). The year indicator variables explain much less for acquisitions of subsidiaries and private firms

paid for with cash. The adjusted R-squared falls by more than half when these variables are omitted for

acquisitions of public and private firms paid for with stock. Furthermore, the adjusted R-squared falls by

almost 40% for acquisitions of public firms paid for with cash.




                                                       29
    These regressions show that the country governance is an important determinant of control-

acquisition frequency. It affects all types of acquisitions and no other widely used country characteristic is

significant in our sample.



8. Conclusion

    In this paper, we examine how the gains to shareholders from investments are related to country and

firm-level governance using a sample of cross-border acquisitions from 61 countries from 1990 to 2007.

We find that the gains to acquirers increase with the acquirer’s country governance and fall with the

target’s country governance. Further, firms in countries with better country governance make more

acquisitions. In addition, the stock-price reaction to acquisition announcements increases with the

acquirer’s insider ownership but, to some extent, more so in countries with weaker governance. Whereas

our governance variables have an economically significant relation with acquirer returns showing that

firms benefit from better country governance, we find no evidence that other country characteristics have

a reliable systematic relation with acquirer returns across acquisition types.           However, both the

accounting transparency and the anti-self-dealing indices are positively related to the stock-price reaction

to cash acquisitions of public firms and the coefficient estimates are highly significant.

    Though country governance is an important determinant of stock-price reactions to acquisition

announcements, we find that the importance of country characteristics is surprisingly limited. In

particular, the year of an acquisition and the industry of an acquirer typically explain more of the

abnormal return than the country of the acquirer. Since the coefficients on year and industry indicator

variables are estimated across the whole sample, they reflect global factors. We find further evidence that

global factors influence stock-price reactions in that acquirers in a country earn less through acquisitions

of private firms and subsidiaries when acquirers in other countries earn less as well. All this evidence

points to the fact that the market for cross-border acquisitions is a global market, but acquirers from

countries with better governance have an intrinsic advantage in that market.

                       designed to represent the overall market portfolio for each country,
                       whereas the IFC Investable index is designed to represent a portfolio
                       of domestic equities that are available to foreign investors. A ratio of
                       one means that all of the stocks are available to foreign investors (see
                       e.g., Bekaert (1995); Edison and Warnock (2003)).

                    Cumulative Abnormal Announcement Returns
This table provides mean cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) measured from two days
prior to two days after the acquisition announcement for the sample of domestic [A] and
cross-border [B] deals. CAR is calculated using the market model, where the parameters
are estimated over the period starting 205 days to 6 days prior to the announcement using
the world index from Datastream as the regressor in the market model. All event returns
are winsorized at the .5% and 99.5% level. The number of observations [N] and CAR are
reported for the full sample and the following subsamples: Public targets paid for with cash,
public targets paid for with stock, subsidiary targets paid for with cash, private targets paid
for with cash, and private targets paid for with stock. The mean difference in CAR between
domestic and cross-border deals is reported with its p-value, where * indicates significance
at the ten-percent level.

                             Single Country-Characteristic Regression Analysis
This table reports for each country characteristic listed and defined in the Appendix, the regression
coefficient on the country characteristic for the acquirer’s country and for the target’s country, the p-value
for the coefficient [in brackets], the number of observations [N], and the adjusted R-squared [AR2] of an
ordinary least squares regression. Each regression includes besides one country characteristic at a time,
controls for calendar year and the main industry classifications from Kahle and Walkling (1996) of the
acquirer. Regression residuals are clustered by country. Statistical significance of the country
characteristic regression coefficient is denoted with ***, **, or * for p-values less than one percent, five
percent, and ten-percent respectively.

                             Multivariate Regression Analysis
This table presents the regression coefficients for OLS regression models where the
dependent variable is the acquirer return and the independent variables are measures for
governance, financial development, and economic development (see Appendix for
definitions) in Panel A and the same regressions with insider ownership in Panel B. Each
regression includes industry indicator variables based on the main industry classifications
from Kahle and Walking (1996). Regression residuals are clustered by country. Statistical
significance of the regression coefficients is denoted with ***, **, or * for p-values less
than one percent, five percent, and ten-percent respectively.

                                    Global Effect Regressions
This table presents the regression coefficients for OLS regression models where the
dependent variable is the acquirer return and the independent variable is the average
acquirer return for acquisitions of the same type made in other countries in the same year
(GLOBAL_EFFECT). Each regression includes industry indicator variables based on the
main industry classifications from Kahle and Walking (1996). Regression residuals are
clustered by country. Statistical significance of the regression coefficients is denoted with
***, **, or * for p-values less than one percent, five percent, and ten-percent respectively.

                                             Frequency Regressions
This table presents the coefficients and p-values for OLS regression models where the dependent variable
is the frequency of acquisitions relative to the number of listed firms in a country (based on the number of
firms with return data on Datastream). Variable definitions are in the Appendix. Model (1) is for the
unrestricted sample from SDC including cases with missing deal values and private acquirers. Models (2)
through (7) use the sample of deals by public acquirers for which deal value is available. Each regression
includes calendar year indicator variables (not reported). N is the number of observations based on
country-year observations. Statistical significance of the regression coefficients is denoted with ***, **,
or * for p-values less than one percent, five percent, and ten-percent respectively.
