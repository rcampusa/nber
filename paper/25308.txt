Taking Time Use Seriously: Income, Wages And Price Discrimination
Daniel S. Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle
NBER Working Paper No. 25308
November 2018
JEL No. J15,J22

                                        ABSTRACT

The American Time Use Survey 2003-15, the French Enquête Emploi du Temps, 2009-10, and
the German Zeitverwendungserhebung, 2012-13, have sufficient observations to allow examining
the theory of household production in much more detail than ever before. We identify income
effects on time use by non-workers, showing that relatively time-intensive commodities—sleep
and TV-watching—are inferior. For workers we identify income and substitution effects
separately, with both in the same direction on these commodities as the income effects among
non-workers. We rationalize the results by generalizing Becker’s (1965) “commodity production”
model, allowing both substitution between time and goods in household production and
substitution among commodities in utility functions. We then use the evidence of price
discrimination in product markets against minorities in the U.S. and immigrants in France to
motivate an extension of the model that predicts how household production differs between
members of these groups and the majority. We find the predicted results—minorities engage in
more time-intensive activities, sleep and TV-watching, than otherwise identical majority-group
members.

       I.        Introduction—Economic Variables in Time Use

            The literature on time use is immense; but due to the paucity of available data allowing

identification of income and price effects, few attempts have been made to take Becker’s (1965)

“commodity production” model seriously as a guide to empirical work, in the sense of deriving and testing

the implications of an explicitly specified model (Kooreman and Kapteyn, 1987; Biddle and Hamermesh,

1990; and recently Blundell et al., 2018). With the recent accumulation in several countries of very large

collections of time diaries, this problem can now be vitiated. These data reveal strong empirical regularities

in the relationship between household income and quantitatively important categories of time use. We show

that a straightforward generalization of Becker’s model provides a simple rationalization of these

regularities.

            The data also allow testing an implication of the theory of time use about how behavior is affected

by discrimination. Literatures measuring the extent of discrimination along such dimensions as race,

ethnicity and gender are immense; and there are burgeoning literatures measuring the amount of

discrimination by sexual orientation, disability status, appearance and other characteristics.1 With the

exception of the fairly large literature on racial differences in consumption/saving behavior, consideration

of how discrimination affects the behavior of the agents who are discriminated against is rare. 2 Even the

few studies that examine these effects concentrate only on how agents’ behavior in market(s) where they

are discriminated against is altered by the discrimination that they face in those markets. Missing

completely is any research on how discrimination in one market affects the behavior of disadvantaged

agents in a different market or area of activity— how discrimination spills over across markets. Within the

context of the theory of household production we examine one spillover, namely how racial/ethnic

differences in the allocation of time are affected by racially discriminatory pricing in product markets.

    Among the few studies that make this at least part of their analyses is Parsons et al. (2011).

                                                              1
             We begin by discussing the sets of time diaries used in this study, those for the U.S., France and

Germany. With these data we present broad-based evidence of a negative relationship between income and

two quantitatively important uses of time: sleep and television watching, both of which are “time-intensive”

commodities. One obvious explanation for this relationship was provided by Becker (1965): rising worker

productivity would increase the opportunity cost of time, thus raising the relative prices of time- to goods-

intensive commodities, inducing substitution away from the former and towards the latter. In most models

using this framework, however, all time uses except market work are “normal”, so that there is an income

effect that works against this substitution effect, even for time-intensive commodities. Also, the explanation

does not account for the possible existence of this pattern among non-workers, for whom income

differences cannot result from wage differences.

             In Section III we use samples of workers to estimate separately the income and substitution effects

on time spent sleeping and television watching, along with effects on two activities that are likely to be

goods-intensive—eating away from home, and attending museums, sporting events and concerts. In Section

IV we explain the empirical results by developing a model that allows substitution between goods and time

in the production of commodities and between commodities in agents’ utility functions. The model

identifies a broad range of circumstances under which non-workers will respond to higher incomes, and

workers to higher wages, by substituting more goods-intensive commodities for more time-intensive

commodities in consumption and using more goods-intensive technologies of household production, in

keeping with the empirical results presented in Sections II and III. The model also suggests a hypothesis

regarding racial/ethnic differences in time use, and Section V develops and tests this hypothesis using the

American and French data.

       II.       Data Sets and Estimates of Income Effects

             With the creation of the ongoing American Time Use Survey (ATUS) in 2003, we now have over

170,000 one-day diaries of people’s short-term recollections of how they spend their time. 3 With a sampling

    See Hamermesh et al. (2005) for a discussion of the characteristics of this data set.


                                                              2
frame based on previous respondents to the Current Population Survey, the ATUS also provides information

on a wide array of demographic characteristics and on family incomes. Minorities account for around 25

percent of the U.S. population. Thus this sample is also sufficiently large to allow the examination of

racial/ethnic differences in time use. For that purpose, we divide the sample into the following three

mutually exclusive groups: African-Americans, white Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics. 4

         In 2009-10 France fielded its fourth roughly decennial national time-diary study, the Enquête

Emploi du Temps 2009-2010 (INSÉÉ, 2014). This survey collected nearly 28,000 diaries containing large

amounts of demographic and other information on people ages 10 or over throughout France, located in

roughly 12,000 households. Unlike the ATUS each person in the Enquête was asked to complete two one-

day diaries, filling each out for 10-minute intervals from Midnight through 11:59PM on the previous day. 5

There is no information on race/ethnicity in this data set; but respondents are categorized by immigrant

status, and nearly 8 percent were immigrants. We analogize this demographic characteristic to race/ethnicity

in the U.S.

         In its third roughly decennial time-diary study the German Statistical Office fielded the

Zeitverwendungserhebung over five quarters in 2012 and 2013. The survey asked respondents to complete

diaries on three separate days, with slightly heavier sampling of weekends than weekdays. As with the

French survey, respondents were asked to provide their activities in fixed intervals of time, and nearly

25,000 time diaries were collected (Statistiches Bundesamt, 2015). We present detailed descriptions of the

construction of the aggregates of time use in this and the other two data sets in the Data Appendix. 6




4
 African-American is defined as anyone who reports being of a single race, African-American, or who lists two races,
with African-American being one of them. White Hispanic is anyone who is not African-American and who lists
his/her ethnicity as Hispanic. White non-Hispanic is any else who lists his/her sole racial affiliation as white. We
exclude Asian-Americans and the other very small racial groups.
5
 This contrasts with the ATUS, in which respondents were asked to note the exact time that they began each new
activity and to describe its nature so that it could be coded into one of the over 400 categories describing time use.
6
 This data set and the ATUS present daily totals of time spent in each individual activity. The Enquête presents the
activity undertaken in each ten-minute interval of the day, which we then aggregate across the diary day.

                                                          3
        Our focus is on the economic measures in these surveys, wages and incomes, so we need to be clear

about how these are measured. In the ATUS, as in the CPS currently, household income is listed in 16

brackets. We assign mid-points to the closed intervals and assign 1.5 times the top-coded amount to the

highest, open interval. We compute the hourly wage rate (available only for those currently employed) as

usual weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours and exclude workers with computed hourly wages

below $5 or above $150. The French income data are continuous measures with no top-coding, and can

thus be used as presented. We compute the hourly wage as monthly earnings divided by 4.33 times weekly

hours, using the same disqualifiers (in euros) as with the U.S. data. The German data set presents household

incomes and monthly earnings in only five brackets, creating a very high positive correlation between them

across individuals. For that reason, and also because its sample of immigrants is small, we only include the

German data in the examination of income effects among non-workers. In each data set, when we examine

workers’ behavior, we include the hourly wage measure and define non-labor income as the household’s

income less the worker’s earnings.

        A frequent division of time use is into four categories: Paid work, home production, personal time

and leisure. Sleep predominates in personal care, and television-watching is the predominant leisure

activity. Sleep and television watching are both relatively time-intensive (Gronau and Hamermesh, 2007),

so that their responses to income and price differences may make them non-aggregable with other personal

and leisure activities. Thus, in each of the three data sets we divide personal care into sleep and other

personal care, and leisure into TV-watching and other leisure activities.

        Table 1 lists statistics describing the six categories of time use for each of two samples in each of

the three data sets: All diaries for which the respondent reported no usual hours of work, no work on the

diary day and no usual earnings (non-workers); and all diaries for which the respondent reported usually

working and working on the day of the diary (workers). The statistics and estimates throughout are

calculated using the sampling weights. The means in Table 1 accord with what is generally known about

time use and its differences across countries. On workdays work time (of workers) and sleep time are about

equal in all three countries. Workers sleep less on workdays than do non-workers, and watch much less

                                                     4
television. In all categories Americans watch more television than the Europeans, especially among non-

workers. Averaging across all households in the samples, household incomes track the national averages

quite closely.

        For each of the three samples of non-workers we estimate equations describing the responses of

each of the five non-work aggregates of time use to changes in household income. Large vectors of

demographic controls are included in each equation. While they necessarily differ across the three samples

because of differences in the available information, in all cases they include indicators of gender and marital

(coupled) status and their interaction, a quadratic in age, indicators of the numbers and ages of young

children, and vectors of indicators of educational attainment, and the year, month and day of the week for

which the diary was kept. They also include state in the U.S., and region in France.

        Table 2 presents estimates of the impact of a $10,000 (€10,000) increase in annual income, far less

than one standard deviation in each case, on the minutes of time spent in each activity on a representative

day. These are pure income effects, since the samples are restricted to respondents who report no usual

work hours, do not work on the diary day and have no earnings. Because of the adding-up requirement, for

each country the five estimated income effects sum to zero.

        While there are some variations across the three countries, there are remarkable similarities: 1)

Sleep and television-watching are uniformly inferior; and in each data set TV-watching is the most

relatively inferior commodity. The impacts of income on sleep are very close in the three data sets; 2) Other

leisure activities are uniformly superior and constitute the most relatively superior aggregate in each

sample; 3) The estimated impacts of increased income on the other two aggregates, home production and

other personal activities, are not uniformly positive or negative.

        If we re-estimate these equations excluding any variable that might possibly be considered

endogenous, leaving only the respondent’s age and the year, month and day of the diary, in the U.S. all the

estimated income effects become larger in absolute value; most are also larger in the French data, but in the

German data the changes are mixed. Another alternative is to estimate this model separately for married



                                                      5
individuals, including their spouse’s age and education (the same coding as for the respondent’s

demographic characteristics). This re-specification hardly changes the estimates. 7

         One might be concerned that non-workers’ choices are constrained by the activities of other family

members’ working and perhaps even by the time allocations of non-family members (Goux et al., 2017).

Because of the size of the ATUS sample, we can get some insight into this potential problem by examining

time allocation on public holidays by both non-workers and workers who do not work on the holiday (even

in the U.S., most workers). The second part of the upper panel in Table 2 presents the same equations as

before, but estimated over the reduced sample of 2,050 people who are not working on the holiday for

which they recorded a time diary. The estimates are remarkably similar to those for the entire sample of

non-workers; and they differ little if we restrict the sample still further to include only those of non-workers

who kept diaries on holidays.

         In much of the following we focus on the two activities, sleeping and TV-watching. These are

hardly ever considered in the economics literature, no doubt because information on them is only available

in time-diary surveys. Yet, at least in the three countries examined here, they are the primary activities that

are the first and third-most important among the hundreds of ways that the data sets classify time use; and

together the average person in each country spends over ten hours per day engaged in these two activities.

         We simulate income effects on these two uniformly inferior activities by calculating changes in

time spent in response to increases in family incomes from one standard deviation below the mean to one

standard deviation above. In the U.S. this increase would reduce the non-worker’s sleep time by 20 minutes

per night (4 percent), and his/her TV-watching time by 28 minutes (12 percent). In France it would reduce


7
 Another possible concern is that some of the respondents may be more willing and available to complete a diary and
may do so differently from others. We do not have information on the difficulty of obtaining an ATUS respondent’s
diary; but we do know how difficult it was to contact them in their eighth month in the CPS. Dividing the sample by
this measure and re-estimating the equations for the U.S. in Table 2 yielded no significant differences among the three
sub-samples. Yet another concern might be that, despite restricting the samples to respondents who stated that their
usual work hours are zero and that they did no work on the diary day, perhaps they are still attached to the labor force.
To circumvent this potential difficulty, we re-estimate the equations for sleep and TV-watching on those non-workers
who are at least at the age of eligibility for a public pension. In all three countries the parameter estimates remain
statistically significant and negative, with the main change being that the difference in the impact of additional
unearned income in the U.S. on sleep time becomes even smaller relative to that on TV-watching.


                                                           6
non-workers’ sleeping by 12 minutes (2 percent) and TV-watching by 28 minutes (17 percent). In Germany

the analogous decreases are 12 minutes (2 percent) of sleeping and 20 minutes (12 percent) of TV-watching.

While both commodities are inferior, in all three data sets TV-watching is markedly more income elastic

than sleep. Physical limitations make it difficult to switch away from sleeping when incomes rise, although

some switching is apparently possible. No such limitations exist to choosing to watch less television when

more goods can be purchased; and people do substitute strongly against this activity in response to pure

increases in income.

III. Wage and Income Effects on Workers’ Time Use

         To estimate income and wage effects for workers, we re-specify the equations estimated in Table

2, adding the hourly wage rate and replacing household income by household income minus the worker’s

earnings. 8 Because of the long history of focus in the labor-supply literature on women’s labor supply, we

estimate the models of time use separately by gender. Other than that, the control variables are the same as

those included in the equations underlying Table 2. The sample consists of all days reported by workers

who indicate that they engaged in some market work in the week preceding the diary day and in some work

on the diary day. We restrict the estimation to married (in France, coupled) to avoid including workers

whose income is nearly entirely their own earnings.

         The upper panel of Table 3 shows estimates of the impacts of increases in other household income

(again in $10,000 units) and the worker’s hourly earnings (in $10 units, slightly less than one standard

deviation) on time spent in the two time-intensive activities, sleep and TV-watching, in the ATUS. 9 Both

activities respond negatively to increases in the price of the worker’s time. In these specifications the pure




8
 We treat all other income the same rather than separating out partners’ earnings from unearned income. Because the
ATUS only collects one diary per household, we cannot examine cross-wage effects on time use within partnered
couples, so that a further disaggregation of household incomes would not be fruitful.

9
 Estimates of the effects of these variables on time spent in the other four major uses of time are presented in the
Appendix for the U.S. and France. For purposes of comparison to other studies, the implied elasticities of labor supply
(at the intensive margin) are +0.02 for men, +0.06 for women.


                                                          7
income effects are much below those for non-workers in Table 2, and, except for women’s TV-watching,

not significantly nonzero. 10

         A large literature has demonstrated the inelasticity of men’s labor supply and the decreasing

elasticity of women’s in the U.S. as well (Heim, 2007). While paid work time is obviously endogenous,

treating it as fixed in estimating these equations is not a large departure given its relative wage inelasticity,

especially in the literature examining the intensive margin. The bottom panel of Table 3 thus estimates the

demand equations for sleep and TV-watching holding work time constant. Except for women’s sleep time

the estimated effects of increases in hourly earnings change little from the upper panel. All the income

effects, however, become negative, with three of them becoming statistically significant; but their

magnitudes are still quite small, especially compared to the wage effects.

         The estimates include all workers, of whom slightly more than half are paid hourly, and thus have

a specified hourly wage, and of whom the other half are salaried and whose hourly wage we calculated as

the ratio of usual weekly earnings to usual weekly hours. Excluding salaried workers from the estimates

might increase the reliability of the results (at the expense of cutting the sample in half) by removing

possible division-bias in the wage variable. Re-estimating the models summarized in Table 3 without

salaried workers, however, produces only minor changes in the parameter estimates.

         We present estimates of the same equations for France in Table 4, again for all those who report

some paid work during the week and who work on the diary day. With sub-samples less than one-sixth the

sizes of the American sub-samples, we cannot expect the same significance of the parameter estimates.

Nonetheless, whether we hold paid work time constant or not, we do find substantial negative income

effects among workers, especially on time spent watching television. None of the wage effects is

statistically significant, but the largest are positive. The estimated wage effects contrast with those for the

U.S., which tended to be significant. A general conclusion from these tables is that pure income effects on

workers’ time spent sleeping and TV-watching are negative.


10
  Some indirect corroborative evidence on these effects is provided by Aguiar et al. (2013), who use the implied cuts
in wages and incomes during the Great Recession to examine time spent in sleep and TV-watching.

                                                         8
        As with the results for non-workers in Table 2, here too we re-estimate the models first with only

age and the year, month and day indicators, and with the two monetary measures included. The changes are

similar to those when we re-specified the models estimated in Table 2: The absolute values of the effects,

of both wages and incomes, generally become larger. Also, as in Table 2, when we include the spouse’s

demographic characteristics, the essential results change only slightly.

        We know that health is correlated with income, so that income or earnings may proxy for poor

health. And people in worse health may find the production of some commodities more difficult than others.

The ATUS has a measure of self-rated health for six of the years in our sample, and the Enquête has a

similar measure, with both on a 5 to 1 scale, from excellent in the ATUS (very good in the Enquête) to poor

(very bad). Those in worse self-rated health do spend more time both sleeping and eating in both samples.

Adding these indicators to the estimated equations does reduce the absolute values of the income effects in

the U.S. equations in Table 2, and of the wage and income effects in Table 3, but never by more than 25

percent. In the French data in Table 2, and in the results in Table 4, there are almost no changes.

        With the impacts on what we believe are the relatively time-intensive activities, sleep and TV-

watching, being generally negative, estimating similar equations describing variations in activities that we

might believe are relatively goods-intensive should give the opposite results. To examine this possibility,

we define the two activities, time spent eating away from home, and time spent attending sporting events,

museums, concerts, etc. (the latter only for the U.S., as the French data have very few observations with

positive amounts of time spent in such activities). Because neither of these activities is undertaken by more

than half the samples’ respondents, we estimate both a probit describing the incidence of the activity on the

diary day(s) and a conditional regression describing its intensity among those who spend any time on it.

        Table 5 presents the estimates of income effects in these equations, specified to include the same

controls as in Tables 2, 3 and 4. Income has a positive effect on the likelihood that an individual engages

in both these activities in the U.S., and in eating out in France. Income also has a positive effect on time

spent eating out for those who do report eating out in the U.S. The other two estimated effects of income

on the intensity of the activity are tiny, negative and statistically insignificant

                                                        9
IV. Income and Substitution Effects in Household Production

A. Background

         In this section we explore the extent to which the empirical regularities that we have demonstrated

for the time-intensive commodities of sleep and TV-watching are consistent with the Becker (1965) model.

A primary consideration is the nature of the income and substitution effects on various categories of time

use in such a model. From Becker (1965) to Gronau’s (1980) study and his survey (Gronau, 1986), one

finds occasional analyses of the impact of changes in wages and in non-labor income on various uses of

time; but the discussions are characterized by a lack of shared definitions and take place in the context of

models that assume fixed proportions for combining goods and time in household production. With fixed-

coefficient commodity production functions the effect of an increase in non-labor income on all the time

uses will generally be positive, while a compensated wage increase leads to a shift away from earnings-

intensive commodities and toward goods-intensive ones, where earnings intensity is measured by the share

of the total cost of a commodity represented by foregone earnings.

         There are a number of other relevant results in the literature, but none applies to non-workers.

Gronau (1986) asserts that for non-workers, or when work time is exogenous, “time scarcity depends upon

the individual’s income and his non-labor time. The higher his income and the smaller his non-labor time,

the greater the time scarcity and the shadow price of time. An increase in the shadow price of time should

raise the relative price of time-intensive commodities (i.e., commodities where ti/xi is high) and result in a

substitution of goods for time”, with ti/xi being the ratio of the marginal input requirements of time and

goods for commodity i. 11

         The negative effect of the wage on both sleep and TV-watching found here is consistent with

Becker’s result concerning the negative substitution effects on time-intensive commodities, and the


11
   A final relevant result is due to Deardorff and Stafford (1976), who show that with a homothetic utility function
defined over two commodities and linearly homogenous commodity production functions, the wage elasticity of labor
supply will be an increasing function of a weighted average of the elasticities of substitution of the production
functions and the utility function. If this weighted average is greater than one, the wage elasticity of labor supply will
be positive. Versions of this result have appeared in more recent papers proposing explanations of aggregate trends in
time use, including Kopecky (2011) and Aguiar and Hurst (2007).

                                                           10
negative effect of income on these activities for non-workers supports Gronau’s conjecture. In the absence

of an ad hoc assumption about the utility of sleep versus TV-watching, however, the model with fixed

coefficients cannot explain the finding that both the income and wage elasticities are larger in absolute

value for TV-watching than for sleep, as both activities are similarly time-intensive. For this reason, we

introduce, as a possible means of explaining the results, a generalization that allows for substitution between

goods and time in the production of commodities—abandoning fixed-coefficients production.

B. Model
        As in Becker (1965) ours is a one-period model in which individuals maximize utility defined over

m commodities Z1 ,..., Zm. Each commodity is produced by combining time and goods according to a

production function Zi = fi(Xi, Ti), where Xi is the expenditure on goods (and/or the service flow from

durable goods) used in the production of Zi, and Ti is time spent in producing Zi. For simplicity we assume

that “goods” is a Hicksian composite with price fixed at one and the same for all consumers, although we

relax this assumption in Section V below. We rule out joint production. Individuals can also devote time to

market work, receiving a wage rate w per unit of time. Market work does not directly affect utility or

contribute to the production of any of the commodities.

        In order to concentrate on the relationship between patterns of time allocation and the

characteristics of the commodity production functions, we specify a simple utility function:

        U = ∑ (Zi/γ)γ , γ < 1.

Each commodity is produced according to a commodity-specific CES production function Zi = [δiXiρ(i) +

(1-δi)Tiρ(i) ]1/ρ(i), where σi = 1/(1- ρi) is the elasticity of substitution between time and goods in the production

of commodity i. This set-up embodies three intuitively appealing properties: 1) Diminishing marginal

productivity and utility of money expenditure on each commodity; 2) Diminishing marginal productivity

and utility of time spent in each commodity; and 3) Decreasing returns to scale in utility for each

commodity.

         The assumption of no joint production leads to the standard budget constraint:

        I + w(T* - ∑Ti) = ∑Xi,

                                                         11
with I being non-labor income, T* total time available, and (T* - ∑Ti) time devoted to market work. The

first-order conditions for the individual’s maximization problem take the form:

        γδiρiXiρ(i)-1[δiXiρ(i) + (1-δi)Tiρ(i)]((γ-ρ(i))/γ) = λ for all i;                              (1a)

        γ(1-δi)ρiTiρ(i)-1[δiXiρ(i) + (1-δi)Tiρ(i)]((γ-ρ(i))/γ) ≥ λw for all i,                         (1b)

where λ is the Lagrangian multiplier on the goods budget constraint. Note that we assume that (1a) always

holds with equality, but that it is possible for the marginal utility of time to be greater than the marginal

utility of the wage rate, so that the individual chooses not to engage in market work. In that case, the problem

takes a different form, with maximization subject to two separate constraints: (T* - ∑Ti) = 0 and I = ∑Xi.

The first-order conditions become:

        γδiρiXiρ(i)-1[δiXiρ(i) + (1-δi)Tiρ(i)]((γ-ρ(i))/γ) =

                   γδkρkXkρ(k)-1[δkXkρ(k) + (1-δk)Tkρ(k)]((γ-ρ(k))/γ) for all i and k;                 (2a)

        γ(1-δi)ρiTiρ(i)-1[δiXiρ(i) + (1-δi)Tiρ(i)]((γ-ρ(i))/γ) =

                   γ(1-δk)ρkTkρ(k)-1[δkXkρ(k) + (1-δk)Tkρ(k)]((γ-ρ(k))/γ) for all i and k.             (2b)

        C. Wage and Income Effects on the Time Allocation of Workers

        Conditions (1a) and (1b) place restrictions on the expenditure per unit of time on each commodity:

        (δi/(1-δi))(Xi/Ti)ρ(i)-1 = (1/w)                                                               (3)

Equating the left-hand side of (1b) for commodity i to its counterpart for an arbitrarily chosen commodity

k, then using (3) to substitute for Xi and Xk in that expression, provides an equation in Ti and Tk:

        (1-δi)Ti(γ-1)[δi (δi/(1-δi))ρ(i)/(1-ρ(i))w ρ(i)/(ρ(i)-1) + (1-δi)](γ-ρ(i))/ρ(i) =

                   (1-δk)Tk(γ-1)[δk (δk/(1-δk))ρ(k)/(1-ρ(k))w ρ(k)/(ρ(k)-1) + (1-δk)](γ-ρ(k))/ρ(k)     (4)

Logarithmically differentiating (4) we obtain an expression that shows the relationship between the wage

and income elasticities of the time inputs into any pair of commodities i and k:

        dlnTi = dlnTk + Qki*dlnw, where:

        Qki = [ai(σu – σi) – ak(σu – σk)] = [(ai – ak)σu – aiσi +akσk] ,                               (5)

where ai = Xi/(Xi + wTi) is the share of money expenditures on commodity i in the total (opportunity) cost

of commodity i, and σu is the elasticity of substitution between commodities in the utility function. An

                                                                    12
immediate implication of (5) is that all uses of time have the same elasticity with respect to non-labor

income (i.e., (dlnTi/dlnI) = (dlnTk/dlnI). Whether the wage elasticity of one commodity is more or less

positive than that of another depends on the sign of Q, the determinants of which we discuss below.

         To obtain an expression for the wage elasticity of time spent on a commodity, logarithmically

differentiate the budget constraint, after using (3) to substitute out the Xi terms, then use (5) to replace the

dlnTi terms. This leads to

         dlnTk/dlnI = θI/(1+ (1-θI)Tw);                                                                      (6a)

         dlnTk/dlnw = {(1-θI) - ∑[si + (1-θI)ri]Qki - ∑siσi}/(1+ (1-θI)Tw),                                  (6b)

where θI is the share of non-labor income in total money income, si is the share of expenditure on commodity

i in total expenditures, and ri = (Ti/Tw) is the ratio of time spent on commodity i to time in market work.

         Equation (6a) shows the elasticity of time allocated to a commodity with respect to non-labor

income, which is positive and identical for all time uses. Equation (6b) is the wage elasticity. The first term

in its numerator is due to the income effect. The final term is a weighted average of the elasticities of

substitution for the various commodities and exerts the same negative influence on the wage elasticity for

all time uses. The middle term is different for each commodity, as it involves Qki which may be positive or

negative.

         Inspection of (5) and (6b) reveals four useful results:

     (1) If σu > σk (substitution away from commodity k in consumption is easy relative to
     substitution away from time in its production), dlnTk/dlnw is more positive for more goods-
     intensive commodities (those with higher ak values), and more negative for time-intensive
     commodities. 12
     (2) If σu < σk, dlnTk/dlnw is more negative for more-time intensive commodities, and more
     positive for goods-intensive commodities.




12
   In Becker’s (1965) model σk = 0, so this result is consistent with Becker’s result that that a compensated wage
increase will lead to a substitution of goods-intensive for time-intensive commodities. The value of ak is proportional
to the elasticity of output of Zk with respect to Xk, so that one could also describe the phenomenon as substituting
toward activities in which the marginal productivity of goods expenditure is higher.


                                                          13
     (3) Higher values of σu (easier substitution in consumption), make dlnTk/dlnw more negative
     for relatively time-intensive commodities, and more positive for relatively goods-intensive
     commodities
     (4) Higher values of σk (easier time-goods substitution in the production of commodity k)
     make dlnTk/dlnw more negative.
         A crucial distinction in the model is that between substitution in the production of the Z’s and

substitution in their consumption, which ultimately depends on how the commodities are defined. In

empirical work, however, the definitions adopted by researchers are often arbitrarily determined by the

nature of the available data. As time use and expenditure data grow in quantity and quality, it will

increasingly be possible and worthwhile to maintain the distinction between substitution within and

substitution across commodities, and to think in terms of the relative values of σu and the σi and their

differing impacts on time allocation. 13

D. Income Effects on the Time Allocation of Non-Workers

         The optimal allocations of time and expenditure to commodities by non-workers, and by those who

cannot vary their hours of work, are described by (2a) and (2b). For the former group, changes in the market

wage are not relevant to the time-allocation decision, provided that these changes are not sufficiently large

to induce entry into the labor force. For the latter group the elasticity of time spent on a commodity with

respect to a change in the wage is proportional to the elasticity with respect to a change in non-labor income.

Unlike the case for workers analyzed above, it is not possible for the income effect on time use to be positive

for all commodities. Unless the income elasticities of all uses of time are zero, there must be both positive

and negative elasticities.

         Deriving the elasticity of time use with respect to income from (2a) and (2b) leads to a complicated

expression from which little insight can be gleaned. In a two-commodity version of the model, however,




13
 For example, in an analysis of changes over time in how Americans have fed themselves, we could define an activity
“eating”, and discuss changing possibilities for substituting money for time within that activity by eating less at home
and more at fast-service restaurants.


                                                          14
the sign of the income elasticity of time use in commodity 1 is the sign of [a1(σu – σ1) – a2(σu – σ2)]. 14 This

expression is similar to Qki in the expression describing the time elasticities for workers, indicating that the

effect of a pure income change on the time allocation of non-workers resembles the substitution effect of a

wage change for workers. The reason for the resemblance is that a change in income for non-workers causes

a change in the relative opportunity costs of the activities, as is readily apparent in a version of the model

with fixed-coefficient production. 15 The same argument applies, mutatis mutandis, when the production

functions are CES. If the elasticity of substitution between commodities is greater than the elasticity of

substitution within commodities, a higher goods-intensity contributes to a more positive income elasticity.

If both commodities are equally goods-intensive, rising incomes will lead to a fall in time devoted to the

commodity with a higher elasticity of substitution in production.16

E. Explaining the Results on Sleep and TV-Watching

            The preceding analysis suggests explanations of the results for sleep and TV-watching reported in

Tables 2-4. Consider a three-commodity version of the model, with sleep, TV-watching and a composite

commodity. The first two are very time-intensive (low values of ai relative to the composite commodity),

which leads to more negative income effects for non-workers, and more negative wage effects for workers.

A high elasticity of substitution between commodities would amplify this effect, and these two factors

would explain the consistently negative and significant income effects for non-workers in Table 2 for both

sleep and TV-watching, as well as the predominance of negative wage effects for these activities for

American workers in Table 3. A plausible explanation for fact that the negative elasticities associated with



14
     The derivation is available from the second author.
15
  Letting bi represent the required goods input for a unit of Zi, and ti the required time input, the (utility) cost to the
non-worker of a unit of Zi relative to a unit of Zk is (λbi + μti)/(λbk + μtk). An increase in income lowers λ, which
lowers the relative cost of Zi if bi/ti > bk/tk, that is, if Zi is more goods intensive than Zk. In contrast, the relative prices
of the activities for workers (bi + wti)/(bk + wtk) are determined in the market and are thus unaffected by changes in
non-labor income.
16
  Simulations of the three-commodity version of the model confirm the indications of the two-commodity version. In
particular, with two very time-intensive commodities (say sleep and TV-watching), one commodity evenly balanced
between time and goods, and σi values that are small relative to σu and nearly equal to each other, rising incomes lead
to substitution away from the two time-intensive commodities and toward the goods-intensive commodity.

                                                              15
TV-watching are larger in absolute value than those associated with sleep is that the elasticity of substitution

in the production of TV-watching, that is, the ability to enhance the utility of the activity by increasing

expenditure per unit of time, is greater for TV-watching than for sleep.

        An additional assumption is required to rationalize the coefficients on non-labor income in Tables

3 and 4, as they are predominantly negative and occasionally significant, and no configuration of parameters

in our model leads to negative income effects for workers. If we assume, however, that an appreciable

number of the workers are temporarily or permanently constrained in their choices of work hours, then

negative income effects on workers become possible (and are consistent with the results in the bottom

panels of the two tables). The responses of workers who are hours-constrained, at least in the short-run, will

be the same as the responses predicted by the model for non-workers to increases in income: If substitution

between activities is easy, higher wages and higher incomes will cause hours-constrained workers to

decrease the time spent in time-intensive activities like TV-watching and sleep. Finally, the positive income

effects on eating out in Table 5 would follow from the relative goods intensity of the commodity and the

likely high elasticity of substitution between eating out and eating at home.

F. Additional Evidence on the Model

        In both production and consumption, the responses to changes in income will diminish in absolute

value as income rises, due to the shapes of the utility and household production functions, so long as the

latter are not characterized by fixed coefficients. To examine this, we add quadratic terms in income to the

equations estimated for the U.S. and France for which Table 2 presented the results. In both countries, and

for both sleep and TV-watching, the quadratic terms in income are positive and statistically significant, as

implied by the assumptions underlying the model.

        The alternating signs of the derivatives in the arguments of the utility and production functions also

suggest that the impacts of marginal changes in incomes or wages will be greater if the amounts

consumed/produced are less. Some evidence that these responses are reflected in the data is provided by

comparing income elasticities in the estimates in Table 2 for the U.S. and France, distinguishing between

women and men. In the data for these non-workers, men slept slightly more than women (9 minutes per

                                                      16
day in the U.S. 3 minutes in France), and the income elasticities differed little by gender. American men

however, watched over 1 hour more TV per day than women, French men 10 minutes more per day. In both

countries TV-watching is significantly less income elastic among non-working men than among non-

working women.

        The model implicitly assumes that the supply of different amenities (television shows, restaurants,

sporting activities and museums, etc.) is the same for all individuals, so that the prices of these goods are

identical for all decision makers. Similarly, we assume preferences are independent of other people’s

choices about how to spend time. We can examine whether these assumptions are correct, but not

distinguish between them, by including in the equations for the U.S. the average amount of time spent in

the activity in the metropolitan area where the respondent lives. We do this for all the U.S. estimates in

Tables 2, 4 and 5, using all individuals in whose metropolitan area at least 100 other individuals were ATUS

respondents. 17

         In no case did these considerations produce any but the tiniest changes in the estimated impacts of

an individual’s income or earnings on the outcomes. In all cases except sleep, however, the time that an

individual spent in the activity was positively related to the average time spent in that activity in his/her

metropolitan area. The data do not allow us to infer the cause(s) of this relationship; but in no way does it

alter our conclusions about the effects of income and prices on individuals’ use of time.

V. Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Goods Markets, and Its Spillovers

A. Product Market Discrimination and Majority/Minority Differences in Time Use

         Assume that a group is discriminated against in the product market, so that while the price faced

by members of the majority group for goods inputs is p, the price facing minorities is p[1 + d] with d being

the discriminatory goods price premium. The impact of this discrimination on the time-allocation decisions

of workers is seen by noting that the left-hand side of (3) becomes p/w for members of the majority group,

and p[1 + d]/w for minorities. Logarithmically differentiating the minorities’ version of (4) at d=0 leads to


17
  This restriction to individuals living in larger consolidated metropolitan areas (46 in this sample) reduced sample
sizes by around 2/3.

                                                         17
dlnTi/dln(1+d) = dlnTk/dln(1+d) - Qki, so that price discrimination in a product market affects time

allocation the same way as a lower wage.

        The case for non-workers is similar. If minorities face a product-market discrimination coefficient

d, the budget constraint becomes I/[p(1 + d)] - ∑Xi = 0, and d affects time allocation only thorough its

impact on real income I/[p(1 + d)]. Increasing discrimination in a product market acts on time allocation in

the same way as a decrease in I, raising the relative price of goods-intensive activities. Under the

circumstances posited above to explain the results in Tables 2-4 (substitution between commodities

relatively easier than substitution within commodities) price discrimination will lead minorities to spend

more time in time-intensive activities than otherwise similar (including same incomes) members of the

majority group. This will be the case for both workers and non-workers.

        Several studies have attempted to measure the extent to which minorities pay more than majority

citizens for equal-quality goods and services. Many of these are audit studies (with Ayres and Siegelman,

1995, apparently the first in this literature), in which racially different but otherwise identical individuals

seek price quotes on some well-defined product or service. Munnell et al. (1996) examined discrimination

in the treatment of applications for mortgage loans, showing higher denial rates to otherwise identical

minority applicants. More recent work in this vein is exemplified by Zussman (2013). Another still smaller

vein of the literature is exemplified by field studies such as List (2004).

        Some of the more recent literature (e.g., Antecol and Cobb-Clark, 2008; Brewster, 2012) has used

respondents’ subjective views of their treatment in various retail contexts to analyze differences in

outcomes by race. Myers (2004) used data from the American Housing Survey to examine racial differences

in purchase and rental prices of housing with narrow geographic clusters; Bayer et al. (2017) looked at the

same question using detailed data on housing sales. Related to this, Edelman et al. (2017) demonstrate that

minority applicants for rentals with AirBnB are less likely than majority applicants to have their bids

accepted, other things equal. All these studies suggest the existence of price discrimination against minority

purchasers. It is nearly impossible to use this literature to answer how much more the average minority



                                                      18
purchaser pays for a typical market basket of goods and services than a majority purchaser. The literature

is, however, sufficiently conclusive to allow us to assume that d > 0 in the United States.

        This line of research has spread to other countries, with most of the recent research also relying on

audit studies and focusing on housing markets. Thus Acolin et al. (2016) examined how a variety of

immigrant groups were treated when they responded to advertisements for rental housing in France.

Drydakis (2011) did a similar study in Greece, focusing on the treatment of Albanian immigrants. The

results are similar to those for racial minorities in the U.S.

        This literature implies that the goods prices faced by minorities will exceed those facing majority

consumers. All else equal, including incomes and wages, discrimination in goods markets will raise the

relative prices of commodities that are relatively goods-intensive. Thus, we expect to observe minorities

spending less time producing/consuming goods-intensive commodities and more in time-intensive

commodities than members of the majority. With sleep and TV-watching being particularly time-intensive

commodities, we should expect minorities to be more heavily engaged in these activities than otherwise

identical majority-group members.

B. Evidence on the Impacts of Product-Market Discrimination on Time Use

        Using both the American and French samples, we examine majority-minority differences in sleep

and TV-watching, the two clearly inferior activities, with minorities designated as explained in Section II.

While we have identified TV-watching as more inferior than sleeping, there is a language problem in testing

the model of spillovers of consumer discrimination to TV-watching: Majority-minority differences in time

spent watching television are likely to be confounded by language issues in the cases of white Hispanics in

the U.S. and immigrants in France. The only American groups whose television-watching we therefore

consider are white Non-Hispanics and African-Americans.

        The upper panel of Table 6 lists the estimates of the impacts of race or ethnicity on time spent

sleeping in the U.S., and in TV-watching. Each equation includes all the controls that underlay the estimates

presented in Tables 2 and 3. The sample includes both workers and non-workers; because of that the only



                                                       19
monetary measure that we include is the household’s total income. 18 African-American women and men

sleep more than otherwise identical white non-Hispanics; they also watch more television. 19 As with the

pure income effects, the differences are larger for TV-watching than for sleep, suggesting that the

discriminatory price effects on consumer goods are working along the same margin of choice in these time-

intensive activities as the results in Tables 2 and 3 implied about the effects of decreases in household

incomes. White Hispanics also sleep more than otherwise identical white non-Hispanics, a difference that

on average is about the same as among African-Americans. 20

         The bottom panel of Table 6 presents the estimates of the same equations as in Tables 2 and 4, but

with workers and non-workers pooled, and including household income as the only economic variable.

These results for France are weaker than those in the U.S.; with sub-sample sizes that are only one-sixth as

large, their relative weakness is not surprising. The impact on the sleep time of immigrants in France

compared to that of similar natives, however, is about the same as the difference between African-American

and white non-Hispanic males. That between female immigrants and natives in France is positive, but much

smaller than in the U.S. Overall the French results corroborate the more secure findings in Table 6 based

on the larger U.S. samples. 21

         We have argued that these racial/ethnic differences in time use arise because the measured incomes

of minorities overstate their true incomes due to discrimination in product markets. Assuming that d≤0.25,


18
  Separate estimates for samples of non-workers and workers in each country, using the same control variables as in
Tables 2-4, yield essentially similar results: Greater sleep time among otherwise identical minorities, whether or not
they are workers.
19
   One might be concerned that annual incomes understate the difference in annual spending ability between whites
and African-Americans because the latter may expect fewer and smaller inheritances. Perhaps so, although most
inheritances are fairly small (Hurd and Smith, 2001). More important, with the average African-American in our
sample expecting to live four fewer years than the average white, if anything annual incomes overstate racial
differences in annual spending ability, so that our results understate the racial difference in sleep time arising from
discrimination in incentives to purchase goods.
20
   These effects are not due to differences in the concentration of minorities in particular inner cities. Interacting the
indicators of state of residence with those of metropolitan status barely alters the parameter estimates describing the
racial/ethnic differences in sleep and TV-watching.
21
  Except for the estimate for black males in describing sleep, the parameter estimates change only slightly when the
respondent’s time spent working on the diary day is added to the specification.

                                                           20
and using the estimated income effects reported in Table 2, we can adjust incomes to reflect the price

differences and simulate the impacts on time use of the implicit reduction in real incomes, thus placing an

upper bound on the racial/ethnic differences attributable to product-market discrimination.

        Among African-Americans this simulation suggests that, if the excess sleep arose solely from

responses to discrimination in product-pricing, we would observe differences in sleep time equaling 1/7 to

1/3 of those measured in Table 6, and in TV-watching time of 1/3 of those listed in the table. Among

Hispanics the explanation can account for only ¼ of their extra sleep, while among French immigrants the

simulation explains 1/6 to ½ of the extra sleep that we observe. Minorities do devote more time to these

time-intensive activities than majority citizens; but at least half of this extra time cannot be explained by a

model relying on spillovers from discrimination in product markets. Numerous explanations for the

discrepancy are possible, including racial/ethnic differences in access to transportation, minority fears of

non-price discriminatory responses while shopping or attending events outside the home, and no doubt

others. We leave distinguishing among these possibilities to future research.

VI. Conclusion

        We have documented a significant negative relationship between household income and time spent

in two time-intensive activities, sleep and television-watching, which together with market work are two of

the three activities that account for nearly two-thirds of time spent in Western economies. The relationship

exists among non-workers in time-dairy data from the United States, France, and Germany, and among

workers in the former two countries. Among workers, it results mainly from a negative wage effect,

although there is also evidence for a smaller negative effect of non-labor income in the French sample. For

both the U.S. and France we demonstrate a significant minority/majority difference in time use: Minorities

engage in more time-intensive activities than otherwise similar members of the majority group.

        These results can be rationalized by a generalized model of time allocation, which allows both

substitution between time and goods in the production of commodities and substitution between

commodities in a representative individual’s utility function. The analysis demonstrates that the effect of a

change in income on non-workers’ time use will generally resemble the substitution effect of a wage change

                                                      21
on workers’ time allocations. It produces the observed negative relation between income and time spent in

time-intensive activities, provided that the elasticity of substitution between commodities is sufficiently

large relative to the average elasticity of substitution between goods and time in the production of each

commodity. This combination of circumstances also leads to the observed minority/majority differences in

time use if, as other evidence shows, minorities experience discrimination in goods markets. This extension

of the theory and its demonstrated use in explaining the novel findings suggest that it might usefully be

applied to policy propositions that affect how people spend time.

        While we have not focused on responses of work time to prices and incomes, the results here and

the expanded household production model are relevant for studying labor supply. The implicit non-

aggregability of various components of non-market time suggests that treating the labor-supply decision as

a choice between working or not is incorrect: Changes in economic incentives affect different non-work

uses of time differently, so that the failure to account for the changing mix of non-market time use as wages

or other incomes change will bias estimates of labor supply responses to these parameters.

        These theoretical and empirical results have at least two implications for future research. First, the

results on minority/majority differences in time use are examples of how discrimination in one market can

affect behavior outside the market where discrimination is practiced. There are undoubtedly many other

examples of this kind of spillover that could be investigated. Second, the rising quantity and quality of time-

diary data available from several nations should lead to a wide array of interesting empirical results. Our

generalized model of time allocation can be used both to help make sense of the patterns observed in such

data and to suggest what patterns of time use to look for.
