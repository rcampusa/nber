1.   Introduction

       Most western countries have witnessed a dramatic increase in the labor force participation

of mothers with young children in recent years. In the United States, the participation of women

with children less than 6 years of age rose from 46.8% to 62.3% between 1980 and 1996 (U.S.

Committee on Ways and Means, 1998). These changes imply that many young children are being

cared for by someone other than their mother for large portions of the day.

       Despite the magnitude of these changes, we know little about their consequences for the

well-being of children. Existing work has focused largely on effects of maternal employment on

children’s test scores (c.f. Desai et al., 1989; Parcel and Menaghan, 1994; Blau and Grossberg,

1992; Niedell, 2000; and Ruhm, 2000), with often inconclusive results. Controlling for

unobserved factors that may be correlated with both maternal employment and child outcomes is

a difficult problem in this literature, given that cognitive outcomes are likely to be affected by

many factors in addition to maternal supervision at a point in time.

       This paper focuses on accidental injuries as one important measure of child well-being.

Injuries are the leading cause of death and morbidity among American children older than one

year (Bonnie et al., 1999). What effect maternal labor force participation has on the incidence of

unintended injuries among children is unclear. On the one hand, working mothers generate

higher family income that enables them to purchase higher quality child care that may minimize

the risk of injury for their children. On the other hand, working mothers may have less time (and

energy) to provide adequate supervision of their children and/or may substitute poor quality non-

maternal supervision when they are working. Either may lead to higher injury rates. Thus, the

relationship between injury rates and maternal employment is likely to be mediated by the quality

of the care of young children and the regulations that influence it.

                                                  1
       We examine the relationship between accidental injuries, maternal employment, and child

care policy using data from several sources. Individual-level information about accidents

requiring medical attention comes from the Child-Mother files of the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth (NLSY). Time-series data about accidental deaths across states is constructed

using the Vital Statistics Detail Mortality (VSDM) and Vital Statistics Detail Natality (VSDN)

data from 1979 to 1996. Information about state child care regulations was collected by Hotz and

Kilburn (1997, 2000). We also make use of data from the March Current Population Surveys

(CPS) to construct measures of the demographic characteristics of states.

       We find that the effects of maternal employment on unintentional injuries to children vary

by demographic group, with the effects being positive for blacks and negative for whites in

models that control for child-specific fixed effects. We also present evidence that indicates that

the effects of maternal employment on rates of injuries to children are mediated by the quality of

child care as measured by the stringency of state regulations of this care. In particular, we find

strong and consistent evidence in both of the data sets that requiring caregivers to have education

beyond high school reduces the incidence of both fatal and non-fatal accidents. For example, the

estimates imply that education requirements reduce accidental deaths among 1 to 5 year olds by

16% overall. Conversely, requiring more than one inspection per year has statistically significant

but mixed effects on childhood injury rates. Such inspections increase the incidence of non-fatal

injuries requiring medical attention among children of less educated mothers, but reduce the

incidence of fatal injuries among blacks. At the same time, we find that requiring insurance

lowers the incidence of fatal injuries among whites, but has no effect among blacks.

       We perform an auxiliary analysis of the relationship between child care regulations and

the modes of child care that parents choose. We find evidence consistent with the view that more

                                                  2
stringent regulations increase injury rates by squeezing some children out of the more expensive

regulated sector and into unregulated care. An important exception to this evidence is the effect

of imposing minimum educational requirements for child care providers. Such requirements do

not appear to reduce the use of regulated care. Overall, these findings suggest that some forms of

child care regulation create winners and losers, depending on whether or not these “crowdout”

effects outweigh the beneficial direct effects of regulation on the safety of child care

environments.

       The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 1 provides some background

information about variation in rates of accidental injuries, and child care regulation. Section 2

lays out a conceptual model. Section 3 describes our data sources. Section 4 provides an

overview of our empirical model. Results appear in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes.

2.   Background

a) Systematic Variations in Injury Rates

       Accidents (or unintentional injuries as public health experts prefer to call these events)

are the leading cause of death among children over 1 year old. Table 1 shows the six leading

causes of death for children of ages 1 to 3, and 4 to 5. These figures are calculated using the 1996

Detailed Mortality data for the U.S. It is striking how much more important unintentional injuries

are than any form of infectious disease for young children.

       These mortality statistics for children shed light only on the tip of the iceberg of

underlying injuries. For each death that results from childhood injury, it is estimated that there

are more than 1,000 emergency room visits and an unknown number of injuries that receive no

medical treatment (Children’s Safety Network, 1991). It is estimated that between 1987 and

1995, 6,600 American children died annually from preventable injuries, 246,000 children per

                                                  3
year were hospitalized, and injuries resulted in almost 9 million emergency room visits and 12

million physician visits each year (National Safe Kids Campaign, 1998).

       It often been argued in the past that the accidents experienced by children are simply the

normal consequence of growing up. For example, a 1999 Institute of Medicine Report on injury

prevention remarks, “For centuries, human injuries have been regarded either as random and

unavoidable occurrences (‘accidents’ or ‘acts of God’) or as untoward consequences of human

malevolence or carelessness. From this perspective, the main strategies for prevention are prayer

and human improvement” (Bonnie et al., 1999). But epidemiological evidence clearly indicates

systematic differences across socioeconomic groups in the risks of childhood injuries. For

example, injury rates vary dramatically by race within the United States, with black children

being 1.7 times more likely than white children to die from unintentional injuries (National

SAFE KIDS Campaign, 1998).

       Additional evidence that many U.S. accidents are actually preventable comes from

declining rates of deaths due to unintentional injuries within the U.S. Between 1987 and 1995,

the number of deaths due to unintentional injuries among children younger than 14 fell from 15.6

per 100,000 to 11.5 per 100,000, a decline of 26 percent. Deaths to motor vehicle occupants,

drownings, and deaths due to pedestrian and bicycle accidents and fires all declined.

       Also, the majority of U.S. childhood accidents occur between May and August, and most

unintentional injury related deaths among older children happen in the evening hours when

children are most likely to be out of school and unsupervised. In addition, some types of injuries

are most common among the children of single parents and young mothers, which again suggests

that lack of proper supervision plays a role (National SAFE KIDS Campaign, 1998).

       Finally, we note that childhood death rates from causes such as burns, drownings, and

                                                 4
falls are systematically lower in Europe than they are in the United States, even though rates of

death from congenital anomalies and malignancies are comparable in most developed industrial

countries (Williams and Miller, 1992). At the same time, the higher rates of childhood injuries in

the U.S. relative to other countries may have little to do with differences in the way children are

cared for. For example, given that the U.S. is a large country while the Netherlands is a small

one, it may always be the case that there are higher numbers of automobile fatalities among both

adults and children in the United States simply because Americans drive longer distances.

Similarly, backyard swimming pools may be more common in the United States than in some

other countries, leading to more drownings.

        In summary, the available evidence suggests that unintentional injuries are a very

important cause of death and injury for young children and that they are not “Acts of God” but

avoidable. Thus, improved supervision of children is likely to be an important way to prevent

such injuries. We now turn to the evidence on the relationship between the risk of injury to

children and one form of childhood supervision, namely non-parental child care.

b) Child Care and Injury Risk

        The available evidence about child care and injury risk suggests two things. First,

licensed, regulated, day care centers are actually a very safe place for children relative to other

settings. Sacks et al. (1989) estimate that the risk of an injury requiring medical attention is 14.3

per 100 children annually in day care, compared to 35 per 100 children in the community at

large. Similarly, other researchers (c.f. Briss et al.) have found relatively low rates of injuries in

such child care settings.

        However, a second finding is that even regulated child care centers are often not without

significant risks of injury. While most states do not keep detailed information about deaths to

                                                   5
children that occur in child care facilities, those that do suggest that 12% of the 2,260 accidental

deaths to children between the ages of 1 and 4 years old in 1995 occurred in child care settings.

This figure rises to 20% if we exclude deaths to children who were automobile passengers from

the denominator (U.S. News, 1997). Furthermore, a recent report from the U.S. Consumer

Product Safety Commission found that many licensed child care centers had safety hazards

including unsafe equipment, a failure to use safety gates, window blind cords within children’s

reach, and allowing children to wear clothing with drawstrings (U.S. CPSC, 1999). These

findings suggest that there may be scope for reducing injury rates by improving regulation of

licensed child care providers.

3.     Conceptual Model

           In this section, we outline a simple model of parental choice over time allocation and

production of “child quality.”1 Parents are assumed to maximize a utility function:

                                           U = f ( X , L, Q : c , e ) ,                                            (1)

by choosing goods (X), leisure (L), and child quality (Q), taking child and family characteristics

(c), and random shocks (e), as given. They maximize this function subject to the following

budget constraint:

                                         pX + wL = Y + (T − L) w ,                                                 (2)

where w is the wage, p is a vector of prices, Y is non-labor income, and T is the total endowment

of time. Households also face a production function that describes the way that goods and non-

working time (leisure) can be combined to produce child quality:

                                             Q = g ( X , L : c, v ) ,                                              (3)

    See Ribar (1992) and Blau and Hagy (1997) for similar models of parental labor supply and child care choice.

                                                             6
where v is a random shock.

        In this simple framework, increases in work activity reduce the amount of L available for

investment in child quality, but increase the amount of X that could be invested. Child care is one

of the X variables that can be purchased. It is useful to think of there being two types of child

care, Xr which is regulated and Xu which is unregulated. These two forms of child care have

prices pr and pu, respectively. To the extent that higher quality, and safer, child care is costly to

produce, binding child care regulations that regulate quality and safety are likely to increase pr

relative to pu. In a world of full information about child care settings and the risk of injuries to

children, more stringent regulations will “crowd” some parents—namely those with a lower

willingness to pay for higher quality care—“out” of regulated care due to this higher price.

        However, in the real world, parents may be uncertain about the quality of care their

children will receive from a particular child care provider. For example, parents may not know

exactly what type of care the provider provides or how safe a particular setting is. The imposition

of minimum quality and safety standards on day care centers can solve the information problem

faced by parents, at least to the extent that these standards are enforced. Some forms of regulation

may actually change the production function for child quality, making it easier to avoid

unintentional injury with a given level of parental effort. For example, a highly trained caregiver

may be more likely than a less skilled person to educate parents about dangerous products and

practices (such as drawstrings on children’s clothing). A skilled caregiver is also more likely to

teach children about safety practices proactively rather than punishing them after-the-fact for

violating rules. As a result, such regulations may increase both the actual quality of care in the

regulated sector and the amount that parents are willing to pay.

        The potential for the imposition of minimum quality standards, via regulation, to solve

                                                   7
the informational problems consumers face with respect to certain types of goods and services

has been noted in the economics literature on product quality and liability. For example, Klein

and Leffler (1981) argue that the maintenance of licensure systems that impose minimum quality

standards on service providers may have beneficial welfare effects in markets for goods and

services in which product quality is difficult to monitor. Imposing standards in such markets can

“assure” consumers of the quality of the goods and services they receive to the extent that a

provider’s investment in meeting such standards either generates a higher stream of earnings or

results in higher costs (fines) to the provider if these minimum standards are violated.2

        In summary, regulating the child care market by imposing minimum standards on some

segment of that market can be a two-edged sword. While children in child care settings subject to

binding regulation may receive higher quality care, regulation is also likely to drive some

children out of the regulated sector. Thus, the overall effect on child safety is ambiguous and a

positive effect of regulation on accident rates may reflect this “crowdout” effect. We investigate

this possibility further below.

4.   Data

        This study merges state-level data about child care regulations with individual-level data

from the NLSY and its Child-Mother files as well as Vital Statistics data. These two sources of

individual-level data are complementary. On the one hand, the NLSY has information about all

medically attended injuries, rather than just the small fraction of injuries resulting in death. To

our knowledge, this data has not previously been exploited. Moreover, the NLSY has a great deal


2
  Also see Leland (1979) and Shapiro (1986) for more on the role of licensing and imposing minimum quality
standards in markets for goods and services with hard-to-monitor quality attributes. See Lowenstein and Tinnin
(1992) and Hotz and Kilburn (1997, 2000) for more on the application of such arguments to the market for child care
services.

                                                        8
of demographic information about mothers and children, as well as repeated observations on the

same child. On the other hand, the Child-Mother information from the NLSY is reported by the

mother, and is likely to be subject to reporting biases, as discussed below.

         The VSDM is a census of all deaths in the U.S., so selective reporting is not an issue. It

contains information about types of accidents and causes of death.3 To assess the plausibility of

our findings on the effects of child care regulations on accident death rates among children, we

conduct separate analyses on child deaths due to cancer and to car passengers. With respect to the

former, one should not expect to find any systematic relationship between child care regulations

and the incidence of cancer deaths. Furthermore, the most plausible way that such regulations

might affect accidental deaths to automobile passengers would be through some form of

crowdout, e.g., the stringency of regulations affecting the commuting patterns and distances to

and from day care facilities. We present results below that examine the effects of regulations (and

other variables) on the death rates due to these two causes.

         Finally, the large sample sizes in the Vital Statistics data offer some distinct advantages.

For example, in the NLSY data we sometimes find significant effects for whites and not for

blacks. It is not clear whether these differing estimates reflect the smaller sample size for blacks,

or true differences in behavior. In the VSDM, sample sizes are large for both blacks and whites,

making it easier to detect true differences.

         The child care data and the two sources of individual-level data sets are described in

further detail in section b) below. We now turn to a description of our data on child care

regulation.

 The NLSYCM actually also has information about the type of accident. However, of the 1563 accidents in our data
set, only 50 involved car passengers. By way of comparison, 745 accidents involved falls, and thus could have
occurred either at home or in child care settings. In contrast to the Vital Statistics data, it was not possible to identify

                                                             9
a) Data about Child Care Regulations

           The child care regulations we focus on include ratios of children to caregivers; whether

there is more than one mandatory inspection per year; whether it is mandatory to have insurance;

and whether head caregivers are required to have training beyond a high school diploma. These

forms of regulation tend to be applied to different types of child care settings. For example, direct

inspections are generally used for licensed family homes while insurance is usually required only

for day care centers. It is possible that large institutions find it easier to obtain insurance in the

private market than small family home operations. Minimum education requirements also apply

mainly to day care centers. We have coded these last three categories of regulation as ‘1’ if the

regulation applies to either family homes or to daycare centers. Regulation of child-to-caregiver

ratios is prevalent for both day care centers and family homes. Hence we include measures for

both types of child care setting.4

           Table 2 shows the number of states that require head caregivers in either setting to have

more than a high school degree, that require insurance, or that have more than one required

inspection per year. Mean maximum ratios of children to caregivers for two age groups are also

shown. Table 2 shows that on average, there was little change in these ratios over time,

something that is also true within states.5 Potentially more significant changes in state child care

regulations occurred between 1986 and 1987, when 6 states added requirements that head

caregivers have some training beyond a high school degree. Six more states added this


any large class of accidents in the NLSCM that did or did not occur in child care.

    For further information on the collection of these state child care regulation data, see Hotz and Kilburn (2000).

 We also examined group sizes, which are often regulated. However, there is generally little difference between the
maximum group size and the maximum ratio. Moreover ratios are a somewhat less ambiguous concept than the
group size. For example, in California in 1996 a licensed family home with two caregivers was allowed to have 12
children, including 4 infants and 8 older children. Here the ratio of children to caregivers is clearly 6. However, the
group size for infants is 4 and for toddlers is 8, even though all 12 children may be together for most of the day.

requirement between 1990 and 1991. Often such training would consist of a specified number of

courses in child development from a local community college. Finally, Table 2 indicates that

there has been a slow decline in the use of direct inspections and an increase in the number of

states that require at least some types of child care providers to carry insurance.

b) Individual-Level Data

         The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth began in 1978 with approximately 6,000

young men and 6,000 young women. These individuals have been followed up every year since.

In 1986, the NLSY began following the children of the young women, at two-year intervals. The

Child-Mother data in the NLSY offers a unique and previously untapped source of information

about medically attended, non-fatal injuries among children. Questions about accidents were

asked beginning with the 1988 survey. Mothers are asked: 1) whether the child had an accident in

the past 12 months that required medical attention; and 2) whether the child ever had an accident

(not necessarily in the past 12 months) requiring hospitalization. If the mother answered yes to

either of these questions, she was asked the specific month and year of the three most recent

accidents.6

         Because of the way that these questions were asked, we have accident information for

different time windows for different children. For example, if the mother did not report any

accidents in 1987, then we know nothing about 1986. But if she reported an accident in January

1987, and a previous accident in May 1986, then we have a history of accidents from May 1986

to December 1987. In total, we have accident data for 3,394 mothers with 6,206 children aged 1

to 5. We excluded infants under one year because unlike older children, they are much more


6
 If there was an accident requiring medical attention reported in the same month and year as an accident requiring
hospitalization, then we assumed that these were one and the same accident. While it would be interesting to look at


                                                         11
likely to die from essentially medical causes such as congenital anomalies. The data spans the

period 1983 to 1996. The children were surveyed at least once and up to four times in our

sample. Organizing our data into quarters (because of the seasonal patterns in accident rates

noted above, and so that we can more precisely measure the mother’s work status) yields a

maximum of 24 quarters of data for each child, and a minimum of 1 quarter. The average child

had approximately 8 quarters of accident data.

         Information about the mother’s employment was obtained from the NLSY Work History

file. The work history file has information about every mother’s labor force status and usual

hours of work for every week beginning with the first week of 1978. Mothers who reported

working for at least one week during the quarter were coded as having worked during that

quarter. We have a total of 44,369 quarters of child life data.

         The NLSY Child-Mother data also includes questions about child care in the 1986 and

1988 surveys which applied to the last month prior to the date of interview. In 1992, 1994 and

1996 questions were asked about child care in the first three years of each child’s life. Because of

this design, we have data about child care arrangements for only a subset of our sample covering

10,480 quarters of child life. We will use this subset of the sample to examine the effect of

regulation on the choice of child care mode.

         We obtained data on maternal and child characteristics from the main NLSY and its

Child-Mother files. These variables included: the child’s age, race, and gender; whether or not a

spouse was present; whether there were older or younger siblings in the household; whether the

maternal grandmother and grandfather worked when the mother was aged 14; whether the

maternal grandfather was present when the mother was 14; the mother’s score on the Armed


accidents requiring hospitalization separately, the sample size was too small.

                                                          12
Forces Qualifications Test (a test of job skills); and the mother’s education.

       Some of these variables are likely to have a direct effect on accident rates. For example,

the presence of an older sibling may mean that a child is more likely to be exposed to age-

inappropriate toys. Other variables such as those describing the maternal grandparents and AFQT

have been shown in previous work using the NLSY to be important predictors of maternal

employment and socioeconomic status and may also be related to accident propensities.

       The first part of Table 3 shows means of all our variables for the entire sample in the

NLSY Child-Mother files, as well as by race and maternal education categories. The overall

accident rate is around 3%, with a rate of 2.4% for blacks and 3.6% for whites. The pattern by

education is u-shaped, with the accident rate first increasing in education and then decreasing.

These patterns are consistent with evidence from other sources that suggests that there are

socioeconomic biases in the reporting of medically-attended injuries. In particular, more

expensive day care centers and those with high proportions of white children are more likely to

report such injuries, even though we would expect these centers to have lower actual injury rates.

       Maternal employment rates are high for all groups except high school dropouts, and

increase with education. The other variables in Table 3 show largely the patterns that one would

expect. For example, black children and children of high school dropouts appear to be

disadvantaged in terms of maternal education and presence of a father-figure.

       The second panel of Table 3 shows rates of unintentional injuries, maternal employment,

and child and family characteristics by type of child care, for those mothers and children for

whom we have child care information. Note, that this sample is much younger on average than

the “accident” sample. Child care regulations generally distinguish between child care centers

and licensed family homes. The NLSY data do not allow us to make this distinction very

                                                 13
precisely. Hence we split the data into three groups: nurseries, day care centers, family group

homes, and preschools; other types of child care; and no non-maternal child care. The first two

categories correspond roughly to regulated and unregulated child care settings.

       There are two striking things about this part of the table. First, almost half of the mothers

who report “no care” are employed. This raises the question of whether even very young children

are being left unattended while their mothers work. Some mothers, for example, might arrange to

work shifts while their children were sleeping. Second, accident rates are much higher for

children in child care than for other children. Since this finding is in sharp contrast to the

literature discussed above, it suggests that perhaps the same injury is more likely to result in a

doctor visit when a child is in some form of child care than when the child is looked after by his

or her mother. Thus, regulation that pushed children out of child care and into maternal care

could cause a spurious reduction in the number of accidents requiring medical attention.

Reporting issues of this sort make it important to verify any findings from the NLSY with the

Vital Statistics data, and to look directly at the crowdout issue as we do below.

b) Vital Statistics Data

       The National Mortality Detail Files contain information about every death in the United

States. The file has information about race, the state of birth, state of residence, age at death, and

cause of death. We use data from the 1979 to 1996 detail files. We focus on deaths due to

unintentional injuries among children 1 to 5 years old.

       In order to calculate a denominator to use in the computation of death rates, we use data

from the National Natality Detail Files (a census of all births in the U.S.) in combination with the

Mortality Detail Files to calculate the number of children who were born in a particular state and



                                                  14
year and who were still living as of each particular age.7 We calculate rates separately for 51

states, 14 years (from 1983 to 1996), and 2 age groups. Disaggregating further by race and gender

yields 5,712 possible cells.

         These cells are matched to additional demographic data obtained from the Current

Population Survey’s March files (CPS). The Current Population Survey samples approximately

100,000 persons per year. We use these data to calculate the fraction of children in each state,

year, and age group that is in poverty, urban, black or hispanic, as well as the median family

income of these children, fraction of children whose mother’s have a high school education, and

the fraction of children in one parent families. All of these indicators might be expected to

influence accident rates independent of maternal employment status. Finally, we use the CPS to

calculate the fraction of mothers in each state, year, age, and race category (black, nonblack) who

were employed.

         Of the 5,712 cells in the Vital Statistics data, 452 cells for black children have no

corresponding observations on maternal employment from the CPS. Hence, these cells are lost.

We lose an additional 54 cells because of missing data about the maximum ratio of children to

caregivers in family homes, and 290 cells because of missing data about the maximum ratio in

day care centers. These cells are generally from the first years of our data.8 We exclude one


7
  Note that this procedure requires us to use the state of birth of the decedent rather than the state of death. Since
state of birth and state of death are the same for most of the children in our sample, we feel that this is acceptable.
The alternative would be to use state of death, and to try to find some other source of information about the number
of children of each age in each state and year. Sample sizes in data sources like the CPS and the SIPP are too small
to give accurate answers for small states, and the Census is not updated frequently enough. Another problem is that
numbers of children can be computed only for U.S. born children, so that immigrants are excluded from our analyses
of death rates using Vital Statistics data.
8
  We have re-estimated the Vital Statistics models discussed below excluding the ratio in day care centers and using
the 290 cells that are missing this information. The inferences are very similar to those reported in this paper, with
one exception: Requiring insurance has a positive and significant effect on accidental death rates among blacks in
this sample. We have also re-estimated the models including the ratio in day care centers and excluding the ratio in
family homes. The coefficients on each type of ratio are remarkably similar to those reported below, whether or not

                                                          15
(small) cell with a reported accident rate of 34.4 per 1,000. Thus, we use 4,915 cells in the

analyses we present below.

         Table 4 provides an overview of these Vital Statistics data. The first column shows the

weighted mean computed over all cells, while the minimum and maximum counts across cells

are shown in columns 2 and 3. Table 4 indicates that there is a great deal of variation in both

outcomes and state characteristics across cells. Among children, deaths due to unintentional

injury are (mercifully) rare events. The overall rate is 0.165 per 1,000. Nineteen percent of these

deaths represent children killed while riding as car passengers, making it one of the largest single

categories of deaths due to unintentional injury. Children killed by cars as pedestrians are

included in the “other accident” category, since these accidents could have occurred while

children were in child care. The incidence of cancer deaths is slightly higher than the incidence of

child deaths to car passengers at 0.039 per 1,000.

         Although it is not shown in the table, it is remarkable how much variation in accident

rates there is by race. The mean accident rate is 0.220 per 1,000 for blacks, with a maximum rate

for a “black” cell of 6.36. Among whites, the maximum death rate is only 2.77. Most of this

variation stems from differences in the incidence of other accidents rather than deaths to car

passengers.

         The variation across cells in our CPS variables is also striking, with for example, poverty

rates varying between 5% and 28%. However, small cell sizes in the CPS lead us to have cells in

which, for example, all observations are either urban or not urban.

         The figures shown at the bottom of Table 4 indicate that the smallest cell in the Vital

Statistics data has 18 observations. Given the possibility of rates being driven by outliers in small


the other is included in the regression model.

                                                  16
cells, we repeated the analyses described below aggregating the Vital Statistics data up to the

state, year and age group level (i.e. suppressing the differences in accident rates by race and

gender). The estimates of the effects of regulation obtained this way were very similar to those

reported below.

5.   Empirical Specification

       The conceptual model discussed above highlights the fact that work status and child

quality are both endogenously chosen. Thus, while it is possible to solve equations (1), (2) and

(3) and derive an expression for child quality as a function of work status, p, w, Y and c, a failure

to properly control for all of the determinants of child quality and work status is likely to yield a

biased estimate of the effect of work status on child quality.

a) Estimation Using Individual-Level Data

       We begin our analysis of the NLSY data by estimating Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

models of the form:

      ACCIDENTit = α 0 + α1WORKSTATit + α 2′ Cit + α 3′SEASONt + α 4t YEAR t + ε it ,              (4)

where accident is a dummy variable equal to 1 if child i had an accident requiring medical

attention in quarter t; WORKSTAT is a dummy equal to 1 if the mother was working, C is the

vector of child and family characteristics described above, SEASON is a vector of dummy

variables for fall, summer, and spring, YEAR is a vector of year dummies, and εit is an

idiosyncratic shock. The model does not explicitly control for income. Hence, α1 measures the

full effect of working, rather than the effect of working with income constant.

       The OLS coefficient α1 may be biased up or down in this model. In particular, suppose

that some mothers are more productive both in the labor force and in the production of child


                                                  17
quality. If these high productivity mothers are more likely to work than others, then a failure to

fully control for differences in productivity will lead to a spurious negative correlation between

maternal employment and child accident rates. Child-specific factors may also be an important

source of bias. Suppose, for example, that a child is particularly at risk of accidents, and that, for

this reason, the mother does not work. Then once again, there will be a spurious negative

association between accidents and maternal employment.

           In order to control for these biases, we also estimate models that include child fixed

effects:

                                              + β ′SEASON + β YEAR + ν
       ACCIDENTit = β i + β1WORKSTATit + β 2′C                                                                    (5)
                                               it 3       t   4t   t    it


                                         is a more limited set of time-varying observable
where βi is the child fixed effect, and C

variables.9 It is important to note that these fixed effects models control for any permanent

component of income, as well as for other time-invariant, child-specific factors. Thus, they

address the question of whether, holding permanent income fixed, maternal employment is

related to a higher or lower probability of a childhood accident requiring medical attention.

           Equations (4) and (5) are estimated for the entire sample, and for subsamples defined by

race or education. As discussed above, one rationale for doing this is that the reporting of injuries

requiring medical attention in survey data may vary systematically by race and/or education.

Including child fixed effects should control for this reporting bias, at least to the extent that

mothers report injuries consistently over time.

           It is also possible that maternal employment has differing effects by group. The model

suggests that reducing the amount of maternal time invested in the child is likely to have negative


9
  We also estimated models that controlled for mother rather than child fixed effects. The estimates were quite
similar to the child fixed effects models reported below.

                                                         18
consequences, everything else being equal. However, everything else is not equal. The quality of

non-maternal care that children receive may be better or worse than the care that would have

been provided by the mother, and the relative quality of care may vary systematically by

socioeconomic status. Suppose for example, that a high school dropout mother works. She may

be more likely than other working mothers to leave her child with someone who is more skilled

in producing child quality than she is herself. For instance, she might leave the child with her

own mother or in a quality subsidized child care center such as Head Start. In this case, maternal

employment would be associated not only with more income, but also with higher quality time

inputs, and thus might have a positive impact on child quality. One might also see such effects by

race. For example, we know that poor black children have much higher rates of participation in

Head Start than poor white children (Currie and Thomas, 1995).

       On the other hand, a more educated mother might end up leaving her child with a less

skilled person when she goes to work. In this case, maternal employment could have a harmful

effect on child quality if the negative effects of lower quality time inputs are not fully offset by

increases in income. To the extent that the fixed effects capture increases in income associated

with maternal employment, the coefficient on maternal employment will capture the positive or

negative effects of substituting non-maternal for maternal time.

       In order to begin to get at the mediating effect of child care quality, we also estimate

versions of model (5) that include measures of child care regulations and interactions between

maternal employment and child care regulations. These models take the form:

     ACCIDENTit = γ i + γ 1WORKSTATit + γ 2′CCREG it + γ 3′CCREG it ⋅ WORKSTATit
                                                                                                       (6)
                          + γ ′SEASON + γ YEAR + η ,
                  + γ 4′ C it  5      t    6t    t     it


where CCREG is a vector of child care regulations. Because the regulations vary only at the


                                                  19
state-year level, we correct the standard errors to allow for correlations within state-year cells.

The question addressed in these models is whether child care regulation mitigates any negative

effects (or exacerbates any positive effects) of maternal employment.

b) Estimation Using Combined Vital Statistics and CPS Data

        We use the combined Vital Statistics and CPS data to estimate models of the following

form:

ACCMORTgst = δ i + δ1′DEMO gst + δ 2 WORKMOM gst + δ 3′CPSst + δ 4 sSTATE s + δ 5t YEAR t + ξit , (7)

where g indexes the demographic group, s indexes the state, t indexes the year, ACCMORT is

the mortality rate in the cell, DEMO is a vector of indicators describing the demographic group,

WORKMOM is the number of mothers working in the group, state, and year, CPS is a vector of

other characteristics of states and years constructed using the CPS as described above, STATE is

a vector of state dummies, YEAR is a vector of year dummies, and ξ is an error term. All models

are estimated by weighted least squares, where the weights are given by the cell sizes.

        In addition to (7), we estimate a model that includes the vector of child care regulation

variables described in Table 2, and we also estimate these models separately by race. Although

we include state and year effects in these models, it is possible that the estimated effects of the

policy variables are biased by the omission of other things that are varying within states over

time. The inclusion of the constructed CPS variables mitigates this problem to some extent by

allowing us to control, for example, for state-specific trends in maternal education and poverty.

        As noted above, we estimate models with child cancer death rates as the dependent

variable to assess the plausibility of our estimated child care regulation effects and the adequacy

of our various attempts to control for endogeneity bias. Cancer deaths may be affected by general

socioeconomic conditions, but are unlikely to respond to child care regulation. Thus, if we found

                                                  20
effects of child care regulation in models of cancer deaths, we would have to conclude that the

child care regulations were proxying for some other, unobserved determinant of mortality.

       Finally, in an attempt to get at the mechanisms underlying the effects of child care

regulation, we distinguish between the effects of regulation on deaths to car passengers, and

effects on all other types of accidental deaths. Accidents to car passengers are unlikely to have

taken place while the child is in child care. Thus, effects of child care regulation on these deaths

cannot reflect the direct effects of regulation on child care settings.

       Regulation could still affect the probability of these deaths indirectly however, either by

changing driving patterns or through “spillovers” of knowledge about safe practices from

caregivers to parents. For example, if caregivers expect children to arrive in car seats, parents

may be more likely to use them. Thus, while we expect regulation to have larger effects on other

accidents than on fatalities among children riding in cars, we cannot rule out the possibility that

there will be some effect on these deaths.

6.   Results

a) Results Using NLSY Data

       The first two parts of Table 5 present estimates of the coefficients on maternal

employment from equations (4) and (5). Estimates are presented for the full sample, as well as

six subsamples defined for various racial and maternal education categories. The coefficients on

the other variables included in the model are suppressed from Table 5 in order to conserve space,

but models corresponding to the first section of Table 5 are shown in Appendix Table 1.

       The coefficients are generally consistent with what one would expect on the basis of the

literature described above. For example, the presence of a younger sibling is associated with a

lower probability of accidents, while the presence of older siblings increases accident rates.

                                                  21
Males have higher accident rates, while blacks and Hispanics report lower rates. Accident rates

rise with age until age 4 and then fall again for 5 year olds, and are higher in the summer and fall

than in the other quarters of the year. One anomalous finding is that maternal education has little

effect on reported injury rates, and the probability of reporting an injury requiring medical

attention increases slightly with AFQT scores. We believe that these findings reflect differential

reporting by more/less educated (high/low AFQT) women.

       The OLS estimates in Table 5 suggest that maternal employment has no effect on

accident rates except among blacks. However, among blacks, the effect is quite large relative to

the mean probabilities in Table 3. Maternal employment decreases the probability of an accident

requiring medical attention by two thirds of a percentage point, which is a decrease of 30%

below the baseline probability for blacks shown in Table 3. Note that the types of reporting

biases discussed above (e.g. child care providers being more likely than parents to seek medical

attention for a given injury) cannot explain this finding.

       Controlling for child fixed effects changes these results a good deal. The negative effect

for blacks becomes even stronger, but the estimated effect for whites is now positive and

statistically significant at the 90% level of confidence. The results for whites suggest that,

conditional on permanent income and other fixed maternal and child characteristics, increases in

maternal employment increase accident probabilities among white children. The fixed effects

estimates also suggest that OLS estimates are likely to be biased downwards due to the type of

selection bias discussed above, namely, that mothers who are most likely to be employed are also

less likely to have children who are prone to have accidents.

       Table 5 suggests that maternal employment has no effect on accident rates overall.

However, this result masks large differences between groups. There is a strong negative effect of

                                                 22
maternal employment on accident probabilities for black children, as well as a positive effect for

white children that is significant at the 90% level of confidence.

        We do not find significant effects when we divide the sample by maternal education,

suggesting that the differential racial effects cannot be explained by differences in maternal

education levels. Other possible explanations for the negative effect of maternal employment on

accident probabilities among black children include more hazardous home environments

(possibly due to residential segregation) and/or greater utilization of high quality day care

centers, at least by some children. Unfortunately, it is difficult to test these hypotheses directly

using our data.

        We can, however, examine the effects of child care regulation. The last panel of Table 5

explores these effects by estimating models in the form of equation (6). The model specification

is similar to the child fixed effects models shown in Panel 2 of Table 5, except that the models

include both the indicators for child care regulation and interactions of these variables with

whether or not the mother was working.10

        It is difficult to interpret the main effects of child care regulation in these models which

include child fixed effects. There is generally little variation in regulation over the time that we

observe a particular child. Moreover, these main effects may pick up omitted characteristics of

states. However, the fact that mothers may or may not be employed at a point in time creates a

great deal of additional variation that can be exploited. The coefficients on the interaction terms

can be interpreted as telling us what would happen if a child’s mother went to work in a high

regulation state rather than a low regulation state.


10
  We also estimated models in which each type of regulation and its interaction were included separately. The
results were very similar to those reported here.

                                                        23
       As discussed above, child care regulations may have either positive or negative effects on

accident rates. Effective regulation is expected to reduce accident rates in child care centers that

are subject to regulation. However, regulation may also squeeze people out of the regulated

sector, which could increase accident rates. Spillovers from child care regulation to home care

are also possible.

       The third panel of Table 5 shows that the main effects of regulation are not generally

statistically significant. An exception is that having more than one mandatory inspection annually

is associated with lower rates of accidents requiring medical attention. Turning to the

interactions, the most striking result is that minimum education requirements for caregivers have

strong negative effects on overall accident rates. In the subgroups, this effect is significant for

white children, but not for blacks. However, we do find some evidence of a beneficial effect of

minimum education requirements for blacks when we examine the Vital Statistics data below.

This suggests that the contrast between results for blacks and whites here may be an artifact of

the smaller sample size for blacks.

       When we conduct our analysis separately by maternal education categories, we find that

the beneficial effects of minimum education requirements are concentrated among children

whose mothers do not have a high school degree and among children with college educated

mothers. It is interesting to note that the differences between maternal care and substitute care

may be largest for these two groups, creating the largest scope for regulation of child care to

mediate the effects of maternal employment.

       The only other significant effect of regulation in Table 5 is that requiring more than one

annual inspection per year increases unintentional injuries among children of high school

dropouts. This pattern could arise if, for example, less educated mothers were most likely to be

                                                  24
pushed out of regulated care by inspections, a hypothesis that is investigated further below.

b) Results Using Vital Statistics Data

        Estimates from models estimated using the aggregate Vital Statistics data are shown in

Table 6. The table shows the determinants of death rates from all accidents, accidents to

automobile passengers, all other accidents, and cancer. As discussed above, we include cancer

deaths as controls as one would not expect them to be affected by child care regulation. We also

differentiate between deaths to children riding in cars, and all other accidental deaths.

        The first panel shows estimates of the effect of maternal employment from models that

control only for child age, sex and race. It is remarkable that these simple controls explain so

much of the variation in accident rates (and especially “other accidents”) across cells. These

correlations suggest that state/year/age/race/sex groups with higher maternal employment rates

also have higher accidental death rates. Changing the share of working mothers from zero to 1 is

associated with an increase in the rate of accidental deaths of 0.05, which can be compared to the

mean of 0.165 accidental deaths per 1,000 in Table 4. However, the second and third columns

suggest that most of this effect can be attributed to an increase in deaths to children riding in cars,

rather than to other accidents. Finally, the fourth column indicates that maternal employment is

associated with an increase in cancer deaths, which suggests that we should take these estimates

with a large grain of salt.

        The second panel of Table 6 shows that including the CPS controls listed in Table 4, state

effects, and year effects, as well as controls for child age, sex, and race greatly reduces the

estimated effects of maternal employment, although it continues to have a significant positive

effect on deaths to children in cars. This finding illustrates the fact that the share of mothers who

work is highly correlated with other characteristics of the cell. The inclusion of these controls

                                                  25
also greatly increases the explanatory power of the regressions.11

         The third panel of Table 6 shows estimates from models that include our measures of

child care regulations in addition to all of the other variables described above. In contrast to the

NLSY estimates discussed above, the main effects of regulation here are identified using the full

time span available, and we are able to include state fixed effects to control for underlying

differences between states. Hence, we expect the main effects to be interpretable as measures of

the effects of regulation.12 The estimates in this panel indicate that requiring caregivers to have

training beyond high school has large and significantly negative effect on accident rates.

Moreover, this type of regulation has a much greater effect on “other” accidents than on deaths to

car passengers, and has no effect on cancer death rates.

         In conjunction with the means shown in Table 4, the point estimate suggests that such a

requirement could lower the incidence of “other” accidental deaths by 18%. If, as suggested

above, as many as 20% of “other” accidental deaths to children in this age range occur in child

care, then our estimate suggests that better training of caregivers could eliminate many of these

deaths. We observe similar patterns for requiring insurance, and for requiring more than one

annual inspection of child care facilities. That is, both measures have small negative effects on

deaths to car passengers and larger negative effects on deaths due to other accidents.

         In contrast, allowing higher ratios of children to caregivers in family homes is associated

with slight increases in the rates of other accidents, while increasing ratios in day care centers



11
  Glied (1999) also finds inconsistent and generally insignificant effects of maternal employment. She uses counts of
deaths due to unintentional injury from the Vital Statistics data combined with controls similar to our CPS variables.
12
   Moreover, unlike the NLSCM data, we cannot identify whether any particular mother worked in the Vital Statistics
data, and we know that the share of mothers who work is highly correlated with other characteristics of cells. Hence,
the strategy of identifying effects of regulation by interacting maternal employment with regulation is not appropriate
in these data.

                                                         26
decrease them. Again, there is no effect on accidents to car passengers, and no effect on cancer

death rates suggesting that it is plausible that the estimate represents a real effect of regulation.

Relative to the Table 4 means, the point estimate suggests that each additional child represents an

increase/decrease in the probability of accidental death of 3.7%.

         The fact that these ratios have effects of different signs (which persists if each measure is

entered separately) suggests that the indirect effects of changing ratios in day care centers may

outweigh the direct effects on accident rates within the day care. Suppose for example, that

allowing higher ratios in day care centers draws children from less safe forms of child care into

day care. Then accident rates may fall even if the day care centers themselves become slightly

less safe. On the other hand, increasing the ratio in family homes increases accident rates, as one

would expect if this represents the direct effect of regulation.

         It is interesting to examine the effects of the control variables as well. Table 6 shows that

black children and male children have about the same chance of being killed while riding in a car

as other children, but that they have much higher rates of other accidents. Consistent with the

literature, we find that living in a one-parent family greatly increases the probability of other fatal

accidents. Poverty significantly reduces the probability of an accidental death, but this effect

appears to be driven by a reduction in automobile deaths, which presumably reflects lower use of

cars among the poor.

         Finally, it is interesting that states with high shares of Hispanics have lower death rates

from all the causes examined in Table 6, and especially from other accidents. This observation is

consistent with the “epidemiological paradox” that Hispanic children tend to have better health

outcomes than other children even though they are poorer on average (Hernandez and Charney,

1998).

                                                  27
        Table 7 shows separate estimates for blacks and whites. The estimated effects of

minimum education requirements are consistent with those shown in Table 6 in that these

requirements significantly reduce both types of accidents but have much stronger effects for

“other” accidents than for deaths to car passengers. However, it is remarkable that the estimated

effect for blacks is twice as great as the effect for whites.

        An interesting set of results in Table 7 concern the differential racial effects of insurance

and inspections. Table 7 suggests that mandatory insurance reduces the incidence of other

accidents among whites, but not among blacks, while increasing the number of inspections has a

negative effect among blacks but not among whites. Similarly, allowing higher ratios in day care

centers has a larger negative effect on blacks than whites, while the effect of increasing ratios in

family homes is negative, but not significant among blacks.

        Recall that inspections apply mainly to family homes, while mandatory insurance applies

mainly to day care centers. Thus, it is possible that these patterns are explained by differential

usage of day care centers and family homes by race. As discussed above, blacks are more likely

to use Head Start. But they may be less likely to use commercial child care centers (c.f. Fuller,

1992), and commercial child care facilities may be more likely to be affected by regulation than

non-profit centers that are already of high quality.

c) An Analysis of Choice of Child Care Mode

        We argue above that the seemingly perverse effects of some types of child care regulation

on some groups (such as positive effects of more frequent inspections on accident rates among

children of high school dropouts, and positive effects of lower day care ratios) may reflect a

crowding out effect. By increasing the cost of regulated child care, regulation may increase the

probability that a child is in an unregulated environment. Moreover, if crowdout is a significant

                                                   28
problem, then our methods should provide lower bounds on the positive direct effects of child

care regulation on the safety of regulated care because they reflect the combined impact of both

improved safety in the child care setting and crowdout. These issues are investigated in Table 8.

       The regression models underlying Table 8 are similar to equation (6) except that maternal

employment and interactions between child care regulations and maternal employment are

omitted. The reason for this omission is that many women in the base “no child care” group are

not using child care because they are not employed (that is, the choice of child care mode and the

choice of employment status are simultaneously determined). Also, these models do not control

for child fixed effects since we have few observations per child in this smaller data set, although

they do control for within-child correlations in the error terms.

       The results in Table 8 suggest that some regulations have significant effects on mode

choice. In particular, requiring insurance significantly reduces the probability that day care

centers are chosen. The effect is larger for blacks than for whites, and it is larger for high school

dropouts than for the college educated. Mandatory insurance is also estimated to have a negative

effect on the use of other child care by blacks, which may reflect difficulties in sorting out the

regulated and unregulated sectors in the NLSY data. Alternatively, regulations that crowd people

out of the regulated sector may also crowd people out of the unregulated sector if the supply of

spaces in the unregulated sector is not perfectly elastic.

       Requiring more frequent inspections also has a negative effect on the use of child care

among blacks, but does not have any statistically significant effect overall, or in other subgroups.

It is perhaps noteworthy, however, that the point estimates for children of high school dropouts is

very large and negative, though imprecisely estimated.

       Allowing higher ratios of children to caregivers in daycares has the expected positive

                                                  29
effect on the use of regulated care overall, among whites, and among those with a high school

education. Allowing higher ratios in family homes is estimated to have a negative effect on the

use of regulated care among high school dropouts, which may reflect strong tastes for smaller

ratios among a group that historically has weaker attachment to the labor force in any case.

        Finally, we find that minimum education requirements are not associated with any

statistically significant crowdout effects. This result is important because it suggests that the

estimated effects of minimum education requirements on accident rates are not contaminated by

crowdout. Thus, minimum education requirements appear to reduce the rates of both fatal and

non-fatal accidents, without pushing children out of the regulated sector.

7.   Conclusions

        We examine the effects of maternal employment on one very important but neglected

indicator of child well-being, accident rates. Using individual-level data from the NLSY Child-

Mother files, we examine the probability that a child had an accident requiring medical attention.

We find that the effect of maternal employment varies by demographic group, with blacks seeing

negative effects on accident rates, and whites seeing positive effects in models that control for

child fixed effects. Although this data is subject to reporting biases, we argue that these biases

are unlikely to explain this differential racial effect.

        Our proposed explanation for this pattern of results is that the effects of maternal

employment are mediated by the quality of the alternative child care arrangements that are

available. Children whose mothers have access to child care that is of better quality than maternal

care see positive effects of maternal employment, while those who are in care that is of worse

quality than maternal care are more likely to suffer injury when their mothers are employed. In

practice, the NLSY data suggest that the interactions between maternal employment and child

                                                   30
care regulation are complex. The effects vary both with the type of regulation and with the

demographic group.

       However, we find strong and consistent evidence that requiring care givers to have

education beyond high school reduces accident rates. When we examine non-fatal accidents

using the NLSY data, we find that requiring caregivers to have at least a high school education is

associated with reductions in the incidence of unintentional injuries requiring medical attention

among whites, among children whose mothers have less than a high school degree, and among

the children of college educated mothers.

       When we examine the incidence of fatal accidents using the Vital Statistics data, we see

that higher education requirements for caregivers are associated with reductions in accident rates

among both whites and blacks, and in fact we see larger reductions for blacks than for whites.

       In an examination of the choice of child care modes, we find no evidence that higher

education requirements lead to children being crowded out of the regulated sector. Thus, higher

education requirements appear to be a good public policy. They reduce both fatal and non-fatal

accident rates without reducing children’s access to regulated care.

       We find only small effects of the regulation of child-to-caregiver ratios on accident rates,

although such regulation does have effects on the choice of child care mode. This finding is

reminiscent of a common result in the class size and school quality literature. Lazear (1999)

argues that if student/teacher ratios are currently set close to optimum levels, then one would not

expect small deviations from the optimum to have a big impact on outcomes. This observation

offers one potential explanation of the paradox that the most regulated aspect of child care




                                                31
quality has only small impacts on child outcomes.13

         On the other hand, requiring more than one inspection per year has statistically significant

but mixed effects. We find that it increases the incidence of non-fatal injuries requiring medical

attention among children of less educated mothers, but that it reduces the incidence of fatal

injuries among blacks. Our analysis of the choice of child care modes indicates that more

frequent inspections also reduce the probability that black children receive any sort of non-

maternal care. Thus, the positive direct effects of inspections on children in regulated care may

be offset by crowdout. In this case, our estimates of the effects of inspection underestimate the

positive direct effects of inspection on the safety of children in child care.

         We also find that requiring insurance lowers the incidence of fatal injuries among whites,

but not among blacks. Our analysis of choice of child care mode suggests that this type of

regulation is associated with a lower probability of using day care centers, and that this effect is

greater for blacks than for whites. Thus, once again, our analysis suggests that this type of

regulation creates winners and losers, depending on whether or not the large crowdout effects

outweigh the beneficial direct effects of regulation.




13
  Another analogy with the school quality literature is that that literature typically examines small changes in
child/teacher ratios, and in our data, the changes in ratios over time are also small.
