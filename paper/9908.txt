                                           ABSTRACT

This paper introduces the concept of "debt intolerance," which manifests itself in the extreme duress
many emerging markets experience at debt levels that would seem manageable by advanced country
standards. We argue that "safe" external debt-to-GNP thresholds for debt intolerant countries are

low, perhaps as low as 15 percent in some cases. These thresholds depend on a country's default and
inflation history. Debt intolerance is linked to the phenomenon of serial default that has plagued

many countries over the past two centuries. Understanding and measuring debt intolerance is
fundamental to assess the problems of debt sustainability, debt restructuring, capital market
integration, and the scope for international lending to ameliorate crises. Our goal is to make a first
pass at quantifying debt intolerance, including delineating debtors' clubs and regions of

vulnerability, on the basis on a history of credit events going back to the 1820s for over 100
countries.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION


        In this paper we argue that history matters: that a country’s record at meeting its debt

obligations and managing its macroeconomy in the past is relevant to forecasting its ability to

sustain moderate to high levels of indebtedness, both domestic and external, for many years into

the future. We introduce the concept of debt intolerance (drawing an analogy to, for example,

“lactose intolerance”), which manifests itself in the extreme duress many emerging market

economies experience at overall debt levels that would seem quite manageable by the standards

of the advanced industrial economies. For external debt, “safe” thresholds for highly debt-

intolerant emerging markets appear to be surprisingly low, perhaps as low as 15 to 20 percent

of GNP in many cases, and these thresholds depend heavily on the country’s record of default

and inflation. Debt intolerance is indeed intimately linked to the pervasive phenomenon of

serial default that has plagued so many countries over the past two centuries. Debt-intolerant

countries tend to have weak fiscal structures and weak financial systems. Default often

exacerbates these problems, making these same countries more prone to future default.

Understanding and measuring debt intolerance is fundamental to assessing the problems of debt

sustainability, debt restructuring, capital market integration, and to assessing the scope for

international lending to ameliorate crises.

        Certainly, the idea that factors such as sound institutions and a history of good economic

management affect the interest rate at which a country can borrow is well developed in the

theoretical literature. Also well established is the notion that, as its external debt rises, a

country becomes more vulnerable to being suddenly shut out of international capital markets,
                                                     -4-




that is, to suffer a debt crisis.1 However, there has to date been no attempt to make these

abstract theories operational by identifying the factors (in particular, a history of serial default

or restructuring) that govern how quickly a country becomes vulnerable to a debt crisis as its

external obligations accumulate. One goal of this paper is to quantify this debt intolerance,

drawing on a history of adverse credit events going back to the 1820s. We argue that a

country’s current level of debt intolerance can be approximated empirically as the ratio of the

long-term average of its external debt (scaled by GNP or exports) to an index of default risk.

We recognize that other factors, such as the degree of dollarization, indexation to inflation or

short-term interest rates, and the maturity structure of a country’s debt, are also relevant to

assessing a country’s vulnerability to symptoms of debt intolerance.2 We argue, however, that

in general these factors are different manifestations of the same underlying institutional

weaknesses. Indeed, unless these weaknesses are addressed, the notion that the “original sin”

of serial defaulters can be extinguished through some stroke of financial engineering, allowing

these countries to borrow in the same amounts, relative to GNP, as more advanced economies,

much less at the same interest rates, is sheer folly.3

           The first section of the paper gives a brief overview of the history of serial default on

external debt, showing that it is a remarkably pervasive and enduring phenomenon: the

European countries set benchmarks, centuries ago, that today’s emerging markets have yet to

    See Goldstein (2003) for a comprehensive discussion of these factors.

  Some analysts, such as Eichengreen, Hausmann, and Panizza (2002), have put the blame for recurring debt cycles
on the incompleteness of international capital markets and have proposed mechanisms to make it easier for
emerging market economies to borrow more. Needless to say, our view is that the main problem for these countries
is how to borrow less. For another critical discussion of the notion of original sin, argued on different grounds, see
Reinhart and Reinhart (2003).

surpass. For example, Spain defaulted on its external debt thirteen times between 1500 and

1900, whereas Venezuela, the record holder in our sample for the period since 1824, has

defaulted “only” nine times. We go on to show how countries can be divided into debtors’

“clubs” and, within those clubs, more or less debt-intolerant “regions,” depending on their

credit and inflation history. We also develop first broad-brush measures of safe debt thresholds.

The data overwhelmingly suggest that the thresholds for emerging market economies with high

debt intolerance are much lower than those for advanced industrial economies or for those

emerging market economies that have never defaulted on their external debt. Indeed, fully half

of all defaults or restructurings since 1970 took place in countries with ratios of external debt to

GNP below 60 percent.4

         Our key finding, presented in the second section of the paper, is that a country’s external

debt intolerance can be explained by a very small number of variables related to its repayment

history, indebtedness level, and history of macroeconomic stability. Markets view highly debt-

intolerant countries as having an elevated risk of default, even at relatively low ratios of debt to

output or exports. Whether markets adequately price this risk is an open question, but it is

certainly a risk that the citizens of debt-intolerant countries should be aware of when their

leaders engage in heavy borrowing.

         The third section turns to the question of how debt intolerance affects conventional

calculations of debt sustainability, which typically assume continual market access. For debt-

4
  See Sims (2001) for a model that implies that an economy with low taxation and low indebtedness may optimally
repudiate its debt, or inflate at high rates, more frequently than an economy that has inherited high levels of
taxation and debt (as have some industrial economies). Indeed, as we shall see, and consistent with some of the
predictions of that model, the countries with the highest historical default probabilities, and the highest probability
of inflation rates above 40 percent a year, also had (on average) much lower levels of debt than the typical
industrial economy.

intolerant countries, sustaining access to capital markets can be problematic unless debt ratios

are quickly brought down to safer levels. To assess how such “deleveraging” might be

accomplished, we examine how, historically, emerging market economies with substantial

external debts have managed to work them down. To our knowledge, this is a phenomenon that

has previously received very little, if any, attention. We analyze episodes of large debt

reversals, where countries’ external debt fell by more than 25 percentage points of GNP over a

three-year period. Of the twenty-two such reversals that we identify for a broad group of

middle-income countries since 1970, almost two-thirds involved some form of default or

restructuring. (Throughout this paper, “restructuring” denotes a recontracting of debt service

payments at terms that are tantamount to partial default.) Only in one case—Swaziland in

1985—was a country able to bring down a high ratio of external debt to GNP solely as a result

of rapid output growth.

       Because history plays such a large role in our analysis, we focus primarily on

understanding emerging market economies’ access to external capital markets. For most

emerging markets, external borrowing has been the only financial game in town for much of the

past two centuries, and our debt thresholds are calculated accordingly. Over the past decade or

so, however, a number of emerging market economies have, for the first time, seen a rapid

expansion in domestic, market-based debt, as we document using an extensive new data set,

which we present in the paper’s fourth section. The calculus of domestic default obviously

differs from that of default on external debt, and we lack sufficient historical data to investigate

this question fully. However, we argue that a record of external debt intolerance is likely to be

a good predictor of future domestic debt intolerance. It is certainly the case that many of the

major debt crises of the past ten years have involved domestic debt, and that the countries that
                                                   -7-




seem to be experiencing “domestic debt intolerance” rank high on our debt intolerance

measures.5

        Finally, if serial default is such a pervasive phenomenon, why do markets repeatedly

lend to debt-intolerant countries to the point where the risk of a credit event—a default or a

restructuring—becomes significant? Part of the reason may have to do with the procyclical

nature of capital markets, which have repeatedly lent vast sums to emerging market economies

in boom periods (which are often associated with low returns in the industrial countries) only to

retrench when adverse shocks occur, producing painful “sudden stops.”6 As for the extent to

which borrowing countries themselves are complicit in the problem, one can only conclude

that, throughout history, governments have often been too short-sighted (or too corrupt) to

internalize the significant risks that overborrowing produces over the longer term. Moreover, in

the modern era, multilateral institutions have been too complacent (or have had too little

leverage) when loans were pouring in. Thus a central conclusion of this paper is that, for debt-

intolerant countries, mechanisms to limit borrowing, either through institutional change on the

  Some policymakers, of course, have come to recognize the problem at least since the Mexican debt crisis of 1994.
The academic literature has lagged behind, in part because of lack of data, but also because the theoretical
connections between external and domestic debt have not been well articulated. Nonetheless, among the
participants in this debate, Ronald McKinnon merits special mention for anticipating the emergence of domestic
government debt as a problem to be reckoned with. McKinnon wrote in 1991 that “One of the most striking
developments of the late 1980s was the extent to which the governments of Mexico, Argentina and Brazil went
into debt domestically. Because of the cumulative effect of very high interest rates ... on their existing domestic
liabilities, government-debt-to-GNP ratios have been building up in an unsustainable fashion even though most of
these countries are not paying much on their debts to international banks. In many [developing countries], people
now anticipate that governments will default on its own domestic bonds—as in March 1990 with the Brazilian
government's freeze of its own outstanding liabilities" (McKinnon, 1991, p. 6).

  The procyclicality of capital flows to developing countries has been amply documented, particularly since Carlos
Díaz-Alejandro called attention to the phenomenon on the eve of the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s
(Díaz-Alejandro, 1983, 1984). For a recent and systematic review of the evidence on the procyclicality of capital
flows, see Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh (2003).

debtor side, or—in the case of external borrowing—through changes in the legal or regulatory

systems of creditor countries, are probably desirable.7



              II. DEBT INTOLERANCE: ORIGINS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR BORROWING

         We begin by sketching the history of debt intolerance and serial default, to show how

this history importantly influences what “debtors’ club” a country belongs to.

Debt Intolerance and Serial Default in Historical Perspective.

         A bit of historical context will help to explain our approach, which draws on a country’s

long-term debt history. The basic point is that many countries that have defaulted on their

external debts have done so repeatedly, with remarkable similarities across the cycles. For

example, many of the Latin American countries that are experiencing severe debt problems

today also experienced debt problems in the 1980s—and in the 1930s, and in the 1870s, and in

the 1820s, and generally at other times as well. Brazil, whose debt problems have attracted

much attention lately, has defaulted seven times on its external debt over the past 175 years.

During that same period, Venezuela has defaulted nine times, as noted at the outset, and

Argentina four times, not counting its most recent episode. But the problem is by no means

limited to Latin America. For example, Turkey, which has been a center of attention of late,

has defaulted six times over the past 175 years. These same countries have at times also

defaulted, de facto, on their internal obligations, including through high inflation or

hyperinflation. On the other side of the ledger, a number of countries have strikingly averted


7
  The need for institutional and legal changes to help rechannel capital flows to developing countries from debt
toward foreign direct investment, other forms of equity, and aid, so as to prevent the recurrence of debt crises, is
the central theme of Bulow and Rogoff (1990).
                                                   -9-




outright default, or restructuring that reduced the present value of their debt, over the decades

and centuries. India, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are members of this honor roll.

         The contrast between the histories of the nondefaulters and those of the serial defaulters,

summarized in table 1, is stunning. Default can become a way of life. Over the period from

1824 to 2001, the debts of Brazil and Argentina were either in default or undergoing

restructuring a quarter of the time, those of Venezuela and Colombia almost 40 percent of the

time, and that of Mexico for almost half of all the years since its independence. On average, the

serial defaulters have had annual inflation exceeding 40 percent roughly a quarter of the time as

well.8 By contrast, the emerging market economies in the table that have no external default

history do not count a single twelve-month period with inflation over 40 percent among them.

For future reference, the table also includes a sampling of advanced economies with no modern

history of external default.




8
 The list of serial defaulters in table 1 is far from complete. Russia’s 1998 default was hardly the first for that
country (as table 2 shows, although the period covered does not include the default on the tsarist debt after the
1917 revolution ). Many other countries have also defaulted on their external debts, including, recently, Indonesia
and Ukraine in 1998, Pakistan in 1999, and Ecuador in 2000.

        Today’s emerging markets did not invent serial default. It has been practiced in Europe

since at least the sixteenth century, as table 2 illustrates. As already noted, Spain defaulted on

its debt thirteen times from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, with the first

recorded default in 1557 and the last in 1882. In the nineteenth century alone, Portugal,

Germany, and Austria defaulted on their external debts five times, and Greece, with four

defaults during that period, was not far behind. France defaulted on its debt eight times

between 1550 and 1800. (Admittedly, the French governments’ debts were mainly held

internally before 1700, and “restructuring” was often accomplished simply by beheading the

creditors—giving new meaning to the term “capital punishment.”9)

        This central fact—that some countries seem to default periodically, and others never—

both compels us to write on this topic and organizes our thinking. True, as we will later

illustrate, history is not everything. Countries can eventually outgrow debt intolerance, but the

process tends to be exceedingly slow, and backsliding is extremely difficult to avoid.

Is Serial Default Really Such a Problem?

        What does history tell us about the true costs of default? Might periodic default (or

equivalently, restructuring) simply be a mechanism for making debt more equity-like, that is,

for effectively indexing a country’s debt service to its output performance? After all, defaults

  Episodes of saignée, or bloodletting, of financiers took place a few years after several of France’s defaults,
including those of 1558, 1624, and 1661, when particularly prominent creditors of the government were executed;

typically occur during economic downturns.10 Although there must be some truth to this

argument, our reading of history is that the deadweight costs to defaulting on external debt can

be significant, particularly for a country’s trade, investment flows, and economic growth. In

more advanced economies, external default can often cause lasting damage to a country’s

financial system, not least because of linkages between domestic and foreign financial markets.


10
  Bulow and Rogoff (1989) argue that one alternative, namely, formal output indexation clauses, although
preferable to nonindexed debt, might be difficult to verify or enforce.
                                            - 13 -




Indeed, although we do not investigate the issue here, we conjecture that one of the reasons why

countries without a default history go to great lengths to avoid defaulting is precisely to protect

their banking and financial systems. Conversely, weak financial intermediation in many serial

defaulters lowers their penalty to default. The lower costs of financial disruption that these

countries face may induce them to default at lower thresholds, further weakening their financial

systems and perpetuating the cycle. One might make the same comment about tax systems, a

point to which we will return at the end of the paper. Countries where capital flight and tax

avoidance are high tend to have greater difficulty meeting debt payments, forcing governments

to seek more revenue from relatively inelastic tax sources, in turn exacerbating flight and

avoidance. Default amplifies and ingrains this cycle.

       We certainly do not want to overstate the costs of default or restructuring, especially for

serial defaulters. In fact, we will later show that debt-intolerant countries rarely choose to grow

or pay their way out of heavy external debt burdens without at least partial default. This

revealed preference on the part of debt-intolerant countries surely tells us something. Indeed,

many question whether, in the long run, the costs of allowing or precipitating a default exceed

the costs of an international bailout, at least for some spectacular historical cases. But there is

another side to the question of whether debt-intolerant countries really do borrow too much, and

that has to do with the benefit side of the equation. Our reading of the evidence, at least from

the 1980s and 1990s, is that external borrowing was often driven by shortsighted governments

that were willing to take significant risks to raise consumption temporarily, rather than to foster

high-return investment projects. The fact that the gains from borrowing come quickly, whereas

the increased risk of default is borne only in the future, tilts shortsighted governments toward

excessive debt. So, although the costs of default are indeed often overstated, the benefits to be
                                            - 14 -




reaped from external borrowing are often overstated even more, especially if one looks at the

longer-term welfare of the citizens of debtor countries.

       What does history tell us about the lenders? We do not need to tackle this question here.

Each of the periodic debt cycles the world has witnessed has had its own unique character,

either in the nature of the lender (for example, bondholders in the 1930s and 1990s versus

banks in the 1970s and 1980s) or in the nature of the domestic borrower (for example, state-

owned railroads in the 1870s versus core governments themselves in the 1980s). There are,

however, clearly established cycles in lending to emerging markets, with money often pouring

in when rates of return in industrialized countries are low. Heavy borrowers are particularly

vulnerable to “sudden stops,” or reversals, when returns in industrial countries once again pick

up.

Debt Thresholds

       Few macroeconomists would be surprised to learn that emerging market economies with

ratios of external debt to GNP above 150 percent run a significant risk of default. After all,

among advanced economies, Japan’s current debt-to-GDP ratio, at 120 percent, is almost

universally considered high. Yet default can and does occur at ratios of external debt to GNP

that would not be considered “excessive” for the typical advanced economy: for example,

Mexico’s 1982 debt crisis occurred at a ratio of debt to GNP of 47 percent, and Argentina’s

2001 crisis at a ratio slightly above 50 percent.

       We begin our investigation of the debt thresholds of emerging market economies by

chronicling all episodes of default or restructuring of external debt among middle-income
                                                - 15 -




economies during the period from 1970 to 2001.11 Table 3 lists thirty countries that suffered at

least one default or restructuring during that period, the first year of each episode, and the

country’s ratios of external debt to GNP and to exports at the end of the year in which the

episode occurred. (Many episodes lasted several years.) It is obvious from the table that

Mexico’s 1982 default and Argentina’s 2001 default were not exceptions: many other countries

also suffered adverse credit events at levels of debt below 50 percent of GNP.




11
  Following the World Bank, for some purposes we divide developing countries by income per capita into two
broad groups: middle-income countries (those developing countries with GNP per capita higher than $755 in 1999)
and low-income countries (those below that level). Most but not all emerging market economies—defined here as
developing economies with substantial access to private external financing—are middle-income countries, and
most but not all low-income countries have no access to private capital markets and instead rely primarily on
official sources of external funding.

           Table 4 shows further that external debt exceeded 100 percent of GNP in only 13

percent of these episodes, that more than half of the default episodes occurred at ratios of debt to

GNP below 60 percent, and that defaults occurred despite debt being less than 40 percent of GNP

in 13 percent of episodes.12 (Indeed, the external debt-to-GNP thresholds reported in table 3 are

biased upward, because the debt-to-GNP ratios corresponding to the year of the credit event are

driven up by the real depreciation that typically accompanies the event.)

           We next compare the external indebtedness profiles of emerging market economies with

  and without a history of default. The top panel of figure 1 shows the frequency distribution of

  the external debt-to-GNP ratio, and the bottom panel the external debt-to-exports ratio, for two

  groups of countries over the period 1970–2000. The two distributions are very distinct

    Tables 3 and 4 measure gross total external debt, as debtor governments have little capacity to tax or otherwise
  confiscate private citizens’ assets held abroad. When Argentina defaulted in 2001 on $140 billion of external debt,
  for example, the foreign assets held by its citizens abroad were estimated by some commentators at about $120
  billion to $150 billion. This phenomenon is not uncommon and indeed was the norm in the 1980s debt crisis.

and show that defaulters borrow more than nondefaulters (even though their ratings tend to be

worse at a given level of debt). The gap in external debt ratios between those emerging market

economies with and those without a history of default widens further when the ratio of external

debt to exports is considered. It appears that those countries that risk default the most when

they borrow (that is, those with the greatest debt intolerance) also borrow the most, much as if a

lactose-intolerant individual were addicted to milk. It should be no surprise, then, that so many

capital flow cycles end in an ugly credit event.

         Table 5 presents a subset of the numbers that underpin figure 1, as well as the

cumulative distribution of external debt-to-GNP ratios for defaulters and nondefaulters. Over

half of the countries with sound credit histories have ratios of external debt to GNP below

35 percent (and 47 percent have ratios below 30 percent). By contrast, for those countries with

a relatively tarnished credit history, a threshold external debt-to-GNP ratio above 40 percent is

required to capture the majority of observations. We can see already from tables 4 and 5,

without taking into account any country-specific factors that might explain debt intolerance,

that when external debt exceeds 30 to 35 percent of GNP in a debt-intolerant country, the risk

of a credit event starts to increase significantly.13 We will later derive country-specific bounds

that are much stricter for debt-intolerant countries.




13
  Using an altogether different approach, an International Monetary Fund (2002) study of debt sustainability
arrived at external debt thresholds for developing countries (excluding the heavily indebted poor countries) in the
neighborhood of 31 to 39 percent, depending on whether one includes official financing in the indebtedness
measure. The results we present later suggest that country-specific thresholds for debt-intolerant countries are
probably much lower.

The Components of Debt Intolerance

        To operationalize the measurement of debt intolerance, we focus on two indicators: the

sovereign debt ratings reported by Institutional Investor, and the external debt-to-GNP ratio (or,

alternatively, the external debt-to-exports ratio). The Institutional Investor ratings (IIR), which

are compiled twice a year, are based on information provided by economists and sovereign risk

analysts at leading global banks and securities firms. The ratings grade each country on a scale

from 0 to 100, with a rating of 100 given to those countries perceived as having the lowest
                                                      - 21 -




chance of defaulting on their government debt obligations.14 Hence we take the transformed

variable (100 - IIR) as a proxy for default risk. Market-based measures of default risk are also

available, but only for a much smaller group of countries and over a much shorter sample

period.15

           The second major component of our debt intolerance measure is total external debt,

scaled either by GNP or by exports. We emphasize total (public and private) external debt

because most government debt in emerging markets until the late 1980s was external, and

because it often happens that external debt that was private before a crisis becomes public after

the fact.16 (As we later show, however, in future analyses it will be equally important to

measure intolerance with reference to the growing stock of domestic public debt.)

           Figure 2 plots against each other the major components of debt intolerance for each year

in the period 1979–2000 for sixteen emerging market economies. As expected, our preferred

risk measure (100 - IIR) tends to rise with the stock of external debt, but the relationship may

be nonlinear. In particular, when the risk measure is very high (concretely, when the IIR index




14
  For details of the survey see the September 2002 issue of Institutional Investor. Although not critical to our
analysis below, we interpret the ratings reported in each semiannual survey as capturing the near-term risk of
default within one to two years.

   Secondary market prices of external commercial bank debt, available since the mid-1980s, provide a measure of
expected repayment for a number of emerging market countries. However, the Brady debt restructurings of the
1990s converted much of this bank debt to bonds, so that from 1992 onward the secondary market prices would
have to be replaced by the Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) spread, which remains the most commonly used
measure of risk today. These market-based indicators introduce a serious sample selection bias, however: almost
all the countries in the EMBI, and all the countries for which secondary-market price data from the 1980s are
available, had a history of adverse credit events, leaving the control group of nondefaulters as approximately the
null set.

falls below 30), it matters little whether the external debt-to-GNP ratio is 80 percent or 160

percent, or whether the external debt-to-exports ratio is 300 percent or 700 percent. This

nonlinearity simply reflects the fact that, below a certain threshold of the IIR, typically about

24, the country has usually lost all access to private capital markets.17

        Table 6 shows the period averages of various measures of risk and external debt (the

components of debt intolerance) for a representative sample of countries, which we will refer to

as our core sample (see appendix B). Because some researchers have argued that the “right”

benchmark for emerging market indebtedness is the level of public debt that advanced

economies are able to sustain,18 table 6 also includes this measure for a group of nondefaulting

advanced economies. The table makes plain that, although the relationship between external

debt and risk may be monotonic for emerging market economies, it is clearly not monotonic for

the public debt of advanced economies; in those countries, relatively high levels of government

debt can coexist with low levels of risk. Table 6, together with table 7, which shows the panel

pairwise correlations between the two debt ratios and three measures of risk for a larger sample

of developing economies, also highlights the fact that the different measures of risk present a

very similar picture both of countries’ relative debt intolerance and of the correlation between

risk and indebtedness. As anticipated by figure 2, the correlations are uniformly positive in all

regional groupings and are usually statistically significant.

   A similar picture emerges (for a smaller sample, not shown) when one uses other measures of default risk such
as secondary market prices of commercial bank debt or EMBI spreads.

Debt Intolerance: Clubs and Regions

       We next use our component measures of debt intolerance—IIR risk ratings and external

debt ratios—in a two-step algorithm, mapped in figure 3, to define debtors’ clubs and

vulnerability regions. We begin by calculating the mean (45.9) and standard deviation (21.8) of

the IIR for fifty-three developing and industrial countries over 1979–2002, and we use these

statistics to loosely group countries into three “clubs” (the countries and their period averages

are listed in appendix table B1). Club A includes those countries whose average IIR over the

period 1979–2002 is 67.7 (the mean plus one standard deviation) or above; members of this

club–essentially, the advanced economies—enjoy virtually continuous access to capital
                                                - 26 -




markets. As their repayment history and debt absorption capacity show (tables 1and 3), these

countries are the least debt intolerant. At the opposite extreme, in club C, are those countries

whose average IIR is below 24.2 (the mean minus one standard deviation). This club includes

those countries that are so debt intolerant that markets give them only sporadic opportunities to

borrow; hence their primary sources of external financing are grants and official loans.

        Club B includes the remaining countries and are the main focus of our analysis. These

countries exhibit varying degrees of debt intolerance.19 They occupy the “indeterminate” region

of theoretical debt models, the region where default risk is nontrivial, and where self-fulfilling

debt runs may trigger a crisis. Club B is large and includes both countries that are on the cusp of

graduation to club A as well as countries that may be on the brink of default. The membership

of club B therefore requires further discrimination. Our preferred creditworthiness measure,

100- IIR, is no longer a sufficient statistic, and information on the extent of leveraging (the

second component of debt intolerance) is necessary to pin down more precisely the relative

degree of debt intolerance within this club.

        Hence, in the second step, our algorithm further subdivides the “indeterminate” club B

into four “regions,” ranging from least to most debt intolerant. The region of least debt

intolerance (which we call region I) includes those countries whose average IIR over 1979–

2002 was above the mean and whose ratio of external debt to GNP was below 35 percent. (As

previously noted, countries below that threshold account for over half of the observations

among nondefaulters over 1970–2001.) Region II includes countries whose average IIR is



19
 One is reminded of Groucho Marx’s aphorism, “I don’t care to belong to any club that will have me as a
member.” As will be shown, membership in club B is not a privilege.

above the mean but whose external debt-to-GNP ratio is above 35 percent. Because their

higher-than-average long run creditworthiness enables them to sustain a higher-than-average

external debt burden, this is the second-least debt-intolerant group. More debt intolerant still

are the region III countries, whose long-run creditworthiness (as measured by their average IIR)

is below the mean and whose external debt is below 35 percent of GNP. Lastly, the countries in

Club B with the highest debt intolerance are those in region IV, with an average IIR below the

mean and external debt levels above 35 percent of GNP. Countries in region IV can easily fall

into club C, losing their market access to credit. For example, in early 2000 Argentina’s IIR

was 43 and its external debt-to-GNP ratio was 51 percent, making it a region IV country. As of

September 2002, Argentina’s IIR had dropped to 15.8, indicating that the country had backslid

into club C. As we will see, countries do not graduate to higher clubs easily; indeed, it can take

many decades of impeccable repayment performance and low debt levels to graduate from club

B to club A.



                             III. DEBT INTOLERANCE: THE ROLE OF HISTORY

           We begin this section by offering some basic insights into the historical origins of

country risk, which some have mislabeled as “original sin.”20 In particular, we focus on

countries’ credit and inflation histories. We then use our core results for several purposes: to

illustrate how to calculate country-specific debt thresholds, in contrast to the coarse threshold

(an external debt-to-GNP ratio of 35 percent) derived earlier; to show how countries in club B

shift between debt intolerance regions over time; to illustrate how countries may graduate into a

     See, for example, Eichengreen, Hausmann, and Panizza (2002).
                                                  - 29 -




better club; and to show how a simple summary statistic can rank countries within club B

according to their relative degree of debt intolerance.

Historical Determinants of Country Risk

        To prepare to investigate econometrically the link between a country’s external credit

and inflation history, on the one hand, and its sovereign risk, on the other, we broaden our

sample from the twenty countries listed in table 6 to the fifty-three industrial and developing

economies listed in appendix table B1. The IIR rating, our preferred measure of

creditworthiness, is the dependent variable in all the regressions. To measure a country’s credit

history, we calculate the percentage of years in the sample when the country was either in

default on its external debt or undergoing a restructuring of its debt. Two different periods are

analyzed: 1824–1999 and 1946–1999. Another indicator of credit history we use is the number

of years since the country’s last default or restructuring on its external debt. We also calculate

for each country the percentage of twelve-month periods during 1948–2000 when annual

inflation was above 40 percent.21 Although it is quite reasonable to expect that debt intolerance

may itself lead to a higher probability of default (because markets charge a higher premium on

borrowing) or a higher probability of inflation (because often the country has few other sources

of deficit financing), we are not too concerned about the potential endogeneity of these two

regressors, because they are largely predetermined relative to the main sample period, which is

1979–2000.22



21
  For a discussion of why 40 percent seems a reasonable threshold for high inflation, see Easterly (2001) and
Reinhart and Rogoff (2002).
22
 An obvious way of extending this analysis of credit history would be to distinguish between peacetime and
wartime defaults and gather additional information about governments’ violation of other contracts, such as
                                                                                                    (continued)
                                                    - 30 -




         However, using 1970–2000 averages of the external debt-to-GNP ratio (or the external

debt-to-exports ratio) as a regressor does pose a potential endogeneity problem. Therefore we

report the results of both ordinary least-squares and instrumental variable estimations, in the

latter case using the average debt-to-GNP ratio during 1970–78 as an instrument. Because

White’s test revealed heteroskedasticity in the residuals, we correct accordingly to ensure the

consistency of the standard errors. To investigate whether the differences in debt tolerance

between countries in club A and the rest of the sample are systematic, we also use a dummy

variable for club A in the regressions, allowing the club A countries to have a different slope

coefficient on the debt-to-GNP ratio.

         Table 8 presents the results of six different specifications of the cross-country

regressions. The results show that few variables suffice to account for a significant portion

(about 75 percent) of the cross-country variation in creditworthiness as measured by the IIR.

As expected, a poor track record on repayment or inflation lowers the rating and increases risk.

In the regressions, all but the debt-to-GNP coefficients are constrained to be the same for club

A and all other countries. One common and robust result across these regressions is that the

external debt-to-GNP ratio enters with a negative (and significant) coefficient for all the

countries in clubs B and C, whereas it has a positive coefficient for the advanced economies in

club A.23 As we will show next, this result is robust to the addition of a time dimension to the




defaults on domestic debt or forcible conversions of dollar deposits into local currency (as occurred in Bolivia in
1982, Mexico in 1982, Peru in 1985, and Argentina in 2002).
23
  The estimated coefficient for the club A countries captures both institutional and structural factors specific to
those countries as well as the different concept of debt (total public debt as opposed to total external debt) used for
those cases (see appendix A).

regressions. Although not reported here, these results are equally robust to the use of the

external debt-to-exports ratio in lieu of the external debt-to-GNP ratio as a regressor.

        We also performed two panel regressions (estimated with fixed effects and robust

standard errors) in which the IIR was regressed against the external debt-to-GNP ratio and three

dummy variables representing periods roughly corresponding to the phases of the most recent

debt cycle. The results are as follows:

IIRit = α it – 3.01X1 - 12.22X2 – 7.01X3 – 0.13X4
               (-2.06) (-8.98) (-5.13) (-10.37)

Adjusted R2 = 0.78; N = 769

IIRit = α it – 3.61X1 - 12.33X2 – 6.62X3 – 0.11X4 + 0.01X5
               (-2.90) (-10.69) (-5.60) (-9.24) (0.04)

Adjusted R2 = 0.91; N = 1,030 (t statistics in parentheses).

        In these regressions, α it are the country-specific fixed effects (see Appendix D), X1 is a

dummy variable for the period immediately before the 1980s debt crisis (1980–82), X2 is a

dummy for the period during the crisis and the Brady plan resolution (1983–93), X3 is a dummy

for the period after the crisis (1994–2000), X4 interacts the country’s external debt-to-GNP ratio

with a dummy variable for clubs B and C, and X5 interacts the debt-to-GNP ratio with a dummy

for club A; i and t index countries and years, respectively. Regressions including year-by-year

dummies (reported in appendix tables D1 and D3) reveal that the IIR data naturally demarcate

these three distinct subperiods. The first of the two regressions above includes thirty-eight of

the fifty-three countries in the cross-sectional regressions (the countries in clubs B and C),

whereas the second regression also includes the fifteen countries in club A and (as before)

allows them to have a different slope coefficient on the debt-to-GNP ratio, in addition to a

different intercept.

        The panel regressions (including those reported in Appendix D) confirm a central

finding of the cross-sectional regressions: debt is significantly and negatively related to the
                                             - 33 -




perceived creditworthiness of the debt-intolerant countries in clubs B and C. In contrast, in the

regression that includes the advanced economies, which make up most of club A, the

coefficient on debt is positive—although, unlike in the cross-sectional results, it is not

statistically significant. The coefficients for the three subperiods are all statistically significant

and their pattern have an intuitive interpretation. Average IIRs were higher across the board

before the debt crisis of the 1980s; these ratings then plummeted as the debt crisis unfolded, and

recovered only partially in the 1990s, never quite reaching their precrisis levels. Thus, debt

intolerance is long lived.

Country-Specific Debt Thresholds

        We now use some of our core results to illustrate that, although an external debt-to-output

ratio of 35 percent is a minimal debt “safety” threshold for those countries that have not made it

to club A, countries with a weak credit history may become highly vulnerable even at much lower

levels of external debt. To illustrate this basic but critical point, we perform the following

exercise. We use the estimated coefficients from the first regression in table 8, together with the

actual values of the regressors, to predict values of the IIR for varying ratios of external debt to

GNP for each country. Table 9 illustrates the exercise for the cases of Argentina and Malaysia

for levels of external debt ranging from 0 to 45 percent of GNP. Until Argentina’s default in

December 2001, both countries were members of club B.

Notes: Authors calculations are based on the coefficients from regression (1) in Table 8.
For countries in club B [24.2 < Institutional Investor Rating (IIR) < 67.7] the four regions (from least to most
vulnerable) defined in Figure 3 are: Least debt intolerant, Type I (45.9 ≤ IIR < 67.7 and Debt/GNP < 35); quasi
debt intolerant, Type II (45.9 ≤ IIR < 67.7 and Debt/GNP > 35); quasi debt intolerant, Type III (25.2 ≤ IIR < 45.9
and Debt/GNP < 35) and; most debt intolerant Type IV (25.2 ≤ IIR < 45.9 and Debt/GNP > 35.)



        The exercise shows clearly that Argentina’s precarious debt intolerance situation is

more severe than Malaysia’s. Argentina remains in the relatively safe region I only as long as

its external debt remains below 15 percent of GNP, whereas Malaysia remains in region I up to

a debt-to GNP ratio of 30 percent, and it is still in the relatively safe region II with a debt of 35

percent of GNP. These contrasting patterns can be seen across a number of other cases (results

not shown): Argentina is representative of the many countries with a relatively weak credit and

inflation history, whereas Malaysia is representative of countries with no history of default or

high inflation.

Moving between Debt Intolerance Regions

       To illustrate how countries in club B can become more or less vulnerable over time,

table 10 presents an exercise similar to that in table 9 for the case of Brazil. The main

difference is that, this time, rather than using hypothetical debt ratios, we estimate IIRs for

Brazil using the country’s actual external debt-to-GNP ratios for each year from 1979 to 2001.

In addition to these estimated IIRs, we report Brazil’s actual IIR in the same year as well as the

difference between the two. The last two columns show the debt intolerance region within club

B in which Brazil actually found itself (based on its external debt and actual IIR, as described in

figure 3) and the region in which it would have fallen based on its external debt and the

estimated IIR. The shaded area indicates the period when Brazil’s external debt was in default

or undergoing a restructuring, and the characters in boldface in the last two columns indicate

the years in which discrepancies are observed between the actual and the estimated region.

       A pattern worth remarking is that Brazil started the estimation period in 1979 with a

fairly high IIR, and although its IIR declined thereafter, it remained quite high until the default

and restructuring of 1983. Also, the gap between Brazil’s actual and its estimated IIR is highest

in the run-up to that credit event. According to its actual IIR and external debt ratio, Brazil was

in the relatively safe region II on the eve of its 1983 default, whereas according to our estimated

IIR it belonged in the most debt-intolerant region (region IV). After the credit event, Brazil

remained in the most debt-intolerant region for a few years by both measures. It is noteworthy

that, whereas the actual IIR was well above the estimated IIR in the years prior to default, it was

below the estimated measure in many of the years when Brazil was in default (though the gap

was not large enough to generate a discrepancy between the actual and predicted regions).

status; bolded numbers in the last two columns indicate the years where there are differences between the actual

This pattern is also evident in many other episodes in our sample (not shown) and lends support

to the view that ratings tend to be procyclical.

Graduating from Debt Intolerance: Some Suggestive Evidence

         As observed above for Brazil, in some years a country’s actual IIR can be considerably

higher than the estimated rating obtained from our simple model. On the whole, however, these

gaps are neither persistent over time nor systematic in any one direction. Nonetheless, for some

countries we do observe consistent, persistent, and sizable positive gaps between the actual and
                                                   - 37 -




the predicted IIR. One interpretation is that these countries either have graduated, or are in the

process of graduating, from club B.

         To explore the countries in our sample that are plausible graduation candidates, we

calculate the difference between the actual and the predicted IIR averaged over the years

1992–2000—roughly the second half of the estimation period. The five countries with the

largest gaps during this period are shown, in descending order, in table 11. Not surprisingly,

Greece and Portugal stand out as the most obvious possible cases of graduation from club B to

club A. Far back in third and fourth place are Malaysia and Thailand (their 1997–98 crises

notwithstanding), both of which have no history of default or high inflation. Chile, the most

consistently good performer in Latin America, ranks fifth, suggesting that it may have begun to

decouple from its long history of high inflation and adverse credit events.

Ranking Debt Intolerance within Club B

         We have presented evidence supporting the notion that there is a group of countries

whose degree of debt intolerance is indeterminate (club B), and that the countries in this group

range from relatively “safe” countries (region I) to more precarious countries (regions III and

IV) where adverse credit events become increasingly likely. Table 12 presents, for fourteen

emerging markets in our core sample, two measures of debt intolerance that allow to assess the

relative degree of debt intolerance along a continuum: the average ratio of external debt to GNP

over 1979–2000 divided by the average IIR, and the average ratio of external debt to exports

divided by the average IIR. Regardless of which of these two summary measures one chooses,

those countries with the weakest credit histories register the highest levels of debt intolerance.

For example, the group average for the first measure is more than twice as high for countries

with a record of past default as for those that have avoided default. The difference between the

two groups is much greater, however, when one looks at the measure that uses the debt-to-

exports ratio as the numerator. These simple summary statistics could therefore be useful to

compare the relative degree of debt intolerance across countries (as done here), and over time

for any given country.24




24
  Figure 3 employs the debt-to-output ratio as a metric for dividing club B into regions, but the debt-exports ratio
could be used alternatively.

                          IV. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY AND DEBT REVERSALS

        Thus far our analysis has focused on quantifying and explaining external debt

intolerance. To reiterate, the basic premise is that, because of debt intolerance, some countries

periodically have disproportionate difficulty repaying their debts on the original terms, even at

levels of indebtedness that would be considered moderate for countries that are not debt

intolerant. Here we first discuss the implications of debt intolerance for standard debt

sustainability analyses, and then turn our attention to what we call debt reversals—episodes
                                             - 40 -




during which countries have managed to significantly reduce their external debt relative to

GNP. The latter analysis will show that debt-intolerant countries very rarely achieve significant

reductions in their debt burden solely through sustained growth or lower interest rates, but

instead require some kind of adverse credit event (default or restructuring) to reduce their debt.

In addition, the analysis will show that, following such an event, governments in emerging

market countries often quickly amass debt once again, and the symptoms of debt intolerance

reemerge, often leading to serial default. This evidence will uncover some critical

shortcomings of standard sustainability exercises.

Implications of Debt Intolerance for Debt Sustainability Analysis

       How does one square our proposed measures of debt intolerance and, more broadly, the

existence of debt intolerance with standard approaches to assessing debt sustainability as

practiced in both the public and the private sector? Standard debt sustainability analysis, as

applied to a country’s external debt, works off the following simple accounting relationship:

(1) D(t + 1) = [1 + r(t)]D(t) – TB(t),

where D(t) is a country’s external debt at time t, TB is its trade balance, and r is the interest rate

paid by the country on its external debt. Simple manipulation leads to the following steady-

state expression:

(2) TB/Y = (r - g)(D/Y),

where TB/Y is the steady-state ratio of the trade balance to output needed to stabilize the

external debt ratio at D/Y, and g is the growth rate of output. (A similar calculus applies to

deriving sustainable paths for total government debt.) It is well recognized that standard debt

sustainability analysis tends to be overly sanguine, in that it does not sufficiently allow for the

kinds of real-world shocks that emerging market economies face (including confidence shocks,
                                                   - 41 -




political shocks, terms-of-trade shocks and, not least, shocks to returns in industrial countries).

Efforts have therefore been made to find ways to “stress-test” these sustainability calculations.25

         Such efforts are useful, but our analysis of debt intolerance suggests that it is also

crucial to take other factors into account. First, it is necessary to recognize that the interest rate

a country must pay on its debt is an endogenous variable, which depends, among other things,

on the country’s debt-to-output (or debt-to-exports) ratio. Because the interest rate on debt to

private creditors can rise very sharply with the level of debt (the rate charged by official

creditors, such as the international financial institutions, typically does not change), a trajectory

that may seem marginally sustainable according to standard calculations may in fact be much

more problematic when debt intolerance is taken into account (not an uncommon situation, to

say the least). This is particularly likely in situations where a country’s debt-to-GNP ratio is

initially projected to rise in the near future, and only later projected to fall (again, a very

common situation).

         Second, sustainability analyses need to take into account that a country’s initial level of

debt (scaled by output or exports) may already exceed, or be close to exceeding, what history

suggests is that country’s tolerable debt burden. In cases where the initial level of debt or the

initial rise in D/Y takes a club B country into a region of extreme debt intolerance (that is, into

region IV), conventional sustainability analyses are not likely to be meaningful or useful. Once

a country is in the “risk of default” region identified in sovereign debt models and


25
   See International Monetary Fund (2002) for a recent discussion of these approaches. As noted, the approaches
sometimes focus on total government debt rather than total external debt, but the issues raised here are similar for
both. See Williamson (2002) and Goldstein (2003) for recent applications of the standard debt sustainability
framework to the case of Brazil.
                                                 - 42 -




approximated by our earlier analysis,26 there is a risk of both dramatically higher interest rates

and a sudden loss of access to market financing. And, as we will see below, the probability that

a “virtuous cycle” of falling interest rates and rapid growth will take the country’s debt burden

back to a safe region is, unfortunately, typically low.

Identifying Debt Reversals

        To identify episodes of large debt reversals for middle- and low-income countries over

the period 1970–2000, we select all episodes where the ratio of external debt to GNP fell 25

percentage points or more within any three-year period, and then ascertain whether the decline

in this ratio was caused by a fall in the numerator, a rise in the denominator, or some

combination of the two.27 To exclude cases where the decline in the ratio was primarily driven

by changes in the nominal value of dollar GNP, we consider only those episodes where either

the decline in the dollar value of external debt was 10 percent or more over the three-year

window, or average growth in the three-year period was 5 percent a year or higher. This two-

stage approach allows us to identify the proximate causes of the debt reversal. If it is a decline

in debt, it may be due to either repayment or some type of reduction in the present value of debt

(that is, a restructuring); alternatively, if the decline was due to primarily, or solely, to growth,

it suggests that the country grew out of its debt.




26
  Such models include those of Obstfeld (1994), Velasco (1996), Morris and Shin (2001), and Jahjah and Montiel
(2003).
27
  Our basic results appear reasonably robust to our choice of “windows” of 25 percent decline and three years—
see the analysis of Brady plan countries below, however.
                                                  - 43 -




        We conducted the exercise for both low- and middle-income developing economies.

The algorithm yielded a total of fifty-three debt reversal episodes for the period 1970–2000,

twenty-six of which occurred in middle-income countries and the rest in low-income countries.

The Debt Reversal Episodes

        Table 13 lists those debt reversal episodes that occurred in middle-income developing

countries with populations of at least one million, separating those cases that involved an

adverse credit event (a default or a restructuring) from those that did not.28 Of the twenty-two

debt reversals identified, fifteen coincided with some type of default or restructuring of external

debt obligations. In five of the seven episodes that did not coincide with a credit event, the debt

reversal was effected primarily through net debt repayments; in only one of these episodes

(Swaziland in 1985) did the debt ratio decline strictly because the country grew out of its debt.

However, growth was also the principal factor explaining the decline in the debt ratio in four of

the fifteen credit event cases (Chile, Morocco, Panama, and the Philippines) and a lesser factor

in other seven of those episodes, as well as in four of the episodes that did not coincide with a

credit event.. Overall, this exercise shows that growth alone is typically not sufficient to allow

countries to substantially reduce their debt burden—yet another reason to be skeptical of overly

sanguine standard sustainability calculations for debt-intolerant countries.

            Of those cases involving credit events, Russia and Egypt obtained by far the largest

reductions in their nominal debt burden in their restructuring deals: $14 billion and $11 billion,
                                                 - 45 -




respectively. Two countries involved in the 1997–98 Asian crisis—Thailand and Korea—

engineered the largest debt repayments among those episodes where a credit event was avoided.

        Conspicuously absent from the large debt reversal episodes shown in table 13 are the

well-known Brady restructuring deals of the 1990s. Although our algorithm does place

Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Jordan, Nigeria, and Vietnam in the debt reversal category, larger

countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Poland do not register. The reasons for this apparent

puzzle are examined below.

The Missing Brady Bunch: Episodes of Rapid Releveraging

        Table 14 traces the evolution of external debt in the seventeen developing countries

whose external obligations were restructured under the umbrella of the Brady Plan deals

pioneered by Mexico and Costa Rica in the late 1980s.29 It is clear from the table why our

debt reversal algorithm failed to pick up twelve of these seventeen countries. In ten of those

twelve cases, the reason is that the decline in the external debt-to-GNP ratio produced by the

Brady restructuring was less than 25 percentage points. But this is only part of the story.

Argentina, Nigeria and Peru had higher external debt-to-GNP ratios just three years after their

Brady deals than in the year before the restructuring. Moreover, by the end of 2000, seven of

the seventeen countries that had undertaken a Brady-type restructuring (Argentina, Brazil,

Ecuador, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, and Uruguay) had ratios of external debt to GNP that

were higher than they were three years after the Brady deal, and four of those countries

(Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru) had higher debt ratios by the end of 2000 than just

before the Brady deal. By 2002 three members of the Brady bunch had once again defaulted on

  their external debt (Argentina, Côte d’Ivoire, and Ecuador), and a few others were teetering on

  the brink. This evidence clearly suggests that, when assessing debt restructuring programs for

  highly debt-intolerant countries, it is critical to ask whether measures can be taken to reduce the

  likelihood of the problem remerging in the near term.

                         V. DOMESTIC DEBT, DOLLARIZATION, AND LIBERALIZATION

            Up to this point, our analysis of debt intolerance has focused on a country’s total

  external debt. The reasons for this are twofold. First, until recently, the theoretical literature on

  public debt in emerging market economies focused primarily on external debt rather than on

  total government debt. This common practice was grounded in the observation that
                                           - 47 -




governments in most emerging markets had little scope for financing their fiscal deficits by

resorting to the domestic placement of marketable debt. Second, a key point of our empirical

analysis has been to show that the external debt burdens that countries are able, and have been

able, to tolerate are systematically related to their own credit and inflation histories. We have

investigated this proposition using time series for countries’ level of external indebtedness

dating back to the 1970s. Unfortunately, there is not a sufficient past record to allow a

comparable empirical analysis of domestic government debt. That said, an early read of the

evidence suggests that a history of external debt intolerance is probably a good predictor of

modern-day domestic debt intolerance.

       Domestically issued, market-based government debt has become increasingly important

for emerging market economies, both as a source of government financing and as a trigger for

generalized debt and financial crises. Domestically issued foreign currency debt (the infamous

tesobonos) was at the center of the Mexican crisis of December 1994. Such debt also

contributed to the costly collapse of the convertibility regime in Argentina in late 2001. And

that debt presently accounts for the lion’s share of public debt in Brazil and Turkey—and will

ultimately determine the fate of those countries’ efforts at financial stabilization. Mexico,

Argentina, Turkey and Brazil of course, all exhibit high external debt intolerance according to

our historical measures.

       Recognizing this fact, in this section we discuss some conceptual issues related to the

role of domestic government debt in emerging market economies, and we document and

explain some related manifestations of debt intolerance—such as dollarization—and offer some

explanations for the rapid growth of domestic government debt in recent years. The growth of

such debt turns out to be a widespread phenomenon in these economies. We conjecture that, in
                                                 - 48 -




the future, the same historical factors that explain external debt intolerance will extend to

domestic debt intolerance, as will the conclusions we have drawn about how rare it is for

countries to grow their way out of heavy indebtedness.

        There is no easy way to aggregate domestically issued and externally issued government

debt for the purpose of assessing financial vulnerability or the likelihood of a debt crisis, and

views differ on how to do so.30 To be sure, the view that external debt is completely separable

from domestically issued debt is dead wrong. As a by-product of capital mobility and financial

integration, foreigners hold increasingly large amounts of the domestically issued debt of

governments of emerging markets, and their residents increasingly hold instruments issued by

governments in advanced economies. Financial integration and open capital accounts

encourage active arbitrage across the two markets. In such a setting, a default on domestic

government debt can easily trigger a default on foreign debt, first for reputational reasons, and

second because induced output and exchange rate effects can easily affect a country’s prospects

for servicing its foreign debt, not least through the havoc that domestic default wreaks on the

banking system.

        That said, it is also clearly wrong to assume that domestically issued and foreign-issued

debt are perfect substitutes. First, foreigners typically do hold a large share of externally issued

debt, whereas domestic residents typically hold most domestically issued debt. Second, the

risks of a cutoff of international trade credits and the risks to future international borrowing are

undeniably greater following a default on foreign-issued debt. Thus the default calculus simply

cannot be the same for the two classes of debt instruments, and they will not, in general, be

30
  The recent IMF on debt sustainability (IMF, 2002), for example, proposes to undertake parallel assessments of
external and public--domestic and external--debt burdens.
                                            - 49 -




equivalent. (The fundamental distinction between them is clearly reflected in the fact that, at

times, rating agencies give the sovereign foreign-issued debt of a country a significantly higher

grade than its domestically issued debt.)

       Given the lack of theoretical clarity on the distinction between foreign-issued and

domestically issued government debt, our objective in this section is to present some basic facts

and explore whether the symptoms of debt intolerance seem broadly similar for both types of

instrument. We leave it to future research to delineate more clearly the dividing lines between

domestic and external debt in a global economy.

The Growth of Domestic Government Debt: New Data

       Figure 4 illustrates the rapid growth of marketable domestic government debt in

emerging market economies in the late 1990s. By the end of 2001, the stock of domestic

government debt of the twenty-four countries represented in the figure amounted to

approximately $800 billion. More than 25 percent of that stock consisted of debt linked to a

foreign currency, and the bulk of the rest was often indexed to some other market variable (for

example, as of the end of 2002, about 45 percent of Brazil’s domestic government debt was

linked to the overnight interest rate). The fraction of domestic government debt that is not

indexed to a market variable is typically of very short maturity. Indeed, the successful issuance

of nonindexed domestic currency bonds for long-term government financing remains as elusive

today for the majority of emerging market economies as it was two or three decades ago.

                      These trends suggest that domestic debt intolerance can manifest itself in a manner

similar to external debt intolerance. Indeed, as we will later show for dollarization, many of the

variables typically linked to the vulnerability of a country’s debt position (maturity structure,

indexation, and the like) are manifestations of debt intolerance and may be viewed as linked to

a common set of factors.

                      The surge in domestic government debt is also apparent in the emerging market

economies that formed the core sample of our analysis of external debt intolerance. Table 15

shows that the stock of domestic government debt in this group of countries has increased

markedly over the last two decades. The rise has been particularly large in the Asian

countries—both in those with no default history, and in the Philippines, which has defaulted
                                                     - 51 -




only once in its modern history. But domestic government debt has also risen significantly in a

number of Latin American countries, as well as in Turkey.

         In all of the Asian countries in the core sample except India, the buildup of domestic

government debt was propelled by the recapitalization of domestic financial systems that
                                           - 52 -




governments engineered in the aftermath of the 1997–98 crisis. Financial system bailouts also

contributed to the rise of domestic government debt in Mexico and Turkey. In the other cases,

including India, the buildup of domestic public debt has primarily reflected fiscal profligacy.

More precisely, as we will show later, the governments’ inability (or unwillingness) to offset

the revenue losses stemming from trade and financial reform, and from disinflation, with new

taxes or lower spending sets them up for a fall.

       Regardless of its origins, and notwithstanding the positive effects that government debt

may have for domestic financial markets, the rise of domestic public debt in many emerging

market economies arguably overshadows the progress that many of them have made in

containing their external debt burden, raising complex questions about their ability to overcome

longstanding debt intolerance. Barring a relatively rapid overhaul of their tax and legal systems

or determined efforts to reduce their spending, it seems unreasonable to expect that the

governments of all these countries will refrain from doing to their domestically issued debt

what so many of them in the past have done so often to their external obligations. Indeed, table

15 suggests that a wave of restructuring or outright default on domestic government debts

looms large on the horizon for many emerging market economies in the early part of the

twenty-first century.

Dollarization as a Manifestation of Debt Intolerance

       The external debts of emerging market economies are, almost without exception,

denominated in foreign currency. As shown in the preceding section, however, governments in

many emerging markets today also issue domestic debt linked to a foreign currency. Even

more countries, including many that have experienced very high or chronic inflation, have

highly dollarized banking systems. Table 16 provides a few summary indicators of the degree
                                                   - 53 -




of domestic dollarization in the emerging market economies in our core sample for the period

composite dollarization index, which ranges from zero when there is no domestic dollarization

  The composite index consists of the sum of the share of foreign currency deposits in broad money and the share
of domestic government debt in foreign currency in total domestic debt (both ratios normalized to an index ranging
from 0 to 10); see Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003) for details.

       The table shows considerable variation in the degree of domestic dollarization among

countries with a history of default, with Argentina scoring very high on the index but Colombia

and Venezuela very low. On the whole, however, countries with a patchier credit history have

more domestic dollarization on any of these measures than do countries with no default history.

Thus, for example, according to the composite index, countries with a history of external debt

default are about four times more dollarized than the most dollarized nondefaulting country

(Malaysia). The likely reason is that, by and large, debt-intolerant countries tend to have a

history of high (and often chronic) inflation.

       We performed a cross-country regression of the domestic dollarization index shown in

table 16 against the same independent variables used in the previous section to explain

countries’ average Institutional Investor ratings (i.e., their long-run creditworthiness), namely,

credit and inflation histories and debt-to-output ratios. The results are as follows:

Dollarization Indexi = 0.04 – 2.30 X1 + 0.08X2 + 0.05X3 + 0.04X4
                      (0.03) (-1.59)    (2.67) (1.67) (2.00)

Adjusted R2 = 0.31; N = 62 (t statistics in parentheses).

       In this regression, X1 is an intercept dummy for club A countries, X2 is the percentage of

twelve-month periods since 1948 when inflation in country i was at least 40 percent; X3 is the

percentage of years since 1824 during which the country was in default or restructuring its debt;

and X4 is the external debt-to-GNP ratio. Considering that dollarization is a form of indexation,

it is not surprising that a country’s inflation history is the most important variable in explaining

it. The external debt-to-GNP ratio is also significant and has a positive coefficient. Although

the interpretation of the role of external debt is less obvious, a reasonable conjecture is that,

when the external debt burden is high, governments are more likely to resort to inflationary

financing of their fiscal imbalances and, in the process, to suffocate the development of a

market for nominal government debt in domestic currency. Indeed, this has clearly happened in

many of the highly dollarized economies.

Liberalization, Stabilization, and Its Consequences for Debt

       Many factors contributed to the alarming rise in domestic government debt reported in

table 15. Key among these have been the revenue losses from the wide-ranging liberalizations

undertaken by emerging markets since the late 1980s. The last column of table 17 shows that

trade liberalization typically entailed revenue losses for the emerging markets in our core

sample. A similar pattern is discernible in figure 5. The left-hand panel shows a steady decline

in trade tax revenue as a share of GDP in four countries from our core sample during that

period. In some cases this revenue loss was offset by higher revenue from other sources (such

as value added taxes). However, the estimates in table 17 show that, for the group as a whole,

total tax revenue as a share of GDP also experienced a cumulative decline over the last two

decades.

       Declining trade taxes were not the only cause of erosion of the traditional sources of

revenue in emerging market economies. In the wake of financial liberalization, revenue from

financial repression also vanished, as table 18 shows. Interest rate ceilings were lifted, and

bank loans to the government at subsidized interest rates gave way to market-based domestic

public debt at high interest rates. As presciently noted by Ronald McKinnon in the early 1990s

(see footnote 5), the outcome was often a significant increase in domestic interest outlays by the

government, a trend that is clearly captured in the right-hand panels of figure 5 and in table 17

(for countries with a history of default). Simply put, much of the debt that governments had for

long crammed down the throats of financial intermediaries at below-market interest rates

suddenly became part of those governments’ market debt burden. Debt intolerance symptoms

rose accordingly.

        In addition to revenue losses and higher debt servicing costs, many of the emerging

market economies in our core sample—particularly the group with a default history—had

traditionally relied on revenue from seigniorage to finance a nontrivial fraction of their fiscal
                                            - 59 -




deficits. As those countries succeeded in reducing inflation, revenue from seigniorage became

much less important. As table 17 shows, the cumulative decline was over 2 percent of GDP,

and for some countries (such as Argentina and Egypt, as shown in the middle panels of

figure 5) the decline was even greater. All in all, for those governments that did not manage to

bring expenditure in line with the new realities, one outcome of liberalization and inflation

stabilization has been a heavier reliance on domestic or foreign debt financing, or both.



             VI. REFLECTIONS ON POLICIES FOR DEBT-INTOLERANT COUNTRIES

       The sad fact that our analysis reveals is that once a country slips into being a serial

defaulter, it retains a high level of debt intolerance that is difficult to shed. Countries can and

do graduate to greater creditworthiness, but the process is seldom fast or easy. Absent the pull

of an outside political anchor, such as the European Union or, one hopes, the North American

Free Trade Agreement for Mexico, recovery may take decades or even centuries. The

implications are certainly sobering for sustainability exercises that ignore debt intolerance, and

even for debt restructuring plans that pretend to cure the problem permanently, simply through

a one-time reduction in the face value of a country’s debt.

       How serious are the consequences of debt intolerance? Is a country with weak internal

structures that make it intolerant to debt doomed to follow a trajectory of slower growth and

higher macroeconomic volatility? At some level, the answer has to be yes, but constrained

access to international capital markets is best viewed as a symptom, not a cause, of the disease.

       Rather, the institutional failings that make a country intolerant to debt pose the real

impediment. The basic problem is threefold. First, the modern empirical growth literature

increasingly points to “soft” factors, such as institutions, corruption, and governance, as far
                                                    - 60 -




more important than differences in capital-labor ratios in explaining cross-country differences

in income per capita. Simply equalizing the marginal product of physical capital across

countries (the sine qua non of capital market integration in a deterministic world) only goes a

limited way toward equalizing marginal labor products.32 Second, quantitative methods have

similarly suggested that the risk-sharing benefits of capital market integration (that is, the

lowering of consumption volatility as opposed to the acceleration of consumption growth) may

also be relatively modest. Moreover, these results pertain to an idealized world where one does

not have to worry about gratuitous, policy-induced macroeconomic instability, poor domestic

bank regulation, corruption, and (not least) policies that distort capital inflows toward short-

term debt.33 Third, there is evidence to suggest that capital flows to emerging markets are

markedly procyclical, and that this may make macroeconomic policies in these countries

procyclical as well, as, for instance, when capital outflows force a tightening of fiscal policy

and the raising of interest rates.34 Arguably, more limited, but also more stable, access to

capital markets may do more to improve welfare than the boom-bust pattern so often observed

in the past. The deeply entrenched idea that an emerging market economy’s growth trajectory

will be hampered by limited access to debt markets is no longer as compelling as was once

thought.



32
     For a broader discussion, see International Monetary Fund (2003, chapter 3).
33
   Prasad and others (2003) find that, during the 1990s, economies whose financial sectors were de facto relatively
open experienced, on average, a rise in consumption volatility relative to output volatility, contrary to the premise
the capital market integration spreads country-specific output risk. The same authors also argue that the cross-
country empirical evidence on the effects of capital market integration on growth shows only weak positive effects
at best, and arguably none.

     See Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh (2003) on this issue.

        The modern empirical growth literature does not actually paint sharp distinctions

between different types of capital flows, whether it be debt versus equity, portfolio versus direct

investments, or long-term versus short-term. Practical policymakers, of course, are justifiably

quite concerned with the form that cross-border flows take. For example, foreign direct

investment (FDI) is generally thought to have properties that make it preferable to debt: it is

less volatile, it is often associated with technology transfer, and so on.35 We generally share the

view that FDI and other forms of equity investment are somewhat less problematic than debt,

but one wants to avoid overstating the case. In practice, the three main types of capital

inflows—FDI, portfolio equity, and loans—are often interlinked: for example, foreign firms

often bring cash into a country in advance of building or acquiring plant facilities. Moreover,

derivative contracts often blur the three categories, and even the most diligent statistical

authorities can find it hard to distinguish accurately among different types of foreign capital

inflows (not to mention that, when in doubt, some countries prefer to label a given investment

as FDI, to lower their apparent vulnerability). Even with these qualifications, however, we

believe that governments in advanced economies can do more to discourage emerging market

economies from excessive dependence on risky nonindexed debt relative to other forms of

capital flows.36



35
  Of course, it was not always so. Before the 1980s, many governments viewed allowing FDI as equivalent to
mortgaging their countries’ future, and therefore preferred borrowing in order to retain full ownership of the
country’s assets. And, of course, where FDI was more dominant (for example, in investment in oil and other
natural resources in the 1950s and 1960s), pressure for nationalization increased. Thus FDI should not be regarded
as a panacea for poor growth performance.
36
  Rogoff (1999) and Bulow and Rogoff (1990) argue that creditor countries’ legal systems should be amended so
that they no longer tilt capital flows toward debt.

       Lastly, short-term debt, although typically identified as the main culprit in precipitating

debt crises, also helps facilitate trade in goods and is necessary in some measure to allow

private agents to execute hedging strategies. Of course, one would imagine that most of the

essential benefits to having access to capital markets could be enjoyed with relatively modest

debt-to-GNP ratios.

       All in all, debt intolerance need not be fatal to growth and macroeconomic stability.

However, the evidence presented here suggests that, to overcome debt intolerance,

policymakers need to be prepared to keep debt levels—especially government debt levels—low

for extended periods while undertaking more basic structural reforms to ensure that the country

can eventually digest a heavier debt burden. This applies not only to external debt but also to

the very immediate and growing problem of domestic government debt. Policymakers who

face tremendous short-term pressures will still choose to engage in high-risk borrowing, and, at

the right price, markets will let them. But an understanding of the basic problem, at least,

should guide the citizens of such countries, not to mention the international lending institutions

and the broader international community, in making their own decisions.

       In our view, developing a better understanding of the problem of serial default on

external debt obligations is essential to designing better domestic and international economic

policies aimed at crisis prevention and resolution. As we have shown, debt intolerance can be

captured systematically by a relatively small number of variables, principally a country’s own

history of default and high inflation. Debt-intolerant countries face surprisingly low thresholds

for external borrowing, beyond which the risks of default or restructuring become significant.

With the recent explosion of domestic borrowing, as documented by the new data presented in

this paper, these thresholds for external debt are now clearly even lower, although it remains an
                                            - 63 -




open question to what extent domestic and external debt can be aggregated for purposes of

analysis. This question needs urgently to be addressed, in part because many questions

involving bailouts by the international community surround it. Our initial results suggest that

the same factors that determine external debt intolerance (not to mention other manifestations

of debt intolerance, such as dollarization) are also likely to impinge heavily on domestic debt

intolerance. We have also shown that whereas debt-intolerant countries need badly to find

ways to bring their debt-GNP ratios down to safer ground, doing so is not easy. Historically,

those countries that have escaped high external debt-GNP ratios, through rapid growth or

through sizable repayments over many years, are very much the exception. Most large

reductions in the external debt of emerging markets have instead been achieved primarily

through restructuring or default. The challenge today is to find ways other than still more debt

to channel capital to debt-intolerant countries, to prevent the cycle from repeating itself for yet

another century to come.



                                        VII. CONCLUSIONS

       Cycles in capital flows to emerging markets have now been with us for nearly two

hundred years. Some of the players, both borrowers and lenders, may change but the patterns

the cycles follow have remained singularly similar over time. When interest rates are low,

when liquidity is ample, and when the prospects for equity markets dim in the world’s financial

centers, investors will seek higher returns elsewhere. During these periods, it is easier for

governments in emerging markets to borrow from abroad—and borrow they do. But history

has shown that for many of these countries, to borrow is to brook default. As the track record

of serial default highlights, many of these booms ended in tears. The policy challenge for these
                                           - 64 -




countries is to address a chronic long term problem—their own debt intolerance—not to take

remedial measures that allow them to gain the favor of international capital markets for a few of

months, or even years.

       This paper has taken a first step toward making the concept of debt intolerance

operational. We have conjectured that, beyond reputational factors, serial default may owe to a

vicious cycle in which default weakens a country’s institutions in turn making subsequent

defaults more likely. We also have stressed that safe debt thresholds vary from country to

country and depend importantly on history. Clearly, much more research is needed to shed

light on what other factors (economic, political, and institutional) figure in the calculus of what

debt levels, external and domestic, are sustainable, and what are the true long-term costs of

default.

Definitions

       External debt: the total liabilities of a country with foreign creditors, both official

(public) and private. Creditors often determine all the terms of the debt contracts, which are

normally subject to the jurisdiction of the foreign creditors or, for multilateral credits, to

international law.

       Total government (or public) debt: the total debt liabilities of a government with both

domestic and foreign creditors, where “government” normally comprises the central

administration, provincial and local governments, and all entities that borrow with an explicit

government guarantee.

       Government domestic debt: all debt liabilities of a government that are issued under—

and subject to—national jurisdiction, regardless of the nationality of the creditor. Terms of the

debt contracts may be market determined or set unilaterally by the government.

       Government foreign currency domestic debt: debt liabilities of a government that are

issued under national jurisdiction but expressed in (or linked to) a currency different from the

national currency.

APPENDIX B

Sample Description

       To illustrate the extent to which modern-day debt intolerance arises from countries’ own

external credit histories (because of persistence in certain economic and social characteristics as

well as reputational factors), we use throughout the paper a core sample comprising three

groups of countries: emerging market economies with a history of default or restructuring of

external debt, emerging market economies without a history of default or restructuring, and

advanced economies, which mostly have no history of default except during wartime (for

instance, in the case of Japan and Italy during World War II). Included in the first group are

countries with a history of default or restructuring that involved concessional terms: Argentina,

Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, the Philippines, Turkey, and Venezuela. Both of the

other two groups consist of countries that have no history of external debt default or

restructuring, but we consider it important to distinguish developing from advanced economies.

Emerging market economies with an unblemished credit record belong to a different debtor

“club” from their more advanced counterparts. The core emerging market economies with no

history of default are India, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The core sample of

advanced industrial countries consists of Australia, Canada, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, and

the United States.

       Appendix table B1 provides a complete list of the countries used in the empirical

analysis and their individual Institutional Investor ratings averaged across 1979–2002.
