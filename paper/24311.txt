This paper explores how an environment of persistent low returns influences saving, investing, and
retirement behaviors, as compared to what in the past had been thought of as more “normal” financial
conditions. Our calibrated lifecycle dynamic model with realistic tax, minimum distribution, and Social
Security benefit rules produces results that agree with observed saving, work, and claiming age behavior
of U.S. households. In particular, our model generates a large peak at the earliest claiming age at 62,
as in the data. Also in line with the evidence, our baseline results show a smaller second peak at the
(system-defined) Full Retirement Age of 66. In the context of a zero return environment, we show
that workers will optimally devote more of their savings to non-retirement accounts and less to 401(k)
accounts, since the relative appeal of investing in taxable versus tax-qualified retirement accounts
is higher in a low return setting. Finally, we show that people claim Social Security benefits later in
a low interest rate environment.

                    How Persistent Low Expected Returns
     Alter Optimal Life Cycle Saving, Investment, and Retirement Behavior

       Low interest rates are now a reality not only in the United States but around the world,

as recently noted by former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke (2015). In the US, the

government can borrow for a decade at a yield of only 2.3%, while in Switzerland, government

bond yields are negative out to 50 years (Lewin, 2016; Zeng, 2017). Our Chapter explores how

this environment of persistent low returns is likely to influence saving, investing, and retirement

behaviors, compared to what in the past were deemed more ‘normal’ financial conditions.

       The persistence of low returns has implications for many aspects of the financial market.

In the case of defined benefit (DB) pensions, a permanently low interest rate can render the DB

plan underfunded, particularly when actual returns prove to be below those assumed when

discounting future payouts. In the case of defined contribution (DC) plans, which are now the

norm in the United States, the implications are more complex. In particular, persistent low

returns can compel workers to save more and invest differently when allocating across stocks

and bonds. Moreover, the low interest rate environment can also change retirement decisions,

especially regarding how long to work and when to claim Social Security benefits.

       This Chapter builds on a number of studies using a life cycle framework to model and

evaluate how individuals respond to a range of environmental shocks. The workhorse model of

Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2015) and Gomes and Michaelides (2005) was extended by

Love (2010) and Hubener, Maurer and Mitchell (2016), who showed how family shocks due to

changes in marital status and children alter optimal consumption, insurance, asset allocation,

and retirement patterns. In Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell, and Rogalla (2015), we demonstrated

how capital market surprises can influence saving and portfolio allocation patterns, and in Chai,

Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2011) we showed how flexible work patterns can help people

hedge both earnings and capital market risk. In the present Chapter, we evaluate how people

might optimally respond to a persistently low return environment by adjusting their
                                                                                                             3


consumption, saving, investment, and retirement patterns compared to what used to be

perceived as the “normal” environment. Our Chapter therefore builds on and extends the recent

life cycle model developed by Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2016). In contrast to that study,

we do not include annuity purchases but we do allow flexible work effort and endogenous

claiming of Social Security benefits. 1

        In what follows, we develop and calibrate a life cycle model that embeds stock market

and labor market uncertainty, as well as stochastic mortality. We also incorporate U.S. tax rules

and minimum distribution requirements for 401(k) plans, as well as real-world Social Security

benefit formulas. We then show that our calibrated lifecycle dynamic model produces realistic

results that agree with observed saving, work, and claiming age patterns of U.S. households. In

particular, our model generates a large peak at the earliest benefit claiming age at 62, as in the

data. Also in line with the evidence, our baseline results show a smaller second peak at the

(system-defined) Full Retirement Age of 66. In the context of a zero return environment, we

show that workers devote more of their savings to non-retirement accounts and less to 401(k)

accounts since the relative appeal of investing into taxable versus tax-qualified retirement

accounts is higher in a low return setting. Finally, we show that people claim Social Security

benefits later in a low interest rate environment. A short discussion concludes.



The Consumer’s Lifecycle Problem: Model and Calibration

        In this section we build and calibrate a dynamic consumption and portfolio choice model

for utility-maximizing individual over the life cycle.

Preferences. We work in discrete time and assume that the individual’s decision period starts

at 𝑡𝑡 = 1 (age of 25) and ends at 𝑇𝑇 = 76 (age 100); accordingly, each period corresponds to

one year. The household’s has an uncertain lifetime whereby the probability to survive from 𝑡𝑡

  We also provide a theoretical backing for the empirical claiming age patterns identified by Shoven and Slavov
(2012, 2014).

until the next year 𝑡𝑡 + 1 is denoted by 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 . Preferences in each period is represented by a Cobb

normalized as a fraction of total available time. The parameter 𝛼𝛼 measures leisure preferences,

𝜌𝜌 denotes relative risk aversion and 𝛽𝛽 is the time preferences factor. The recursive definition of

the value function is given by:

                                                (𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡𝛼𝛼 )1−𝜌𝜌                                             (1)

with terminal utility 𝐽𝐽𝑇𝑇 =                              and 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 = 1 after retirement. Following prior research
                                          1−𝜌𝜌


(Horneff et al. 2016), the baseline calibration sets 𝜌𝜌 = 5 and 𝛽𝛽 = 0.96 for both males and

females. The survival rates entering the value function are taken from the US Population Life

Table (Arias 2010). We calibrate the leisure parameter 𝛼𝛼 in such a way that our results match

empirical claiming rates reported by the US Social Security Administration. This matching

procedure produces leisure preference parameters of 𝛼𝛼 = 0.9 for males and 𝛼𝛼 = 1.1 for

females.

Time budget, labor income, and Social Security retirement benefits. Our model allows for

flexible work effort and retirement ages. The worker has the opportunity to allocate up to (1 −

𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ) = 0.6 of his available time budget (assuming 100 waking hours per week and 52 weeks per

year) to paid work. Depending on his work effort, the uncertain yearly pre-tax labor income is

given by:

                                      𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 = (1 − 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ) · 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 · 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡+1 · 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡+1                            (2)

Here 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 is a deterministic wage rate component, which depends on age, education, sex, and if

the individual works overtime, full time, or part time. The variable 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 · 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡+1 is the

permanent component of wage rates with independent lognormal distributed shocks

𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 ~𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(−0.5σ2P , σ2𝑃𝑃 ) with a mean of one and volatility of σ2𝑃𝑃 . In addition 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 ~𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(−0.5σ2U , σ2𝑈𝑈 )

is a transitory shock with volatility σ2𝑈𝑈 and uncorrelated with 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡 .
                                                                                                             5


        The wage rate calibration builds on Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell (2016), who

estimated the deterministic component of the wage rate process 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 and the variances of the

permanent and transitory wage shocks 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 and 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 using the 1975–2013 waves of the PSID. 2

These are estimated separately by sex and by educational level, where the latter groupings are

less than High School, High School graduates, and at least some college (<HS, HS, Coll+). 3

        Between ages 62 and 70, the worker can retire from work and claim Social Security

benefits, the latter of which depend on his average lifetime 35 best years of earnings. If the

individual claims benefits before (after) the system-defined Normal Retirement Age of 66, then

his lifelong Social Security benefits will be reduced (increased) according to pre-specified

factors. If the individual works beyond age 62, we require that he devote at least a minimum

effort of at least one hour per week; also, overtime work is excluded (i.e. 0.01 ≤ (1 − 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ) ≤

0.4).

Wealth dynamics during the work life. During the work life, the individual has the

opportunity to use current cash on hand for consumption and investments. Some portion 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 of

the worker’s pre-tax salary 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 (up to a limit of $18 000 per year) can be invested into a tax-

qualified 401(k)-retirement plan of the EET type. 4 That is, contributions into the account and

investment earnings on account assets are tax-exempt, (E), while withdrawals are taxed (T). In

addition, a worker can invest outside his retirement plan in risky stocks 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 and riskless bonds

𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 . As such, his cash on hand 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 in each year is given by

                                         𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 = 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 + 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 + 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡                              (3)

where the usual constraints 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 , 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 , 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 , 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 ≥ 0 apply. One year later, his cash on hand is given by

the value of stocks (bonds) having earned an uncertain (riskless) gross return of 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1 (𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 ), plus

  This approach to retirement benefit taxation is therefore similar to how regular defined benefit and defined
contribution plan payments are handled under US tax law. We abstract here from Roth 401(k)s.
                                                                                                                   6


income from work (after housing expenses ℎ𝑡𝑡 ), plus withdrawals (𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 ) from the 401(k) plan,

minus any federal/state/city Taxes and Social Security 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡+1 contributions:

                         𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1 + 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 + 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 (1 − ℎ𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 − 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡+1            (4)

We model housing costs ℎ𝑡𝑡 as in Love (2010). Our “baseline” financial market

parameterizations assume a risk-free interest rate of 1%, and an equity risk premium of 4% with

a return volatility of 18%. In simulations below of the low-yield environment, we vary these

assumptions.

           During his work life, the individual pays taxes (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡+1 ) which reduce his cash on hand

available for consumption and investments. 5 These include the labor income tax at a rate of

11.65% (the sum of 1.45% Medicare, 4% City and State Tax and 6.2% Social Security tax).

Also under the US progressive tax system, the individual must also pay taxes on labor income

as well as on withdrawals from tax-qualified retirement plans (including a 10% penalty tax for

withdrawals before age 60), and on returns on stocks and bonds held outside the tax-qualified

retirement account. If his cash on hand falls below 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡+1 ≤ $5,950 p.a. (an amount also exempt

from income taxes), he is supported by the state so he has a minimum wealth level of $5,950

for the next year.

           Prior to the endogenous retirement age 𝑡𝑡 = 𝐾𝐾, the assets in his tax-qualified retirement

plan are invested in bonds earning a risk-free gross (pre-tax) return of 𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 and risky stocks with

                                                                   401(𝑘𝑘)
an uncertain gross return of 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 . The total value (𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡+1                  ) of the 401(k) assets at time 𝑡𝑡 + 1,

usually held in a 401(account), is determined by the previous period’s value minus any

                            401(𝑘𝑘)
withdrawals (𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 ≤ 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡              ), plus additional contributions (𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 ), and returns from stocks and

bonds:

We posit that his DC plan assets are held in a Target Date Fund with stock exposure declining

with age following the common rule 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 = (100 − 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴)/100 . 6 This is a Qualified Default

Investment Alternative (QDIA) as per Department of Labor regulations (US DOL 2006).

Wealth dynamics during retirement. The worker can retire and claim Social Security benefits

between age 62 and 70. After retirement at the endogenous age 𝐾𝐾, the individual has the

opportunity to save outside the tax-qualified retirement plan in stocks and bonds:

                                                     𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 = 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡 + 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 + 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡                                   (6)

His cash on hand for the next period evolves as follows:

                      𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+1 + 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 𝑅𝑅𝑓𝑓 + 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 (1 − ℎ𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 − 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡+1 .                       (7)


Old age retirement benefits provided by Social Security are determined by the worker’s Primary

Insurance Amount (PIA), which depend on his 35 best years of earnings. 7 Social Security

payments (𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 ) in retirement (𝑡𝑡 ≥ 𝐾𝐾) are given by:

              𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐾𝐾 ⋅ 𝜆𝜆𝐾𝐾 ⋅ 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡+1 .                                                               (8)


Here, 𝜆𝜆𝐾𝐾 is the adjustment factor for claiming before or after the normal retirement age, which

is equal to age 66. 8 The variable 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 is a transitory shock 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 ~LN(−0.5𝜎𝜎ℇ2 , 𝜎𝜎ℇ2 ), which reflects

out-of-pocket medical and other expenditure shocks in retirement (as in Love 2010). During

   The benefit formula is a piece-wise linear function of the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings providing (as of
2013) a replacement rate of 90% up to a first bend point ($791), 32% between the first and the second bend point
$4768), and 15% above that. See US SSA (nd_d).

  The factors we use are 0.75 (claiming age 62), 0.8 (claiming age 63), 0.867 (claiming age 64), 0.933 (claiming
age 65), 1.00 (claiming age 66), 1.08 (claiming age 67), 1.16 (claiming age 68), 1.24 (claiming age 69), and 1.32
(claiming age 70). See US SSA (nd_a, c).

retirement, benefits payments from Social Security are partially taxed 9 by the individual federal

income tax rate as well as the 1.45% Medicare and 4% city and state taxes.

        We model the 401(k) plan payouts as follows:

                     401(𝑘𝑘)                401(𝑘𝑘)
                   𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡+1      = 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠 �𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡         − Wt �R t+1
                                                                                                             (9)
                                                                   401(𝑘𝑘)

Under US law, plan participants must take retirement account payouts from age 70 onwards,

according to the Required Minimum Distribution rules (m) specified by the Internal Revenue

the following constraints: 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡                 𝑚𝑚 ≤ 𝑊𝑊𝑡𝑡 < 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡              .



Baseline Results in a “Normal” Interest Rate Environment

        Next we evaluate, in a “normal” interest rate world, how people would optimally choose

their consumption, work effort, the claiming age for Social Security benefits, investments in as

well as withdrawals from tax-qualified 401(k)-plans, and investments in stocks and bonds. We

posit that households maximize the value function (1) under budget restrictions. This

optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, so it requires a numerical procedure using

dynamic stochastic programming. To generate optimal policy functions, in each period 𝑡𝑡 we

discretize the space in four dimensions 30(X)×20(𝐹𝐹 401(𝑘𝑘) )×8(P)×9(K), with 𝑋𝑋 being cash on

hand, 𝐹𝐹 401(𝑘𝑘) assets held in the 401(k) retirement plan, P permanent income, and K the claiming

age. Next, we simulate 100,000 independent life cycles based on optimal feedback controls for

each of the six population subgroups of interest (male/female with <HS, HS, and Coll+). We

then aggregate the subgroups to obtain national mean values using weights from the National

Center on Education Statistics (2012). Specifically, the weights are 50.7% female (and 62%

 For tax rules for Social Security see US SSA (nd_b). Based on the combined income up to 85% of Social Security
can be taxed for households with high income additional to Social Security benefits. Yet because of quite generous
exemptions, most households receive their Social Security benefits tax-free (see Horneff, Maurer, Mitchell 2016).
                                                                                                9


with Coll+, 30% with HS, and 8% with <HS), and 49.3% male (and 60% with Coll+, 30% HS

and 10% <HS).

       Figure 1 reports results for our baseline calibration assuming a risk-free interest rate of

1%, and an expected return on stocks of 5% with a volatility of 18%. The life cycle graphs

appear in the upper panels, while Social Security benefit claiming behavior appears in the lower

panels. Moreover, results for men appear on the left, and for women on the right.

Figure 1 here

       Panels A and B demonstrate that, during the work life, labor income substantially

exceeds consumption. This is partly due to the fact that we show pre-tax income, so after income

taxes, net labor income tracks consumption more closely. During the worker’s first decade in

the job market, he saves only a small amount due to the fact that he is liquidity-constrained

when young. (The worker also cannot increase consumption by borrowing against future labor

income). From age 35 onward, savings rise, especially in the 401(k) plan retirement plan to

peak around age 59. Thereafter, he systematically draws down assets from the plan, since after

age 59.5, he need no longer pay the 10 percent penalty tax for early withdrawals. In retirement,

between age 62 and 70, his Social Security income falls below average consumption, with the

difference financed by retirement plan withdrawals.

       For women, though their labor income is lower than for males, they still accumulate

almost the same amount of retirement plan assets. This can be explained by the fact that the

average life expectancy for women is substantially higher than for men, so women must save

more to maintain desired consumption levels over a longer period. For example, at age 25 (the

starting point of our lifecycle model), the life expectancy of females is age 81, or about 4.5

years more than for males. Both women’s and men’s consumption drops slightly during the

retirement period, which is in line with both empirical evidence and theoretical lifecycle
                                                                                                          10


literature (Chai et al. 201, Battistin et al. 2009). This can be explained by the sharp increase in

leisure time after people claim Social Security benefits. 10

        Panels C and D of Table 1 reveal that the Social Security claiming patterns generated

by our model align closely with empirical claiming rates reported by the US Social Security

Administration. 11 That is, our model generates a large peak at the earliest claiming age at 62,

whereas as in the data, about 45% of workers claim their benefits at this point. Additionally,

and also in line with the evidence, our baseline results show a smaller second peak at the

(system-defined) Full Retirement Age of 66; here about 15% of workers claim benefits for the

first time. Overall, the results of our baseline calibration confirm that our model produces

realistic results that agree with observed work, saving, and claiming age behavior of U.S.

households.



Understanding the Impact of Interest Rates

        Having provided the baseline “normal” environment results, we next evaluate what

changes in a different interest rate environment. To this end we examine two experiments. First

we reduce the (real) risk free interest from 1% to 0%, and second, we increase the real interest

rate to 2%. (In both cases we keep the equity risk premium at 4%). Table 1 reports results for

men and women, separately.

Table 1 here

        In this Table, we report the rates at which people claim their Social Security benefits by

age, as well as the overall claiming age. One key finding is that the lower is the risk free interest

rate the higher are claiming ages. In other words, when the long term interest rate falls to zero,

women claim about 0.4 years later, and men almost a full year later. Another point to note is

that claiming at the earliest possible age of 62 declines quite notably, more so for men but also


10
  This pattern conforms with evidence on expenditure drops after retirement found by Aguiar and Hurst (2005).
11
   For instance, see the US Social Security Administration. (2015), Table 6.B5. We adjust their data to omit
disability conversions at age 65 and scale the other age brackets so they sum to 100%.
                                                                                               11


for women. We explain this by noting that, when expected returns are high, the worker can

claim early Social Security benefits without needing to withdraw as much from his retirement

assets which continue to earn higher returns for a while longer. But when the real interest rate

is low, a worker can delay claiming Social Security in exchange for higher lifelong benefits,

and the cost of taking more from his retirement count to support consumption is lower. This is

in line with Shoven and Slavov (2014) who argued that, by delaying claiming, people can

maximize the actuarial net present value of their lifetime Social Security benefits in times of

low returns. By contrast when returns are higher, the net present value of benefits is maximized

by claiming early. Evidence from Shoven and Slavov (2012) and Cahill, Giandrea, and Quinn

(2015) also suggests that low (high) interest rates result in later (earlier) claiming ages.

Accordingly, our results are in line with empirical evidence.

       Table 2 shows how wealth accumulation changes under the two interest rate regimes,

both inside and outside the 401(k) plan. In the low return environment, workers build up less

wealth in their retirement plans. For instance, when the safe yield is 0%, middle aged women

(age 55-64) optimally accumulate an average of about $88,200 in their 401(k) plans, while in

the 2% yield scenario, they average one-third more, or $117,700 at the same point in their life

cycle. Middle-aged men accumulate $83,200 in the Zero-rate environment, and 45% more

($120,600) in the 2% interest rate scenario. Interestingly, the opposite pattern applies to assets

held outside the tax-qualified retirement plans. That is, women age 45-54 hold $16,600 in liquid

stocks and bonds when the interest rate is Zero, but only $9,800 in the two percent interest rate

scenario. The same effect also applies to males.

Table 2 here

       The divergent impact of low versus high interest rates on asset holdings inside versus

outside tax-qualified retirement plans can be explained as follows. When the interest rate is low,

people work fewer hours per week early in life, compared to workers in the higher interest

environment. For example, women work two hours per week less between age 25-60 than they
                                                                                                 12


do in the two percent interest rate scenario. 12 The reason is that, in the higher return scenario,

it is more attractive to build up savings early in life as these can grow at the higher rate. More

work effort then generates higher labor income, and because of the progressive tax system, this

results in a larger allocations to the tax-exempt retirement accounts. In addition, returns earned

on assets held inside the 401(k) plan are tax-free. This second advantage is, of course, smaller

in a zero return environment. Accordingly, when interest rates are low (high), workers devote

more (less) of their savings to non-retirement accounts.



Conclusions

           Financial writers have noted with concern that the long-term impact of very low interest

rates has been to drive some investors to “hunt for yield,” taking on riskier investments (Bryan

2016). Yet little academic research has focused on how persistent low returns would optimally

shape workers’ and retirees’ decisionmaking regarding accumulation and retirement patterns.

Our lifecycle model integrates realistic tax, Social Security, and minimum distribution rules, as

well as uncertain income, stock returns, and mortality. The baseline calibration generates a large

peak at the earliest claiming age at 62, in line with the evidence. Additionally, baseline results

produce a smaller second peak at the (system-defined) Full Retirement Age of 66. Overall, the

results of the baseline calibration confirm that our model produces realistic results that agree

with observed work, saving, and claiming age behavior of American households.

           The results of alternative interest rate regimes are also quite informative. One sensible

result is that people are predicted to save less during periods of low returns. Second, people

finance consumption relatively early in retirement by drawing down their 401(k) assets sooner.

Third, low rates also change where people save. During low-return periods, workers save less

in tax-qualified accounts and more outside tax-qualified plans, until retirement. The reason is

that the tax advantages of saving in 401(k) plans are relatively less attractive, inasmuch as the

gain from saving in pretax plans is lower, and because the return on assets in the retirement

account are lower in a low return environment. And fourth, we find that low interest rates drive

workers to claim Social Security benefits later, so they can take advantage of the relatively high

payoff to deferring retirement under current rules. In this way, we confirm that tax and Social

Security claiming rules have a powerful effect on how households are able to adjust to financial

market fluctuations.

 Notes: The top two panels show expected life cycle patterns for males and females (consumption, income, assets in 401(k)
 tax-qualified plans, and bonds/stocks. The lower two panels present claiming rates generated by our life cycle models versus
 empirical claiming rates as reported by the US Social Security Administration for the year 2014. Expected values are
 calculated from 100,000 simulated lifecycles based on optimal feedback controls. Results for the entire female (male)
 population are computed using income profile for three education levels: 62% +Coll; 30% HS; 8% <HS (60% +Coll; 30%
 HS; 10%<HS). Parameters used for the baseline calibration are as follows: risk aversion 𝜌𝜌 = 5; time preference 𝛽𝛽 = 0.96;
 leisure preference α=0.9 (female) α=1.1 (male); endogenous retirement age 62-70. Social Security benefits are based on
 average permanent income and the bend points in place in 2013; minimum required withdrawals from 401(k) plans are
 based on life expectancy using the IRS-Uniform Lifetime Table in 2013; tax rules for 401(k) plans are as described in
 Horneff (2015). The risk premium for stocks returns is 4% and return volatility 18%; the risk free rate in the baseline case
 is 1%. Source: Authors’ calculations.
