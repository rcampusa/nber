                            (PART I OF III PARTS)


                                   ABSTRACT


     This is the first part of a three-part paper on research on the elderly.

The objective of the paper is to present issues and research results in three

areas: economic status, retirement, and consumption and
                                                           saving. This part
covers background material on demographic change, living arrangements, income

growth and labor force participation, and research on economic Status.

     The major areas of research on economic status are: adjustments to

observed income to bring it closer to a welfare measure with the objective of

understanding whether the elderly are better off than the nonelderly; the

distribution of income among the elderly and in particular the extent and causes

of the high poverty level of elderly widows; wealth
                                                      holdings, especially
sources of wealth and the importance of public programs.

1. Introduction



     Research by economists on the elderly has grown rapidly since the 1978

review on the economics of aging in this Journal (Robert Clark, Juanita Kreps

and Joseph Spengler, 1978). An important reason for this growth is demographic

change. In 1900 just 4% of the population was elderly (65 or older). By 1980

the elderly were 11% of the population and they are projected to rise to 22% in

2040. Although each age group has its own productive capacities and demands,

the capacities and demands of the elderly are very different from the rest of

the population, so the large demographic changes will have a substantial impact

on society. For example, because few elderly work, their consumption must be

financed either through their own savings or through social programs: The

demographic changes are bound to put stress on capital markets and social

institutions. Each age group faces uncertainty, but the consequences of

uncertainty for the elderly are probably larger than for other age groups simply

because they have fewer remaining years over which to spread windfall gains or

losses. Furthermore, they have fewer responses to unexpected events. For

example, many retired elderly cannot return to the work force in response to an

unanticipated drop in income.

     A second reason for the increase in research on the elderly has been the

availability of data that can be used to study and test some basic economic

models. Retirement is an aspect of labor supply. The Social Security system

and pensions offer economic incentives that are different from the labor market

incentives offered earlier in life. The response of workers of retirement age

can provide information about the tradeoff between goods and leisure which can

complement knowledge gained from studying the labor supply of younger workers.

    The study of the consumption behavior of workers has been difficult because

their main asset, human capital, is not observed. The main assets of the


                                     1
retired elderly (financial assets, housing and claims on retirement programs).

however, are observed. Study is further simplified because the utility of

retired individuals only depends on consumption, whereas the utility of workers

depends on consumption and leisure. Therefore, only the intertemporal aspects

of utility maximization need to be considered, not the intratemporal aspects.

In life cycle models, consumption depends on the interest rate and on mortality

rates, as well as on assets. But variation in interest rates across individuals

is typically not observed, and, among younger people, variation in mortality

rates from person to person is so small that any effect is absorbed    in the

constant parameters of a consumption model. The mortality rates of the elderly

are substantial, and they vary considerably by age and by sex.   The variation

can econometrically identify important utility function parameters.

     The demographic changes and the research questions would have attracted

much less attention, however, had it not been for the Retirement History Survey

 (RHS). THE LUIS is a ten-year longitudinal survey of 11,153 households whose

 heads who were 58-63 in 1969. Every two years the heads (or their spouses       if


 the head had died) were questioned about income, assets, employment, health, and

 social and family interactions. Most importantly, the official Social Security

 earnings records were attached to the survey data. From them,   each person's

 Social Security eligibility and benefits can be calculated exactly. In

 principle, this provides the necessary data to estimate the effects of Social

 Security on retirement. The earnings records can also be used to     form a good

 estimate of lifetime earnings, which is almost necessary in any study of

 lifetime wealth accumulation. The RHS has proven to be an invaluable resource:

 many results to be discussed in this paper are derived from the RES data.

      The main goal of this paper is to present and analyze some major research

  questions and findings. The research falls in three main areas:     economic

  status of the elderly, retirement, and consumption and saving behavior.       Health,



                                       2
which is properly the subject of an entire paper, and social and family

relationships are only mentioned in connection with the topics covered.

      Because the analysis will often refer to recent economic and demographic

changes, the next section will use widely available data on
                                                              population, life
epeetancy, living arrangements, labor force participation, and income to

provide background for the discussion of the research.



2.   Demographic and Economic Changes.



      Between 1900 and 1980 the proportion of the population that was elderly

increased from 4% to 11% (Table 1). The proportion 85 and over increased from a

fraction of a percent to 1%, which is about 2 million people. Population

forecasts, which should be quite accurate over the next 30 years, show large

increases in the fraction of the population that is old.   By 2050, 6% (16

million people) of the population will be 85 or over; about eight million

people will be 90 or over. Thus between 1980 and 2050 the number aged 85 and

over is expected to increase by a factor of eight.

     Part of the change in the age distribution is due to a long-term fall in

birth rates, which, by itself, would have gradually increased the average age.

Part of the large projected increase in the elderly is due to the baby-boom

cohort (1946 to 1964). The fattest part of this bulge in the population will be

65 in 2020 and 95 in 2050. Mortality rates have fallen sharply, contributing to

the change in age distribution: in 1900 life expectancy at birth of males and

females was 46 and 49 years respectively; in 1980 it was 70 and 78.

     Life expectancy, conditional on reaching 65, is forecast to continue to

increase (Table 2). If there is no change in the average retirement age, the

fraction of life spent in retirement will increase. Financing more consumption

from a shorter worklife will strain the savings of each retired person. The


                                     3
problem for society is greater because the probability that an individual will

reach 65 will continue to increase and the number of individuals in the cohorts

approaching 65 will rise. Therefore, the fraction of output consumed by the

retired will increase substantially. This will affect not only Social Security

and private pensions but capital markets as the retired convert their savings

into   consumption.
       At the turn of the century, the conditional life expectancies of men and

women were practically the same. By 1980 a 65 year-old woman could expect to

live 4.2 years more than a 65 year-old man. The difference is forecast to

continue to increase slowly. Beyond the more obvious impacts on Social Security

and pensions, the differences in life expectancy mean that most of the very old

are widows. Because the very old must finance a long lifetime of consumption,

it is likely that they will have few assets toward the end of their lives.

Therefore, in the absence of social programs, the longer lifetimes of women will

lead to high rates of poverty among widows. As will be discussed below, elderly

widows have substantially higher poverty rates than others; the population

forecasts give no suggestion that demographic changes by themselves will reduce

the rates.

       Higher mortality rates of men affect the living arrangements of the

 elderly. In 1985, 53% of the elderly lived with a spouse, but the distribution

was very different for men and women: 75% of elderly men lived with their wives

 while only 38% of elderly women lived with their husbands (Table 3)1

 Differences in living arrangements by age were much smaller among men than among

 women because most wives outlive their husbands. For example, 49% of women aged

 65-74 lived with their spouses compared with 23% of women aged 75+. Most of the

 women not living with spouses would be widows. Of that group about two-thirds

 lived alone.         Comparisons over time show a small increase in the fraction of

 elderly men living with a spouse (probably due to the increase in the life


                                          4
expectancy of women), and a modest increase in the fraction living alone.
                                                                             Among
women the changes were much greater: 24% lived alone 1960, 41% in 1985. The

fraction living with relatives fell from 34% to 18%. The largest changes were

among women 75 and over: during the 25 years the fraction living alone almost

doubled from 26% to 50%; the fraction living with relatives fell from 46% to

25%. The trend from living with relatives to living alone was due, at least

partly, to rising economic resources (Robert Michael, Victor Fuchs and Sharon

Scott, 1980; Karen Holden, 1986; Saul Schwartz, Sheldon Danziger and Eugene

Smolensky, 1984). If incomes are stable in the future, a continuing increase in

the difference in life expectancies, as forecast in Table 3, implies that about

half of elderly women will live alone.

     The average real income of the elderly, as conventionally measured in the

Current Population Survey, increased by about 29% between 1970 and 1986 (Table

4), with more than half of the increase coming between 1970 and 1975. The mean

income of the entire population increased by only 8.5%, so that the income of

the the elderly relative to the entire population rose from 0.54 to 0.64. As

will be discussed below, this income measure is far from what economists would

call a full income measure, and it makes no provision for differences in

household size. Nonetheless, the figures give a good indication of the relative

income gain of the elderly.

     The income growth of the elderly was accompanied by rather large changes in

the source of income as shown in Table 5. Income from earnings fell from 29% of

total income in 1967 to 17% in 1986. The fraction of income from Social

Security and pensions increased from 49% to 54%, mostly due to increases in

Social Security. Income from assets increased substantially but, as to be

discussed below, assets are so highly concentrated that the change was not

important for many of the elderly

     Table 6 gives the distribution of elderly households according to the


                                    5
fraction of each household's income from various sources. For example, in 1971,

69% of elderly households had no earnings, 16% had from 1% to 49% of their

income from earnings, and 15% had 50% to 100% of their income from earnings.

The table shows that by 1986, 81% of elderly households had no income from

earnings, and that just 8% had more than half of their income from earnings.@2

     The percentage of households having no income from Social Security dropped

from 13% in 1971 to 8% in 1986. This change is partly due to increasing

coverage of Social Security. It is also due to earlier retirement: under the

Social Security law, few full-time workers would receive Social Security

benefits, so as participation rates fell, the fraction receiving Social Security

benefits rose. The importance of Social Security to most elderly can hardly be

overstated: in 1986 57% had more than half of their income from Social

Security, and 24% had more than 90%.

     Although the fraction of the elderly with income from public and private

pensions and annuities (almost all pensions) has increased, pensions are still a

modest source of income. In 1986, only 26% had private pension income; about

13% had government pensions. These figures imply that, at most, 39% of

households had some pension income. Even among those with pension income, few

households had a large fraction of their income from pensions: just 7% of

households had more than 50% of their income from either private or public

 pensions. Again, 57% of households had more than half of their income from

 Social Security.

      Table 6 confirms that asset income (which does not include any imputed

 income to housing equity) has become more important; yet, in 1986 40% of

 households had no income from assets, and 70% of households had less than 20% of

 their income from assets. These figures accord with findings to be reported

 later that many households retire with practically no financial savings.

 Although asset income was 26% of total income (Table 5), most households had


                                       6
small amounts from assets, reflecting the highly skewed distribution of wealth.

   The decrease in the importance of earnings is reflected in changes in labor

force participation, which for the elderly, is practically synonymous with

retirement. The changes in participation are large: between 1950 and 1987 the

participation rate of elderly men fell from 46% to 16%. In comparison, the

participation rate of the population increase from 60% to 66%, due to increased

participation by women. The fall in participation has been greatest at the most

advanced ages, but even at younger ages it has been substantial (Table 7). For

example, the participation rate of men 55-59 fell between 1957 and 1987 from

91.4% to 79.7%.

     The normal retirement age of men, which at one time was 65 or even older,

is now less than 65 Many men retire in their late 50's. Among women two

opposite trends, earlier retirement and higher lifetime participation rates,

have kept the participation rates of 60-64 and 65-69 years olds approximately

constant. A way to isolate the trend to earlier retirement is to calculate the

retirement hazard rate, which is the probability of retirement at age T given

labor force participation at age T-l. A rough calculation of the retirement

hazard rate can be made from the participation rates of Table 7 by assuming that

the cross-section participation probabilities are the same as the participation

probabilities as an individual ages.



                                   Retirement Hazard Rates



                          Men                           Women

                  55-59 to      60-64 to       55-59 to         60-64 to
     Year          60-64         65-69          60-64            65-69

According to this method of calculation, in 1957 the probability of retiring at

ages 60-64 given labor force participation at ages 55-59 was 0.093 for men and

0.207 for women. Thus, even among the small number of women     who were in the

labor force later in life the retirement probabilities were higher than the

retirement probabilities of men. The retirement hazards of men increased more

so that by 1987 the hazards of men and women were about the same.

     The data discussed in this section show large changes in the demographic

structure of the population, and in the income, labor force participation, and

living arrangements of the elderly. Some of the research to be reviewed in the

rest of the paper will aim at understanding the consequences of these changes,

and some will aim at learning the causes of the changes.



 3. Economic Status



      The broad goals of the research on economic status have been to find better

                                                                   and to use the
 measures of economic well-being than simple income statistics,

 measures to determine whether the economic status of the elderly has improved

 over time, whether it has improved faster than the   economic status of the

 nonelderly, and whether it is higher than the economic status of the nonelderly.

 The ultimate social usefulness of the work is to assess whether the system of
                                                                                    the
 transfers from the nonelderly to the elderly is adequate. Broadly speaking,
                                                              could be used to help
 work has immediate policy implications. For example, it
                                                               should be borne by the
 decide how much of the rising Medicare and Medicaid costs

 elderly and how much by the nonelderly.

       Some of the research is concerned with measurement:     how to impute income

  flows from nonmoney sources such as housing, and Medicare    and Medicaid, and how


                                       8
to adjust for taxes and underreporting of income. Other research aims to find

welfare measures from income: how to adjust for family size and composition to

account for need. Considerable work has been aimed at distributional aspects of

income, in particular, at poverty. Some work has been done on wealth measures

of well being, but limitations of data and comparability with the nonelderly

limit its application.3



3.1 Trends in Income



     No single study has an income series with all the household size

adjustments and adjustments to income that are desired. Therefore, I first give

results that are based on the consistent application of one particular size

adjustment. The similarity of method over years should increase our confidence

in the observed trends. Then, I give results for a single year that incorporate

all the adjustments. Provided there is stability of the effects of the

adjustments, the two approaches taken together should give a good idea of the

fully adjusted trends.

     Table 8 shows annual growth rates in income and the level of income in 1984

adjusted for household size according to the official poverty index.4 In this

scaling, one nonelderly person has a weight of 1.024, two nonelderly persons

1.322, three persons (either elderly or nonelderly) 1.568 and so forth.5

Elderly persons are given slightly smaller weights (about 8% smaller than the

nonelderly). Size-adjusted income (income per equivalent person) is household

income divided by the household weight. The scaling embodies the assumption of

substantial returns to scale in household consumption: a two-person nonelderly

household requires only 29% more income than a one-person household. This

scaling yields income measures that are closer to income per household than to

income per person: income per household has an implicit weight of 1.0 for all


                                     9
households whereas income per person is based on assigning a weight of 1.0 to

each person.

     The average elderly family unit is smaller than the average nonelderly

                                                            in 1980), so the size
family unit (1.7 persons per household versus 3.0 persons

adjustments will raise the income measure of the elderly relative to the

nonelderly. In Table 8 the ratio of incomes of the nonelderly to    the elderly

was 0.67 in 1984 with no size adjustment; the ratio was 0.87 with the size

adjustment. Average family size has decreased over time, but it has decreased

more for the nonelderly than for the elderly. Therefore, the size adjustment

will produce a larger increase in income per equivalent person of the nonelderly
                                                                   the annual rate
than of the elderly. For example, the size adjustment increased

of growth of income between 1979 and 1984 by 0.9% for the nonelderly but by just

0.3% for the elderly.

      By either the unadjusted or adjusted income measure the elderly had much

higher rates of growth of income than the nonelderly.     These differences

                                                                              For

 Source: Table 8



 The growth of income of the nonelderly has come from increased work effort,6

 whereas earnings of the elderly have fallen as their labor force participation

  rates declined.

       Table 8 shows that, after adjusting for size, in most cases income growth


                                        10
increased with age. This is partly due to the aging of younger, more wealthy

cohorts and partly due to increases in Social Security, which are relatively

more important to the very old. Still, as measured in Table 8, by 1984 the

incomes of the most elderly were still lower than the incomes of any age group.

     Table 9 indicates that incomes of the elderly increased throughout the

income distribution.7 In the second decile their incomes grew rapidly during

the first time period, possibly due to large across-the-board increases in

Social Security benefits. They continued to grow in the second time period,

although at a slower rate. Total growth over both periods was about 84%. The

nonelderly in the second decile had much less growth during the first period,

and their incomes fell substantially during the second period. The difference

in the experience of the nonelderly and the elderly is clearly shown by the

sharp break in growth rates at ages 60-64. Total income growth of the

nonelderly over both periods was very close to zero.

     The elderly in the ninth decile had consistent income growth, but overall

(1967-1984) it was less than the elderly in the second decile: 49% compared

with 84%. The nonelderly in the ninth percentile also had income growth over

both periods, and, although there were some differences in each period, total

growth was not much different from the income growth of the elderly in the ninth

decile. It was much different, however, from the income growth of the

nonelderly in the second decile.

     The general impression from the table is that the poorer elderly have done

much better than the poorer nonelderly, especially between 1979 and 1984.

 Incomes of the well-to-do elderly have increased sharply in recent years,

 probably due to the increase in asset income noted in Tables 5 and 6. Between

 1969 and 1984 income inequality among the nonelderly seems to have increased,

 particularly from 1979 to 1984. From 1969 to 1984 income inequality among the

 elderly probably decreased, but not from 1979 to 1984.

     In 1967, when this cohort was 65-69 years old, its mean real income was

$11,095; in 1979, when it was 75-79 years old, its mean real income was

$10,847. Some may find the stability of income surprising in view of the high

rates of inflation during the 1970's. At one time it was generally thought that

 the elderly live on fixed incomes and are vulnerable to inflation; but   these

 figures suggest the income of the elderly is effectively indexed.

      The stability between 1967 and 1979 is not a reliable indicator of income

 indexing because of two countervailing changes: earnings would have dropped

 because of the trend toward earlier retirement; Social Security benefits would

 have increased due to changes in the benefit schedule in the early part of the

 1970's. However, the stability between 1979 and 1984, when the CPI increased by

 43%, certainly indicates effective indexing.8     Just why income should be

 effectively indexed is not apparent from the distribution of income by source

 shown in Table 5. At least part of pension income and part of asset income are

 not indexed, so thattotal income is not completely indexed. Detailed study of

 income in the RRS, however, confirms that incomes of individuals were stable


                                         12
during the l970s, a period of high and variable inflation (Burkhauser, Holden

and Feaster, 1988).   Apparently the unindexed parts of income were small and

concentrated among a few individuals.

     A different method of finding inflation vulnerability is based on how the

value of assets (including the present value of income flows such as Social

Security) is expected to change when inflation changes (Hurd and Shoven, 1985).

For example, long-term nominal bonds are vulnerable to changes in the inflation

rate whereas housing wealth is not. According to this measure of inflation

vulnerability, very few of the elderly would be affected substantially by a

change in inflation. This implies that the real value of the income flows from

the assets will not change with changes in inflation, which is consistent with

the effective indexing of income in the table.



3.2. Income comparisons.
                                                                    -




     The aim of the research on income comparisons is to understand better the

economic status of the elderly compared with the nonelderly. Its method is to

bring income measures closer to welfare measures by adjusting income for

nonmoney components, underreporting and taxes, and by scaling for family size.

     Table 10 shows the ratio of average income of the elderly to the nonelderly-

for several different income measures and for several size adjustments.

Conventional income is the usual income measure from the Current Population

Surveys; according to conventional income elderly households had just 52% of

the income of nonelderly households in 1971. Line B shows income adjusted for

the value of in-kind transfers, implicit income from housing, employment-related

benefits and direct taxes. These changes are important. In-kind transfers

increased the incomes of the elderly by $1430 per household, $1344 of which is

the market value of the transfers they receive on average through the Medicare


                                        13
and Medicaid programs. The elderly have lower tax rates than the nonelderly,

even holding income constant. They hold more housing equity.      The effect of all

these adjustments is to increase incomes of the elderly by about 12%. The most

important changes for the nonelderly are taxes, and work-related benefits.

These changes decrease average income by 10%. As a result, as     shown in line B,

the ratio of household incomes increases to 0.65.

     Adjusted income in Table 10 differs from income in two ways.      The most

important difference is due to underreporting of income: according to a

validation study of survey data, the nonelderly underreport on average by about

3%, but the elderly underreport by about 37%, mainly property income (Radner,

1983). This adjustment, which is done for each income source at the household

level, substantially increases the income ratios. The other adjustment changes

the method of valuing the noninoney transfers in line B: they are    valued at an

estimate of what the recipient would be willing to pay for them (recipient

value) ,   rather   than at the cost to the provider (market value). The recipient

 value is less than the market value especially for the poor. This adjustment

 lowers the income ratio due to the large transfers through the Medicare/Medicaid

 system, but the change is minor compared with the change for income

 underreporting.

      The table has three different adjustments to household income for household

 size and composition. The aim is to bring household income closer to an

 individual welfare measure by dividing income by a suitable index. The index

 used in calculating per capita income is, of course, just the number of people

 in the household. It embodies the assumption that there are no returns to scale

 in household consumption. The poverty line index is based on the poverty scale;

 it was used in the size adjustments in Table 8. It implies substantial returns

  to scale: according to this index, if a single elderly male has a consumption

  weight of 1.0, a husband and wife have a consumption weight    of 1.26. That is,


                                           14
the couple would be deemed to be as well off as the single male if their income

was 26% greater. The budget share index was estimated from observed variation

in consumption patterns as family composition varied in the 1972-73 Consumer

Expenditure Survey (van der Caag and Smolensky, 1982). At least conceptually

this is the best of the indices of household size. Compared with the poverty

scale it has more modest returns to scale in consumption: according to this

index an elderly husband and wife need about 37% more income than a single male.

     In my view line B is a better income-based measure of welfare because it is

more inclusive. In principle, adjusted income is superior to income, although

the adjustment for underreporting only makes sense on average: the

underreporting is mainly associated with property income which is highly

concentrated. As a rough welfare measure, household income is too high, as it

implies it is costless to add additional individuals to a household. Per capita

income is too low because it bars any returns to scale. The poverty line index

is not based on any observed behavior or theoretical model. That leaves the

budget share measure. The income and adjusted-income ratios are 1.04 and 1.28

respectively, implying that in 1979 the elderly were at least as well off on

average as the nonelderly, and possibly better off.

     The results in Table 10, which are based on detailed analysis of 1979 CPS

data, can be updated by applying the observed growth in CPS income. According

 to the Cl'S, the ratio of mean incomes of the elderly to the nonelderly increased

by 12.3% between 1979 and 1986. If all the components and adjustments to income

 of Table 10 grew at the same relative rate, the income ratio would grow from

 1.04 to 1.17 and the adjusted-income ratio from 1.28 to 1.44.

      Most researcher would agree, I believe, that on average the elderly are at

 least as well off as the nonelderly as measured by income,10 but, as the entries

 in Table 10 suggest, the magnitude of the differential is not precisely

 measured. From the point of view of public policy, however, precision is not


                                      15
required: if the elderly are as well off as the nonelderly, there    is little

reason for new policy that would transfer income to them. Policy    should

concentrate on the distribution of income among the elderly.



3.3. Distribution of Income.



     Even though Social Security is an important source of income and it acts

strongly to reduce income inequality through the progressivity of the schedule

from lifetime earnings to benefits, income of the elderly appears to be more

unequally distributed than income of the nonelderly. Table 11 has Gini

coefficients of income and the percentage of income to the highest income

quintile. Although there is some variation by year, data set and income

measure, both inequality measures show more income inequality among the elderly

than among the nonelderly. The results from the 1973 Consumer Expenditure

Survey and the 1979 CPS (unadjusted) are based on the same income measure and

they yield about the same Gini coefficients. The adjustments to income in the

1979 CPS reduce income inequality because the well-to-do have higher tax rates

and the poor receive a larger fraction of their budgets from nonmoney transfers.

The differences between the unadjusted and adjusted inequality measures are

 greatest among the elderly because of the importance of Medicare and Medicaid.

 The last three lines are based on consistent methods of measuring income in the

 CPS: they embody the poverty scale size adjustment for household size discussed

 earlier. They verify increasing inequality from 1979 to 1984 especially among

 the nonelderly, as was found in Table 9.

      Income levels, sources of income and the changes in income by source are

 very different for the highest and lowest quintiles. Table 12     shows that the

 lowest quintile had about 8% of the income of the highest quintile in 1967;

 about 13% in 1979 and 12% in 1984.11 Earnings in the lowest quintile were


                                       16
negligible. For this group, Social Security benefits were the only important

source of income, and benefit increases were the main reason for increasing

income: of the $1870 change in real income between 1967 and 1984, 81% was due

to increases in Social Security benefits. Real earnings of the highest quintile

fell over the 17-year period, but the other components of income increased

sharply. Social Security benefits increased by a factor of 2.5, which is a

higher rate than the rate of the lowest quintile. The category "Other" is, for

the highest quintile, mostly pensions.

      The growth in Social Security benefits, especially between 1967 and 1973,

is at least partly due to an upward shift in the benefit schedule, partly to

earlier retirement (which causes a shift in income from earnings to Social

Security benefits), and partly to increasing lifetime contributions of each

cohort. Table 13 gives Social Security benefits of the cohort born in 1893-1897

which, except for mortality, holds constant lifetime earnings. Because most

people had retired by age 70, it also eliminates much of the retirement effect

on benefits. Thus, most of the change will be due to changes in the benefit

schedule.

      Between 1967 and January, 1972 the benefit schedule was changed to increase

benefits by 43% holding lifetime earnings constant. A further increase in

September, 1972 raised the total change from 1967 to 72%. Total inflation over

the period was about 25%. In Table 13 mean real benefits increased by about 36%

(38% for the fifth decile) between 1967 and 1972, which is consistent with the

changes in the benefit schedule. Following the increase in 1972, benefits have

been indexed, so any increases in average benefits after retirement come from

compositional effects. (For example, the poor die sooner than the well-to-do,

so average benefits will rise with age.) The table shows, again, the importance

of Social Security benefits, especially for the very elderly: in 1982 they were

70%   of   the income of 85-89 year-olds.


                                            17
3.4. Poverty



     The poverty rate of the elderly is an aspect of income distribution that
                                                     because until recently it has
has been the object of considerable study probably

been high and because poverty is especially troubling for the elderly. They

have few ways to recover from a loss of income, so a fall into poverty tends to

be permanent.

     The poverty rate is the fraction of a population whose incomes fall below

the poverty line, which varies by age and household composition. The poverty
                                                        it was $6,871 for an
line for a single elderly person was $5,447 in 1987;

elderly couple.   I suspect that most people would regard the poverty line as low

 indeed, and that someone with income substantially above the poverty line is

 still poor.

      Table 14 shows that, in line with the increases in income, the poverty
                                                  1984 they were lower than the
 rates of the elderly have declined sharply. By

 poverty rates of the nonelderly, and they remained lower through 1987.12 As

 reference to Table 12 shows, the Social Security system can claim a major role

 in the rather remarkablereduCtiOn of poverty among the elderly. The decline

 was largest for the oldest. Yet their poverty rate remains high for reasons

 connected with widowhood, as will be discussed below.
                                                     increases income measures of
      Putting a value on nonmoney income transfers

 the elderly considerably, which should lead to a large reduction in poverty

 rates. The following table shows that to be the case.

The table has poverty rates by age for various income measures.'3 The market

measure values nonmoney transfers at cost; the recipient measure values them at

an estimate of their value to the recipient)4 Including food and housing

transfers in income reduces poverty modestly for both elderly and nonelderly.

Due to the size of Medicare and Medicaid, however, including medical transfers

has a large effect: if medical transfers are valued at market cost, the poverty

rate of the elderly was 4.5% in 1979. In my view, the size of the transfer is

so large (about $1,344 in 1979 dollars), especially in relation to the income

levels of the poor elderly, that any poverty rates based on augmented income are

bound to be only suggestive.15 Nonetheless, th implicit transfers in the

Medicare and Medicaid program are large and certainly they are of value to the

poor elderly. The transfers have continued to grow much faster than the rate of

inflation (they grew by about 36% in real terms between 1979 and 1984),

suggesting that the poverty rates of the elderly in Table 14, which were already

below the poverty rates of the nonelderly, would be substantially below

following some adjustment for nonmoney income transfers.

     The poverty rate of elderly widows has also declined, but it remains

considerably higher than the poverty rates of the population and of the rest of

the elderly. Some of the poverty is undoubtedly due to the high fraction of the


                                         19
very elderly that are widows:   cet,par. one would expect the very elderly to be

poor simply because they must finance a longer lifetime of consumption from a

given lifetime wealth. Table 15 shows, however, that the explanation is more

complicated. It is true that widows aged 72 and over had higher poverty rates
                                                           rates at least as high.
than widows aged 65-71; but younger widows had poverty

     One explanation is differential mortality by income level: husbands in

poor families die sooner than husbands in well-to-do families. For example, in

the R}1S the poverty rate in 1969 of couples who survived intact during the

entire ten years of the R}tS was 7.6%. The poverty rate in 1969 of couples in

which the husband eventually died during the ten years of the R}IS was 11.7%

 (Holden, Burkhauser and Myers, 1986). One might think the difference in poverty
                                                 several years before the husband's
 rates is caused by health expenditures in the

 death; but the association with poverty in 1969 and eventual widowhood lasts

 over many years. For example, the poverty rate in 1969 of couples in which the

 husband died between 1977 and 1979 was 9.2%, again compared with 7.6% for

 couples intact between 1969 and 1979.

      Mortality rates are also associated with wealth levels (Table 16). couples

 in the 1977 RIIS were divided into two groups: those who survived intact between
                                                          the husband died between
 197] and 1979 (surviving couples) and those in which
                                                             wealth in each of the
  1977 and 1979 (widowed couples). The table gives median

  six R1{S surveys (covering the years 1969 to 1979) by   that classification. All

                                                           had higher wealth than the

  widowed couples as early as 1969, more than eight years before the husband

  died)6 These results imply that the widowed couple would have had fewer assets

  had the husband survived, and, therefore, would have had a higher probability of

  being in povertyJ7     The causes of the differential mortality are not known,

  but there is some indication that lifetime health differences play a role.
                                                                    both of which are

                                         20
good summaries of lifetime earnings, were higher for the surviving couples.18

This suggests that lifetime health differences affect both lifetime earnings and

mortality rates after retirement, causing the observed correlation.

     Beyond differential mortality the transition to widowhood itself seems to

induce poverty. Table 17 gives poverty rates by marital transition between 1975

and 1977 for the entire sample of 1975 couples and for the 1975 couples not in

poverty in 1975. The table shows that widowed couples (1975-1977) had somewhat

but not greatly higher poverty rates than the other couples in the years before

the husbands died. However, in the first survey year after the husbands deaths

the poverty rate of the surviving widows rose to 42% while the poverty rate of

the intact couples was just 7%. Other calculations (not given here) show that

the average increase in poverty following widowhood was 30%. The increase is

partly due to income mismeasureinent associated with the husband's death

(Burkhauser, Holden and Myers, 1986), but mostly due to permanent changes in

economic resources as shown by the high poverty rate in 1979. The two right-

hand columns give poverty of couples that were above the poverty line in 1975.

37% of the surviving widows, none of whom had been in poverty in 1975, were in

poverty in 1977.

     One might well imagine that much of the increase in poverty at the

husband's death is due to the termination of his earnings. Apparently, however,

this is not the case: using RHS data Burkhauser, Holden and Feaster (1988)

studied the determinants of the hazard of poverty of widows, the probability of

entering poverty among those not already in poverty. Only 10.1% of the

transitions into poverty were associated with the loss of the husband's

earnings. About two-thirds of the cases were associated with widowhood itself

and with a decline in nonwage income, particularly Social Security. Even after

the husband's retirement (so that he had no earnings), the probability of a

transition into poverty when the husband dies is high (Holden, Burkhauser and


                                     21
Feaster, 1988)

     Changes in the components of wealth at the husband's death provide some

explanation for the high poverty rates of widows. Among the widowed couples,

wealth in all the categories declined between 1977 and 1979 (Table lG).19

Similar calculations over all transition years in the R}IS show that total median

wealth declined by 31% during the years of the husband's death compared with an

increase of 2% over the same years among surviving couples.    Most of the loss is

in Social Security wealth, which is to be expected: according to the Social

Security rules the couple's benefit is reduced when the husband dies. For

couples of this age and cohort the typical reduction would be about 33% of the

couple's benefit. Because the poverty line of a single elderly person is just

21% below the poverty line of an elderly couple, the difference in the changes

in Social Security benefits and the poverty line will itself cause some widows

 to become poor. There is no particular reason to believe that either factor

properly reflects returns to scale in consumption:   both are arbitrary.

      Table 16 shows that pension wealth declines sharply when the husband dies:

 at the time of the RHS most husbands did not have pensions with survivorship

 rights (Myers, Burkhauser and Maiden, 1986). The Retirement Equity Act of 1984

 is meant to encourage the choice of a pension with survivorship rights.
                                                              could choose a
 Previously the pension beneficiary (typically the husband)

 pension with no survivorship rights. Since 1984 the pension will have

 survivorship rights unless both the husband and the wife request otherwise.

 Simulations over the RIIS population show that changing all pensions to have

 survivorship rights would have raised substantially the incomes of those widows

 whose husbands had pensions without survivor's benefits. However, the poverty

 rate of all widows would have been remained high, about 22%, compared with 26%

 before the change. The effect on the poverty rate was small for two reasons:

  first, about 30% of pensions had survivor's benefits already; second, there is


                                       22
a strong positive association between economic status and pension eligibility,

so that few of the poor widows would have been eligible for pension benefits

even with sur-vivorship rights. This general result should carry over to the

population. It is hard to see that survivorship rights to pensions will have a

large impact on the high poverty rates of widows.

     The causes of the high rates of poverty among elderly widows are varied and

complex. Some families reach retirement already poor or near poor. Were the

husband to survive the family would have a high risk of poverty, but. because

husbands in poor families tend to die sooner than husbands in wealthy families,

often the widow inherits the family's poverty. In addition some sources of

income drop when the husband dies and some wealth is reduced. How much poverty

is due to the spending of assets as an individual ages is not clear. Cross-

section poverty rates have cohort effects: the oldest are from cohorts that had

lower lifetime earnings. We need panel data over, say, 20 years to control for

cohort effects: we could then observe the life cycle effects.



3.5. Wealth.



     Although income is practically the only measure of economic status in use,

life cycle considerations suggest that, at least for the retired elderly, wealth

is a better measure because it measures consumption opportunities. However, the

kinds of intergenerational comparisons that are based on income cannot easily be

made using wealth because a large fraction of the wealth of workers is future

earnings, which are not observed. Even wealth comparisons among the retired

elderly of different ages are not straightforward because of variation in life

expectancy: for example, who is better off, a 70 year-old with $100,000 or an

80 year-old with $50,000? One could, of course, calculate the annuity each

could purchase to translate the comparison into income terms, but the


                                      23
consumption path implied by the annuity might not be the desired path.    Another

method would be to ask whether the 70 year-old he would have more or less than

$50,000 should he life to 80. This involves finding the optimal consumption

path. Although there has been some research on consumption paths    of the elderly

(to be discussed later), the research is not well-enough advanced to make

confident comparisons based on the estimated paths. Notwithstanding these

problems of comparison, wealth data are a valuable alternative or supplement to

income data.

     The following table has estimates of average bequeathable wealth of the

           20
elderly.

      Both the Survey of Program Participation (SIPP) and the Survey of Consumer

 Finances (SCF) without supplement are self-weighting samples.21 The estimates

 of mean wealth differ somewhat but they are probably not significantly

 different. (Given the typical dispersion of wealth, the standard errors are

 bound to be very large.) The SCF with supplement differs from the SCF without

 supplement by the addition of 438 high income households.22 Even though both of

 the SCF estimates of mean wealth are weighted by the sampling weights, so that,

 in principle, the means should be the same, the estimates are widely different.

 This happens because wealth is so highly concentrated. (The Cmi coefficient in


                                       24
the wealth of the elderly is 0.78 from the SCF with supplement (McDermed, Clark

and Allen, 1987), whereas the Cmi coefficient of income is about 0.35. The

fraction of wealth in the top 1% of the wealth distribution is about 35%) The

high concentration of wealth, makes it difficult to find wealth measures that

represent the situation of most of the elderly. An alternative to the mean is,

of course, the median. But it has drawbacks for studying the sources of wealth,

which has been an important research topic: the medians of the wealth

components cannot be aggregated and some categories will have medians of zero.

For these reasons and for comparability with the RMS and other data sets (which

are self-weighting), I analyze mean wealth from the SCF without supplement and

from the SIPP.

     Mean wealth of the elderly was about $100,000 in these data sets. This

does not include a few asset categories such as consumer durables, but much more

important from the point of view of describing available resources it does not

include any claim on Social Security, pensions or Medicare/Medicaid. At a real

interest rate of 3% the assets add just $3,000 per year to income from other

sources. This is about 18% of the average household income of the elderly in

1983 ($16,386). Should an elderly person consume part of the wealth as he ages,

the wealth could make a much higher contribution to consumption. Suppose, for

example, a 70 year-old woman chose a flat consumption over 15 years, which is

about her life expectancy. At a real interest rate of 3%, she could consume

$8,300 per year (1983$) from the wealth. This is about 51% of average income in

1983. Of course, a flat consumption path is probably not optimal (she might

live to 86), but the example implies that, on average, wealth accumulation for

retirement is adequate, provided the wealth is consumed.

     To form a complete picture of the resources of the elderly we need more

 inclusive wealth measures than are available from either the SCF or the SIPP.

Table 18 has fully inclusive average net wealth from the 1975 and 1979 RHS. The


                                     25
ages of most of the heads of households were 64-69 in 1975 and 68-73 in 1979, so

the table shows wealth near the beginning of retirement.    In fact, future

earnings accounted for only 6% of wealth in 1975 and 3% in 1979, so, practically

speaking, the sample had retired by 1979.    Financial wealth includes stocks and

bonds, savings accounts and so forth. Flows (all but the first three entries)

are converted to stocks through actuarial discounting,   either real or nominal

depending on the flow.   SSI. is Supplemental Security Income, a means-tested old

age welfare program. Transfers

Medicare and Medicaid is the expected present value of the per household

transfer through the Medicare and. Medicaid program evaluated at cost,   the market


value discussed earlier.23

     The average wealth levels are reasonably high and consistent with

independent measures of income and wealth.24 I imagine, however, that most

people would be surprised at how little saving is in the conventional form of

 financial, business and property wealth: about 22% in 1975 and 23% in 1979.

Adding in housing equity to find the fraction of saving that takes place at the

 household level brings these figures to 36% and 41%. Pensions    and Social

 Security, which are savings done by firms and society on behalf of the

 household, accounted for 46% in 1975. Both in levels and as percentages of

 total wealth, the sum of pensions and Social Security fell between 1975 and 1979

 because of higher mortality discounting as the R}IS sample aged, and,   in the case

 of pensions, because inflation reduced the real value. Undoubtedly, for the

 same reasons I discussed earlier in connection with the valuation of the income

 flow from Medicare and Medicaid, the most controversial entry is the wealth

 value of Medicare and Medicaid.25 It accounted for 10% of wealth in 1975 and

  12% in 1979.26 Its value rose between 1975 and 1979 despite the aging of the
                                                                          because

rate.

        The level of wealth in the lowest wealth decile is low indeed, and consists

almost entirely of wealth from public programs. Any underreporting is not

likely to be substantial because most underreporting is associated with

financial assets; but even allowing for some, it is clear that many elderly

reach retirement with very little. Research has not discovered why this

happens.

                                   Notes

1. An additional reason for this difference is that women tend to marry older

men.

2. A households is classified as elderly if the "householder" is elderly;

earnings can come from a nonelderly spouse.

3. In much of this section I use averages or other summary measures. The
                                                     the averages will mask the 4.
elderly are a very diverse population, however, so

Although the consumption bundles of the elderly and the nonelderly are somewhat

different, a Laspayres index based on the consumption bundle of the elderly has

varied little from the CPI over either short or long time periods (Boskin and

Hurd, 1985; Bridges and Packard, 1982). Therefore, I use the CPI to convert

nominal dollars to real dollars unless the original research used some other

index.

 5. The poverty scaling is rather arbitrarily based on food consumption in 1955

 (Palmer, Smeeding and Jencks, 1988).

 6. In 1984 average hourly real nonagricultural earnings were almost exactly the

 same as in 1967. Table B-44, 1988 Economic Report of the President.

 7. The table does not show the experience of any cohort; it measures changes

 in the means of the deciles of each age interval.

 8. There was, of course, some change in composition due to mortality between

 1979 and 1984, which probably tended to increase average income.    This issue

 will be discussed later in connection with age-related wealth changes.

 9. The validation study used outside information from Social Security and IRS

 records to check the accuracy of income items in the 1973 CPS.

  10. In addition to the studies already discussed, see Boskin and Shoven (1987);

  Danziger et. al. (1984a, l984b); Hurd and Shoven (1982, 1984); Ross Danziger

  and Smolensky (1987).

  11. Income is observed cash income from the CPS adjusted for household size


                                        I
according to the poverty scale.

12. In 1987 the   poverty   rate of the elderly was 12.2% and of the population was

13.5%. This more recent data does not have the age detail of Table 14.

13. The entries under money income vary from the official poverty levels (and

front the levels in Table 14) because of difference is weighting.

14. The method aims to find the expenditures the recipient family would have

made, given its characteristics and income, if it had purchased the nonmoney

transfers in markets. The ratio of the estimated expenditures to the market

value of the transfers in the benefit weight. The benefit weight for Medicare

and Medicaid transfers is 0.42 (Smeeding, 1982).

IS. For example, it seems unlikely that if a two-person elderly household at

the poverty line ($4,400) were given an additional $1,344 and the opportunity to

buy into the Medicare and Medicaid program, it would choose to spend the full

$1,344 in such a way.

16. Table 16 is an example of many similar results obtained when the

classification is by marital transition in other years.

17. Similar results have been obtained by Jianakoplos et al (1989) in the

National Longitudinal Survey of older men.

 18.   Age will cause differences in the wealth measures of Social Security and
 pensions because the discounting that converts the future flows to stocks rises

 with age. But the wealth differences are too large to be caused by age

 differences: the husbands in the widowed couples were about 0.35 year older

 than the husbands in the surviving couples.

 19. Earnings are not shown in the table: because the husbands were 66-71 year

 old in 1977, median earnings were zero.

 20. Family unit wealth in the SCF; household wealth in the SIPP.
                                                                            all net
 21. Wealth includes financial assets, real estate, and housing equity,
                                                                        value of
 of debts. It excludes pension and Social Security wealth, the cash


                                         2
life insurance and household durables. The SCF also excludes the value of

automobiles and equity in small businesses and farms. The sample sizes are 3824

(SCF) and 18,700 (SIPP) all ages included.

22. Although weights are given for the high income households, it is by no

means clear that weighted averages are accurate: only 9% of the high income

families that were asked to participate in the survey responded that they would

participate. This raises obvious questions about the representativeness of the

sample.

23. This is the method used by Smeeding (1989), and by Clark, et. al. (1984).

24. For example, Smeeding (1989) calculates full income of the elderly to be

$13,423; if the wealth in 1979 were annuitized at a 7% interest rate and 4%

mortality rate, it would yield $16,137. Given that this applies to 68-73 year

olds who are more wealthy than older cohorts, the figures seem quite consistent.

Radner (1989) reports mean financial and housing wealth of 65-74 year-olds from

the SIPP to be $99,800, which is $69,700 in 1979 dollars. The comparable wealth

figure in the 1979 RES, when most heads of households were 68-73, is $71,100.

However, both the 81FF and the RHS wealth figures are substantially below the

 SCF (without supplement) wealth figures: for 65-74 year-olds they are $91,300

 in 1979 dollars.

 25. The market valuation for most elderly may be fairly accurate: many elderly

 purchase additional medical insurance beyond Medicare and Medicaid. This

 indicates that, from Medicare and Medicaid alone, they are not at a corner

 solution in their demand for medical coverage, and that, apart from wealth

 effects, market valuation is appropriate. This argument would not hold for the

 poor elderly many of whom do not purchase additional medical coverage (U.S.

 Senate Special Committee on Aging).

 26. These fractions are very close to the fraction of income from Medicare and

 Medicaid (10%) in Smeeding (1989).
