Natural-resource taxation and investment exhibit cycles in a vast number of countries, driving
political turmoil and power shifts. Using a rational-expectations model, we show cycles result
from governments' inability to commit to future taxes and firms' inability to credibly exit a
country indefinitely. A government sets a low initial tax inducing high investments, which in turn
prompts it to increase taxes next period. This induces low investment thus low future taxes, and
so on. We investigate which factors reinforce cycles and present ways of avoiding them, and
document cycles across many countries including detailed case studies of two Latin-American
countries.

1     Introduction
Taxation of natural resources is a dominant source of government revenue in many countries.
More than twenty resource-rich countries obtain three-quarters of their export revenues or
half of their government revenues from oil and gas related activities (Venables, 2016). The
quest for obtaining the associated profits is consequently often the single most important
public policy issue in these countries (Boadway and Keen, 2010; Hogan and Sturzenegger,
2010). These matters are often sufficiently salient to shift political sentiments in the popu-
lation, to drive political platforms, to determine election outcomes, and to even cause coups
or civil wars (Manzano and Monaldi, 2008; Venables, 2016).
    This paper aims to explain a prominent feature of resource markets: cyclicality in re-
source taxation. Why do finders get to keep more of their discoveries in some periods than
others? A stylized description of such cycles is that taxes start out low to induce high
investment. Then there is typically a shift in political power, either democratically or not,
to a party with a high-tax agenda. The government thus changes the current fiscal terms,
either through tax increases or through direct expropriation, which deters investment. Sub-
sequently there is another shift in political power or the incumbent party’s platform, now
to politicians setting low taxes, which increases investment, and so on. Thus, resource
taxation is a key driver of political turmoil, instability and shifts in power in resource-rich
countries. To explain this cyclical tax and investment behavior, we develop the first model
of time-consistent resource taxation under limited ability of governments to commit to re-
source tax rates and firms to commit to exiting. Thus, apart from our main contribution
of explaining the empirically prevalent taxation cycles, we also fill an important gap in the
resource-economics literature.
    A clear illustration of recurring resource-taxation cycles is given by the history of oil and
other hydrocarbons in Bolivia. Figure 1 (either panel) plots Bolivia’s effective net resource-
income tax rate over the past century. Periods of low tax rates that stimulate investment
and production are followed by extremely high taxes and expropriations, which subsequently
required the government to offer a favorable fiscal regime to lure back investors. Bolivia has
experienced three such cycles, with expropriations in 1937 (Standard Oil), 1969 (Gulf Oil)
and 2004-2009 (several foreign companies) and low tax rates in between. Section 2 describes
in more detail the history of taxation cycles in Bolivia as well as in Venezuela which
expropriated its foreign investors in 1975 and 2007. In both cases, these expropriations were
interspersed with long periods of relatively favorable fiscal terms. Bolivia and Venezuela
are no exceptions. According to Chua (1995), many Latin American countries have gone
through five or more privatization-nationalization cycles.
    Other examples abound. Israel offered a low tax rate of 28% to gas exploration firms
before the discovery of the large Leviathan gas field in 2010. In anticipation of surging
production levels, the Israeli government increased taxes to 42% in 2014 (The Jerusalem
Post, 2014). After investment dropped, the government recently promised more favorable
conditions (Sachs and Boersma, 2015; Times of Israel, 2015). Argentina’s oil sector has


                                                2
seen a number of oscillations between low-tax, high-investment periods and nationalizations
in the last century. In 2012, Argentina increased taxes and expropriated Repsol’s controlling
stake in state-owned company YPF following the discovery of the large Vaca Muerta shale
oil and gas field. Consequently, Repsol stopped investing in Argentinian oil in 2014 (Reuters,
2012, 2014). Very recently, a new government promised lower taxes leading international
companies to plan on increasing FDI (Forbes, 2015; OilPrice, 2016). There have been two
full cycles in Zambia’s copper industry. Low initial taxes and high investment were followed
by expropriations under socialist president Kenneth Kaunda in 1969. FDI plummeted and
stayed low until the late 1980s, when Zambia abandoned its socialist policies. President
Frederick Chiluba, elected in 1991, privatizated the copper sector which led to a new wave
of FDI and sharply increased production in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2007, the government
increased taxes (Chang, Hevia and Loayza, 2016). Peru has seen two cycles in oil and
mining during the 20th century (Chua, 1995). Algeria has had two cycles in oil and gas
since the 1980s (Oil and Gas Journal, 2000; The Economist, 2007; Reuters, 2013; Layachi,
2013). Chile has experienced two full cycles in copper since the 1960s (Kobrin, 1984;
UNCTAD, 2007). Ecuador has seen a full cycle in oil, and Mongolia in copper, since the
1990s (Manzano and Monaldi, 2008; The Mongolist, 2013; Ernst & Young, 2015). Cycles
have been documented for many other countries and sectors (e.g., tin, coffee, agriculture,
and land development, see Chua (1995); Manzano and Monaldi (2008); Hajzler (2012)).
    To explain such cycles we develop a rich yet tractable model with four key assumptions.
The first is that governments cannot commit to tax rates for more than a few years.1 This
realistic assumption can be motivated by political-economy considerations (Persson and
Tabellini, 1994) or by basic principles of law. As William Blackstone commented on English
law: “Statutes against the power of subsequent Parliaments are not binding” (Blackstone,
1765).2 The second assumption is that firms cannot commit to leaving a country for good
following a change in the agreed fiscal terms. This describes large oil majors such as Cono-
coPhillips and Exxon who, for instance, reinvested in Venezuela after their investments were
expropriated in the 1970s. It also describes situations where, if one firm leaves, another firm
takes its place as observed in, for instance, Bolivia in the 1950s. The third assumption is
that mines are long-lived, relative to the government’s period of commitment. It usually
takes several decades from the time a firm starts exploring for resources until it makes a
successful discovery, starts a full-scale mining operation, and finally exhausts the resource.
This has the implication that old mines, discovered earlier, exist in parallel with newer
mines. The fourth assumption is that governments cannot, or do not, differentiate tax rates
between different mine vintages that exist in parallel (or, at least, not perfectly). We relax
    1 If governments could fully commit to future tax rates, the problem has an elegant theoretical solution:

the first-best outcome would be achieved by auctioning off the exploration rights. This would induce firms
to pay the total expected profits and explore efficiently thereafter. Limited commitment is a likely reason
for the rare occurrence of pure auction systems for exploration and extraction rights.
    2 In the context of natural resources, this principle has been applied in a recent ruling by the Supreme

Court of Israel, denying the government the right to tie its own hands with respect to future tax changes
for gas companies. The motivation was that a commitment “that binds the government to [...] no changes
in legislation and opposing legislative initiatives for 10 years – cannot stand”(Reuters Africa, 2016).

Notes: Tax rate refers to the effective net resource-income tax rate per barrel of oil equivalent. Sources:
Jemio (2008) and WoodMackenzie (2012) for tax rates; Jemio (2008), Klein and Peres-Cajı́as (2014) and
International Energy Agency (2016) for production; BP (2015) for prices. Years in which assets are ex-
propriated are coded as a 100% tax rate (though effectively tax rates could be higher than 100% in those
years). Gaps in tax rates represent periods in which no foreign firms were producing. In some years, tax
rates are plotted as a range instead of a single value, as different rates applied to different projects. Low
end and high end ranges indicate the minimum and maximum tax rates (when available), which can differ
depending on project characteristics.

this assumption in a model extension.
    These assumptions imply that each government faces a trade-off: high taxes maximize
profits from old mines but harm new investments and hence profits from new mines. Since
mines are long-lived, firms naturally choose investment based both on current and expected
future taxes. As a result, a rational government that is unable to commit, when choosing
its current tax rate, has to consider the impact of today’s tax rate on all future taxes and
on all future investment decisions by the firms.
    The model predicts that, following an earlier large discovery, the government will set
a high tax to ensure getting a large share of the bonanza. This in turn will inhibit new
investments which lowers the future tax base. Hence, in the next period the government
refocuses to encouraging new investment and therefore lowers the tax. These high new
investments imply a large inelastic tax base in the period after and hence an increase in
the tax, and so on.3 The model thus predicts cycles in resource taxation and investment
in line with the observations described earlier. While not modeled explicitly, the shifts in
tax policy can be expected to take the form of either incumbent politicians changing their
policy or by new politicians taking over. That is, as observed, resource taxation is a driver
of political sentiments in society and our model can thus explain why resource-rich countries
often are politically unstable.4
    The model yields a number of additional predictions. A more backloaded mining profile
– i.e., a substantial share of the mining profits coming with a lag – means firms care a lot
about the tax tomorrow. Hence, mining investment is insensitive to today’s taxes, implying
they are set high. This of course happens in all periods, which implies a high tax level
and limited investment throughout. This scenario would apply to projects with large lead
times, such as drilling for oil and gas at deep offshore fields or in the Arctic. Conversely,
the model predicts that quickly depleted discoveries, such as shale oil, should incur a low
tax. The model also predicts that the cycles will be more pronounced in countries that are
new exporters of resources. This is because, initially, when current mining activity is low,
the government focuses on incentivizing investments by setting an extraordinarily low tax,
implying a large increase in new mines and hence a strong revision in taxation later on.
    We also offer predictions about the interaction of prices and investment in creating
cycles. It is well established, and of course very intuitive, that exogenous price shocks can
lead governments to change a tax (see, e.g., Guriev, Kolotilin and Sonin, 2011; Stroebel
and van Benthem, 2013; Chang et al., 2016). Our model accounts for such exogenous price
shocks too. But it is noteworthy that many of the observed cycles are not driven by prices.
Take the Bolivian example (Figure 1, panel b). The expropriations in 1937 and 1969 did
not coincide with high prices. Conversely, the price spikes in the 1970s and 1980s did not
    3 An inelastic tax base is consistent with recent evidence that oil production from existing wells is almost

completely unresponsive to oil price shocks and, thus, tax rates (Anderson, Kellogg and Salant, 2017).
    4 As we are agnostic as to the uses of government revenue, the model is consistent with tax collection for

corrupt purposes. Besides stealing “official” tax revenues, corrupt politicians may request bribes and other
illegal payments. Such side payments are unobserved, but likely to be very small compared to transfers
through official taxes or expropriations, and unlikely to interact with the official tax rates and the main
channel for cycling in our model (high production).



                                                       5
lead to expropriations. The resource nationalism in the early 2000s started during a period
of sharply increasing production before the oil price spike. Likewise the cycles in natural
gas taxation in Israel and copper-taxation in Chile were not at all driven by prices and
many parts of the mentioned cycles in Algeria, Peru and Argentina were not driven by
prices either. Instead, the level of production, installed capital and discoveries seem to
be the main drivers of these tax changes. This begs our paper’s question of whether the
inner workings of political and economic processes make cycles appear endogenously as an
economic and political equilibrium. We show that limited commitment and investment lags
provide such a channel. Exogenous price changes, however, have an interesting interaction
with the endogenous cycles in our model: a price shock is not what explains the tax cycles
per se, but by shocking the economy out of a steady state it initiates new endogenous and
persistent cycles in the same way that an unexpected discovery does.
   Finally, we show that the result that equilibria will exhibit tax oscillations is not in-
evitable. Equilibria without cyclicality can be sustained under certain conditions. This
could account for why, in practice, tax cycles are very prevalent but not ubiquitous across
countries. In one such ‘no-cycling’ equilibrium, the government endogenously commits to
setting a low and constant tax. This allows it to capture higher resource revenues than
in the cycling equilibrium. This is sustained by firm expectations that, if a high tax is
set once, a new cycling equilibrium is being played and by the fact that, once firms hold
such expectations, the government’s best response is to cycle taxes. Our results imply that
countries with more patient governments (for instance, due to low political turnover) are
better able to avoid cycles. Another equilibrium without cycles is characterized by full tax
differentiation between old and new mines. In that case, governments would always tax
existing production at 100% while taxing new mines at a low rate. Perhaps surprisingly,
this increases tax revenues. In reality, while certain governments have resorted to some
form of differentiated taxes, this seems to be an exception rather than the rule. Perfect tax
differentiation with persistent expropriation of old mines is highly unusual, potentially due
to reputational spillovers, a lack of continued capital investments in older facilities, the costs
of shifting ownership and operations of old mines to the state, and moral hazard. Thus tax
and investment cycles persist.
   Following a brief description of the paper’s relation to previous research, Section 2
presents rich descriptions of repeated cycles of taxes and investment in Bolivia and Venezuela.
In Section 3, we present the basic model along with comparative statics with respect to the
mining profile and the resource price. Here, we assume the government does not care about
future revenues. Section 4 extends the model to a case in which the government does care
about tax revenues in the more distant future, showing tax cycles appear here too. Section 5
studies how a government can endogenously commit to setting low constant taxes and avoid
cycling and in Section 6 we show how tax differentiation can avoid cycling and increase the
total tax revenues. Section 7 concludes.

1.1     Relation to previous research
The prime purpose of this paper is to present an endogenous mechanism to explain resource
taxation cycles and their interaction with investment cycles. We are by no means the first to
analyze resource taxation (Lund, 2009; Boadway and Keen, 2010) or the “natural resources
trap” (as Hogan and Sturzenegger (2010) dub the difficult dynamic hold-up problem associ-
ated with resource investment). However, we do develop the first model of time-consistent
resource taxation, under limited ability of governments to commit to resource tax rates and
firms to commit to exiting, which endogenously explains cycles and repeated exit and entry
in equilibrium.
    The papers most related to ours include a number of important contributions analyzing
dynamic commitment problems such as Thomas and Worrall (1994) and Bohn and Deacon
(2000). These and other papers yield important insights about resource contracts and taxa-
tion when governments cannot commit. We build on this literature by relaxing two unsatis-
factory features of existing models: exogenous expropriations (such as in Bohn and Deacon
(2000)) and the assumption that individual firms can effectively punish an expropriating
host government (e.g., by the threat of autarky such as in Thomas and Worrall (1994)).
The first feature is clearly important to relax when trying to explain why and when tax
changes occur. The second feature runs counter to the large number of observations (a few
of which we have already highlighted) in which either the same firm or a new firm enters the
country a few years after an expropriation has taken place. In relaxing these assumptions,
we take the standard approach in dynamic public finance and macroeconomics.5
    Many resource-taxation models study the effect of expropriation risk on private invest-
ment.6 For example, Bohn and Deacon (2000) and Wernerfelt and Zeckhauser (2010) analyze
how the risk of expropriation affects the speed of extraction and optimal contracts. However,
being mainly interested in the reaction of firms, the risk of expropriation in their models is
exogenous. Aghion and Quesada (2010), Engel and Fischer (2010) and Rigobon (2010) also
assume exogenous expropriations. None of these papers can explain tax cycles. In contrast,
our paper explicitly models the interaction between successive governments that, like firms,
hold rational expectations. We thus endogenize the tax (in the extreme case, expropriation)
and the reactions of future governments. We also extend earlier analyses to include different
   5 Our setup is similar to Klein, Krusell and Rios-Rull (2008) who describe the lack of commitment as

a “game between successive governments.” See also, for instance, Benhabib and Rustichini (1997) and
Ortigueira (2006) for similar setups. Since the seminal paper of Kydland and Prescott (1977), a large part
of the dynamic public finance literature has been analyzing various forms of commitment problems (e.g.,
Persson and Tabellini, 1994; Reis, 2013). The main approach in this literature is to focus on capital as a
generator of output. Since resource extraction creates few jobs and is, in many countries, performed by
non-domestically owned firms, we treat the resource sector primarily as a source of government income
implying a dynamic Laffer trade-off under limited commitment. Related to our focus on taxation cycles,
Hassler, Krusell, Storesletten and Zilibotti (2008) analyze circumstances under which oscillatory human-
capital taxes are optimal from a normative perspective. Our analysis is positive and the tax cycles in our
setting are not optimal. Aguiar, Amador and Gopinath (2009) extend the model of Thomas and Worrall
(1994) to include sovereign debt, and find that the threat of expropriation (of both debt and FDI) can
induce investment cycles when the government is less patient than consumers.
   6 Other papers focus on the question of how to make resource taxes neutral (e.g., Campbell and Lindner,

1985; Fane, 1987), which is less related to our work. Yet other papers study optimal contracts (e.g.,
Baldursson and Von der Fehr, 2015) and optimal taxation (e.g., Daubanes and Lasserre, 2015).

mining profiles and price changes, factors obviously important for resource markets.
    Endogenous expropriation has been considered in the seminal paper on foreign direct
investment by Thomas and Worrall (1994), in which a government is unable to commit
even in the short run. They show how the fear of being condemned to autarky can help a
government suppress its urge to expropriate. However, as positive shocks make expropriation
ever more lucrative, the firm is forced to ratchet up investment; taxation only kicks in (at a
constant rate) once the maximal level of investment is reached. In other words, their model
neither exhibits cycles, nor repeated exit and entry, in equilibrium. Instead, investment
and taxes increase over time. A similar issue arises in Stroebel and van Benthem (2013),
in which expropriations occur with positive probability, after which the country remains in
autarky forever, so that expropriation happens only once. We want to explain the empirically
relevant features of repeated cycles of resource investment and taxation, and repeated exit
and entry by firms. To do this, we differ from the previous literature by assuming the
government can commit in the short term, and that resource firms are unable to credibly
exit the market for good. This is a better description of the investment conditions and firm
behavior in many politically unstable, resource-holding countries.


2     Episodes of repeated tax and investment cycles
We now describe in more detail Bolivia’s and Venezuela’s history of long-run cycles in tax-
ation and investment. These countries’ dealings with foreign oil and gas companies provide
instructive case studies and motivation for our model. As emphasized in the introduction,
many other countries and natural resources have gone through similar cycles.


2.1    Bolivia
Low taxes spur initial investments: Bolivia opened up its hydrocarbons sector to
foreign investors in 1916 and the first foreign oil company (Standard Oil; a predecessor of
ExxonMobil) entered in 1921. In that year, the Organic Law on Petroleum set the fiscal
terms for the decades to come, mainly consisting of an 11% royalty plus an obligation to
return 20 percent of the licensed area back to the state once production began (Jemio, 2008).
    Expropriation and low subsequent investment: The relationship between the gov-
ernment and Standard Oil turned sour around the 1932-1935 Chaco War, in which the oil-
rich Gran Chaco region was claimed by both Bolivia and Paraguay. Standard Oil started
shutting down equipment and moving it out of the country and was generally seen by the
public as betraying the Bolivian government. After the war ended, the David Toro govern-
ment created state-owned company Yacimientos Petrolı́feros Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) in
late 1936 and expropriated Standard Oil’s assets in 1937 (Klein and Peres-Cajı́as, 2014).
This marked the beginning of almost two decades without foreign oil investment; the legis-
lation provided that YPFB could be associated with foreign business, but either for fear of
expropriation or lack of interest, no foreign company invested.


                                              8
    Low taxes, high investment: Production by YPFB grew in the 1940s and early
1950s, but Bolivia concluded that it could not provide the capital investment needed for a
significant expansion of the oil industry. The government therefore offered a favorable fiscal
regime to foreign investors (the “New Petroleum Code” of 1955). Standard Oil did not
return, but Gulf Oil seized the opportunity. As a result, production grew fast, especially in
the mid and late 1960s. Revenues also grew fast despite falling oil prices.
    Resource nationalism, expropriation and low subsequent investment: This
sparked another episode of resource nationalism. Supported by popular resentment against
Gulf Oil’s increasing profits, the military government of general Alfredo Ovando Candı́a
expropriated the company in 1969 and transferred its properties to YPFB (Peres-Cajı́as,
2015). Oil production fell drastically right after the expropriation of Gulf Oil. Following
these dramatic events, Bolivia realized the need for stable investment conditions to boost
production, especially since natural gas production and exports to Argentina were about to
take off. However, tax rates under Decree Law No. 10170 remained fairly high throughout
the 1970s and 1980s. The new fiscal regime had only limited success in bringing back foreign
investment in the 1970s and 1980s (Figure 2, Panel a). Bolivia did resist the temptation to
expropriate when oil prices soared in the mid and late 1970s.
    Low taxes, high investment: In 1990, the government reduced the tax rates for
certain fields in a further effort to attract private investment. When oil and gas production
stagnated and even started to decline in the mid 1990s, the Hydrocarbon Tax Law of 1996
substantially reduced the fiscal take for new fields. In 1996-1997, president Gonzalo Sánchez
de Losada even privatized YPFB. All this led to a wave of foreign investment in the natural-
gas sector, as clearly illustrated in Figure 2. International oil and gas companies such as
BG Group, BP, Petrobras, Repsol and Total entered the country (Valera, 2007).
    Resource nationalism, tax increases and low subsequent investment: Resource
nationalism started yet again by the early 2000s. Even before oil and gas prices were on
the rise in the mid 2000s, there was growing public discontent about the profits made by
foreign resource firms as their production had increased rapidly. As Manzano and Monaldi
(2008) put it, private investors in Bolivia and other Latin American oil producing countries
were “partially the victims of their own success”. Fifteen years of large private investments
had resulted in new resource discoveries which, from the year 2000 onwards, translated to
strong growth in production. This created strong incentives to increase government take.
President Sánchez de Losada had to resign during the Bolivian gas conflict in 2003, in which
the protesters demanded full nationalization of the hydrocarbons sector.
    His successor, president Carlos Mesa, held a national referendum – which passed in
2004 – to repeal the existing hydrocarbon law and to increase tax rates on oil and gas
companies.7 In 2005, the referendum was signed into law as the new Hydrocarbon Law No.
   7 In this case, the changes in the tax rates were forced on the government by political unrest and public

pressure. In other cases, a government or president can independently initiate fiscal changes, either upon
(re-)election or in the middle of an existing term. These various channels are consistent with our model,
which does not need to specify explicitly the exact conditions under which a government can change the
rules of the game.



                                                     9
3058 which revoked the tax breaks from 1996. The 2005 law also established state ownership
of oil and gas at the wellhead and made it mandatory for operators with existing contracts
to transfer to the new terms (WoodMackenzie, 2012). This ended the significant wave of
foreign investment.
    The more punitive taxation system still did not satisfy many people who believed that
full nationalization was preferable. Following protests in La Paz in May 2005, president Mesa
was forced to resign. The sharply increasing gas production had created strong incentives for
newly elected president Evo Morales to increase taxes further even at constant oil and gas
prices, but the resource price increases of the mid 2000s gave him the perfect opportunity
to increase taxes to very high levels in response to popular demand. In 2006, tax rates
for some fields increased to as much as 82%. Foreign investment in oil and gas plummeted
between 2002 and 2006 (Figure 2). Morales then nationalized certain foreign assets in 2007
as per his election pledge.
   Lowering of taxes to spur investment: As Morales realized that Bolivia needed
three billion dollars in investment to meet its gas-export obligations to Argentina and Brazil,
the government quickly softened investment conditions after the nationalizations. In 2010,
fiscal terms mostly reverted to those in the 2005 Hydrocarbon Law. The government started
offering tax breaks as it feared that hydrocarbon production would stall. By June 2011,
fifteen foreign companies had signed contracts for oil and gas exploration, adding up to
substantial foreign investment (Figure 2); not a single company pulled out of Bolivia this
time (Chávez, 2012).
   The Bolivian history illustrates a sequence of long-run cycles in taxation and investment,
with expropriations in 1937, 1969 and 2004-2009, and low tax rates in between, in line with
our model predictions. It also illustrates how production and investment levels are an
important driver of cycles, in addition to resource prices.


2.2    Venezuela
Low taxes and a stable tax regime spur initial investment: Oil was first discovered
in Venezuela in 1878, but the first well was not drilled until 1912. Royal Dutch Shell and
Standard Oil soon became major oil producers as Venezuela became the second-largest oil
producing country in the world. Oil made up more than 90 percent of exports by 1935
(Venezuela Analysis, 2003). The First Petroleum Law went into effect in 1922. When
production grew between 1922 and 1943, the government realized the need for a stable long-
term investment climate. In 1943, Venezuela passed the Hydrocarbons Law, which aimed to
ensure that foreign companies could not make greater profits from oil than they paid to the
Venezuelan state, yet also allowed the world’s largest oil companies access to Venezuela’s
vast reserves at reasonable tax rates for the decades to come. This created stable investment
conditions that firmly established the industry and allowed the oil sector to expand rapidly.
Between 1944 and 1958, production more than tripled and the annual average growth rate
of the net capital stock of the oil industry was 14.3% (Monaldi, 2001) (Figure 3, panel a).

Notes: Sources: UNCTAD for oil and gas FDI in Bolivia and Venezuela (1994-2012). Monaldi (2001) for
oil and gas investmet in Venezuela (1950-1997). Monaldi (2001)’s data includes PDVSA investment from
1976 onwards; not just FDI. To compare the two data sources for Venezuela, UNCTAD data in current
USD is converted to 1998 Bolivars using exchange rate and GDP deflator data from the World Bank. For
consistency reasons, UNCTAD data for Bolivia are also converted to real local currency. See Appendix A
for details.

Notes: Tax rate refers to the effective net resource-income tax rate per barrel of oil equivalent. Sources:
Monaldi (2001), Manzano and Monaldi (2008) and WoodMackenzie (2012) for tax rates; Monaldi (2001)
and International Energy Agency (2016) for production; BP (2015) for prices. Years in which assets are
expropriated are coded as a 100% tax rate (though effectively tax rates could be higher than 100% in those
years). Gaps in tax rates represent periods in which no foreign firms were producing. Low end and high
end ranges indicate the minimum and maximum tax rates (when available), which can differ depending on
project characteristics.

    Resource nationalism, tax increases and subsequent low investment: This
spectacular growth in oil production tempted the government to capture a larger share of
the profits. Taxes increased dramatically in the period 1959-1972.8 Figure 2 (Panel b)
shows that, as a result of the increased taxes, oil investment started to decline in the late
1950s and stayed low until 1976, but oil production continued to rise until the early 1970s.
It then fell abruptly, though with a significant lag to the reduced investment levels.9
    In 1973, the oil embargo in the Middle East led to a dramatic increase in oil prices. In
1974, the newly elected president, Carlos Andrés Perez, used this to promise the population
that Venezuela would become a first-world country in just a couple of years. He started
nationalizing the oil industry, a process that finished with the creation of Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA) in 1976 (Venezuela Analysis, 2003). In the process, Venezuela paid
Conoco, Exxon, Gulf Oil, Mobil and Shell only 20 percent of the market value of their
assets (Wirth, 2001), that is, a form of expropriation. Conoco left the country, but other
firms stayed and signed contracts for training local staff and technological support.
    Tax breaks to spur foreign investment: After the expropriation, PDVSA controlled
all oil production. PDVSA increased investments dramatically (Figure 2), taking advantage
of the prevailing high oil prices. Despite the fast growth, the government realized in the
1980s that foreign investment and expertise was needed to develop the massive heavy oil
resources in the Orinoco Belt. Against that background, Venezuela opened up the oil sector
to foreign investment again in 1990. Foreign investors were offered tax rates well below the
rates of around 80% that PDVSA had been paying during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
By 1996, four joint ventures had entered Venezuela and Conoco came back after leaving the
country following the expropriations of 1976.10 By the mid 1990s, private investment had
increased substantially (Figure 2) and Venezuela was top on the list for foreign investment
in petroleum exploration and production (Manzano and Monaldi, 2008; Hajzler, 2012).
    Resource nationalism, nationalization and production decreases: In the early
2000s, resource nationalism was on the rise again. When Hugo Chávez first came to power
in 1998, he did not announce any plans for PDVSA. But in 2001, Chávez introduced a new
Hydrocarbons Law that increased royalties and forced private investors to sign agreements in
which they could only operate in joint ventures with at least 51% PDVSA ownership. Also,
when his initial popular support had faded by 2002, Chávez responded to public protests by
announcing a re-nationalization of the oil industry. He took control over PDVSA, which was
to be managed “by the people and for the people” (Energy Tribune, 2007). In the resulting
   8 In 1959, the government share rose from 51% to 65%; a radical break with the 50-50 rule from the 1943

Hydrocarbons Law. In the late 1960s, oil taxes increased further to levels around 71% in 1969. Yet another
law increased tax rates to over 78% in 1970. By 1972, tax rates had creeped up to levels around as high
as 90%. Up to that point, oil prices had been low and decreasing from $16 per barrel in 1943 to $14 per
barrel in 1972. In an attempt to raise global oil prices, Venezuela was instrumental in the formation of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1960.
   9 This is again consistent with Anderson et al. (2017) who find that investment, not production, is the

main margin of adjustment to changing oil prices or tax rates.
  10 Miguel Espinosa from Conoco’s treasury department explained the decision to come back as follows:

“In spite of our previous experience, we were eager to participate in the Venezuelan oil sector once again.
We had long-standing commercial relationships with PDVSA – buying their crude to supply our refineries
– and strong personal relationships. When the door opened, we took the opportunity” (Esty, 2002).


                                                    13
chaos, oil production fell and Venezuela had to renege on oil deliveries.
    While this resource nationalism started in a period of high production and sunk in-
vestment (and low oil prices), the sharp increase in oil prices in the mid 2000s added to
the government’s desire to impose higher taxes and more restrictions on foreign investors.
By 2007 the government had nationalized the oil industry, taking a majority control of all
privately operated projects without providing market compensation. ConocoPhillips and
ExxonMobil subsequently decided to abandon their assets in the Orinoco Belt and exit the
country. BP, Chevron, Statoil and Total accepted that PDVSA increased its share from
40% to 78% (Guriev et al., 2011; Hajzler, 2012). Tax rates have remained high since then.
In 2008, Venezuela imposed a first windfall tax on incremental revenues for oil prices ex-
ceeding $70 per barrel. In 2011, the government introduced a second windfall tax for oil
prices between $40 and $70 per barrel (WoodMackenzie, 2012). Investment has been low
ever since the resource nationalism started in 2002 (Figure 2).
    Altogether, the history of Venezuela presents another clear example of long-run cycles
of taxation and investment, with expropriations in 1975 and 2007 following long periods of
more favorable fiscal regimes. Foreign investment dissipates and foreign investors leave the
country when taxes are high but come back later when tax rates are low again.


3     Model of resource taxation with limited commitment
In this section we outline a tractable model of resource taxation and exploration and solve for
the equilibrium policies. The overall purpose of our setup is to capture important features
of resource markets through four main assumptions. First, governments can only commit to
tax rates for a limited period of time. Second, firms cannot commit to permanently exiting
a country following changes in the agreed fiscal terms. Third, mines have long lifetimes that
extend beyond the government’s commitment period such that old mines, discovered earlier,
and new mines exist in parallel. Further, mine development takes time, so that there is a
delay between the investment decision and the first revenues. Fourth, we initially assume
that taxes do not differentiate between old and new mines, but we relax this assumption
later.


3.1    Model setup and Markov-perfect equilibrium
There are two types of agents in the economy: a government wanting to maximize tax
revenue, and a unit mass of infinitesimal resource-prospecting firms. The government sets
a uniform tax rate for a given period. The firms choose how much to explore.
    The time intervals, which we call periods, are indexed by t ∈ N+ . The sequence of
decisions is depicted in Figure 4. The government observes the existing stock of mines and
then announces a tax rate, to which it commits for only period t, with the objective of
maximizing its resource revenues. After the interval has elapsed, the government can freely
change the tax. This lack of long-term commitment implies there is in essence a sequence

                2. New firms choose exploration et



of governments, each facing a different optimization problem. After the announcement of
the tax rate, firms conduct exploration, and any mines open with a lag. This means that
within each period t there are two subperiods s ∈ {1, 2}. In the first subperiod only the old
mines are being extracted from and in the second subperiod extraction is taking place both
from the old and the new mines. Note that the government commits to the same tax for
the whole period t, that is, for both subperiods. Finally, when the current period t ends,
the old mines close down while the new stay open for the entire next period t + 1 (i.e., the
new mines in period t become the old mines in t + 1).
   There is an infinite quantity of land available. A small plot of land can be explored for
natural resources by using appropriate factors (e.g., petroleum geologists and drilling rigs,
or dynamite and diggers). For tractability we assume firms face quadratic (i.e., convex)
internal costs of exploration.11
   Aggregate exploration effort (i.e., investment) in period t is denoted by et . Since the
model is deterministic, et is equivalent to discoveries. Exploration takes place in the first
subperiod and every unit of exploration yields a known quantity of resources, normalize to
unity. The initial stock is denoted e0 .
   Any discoveries made in period t can be exploited in periods t and t + 1, after which the
mine in question closes down. Denote the exogenous (world market) resource price in period
t, subperiod s by pt,s . For now, we assume the price is constant: pt,s = p > 0 (we consider
price shocks in Section 3.3). Assume that the exploration costs are inclusive of the costs of
  11 Alternatively, the model could be written in terms of firm entry and external diseconomies of scale,

without changing any of the results.

developing the deposit, and that extraction itself is costless. Firms extract during the two
periods. In the first period a share δ ∈ [0, 1] of the mine’s content is extracted and in the
second period 1 − δ is extracted. This way, a small δ captures a backloaded mining profile,
so that a large share of the extraction from a new mine takes place beyond the commitment
period of the current government.
   We now construct a Markov-perfect equilibrium: a tax policy rule and an exploration
rule which both depend only on the current ‘state’ of the economy. For the government’s
problem at time t, the state variable is the pre-existing stock of mines et−1 . For the firm’s
problem, due to the sequential move order, the state variable includes both this stock and
the tax for the current period τt ; however, it will become clear that the former is redundant.
Thus, the Markov strategies are described by the rules τt∗ (et−1 ), e∗t (τt ).

Exploration effort is zero when 1 − τt = β(1 − τt+1 ) = 0, i.e., only if there would be full
expropriation (100% taxes) both this period and the next. This means that, since firms are
forward-looking, they will choose to explore today despite a very high current tax if they
foresee a low tax tomorrow.
   We assume the government is unconcerned with the revenues obtained in future periods
and only wants to maximize the revenues obtained today (we relax this in Section 4). The
government recognizes the firms’ reaction function and solves

For now, we restrict ourselves to Markovian strategies for the government, that is, tax
policies which are a function of past exploration only. With rational expectations, this
         e      ∗
implies τt+1 = τt+1 (et ), so that given any τt , (2) defines a fixed-point problem. As long as
this has a unique solution, we can write it as e∗t+1 (τt ). We will limit ourselves to stationary
Markov strategies in this section and drop the time subscripts on the tax policy rule.

In words, the government trades off the extra revenue, given the existing tax base, against the
new tax base that shrinks with higher taxes. The existing tax base – the pre-existing mines
– are fully inelastic. Since each firm reacts to taxes over multiple periods, the government
needs to consider how its tax affects investment and hence taxes tomorrow, which again
feeds back on today’s investment. Thus, a succession of short-termist governments are
linked by long-lived firms. With no pre-existing mines (et−1 = 0), the government would
simply choose to sit at the top of its one-period Laffer curve (where it still needs to take into
account how the current tax affects firms’ expectations of future taxes). With a positive
pre-existing stock of developed mines, the government prefers to set a higher tax rate.
   We will look for equilibria in piecewise linear strategies, using the guess and verify
method. To avoid technical issues, in the main text we impose a parameter restriction:
                                                                     √

We can relax this restriction to construct piecewise linear equilibria for smaller δ also. These
yield no additional intuition, compared to the equilibrium given in the following proposition;
to avoid unnecessary technical complications, we relegate them to Appendix C (Proposition
C.1).

    Note that the tax transition rule has a slope of − 12 1−δ
                                                           δ < 0. In other words, low taxes
today, by inducing higher exploration, lead to high taxes in the next period.12 Further, the
transition is also stable: taxes will converge to the steady state.13
    We summarize the dynamic properties of the benchmark case here:

Proposition 1. With a constant resource price p, the taxes will cycle around the steady
state τSS .

Proof. In the preceding text.

We will now discuss some implications of the proposition.

Corollary 1. i) Within a time period there is a positive relationship between the tax rate
and the value of the current mines. ii) Within a time period there is a negative relationship
between the tax rate and mining investments (i.e., exploration and development of mines).

    To illustrate the implications of this corollary consider a country which has just recently
discovered that it has some resources but where these have not been explored yet. That
is, the initial stock of mines is zero (e0 = 0). For this country τ0∗ = τ which is the lowest
possible tax in any period. This means that countries with a newly discovered resource
potential will offer a low tax to initiate exploration.
    The proposition further implies:

Corollary 2. i) The tax in period t is negatively related to the tax in period t + 1. ii) The
number of existing mines in period t is negatively related to the number of existing mines in
period t + 1.

    Prediction (i) in Corollary 2 implies that the country with zero initial mines will also
be the one that raises taxes the most once discoveries have been made. So the cycles will
be particularly strong in less mature resource-producing countries. Prediction (ii) of course
implies that investments cycle along with the taxes.
    To illustrate the main mechanism of the model consider the case of a flat extraction
profile δ = 12 . Then the government will set a tax
                                     (
                                                           1+β
                                            2
                                         p(2−β) et−1   +            if et−1 < p 12 2−β
                                                                                   2+β ,

    This represents the government’s Laffer-type trade-off between getting a large share of
the revenues and incentivizing the development of a large tax base. The tax differs from a
                                                                   2
static Laffer tax in two ways. First, the term                  p(2−β) et−1   implies that the government will
  12 Clearly tax rates are never at 100% for two subsequent periods, so that exploration will always take

place. Indeed, 100% taxes can only occur if the initial stock is very high, after which the taxes will oscillate,
gradually converging to the steady state. Thus full expropriation can occur in the initial period, if the
economy starts with a very large existing stock of active mines; following this, taxes will always be strictly
interior.
  13 Stability results from the tax-transition slope being lower than 1 in absolute value, which holds as long

as δ > 13 . This is ensured by restriction (5). The case of an unstable tax transition would lead to an eventual
cycle of repeated full expropriations, but this would make the equilibrium non-linear.

set a higher tax since part of the tax base consists of pre-existing, inelastic capital that is
unaffected by the current tax. If no old mines exist, this term disappears. To highlight the
second difference, suppose that indeed et−1 = 0. In a static model, but otherwise similar
linear-quadratic specification, the Laffer tax would be τt∗ = 12 . In our dynamic model,
       1+β
τt∗ = 2+β  ≥ 12 . That is, the tax is higher than the static Laffer tax even if there is no
inelastic capital. The reason for this is that patient firms care about future revenues, which
mitigates the negative effect of today’s tax rate on investment. First, the firm still expects
to obtain some future revenues; second, a higher tax today leads to lower exploration, which
means taxes in the next period will be lower. Note that with perfectly impatient firms
(β → 0) and no pre-existing revenues (et−1 = 0), the tax goes to τt∗ → 21 . For the same
reasons, the steady-state tax τss = 32 2+2β   2 8

3.2      Mining profile
We now consider how the mining profile, represented by δ, affects the above results. Recall
that a low δ implies resource revenues are more backloaded, with fraction 1 − δ of the
revenues arriving beyond the government’s commitment period.
   Note that the steady-state tax τss given in (9) is below unity and decreases in δ. The tax
transition rule (8) becomes steeper with low δ, which implies that oscillations decay more
slowly for backloaded mining profiles. Furthermore, as A and B are both decreasing in δ
we get the following results:

Corollary 3. i) For a given stock of existing mines, the more backloaded the mining profile
is, the higher is the tax. ii) Given the stock of existing mines, the more backloaded the
mining profile is, the lower is the exploration effort. iii) The more backloaded the mining
profile is, the more slowly deviations from a steady-state tax decay:14
                                                     ∗
                                                  |τt+1  −τss |
                                              ∂     |τt −τss |
                                                                  < 0.
                                                     ∂δ

   These predictions are intuitive. Consider part (i). When the mining profile is relatively
backloaded, then the firm, when deciding on its exploration investment, cares more about
future taxes as the mine will now produce much of its value in the next period. The
government today knows this and therefore has an incentive to set a high tax to ensure
getting a large share of the profits from the old mines. This of course happens in all periods
implying that, in general, the tax rate will be high. When the mining profile is sufficiently
backloaded, the tax regime becomes so directed at getting at the current mines’ profits
that this completely strangles the industry. As an illustration, consider the polar case of a
completely backloaded mining profile (δ → 0). Then the government, knowing that whatever
it does will not have an effect on the current-period production from the new mines, only
cares about taxing the old mines and sets the tax at an appropriation level τt∗ = 1. This
 14 A                                                                                   1 1−δ
        bit of algebra shows that the decay rate in the inequality is given by |AC| =   2 δ
                                                                                              .

of course means there will not be any exploration at all since the firms foresee this in all
periods.
   The opposite case is one where the mining profile is sufficiently frontloaded so that all
the mining occurs in the current period (δ → 1). In this case the firm is fully responsive
to any tax change and there is no linkage between the taxation of subsequent governments.
In this case the model converges to the results of a static model, i.e., the Laffer tax of
τt∗ = 12 . Thus, the high taxes we obtain in the model hinge on 1) mines existing beyond the
commitment period of the government and on 2) firms that care about later profits.
   The intuition for part (ii) of the corollary is similar. Given the existing stock of mines,
more backloaded revenues will reduce the total value of any new discoveries (because of
discounting) while increasing the government’s taxes today. As a result, exploration falls
with backloadedness.
   For part (iii) of the corollary, note that the rate at which oscillations decay is simply the
absolute value of the slope of the tax transition (8), which itself depends on how sensitively
governments respond to pre-existing mines and firms respond to taxes. An impatient gov-
ernment overseeing a very backloaded resource cares much more about taxing the existing
tax base than about encouraging new exploration, and thus responds more sensitively to
the stock of pre-existing mines. Equilibrium exploration becomes less responsive to current
taxes, as future revenues weigh more and as future taxes are expected to respond more.
The government’s increased sensitivity dominates, so that equilibrium taxes become more
variable.
   There are two ways to interpret the results on the mining profile δ. The first is that
they pertain to geological constraints. Capital-intensive and technologically challenging
projects, such as offshore drilling, Arctic drilling and ultra-deep drilling, have long lead
times between exploration and the start of commercial production. Corollary 3 implies
that countries in which these projects represent a large share of hydrocarbon extraction
set higher tax rates (and see lower exploration) than countries with frontloaded extraction
profiles (e.g., conventional oil).
   The second interpretation is that δ represents the government’s commitment period. If
a government is able to commit for many years, then the “current period” applies to a large
share of the profits: δ is large. Corollary 3 then says that countries with stable governments,
that is, ones which can be trusted not to change the tax very often, will have lower taxes
and more exploration activity. A long commitment period may of course be the result of a
stable autocratic regime or characterize a democratic country with low turnover or cohesive
political views.15
  15 Strictly speaking, a longer commitment period also decreases β since it postpones the firms’ second-
                                 dτss
period profits. The derivative dβ>0   . Hence a long commitment period has two effects, both of which are
lowering τss : one through decreasing β and one through increasing δ.

3.3      Price changes
We now turn to the effect of price changes on the tax policy. To highlight the mechanism,
Lemma 2 considers an unexpected price change. Suppose the price in all periods is p, but
in the first subperiod of period t there is a price shock, so that pt,1 6= p.
                         pt,1 +p
Lemma 2. Let p̃ ≡           2      denote the average price in period t. Then, the policy rules are
                                                                                                      p̃t
given by (6), but with the coefficients indexed by time; for i ∈ 0, 1, 2, . . ., we have At =          p A,
At+1+i = A, Bt+i = B, Ct+i = C, Dt+i = D.

Proof. By applying Lemma 1, rolled forward by one period, it is clear that from period t + 1
onwards the coefficients are given by (7). The firm’s and government’s problems in period
t are then solved by backward induction, exactly as in the proof of Lemma 1.

The above lemma and Proposition 1 yield the following prediction:

Corollary 4. i) An unexpected increase in the spot price pt,1 raises the current tax. ii)
Suppose the economy is in steady state, then one price shock will initiate persistent oscilla-
tions.

    Part (i) is seen from the fact that an increase in pt,1 raises the average price in period t,
p̃t , thus raising At . The predictions are intuitive. An unexpected, temporary, positive price
shock in the first subperiod increases the value of existing (old) mines vis-á-vis new mines
(which appear only in subperiod 2). Hence, the government becomes more concerned about
extracting tax revenues from the existing stock of mines.16
    Part (ii) of the corollary says that, starting from a steady state, a price shock will kick-
start cycling. This is illustrated in Figure 5. In periods 1 through 4 the economy is in steady
state with a constant price. An exogenous and unexpected price shock happens in period
5, subperiod 1 (p5,1 increases). Then the price goes back to the pre-shock level in period
5, subperiod 2 (p5,2 ) and stays there in period 6 and onwards. As can be seen, this raises
τ5 since the government is more directed at appropriating the old mines that have become
more valuable, in line with part (i) of the corollary. This dampens exploration investment
(there is an immediate dip in exploration in period 5) leading to below steady state old
mines in period 6. This, in turn, leads to low taxes and high investment in period 6, and
so on. In the particular example in the figure the price shock is such that the government
actually expropriates the old mines in period 5.
    The key message is that exogenous price shocks interact with the endogenous cycles in
an interesting way: price shocks do not explain the tax cycles per se, but by moving the
economy away from the steady state, they initiate new endogenous cycles which persist
even if no further shocks occur. The same dynamics of course hold for any shock, be it an
  16 This has been tested by Guriev et al. (2011) and Stroebel and van Benthem (2013), who use a panel

data set on expropriation events to provide empirical evidence that a higher oil price is associated with an
increased probability of expropriation.

unexpectedly large discovery or a new technology that changes the extraction profile.17 It
also holds if the price shock is permanent.
    A final note on price shocks is that we have illustrated them here, for clarity, with a
shock that is unexpected. We have also analyzed a case where a price change is expected to
come with a certain probability. The qualitative messages of the previous corollary remain
under such an extension – price shocks kick-start cycles.


4     Patient government
In the previous sections, we have assumed that the government is perfectly impatient: it
does not care for future tax revenues at all. We will now show that the main results do not
depend on this assumption.
  17 For example, consider the case that a surprisingly large discovery is made or that exploration does

not bear the expected fruits. Since our model is deterministic, discoveries are directly determined by the
exploration effort of the firms, and the tax and effort oscillate over time until a steady state is reached where
the tax and effort are constant. Starting from this steady state, an exogenous and unexpected shock to
discoveries will lead to high taxes and therefore low exploration effort next period, thereby starting another
cycle (in which both discoveries and taxes are determined endogenously in all periods following the shock).




                                                       22
    Suppose the government discounts future tax revenues with per-period discount factor
β. Then, the government’s value function, given an existing stock of reserves et−1 , is


                  V (et−1 ) = max τt ((1 − δ)p̃t et−1 + δpt,2 e∗t (τt )) + βV (e∗t (τt )).               (10)
                                 τt

Note that, in contrast with (3), the government now also cares about all future tax revenues.
We can solve the model as before; details are in Appendix D. To reduce the burden of
                                                            √

notation, we normalize p = 1 and restrict δ >                √
                                                           1+ 1+β
                                                                  .
    We guess and verify that, in the Markov-perfect equilibrium, the tax policy function and
the equilibrium exploration are still linear, i.e., given by (6), and stationary (so that the
coefficients A, B, C and D are constants). Hence, the structure of these functions is exactly
as before.

Proposition 2. i) Tax cycles exist for all β ∈ (0, 1). ii) Relative deviations from steady-
state taxes decay more slowly, the higher is the discount factor:

Proof. In Appendix D.

    Most importantly, this proposition says that tax cycles will exist also if the government
is patient. In fact, as part (ii) says, more patient countries should see more persistent
tax cycles. Cycles are persistent when the government responds strongly to changes in
existing production, and firms respond strongly to tax rates. Increasing patience has two,
countervailing effects: it tends to make governments more responsive to changes in existing
mines, and firms less responsive to current tax rates. The former prevails, with the net
effect being stronger cycling when firms and the government discount the future less.18


5     Endogenous commitment
Is the result that equilibria will exhibit tax oscillations inevitable? In practice, tax cycles are
very prevalent but not ubiquitous across all countries and sectors. We now demonstrate,
using our model, mechanisms that would enable countries to escape the cyclicality and
capture higher resource profits. First, in this section, we show that there exist equilibria in
which the government endogenously commits to setting a low and constant tax. Second, we
show in the next section that full tax differentiation between old and new mines can also
lead to an equilibrium without cycling.
    To show the constant-tax equilibrium with endogenous commitment, consider the prob-
lem of the patient government as outlined in the previous section. In the equilibria described
  18 We discuss the intuition further in Appendix D. We have also analyzed a case where the government’s

and firms’ discount factors differ and the results remain the same. Claim (ii) of Proposition 2 holds when the
derivative is taken with respect to the government’s discount rate (keeping the firm’s discount rate fixed).




                                                         23
there (see Proposition 2 and its proof in Appendix D) the government’s tax both oscillates
                                                                                          1
and is set suboptimally high – it is above the Laffer rate of τ =                         2   which maximizes the
static revenue from new mines. These problems emanate from the government not being
able to formally commit to a tax.
   To show how the cycles can be avoided, we look at a different class of equilibria. A
government may be able to sustain a constant low tax rate by a reputation mechanism. As
we are dealing with a continuum of firms all behaving competitively (i.e., not taking into
account how their individual actions affect future actions by others), the notion of subgame
perfection is technically problematic. We thus use the analogous notion of ‘sustainable
equilibrium’ of Chari and Kehoe (1993), developed for contexts such as ours:19

Definition 1. Denote the time-t government history by ht ≡ (e0 , τ1 , e1 , . . . , τt−1 , et−1 ),
and time-t firm history by (ht , τt ). A ‘sustainable equilibrium’ is a tax policy rule τ S (ht )
and an exploration rule eS (ht , τt ) such that: i) given the tax policy rule τ S , for all firm
histories (ht , τt ) the exploration rule eS is optimal for the representative firm; ii) given the
exploration rule eS , for all government histories ht the tax policy rule τ S is optimal for the
period-t government.

   This definition is essentially analogous to subgame perfection in extended-form games,
but it is adapted so as to avoid technical issues related to the competitive and infinitesimal
nature of the exploration firms. Note that the Markov-perfect equilibrium we constructed
in Section 3 is also a sustainable equilibrium. We again normalize p = 1. We also restrict
      √
        2
δ>     √
     1+ 2
          ,   purely to avoid technicalities in formulating the results.

Proposition 3. Consider the following strategy for the government:
                                                                                   1+β
   • Set τ1 = 12 . In period t > 1, set τt =          1
                                                      2   if τi =   1
                                                                    2   and ei =    4    for all i ∈ {1, . . . , t − 1};
      otherwise, set τt according to the Markov strategies underlying Proposition 2;

and the following exploration rule for the firms:
                      1+β             1                                            1+β
   • Choose et =       4    if τi =   2   for all i ∈ {1, . . . , t} and ej =       4    for all j ∈ {1, . . . , t − 1};
      otherwise, choose et according to the Markov strategies underlying Proposition 2.

Then:

  (i) For any e0 , there exists a βC ∈ (0, 1) such that this strategy and exploration rule form
      a sustainable equilibrium if and only if β ≥ βC .

 (ii) For any β ∈ (0, 1), there exists an eC such that these strategies are not a sustainable
      equilibrium if e0 > eC .

Proof. In Appendix E.
  19 Chari and Kehoe (1990) discuss the problems related to subgame perfection, and show how the sustain-

able equilibrium is also a symmetric perfect Bayesian equilibrium.




                                                          24
    Statement (i) of the proposition expresses that a sufficiently patient government can
endogenously commit to setting a Laffer-type tax in all periods. This equilibrium is sustained
by the expectations of the firms. As long as the government keeps setting a low tax (τ = 12 ),
firms expect this will continue into the future and hence explore at a relative high rate. The
government constantly has the ‘temptation’ to increase taxes to obtain a large share of the
old mines. However, should it do so, firms will change expectations about the government’s
equilibrium play. More precisely, if the firms observe a high tax, then they will expect the
oscillating equilibrium under the Markov strategy is being played and hence explore as if
future taxes will oscillate. Given such expectations on the part of firms, it will indeed be
optimal also for the government to set taxes that oscillate. Hence the economy switches
to the Markov equilibrium with tax and investment cycles. Since oscillations imply a short
run gain for the government when appropriating a large part of the old mines, but a lower
long-run tax revenue than under the constant τ = 12 , only a sufficiently patient government
will be able to sustain the constant tax as expressed by the proposition. As an illustration,
consider a government with β approaching 1. For this government the revenues of the infinite
future naturally overshadow any short-run gain, so the government seeks to maximize the
long-run tax revenues. Conversely, a government with a low β puts low value on future tax
revenues and hence immediately falls for the temptation of attaining a large share of the
existing mines.
    A closely related result is expressed in statement (ii) which says that a large existing tax
base undermines the ability to endogenously commit. To see this, consider a government
with a given β. If this β is sufficiently high then the constant-tax equilibrium may be
attainable. Of course, this relies on the government preferring the constant-tax equilibrium
over the oscillating equilibrium. This will not be the case if the existing tax base is very
large as the temptation to set a high tax in the first period would be too high.
    The results presented here show that the model may account for why, in practice, dif-
ferent countries exhibit oscillating taxes while others do not. In particular, countries with
more patient governments (for instance, due to low political turnover or due to shared basic
objectives between competing parties) are less likely to exhibit cycles. Related to this, the
result that a sufficiently low e0 is required to enable the constant-tax equilibrium can be
applied on an intuitive level to any period: a country that has managed to sustain a constant
tax may renege by increasing its tax if a large discovery is made.


6     Tax differentiation
In this section we analyze the model in a situation where the government can differentiate
taxes based on age – it can set separate taxes on old and new mines – and show that such
complete tax differentiation would lead to an equilibrium without cycling. We compare
the taxes a government sets in such a setting with the taxes in the baseline (impatient-
government) setting. For conciseness, we assume here that p = 1 and δ = 12 .



                                              25
   Consider a government in a period t. It has the objective function

                                            1             1
                         max          τt,old et−1 + τt,new et (τt,new , τt+1,old )        (11)
                     τt,old ,τt,new         2             2

where it chooses a tax, τt,old , on the existing stock of mines and a tax, τt,new , on new
mines explored within the period. It is immediate that, the old mines being a completely
inelastic tax base, the government will expropriate them by setting τt,old = 1. Hence, τt,old
is set independently of τt,new . Likewise will be the case for the government in the next
period, which will set τt+1,old = 1. This, naturally, is foreseen by the representative firm
that consequently faces the problem

                                                       1    1
                                      max (1 − τt,new ) et − e2t
                                       et              2    2

which simply says that the firm chooses exploration effort by maximizing current-period
revenues only. Taking the first-order condition we get

                                                    1 − τt,new
                                            e∗t =              .
                                                        2

Since τt,old and τt,new are independent of each other, in choosing τt,new , the government
considers the reaction function of the firm and solves

                                                      1 1 − τt,new
                                         max τt,new
                                        τt,new        2     2

which has the solution
                                                  ∗         1
                                                 τt,new =     ,
                                                            2
i.e., a Laffer tax on new mines. This in turn implies

                                                                  1
                                             edif f ≡ e∗t =
                                                                  4

in all periods. Thus, in each period the government expropriates all old mines but sets a
rather favorable tax on new mines. Note that there is no cycling in this case.
   It is instructive to compare this outcome with the steady-state tax in the baseline case.
From (9) we get τss = 23 2+2β      2 8             1
                                       
                           2+β ∈ 3 , 9 when δ = 2 . This tax is in between the old-mine
and new-mine tax of the differentiating government. This way, if the government can tax-
differentiate, it is able to better incentivize the firm based on revenues obtained in the
current period. But this comes at the cost of being unable to incentivize the firm based on
revenues arriving later since such revenues will be expropriated.
   Will the two effects jointly imply more or less exploration compared to the non-differentia-
ting case? When evaluating the two effects jointly, the low tax on new mines always over-
shadows the importance of the high tax on old mines as compared to the single tax in
the baseline model. To see this, consider the steady-state exploration effort in the baseline

                                                   2 2 + 2β       1
                                  ess =       1−                    (1 + β) .                            (12)

                                                                                        1
It is straightforward to show that ess is decreasing in β and that ess (0) =            6   and ess (1) = 19 ,
which are both smaller than edif f = 14 . Hence, tax differentiation yields more exploration
than non-differentiation. The intuition for this is somewhat subtle and we illustrate it for
the polar cases of β → 0 and β → 1. Starting with the case of very impatient firms (β → 0)
it should be noted that such firms do not care at all about the revenues in the next period.
This means that the tax tomorrow, whether high or low, does not play a role in the firm’s
decision. But even so, since the firm obtains revenues from exploration in the current period
there will exist old mines in the next period. These mines form an inelastic tax base for
the government. To capture these revenues, the non-differentiating government has to raise
taxes also on new mines while the tax-differentiating government can get hold of them
while still incentivizing new investment (by setting a Laffer tax on new mines). Hence the
steady-state tax of the non-differentiating government will be higher than the tax on new
mines set by the differentiating government. Since this is the only tax the firm cares about,
exploration will be higher when the government differentiates.
    Consider now the case of very patient firms (β → 1). These firms do care about the later
revenues and are therefore disincentivized by the expropriatory tax levied on old mines by
the tax-differentiating government. However, since these firms care relatively less about to-
day, the non-differentiating government has less reason to set a low tax as the current-period
tax works poorly in incentivizing new investments. The non-differentiating government con-
sequently focuses on taxing the inelastic old mines and sets a high τss = 89 .20 Now, while the
tax-differentiating government also faces the problem of taxes on new mines working poorly
in incentivizing exploration, it at least retains the possibility of setting this tax separately
and hence optimally. This has a positive effect on investments. Thus, the flexibility of
differentiated taxes outweighs the value of committing to not fully expropriate next period.
    As a final step, we consider the total tax revenues obtained in the case of a differenti-
ating and non-differentiating government respectively. Let R denote government revenues
in a given period. In the differentiating-government case, plugging equilibrium taxes and
exploration into (11) yields
                                                           3
                                               Rdif f =       .
                                                           16
Similarly, in the non-differentiating government case, plugging the steady-state effort (12)
and steady-state tax (9) into (3) yields

                                           1 (2 + 2β) (2 − β) (1 + β)
                                   Rss =                    2
                                           9        (2 + β)
  20 This is closely connected to our earlier discussion following Corollary 2. Even without any pre-existing

mines, the undifferentiated tax exceeds the Laffer tax as firms are patient (β > 0). With pre-existing mines,
the tax is even higher.



                                                      27
which can be shown to be smaller than Rdif f for all β ∈ (0, 1).21 The intuition for this
follows from the previous results on exploration investment. Since exploration is always
higher under the differentiating government which expropriates old mines while optimally
taxing new mines, the total tax revenues have to be higher.
  This analysis, perhaps surprisingly, suggests that differentiating taxes increases govern-
ment revenues. Yet in reality full tax differentiation is seldomly observed, and tax and
investment cycles persist. We have several hypotheses in mind for why full tax differ-
entiation is rare (e.g., guaranteed expropriation of old mines in all periods could lead to
reputational spillovers, a lack of continued capital investments in older production facilities,
costs of shifting ownership and operations of old mines to the state, and moral hazard) and
view this as an interesting question to explore in future research.


7     Conclusions
This paper has presented the first resource-taxation model with rational expectations by
forward-looking firms who cannot commit to exiting a country and governments who cannot
commit to tax rates. This is a highly policy-relevant problem, not only in developing
countries lacking strong institutions, but also in developed countries.
    We have shown how this model predicts repeated cycles of tax rates and investment,
which is in line with the empirical reality in a large number of resource-producing countries.
We provide two detailed case studies and multiple shorter examples of cyclical taxation. In
these examples, the government sets a low tax rate to encourage exploration and investment.
This leads to subsequent large discoveries whereby either a new high-tax party seizes power
or the current government changes its policy to high taxation. This consequently deters
new investment, implying few discoveries and the arrival of a new government with a low-
tax platform, and so on. Thus tax cycles are a key driver of political turmoil and changes
in political power and platforms and may be an important explanation of the political
instability of resource-rich countries. Our model predicts that these cycles will be more
pronounced for resources which take longer to develop. We have also analyzed how price
changes and increasing government patience affect these tax oscillations. As such, the model
offers many testable implications that can be taken to the data.22
    We also show how our model can sustain equilibria without tax oscillations. Hence, some
countries may reach equilibria with cycles while others do not. This is consistent with the

mainly on the theoretical and modeling side, and to document and explain repeated taxation cycles as
commonly observed in many countries. We therefore leave further empirics as future work.

observation that tax cycles are frequently observed across many countries and sectors, while
there certainly exist exceptions.
   Our model is cast in terms of exhaustible natural resources like oil, gas, metals, and
gems, but applies to any setting in which capital is immobile and has a productive lifetime
that exceeds the government’s commitment period. Examples from the broader resource
sector would include renewable resources such as investments in land development, fisheries,
timber or coffee plantations. Examples from the energy sector include power plants, wind
farms, pipelines and refineries. Many infrastructure investments, such as privately operated
ports, toll roads, railroads, buildings and telecommunications networks, are also long-lived
and immobile. Finally, the model applies to capital-intensive manufacturing facilities, such
as for automobiles, electronics or steel. Any of these sectors could in principle be subject to
cycles following our model and it is well documented that such sectors also exhibit cyclical
taxation and investment (e.g., Chua (1995) documents that railroads, electricity grids and
other types of infrastructure and sectors have been subject to cycles in a large number of
Asian and Latin-American countries).
   Our model is rich enough to reflect tax and investment cycles with agents that hold ra-
tional expectations, but without the need to exogenously assume expropriations. It is also
simple enough to serve as a starting point for further analysis of optimal natural resource
taxation under imperfect commitment. For example, the model can be extended to con-
sider changing land prospectivity, imperfect competition among resource extraction firms,
different price expectations, endogenous extraction profiles and side payments to corrupt
politicians. The model could also include any costs of expropriation – e.g., from reputation
loss, international arbitration, and the loss of technological expertise if private investors
leave following a full-scale nationalization and production and exploration are left to state-
owned companies. One could also introduce more sophisticated taxation schemes that aim
at getting around the commitment problem (e.g., exploration subsidies). Hence our model
can also be used to study normative issues related to the structure of resource taxation.

A      Investment data
Figure 2 shows investment flows in oil and gas in Bolivia and Venezuela. Sectoral investment
data are hard to collect in a consistent manner over long periods of time, especially for non-
OECD countries. UNCTAD is the most comprehensive data source available and reports
foreign direct investment in the oil and gas sector, starting in 1974 (Bolivia) and 1994
(Venezuela). For Venezuela, we obtained earlier data on total oil and gas investment flows
from Monaldi (2001). Note that, from 1976 onwards, these data represent the sum of
investments by national oil company PDVSA and foreign investments. The two series are
therefore not perfectly comparable, but the pattern is still highly informative.23
    As described in Section 2, these data clearly illustrate the mechanism of our model.
In both countries, investments are low when taxes are high and the investment regime is
unfavorable, and vice versa. Specifically, investment increased with tax reforms in 1990 and
especially the new fiscal terms in 1996. Resource nationalism in the early 2000s significantly
depressed FDI, after which it stayed low in Venezuela (which has stuck to high taxes)
but increased substantially in Bolivia when tax rates went down again in the late 2000s.
Investment flows in earlier years are also consistent with our model and the fiscal regime.


B      Proof of Lemma 1
Note first that δ ≥ 12 , so that the restriction on δ ensures 2 − β( 1−δ 2
                                                                      δ ) > 0. Thus A, D > 0,
C < 0, and the tax function is weakly increasing. It is also clearly continuous, so given any
current tax τt ∈ [0, 1], the first-order condition (2) defines a unique e∗ (τt ). Suppose that
                                                                                ∗
this e∗t yields a next period tax strictly below unity. We can then substitute τt+1 = Aet + B
into the FOC, giving the equilibrium exploration as a linear function of τt , with coefficients
dependent on A and B. Substituting this into the government’s FOC (4), we obtain an
expression linear in et , with coefficients functions of A and B. For the optimal tax to
conform to the policy rule, the coefficient on et must equal A and the constant term must
equal B. We can solve for A and B, and substitute these to the expression for e∗t (τt ) to
obtain C and D.
    To complete the proof, we must confirm that e∗t (τ ) indeed yields a tax below unity next
                                       ∗
period. To check this, we verify that τt+1 (e∗ (0)) < 1, which holds given δ > δ. Given A > 0,
C < 0, then any τ > 0 also yields an interior tax next period. Clearly for very high et−1 ,
the tax policy does not yield an interior solution; given that the government’s problem is
strictly concave, this implies for any such et−1 it is optimal to set τt∗ (et−1 ) = 1.
  23 In fact, the spike in FDI from UNCTAD in 1997 is inconsistent with the reported total investment from

Monaldi (2001). This is possibly explained by differences in reporting periods or practices, or the conversion
between U.S. dollars and local currencies in a period of fluctuating exchange rates and high inflation.

C     Equilibria for δ < δ(β)
In this section, we demonstrate that piecewise-linear equilibria can also be constructed for
some values of δ less than δ(β). The firms’ equilibrium exploration rule is decreasing, but
it may have a kink at τ = τ̃ : for low values of the current tax τ ≤ τ̃ , the firms explore
so much that the next period’s taxes hit 100% (see the black curves in Figure C.1). The
government’s policy rule is increasing but may be discontinuous; for low values of et−1 < ẽ1 ,
the government may set taxes τ ∗ (et−1 ) < τ̃ . These equilibria are illustrated in Figure C.1
and given formally by the following proposition.

Proof. We first show that, given the government’s policy rule, equilibrium exploration will
satisfy (C.1). Recall the representative firm’s FOC (2). We plot the average benefit and
average cost of exploration in the left panel of Figure C.2, for a given τt , and given the
                              ∗
government’s policy rule for τt+1 (et ). Equilibrium exploration is given by the intersection,
and changes in τt shift the average benefit vertically. For τt < τ̃ , the AB curve lies very high
                                                       ∗
and intersects AC in the horizontal section; that is, τt+1 = 1 and the FOC yields the claimed
equilibrium extraction. For τt ∈ (τ̃ , 1], the curves intersect in the region et ∈ [ẽ1 , ẽ2 ), so
that e∗t = Cτt + D as claimed. The threshold τ̃ is derived from setting limτ ↓τ̃ τ ∗ (e∗ (τ )) = 1,
          1−B−AD
or τ̃ =     AC   .   The restriction δ > δ(β) is derived from the requirement that even a 100%
tax puts the economy on the converging path next period, or e∗ (1) = C + D > ẽ1 . The
steady state is always stable as δ 0 (β) > 0 and δ(0) =        1
                                                               3    (ensuring the tax transition curve
will always have a slope less than unity in absolute value).
   Now let us demonstrate that, given the equilibrium exploration rate, the government
will optimally set taxes as according to (C.2). Note first that

                                                           det


so that the firms’ equilibrium extraction function is steeper for low τt : for low taxes, next-
period taxes are capped at unity, so that a small change in current period taxes is not
offset at all by a response in the next-period tax (which are unresponsive, on the margin,
to changes in e∗ (τt )). Note also that, as equilibrium exploration is continuous, so is the
government’s profit. Thus we can obtain the government’s profits from integrating the
difference between marginal benefit and marginal cost of increasing τt , as given by by the
LHS and RHS of (4), respectively. We plot these in Figure C.2.
   A change in et−1 shifts the MB curve vertically, leaving MC unchanged. There is a level
of et−1 = ẽ1 such that the profits are equal for either intersection (consider the sizes of
the triangles formed by the MB and MC lines and the line τ = τ̃ ). For et−1 < ẽ1 , it is
optimal to set τ ∗ < τ̃ . For et−1 > ẽ1 , it is optimal to set τ > τ̃ . Of course, for very high
et−1 > ẽ2 , the taxes are optimally set at the upper limit τ ∗ = 1, with the threshold given

      It is straightforward to confirm that, for et−1 ≤ ẽ1 , i.e. setting τ ∗ < τ̃ , the resulting
optimal tax rate is given as per (C.2). The case et−1 > ẽ1 is essentially the case we dealt
with in Section 3. What then remains to do is to calculate ẽ1 , i.e. the point at which the
government obtains equal tax revenues from the optimal taxes below and above τ̃ . For this,
we calculate the values given taxes are set optimally. For τ < τ̃ ,

Thus the discriminant of (C.4) is weakly positive, so that ẽ1 has either two real roots (one
negative, one undetermined) or a single (negative) root. Only a positive ẽ1 makes sense.
Furthermore, from (C.4), for e > ẽ1 , the profits for the τ > τ̃ regime always exceed the

profits for the τ < τ̃ case. The positive root is straightforward to calculate, and equals the
expression for ẽ1 given in the proposition. If there is no positive root, then the government’s
policy is not discontinuous; even for et−1 = 0, it will be optimal to set taxes high enough so
that the next period government’s response to equilibrium exploration is to set taxes still
below unity (see the middle panel in Figure C.1).



D        Details of the patient government case
We here construct the equilibrium for the case with a patient government. We simplify by
setting the government’s discount factor equal to the private discount factor: β G = β. We
also normalize p = 1, to reduce clutter. To the same end, we also define

                                                    1−δ
                                               x≡       .
                                                     δ

    The structure of the proof is exactly analogous to that of Lemma 1: we guess and verify
piecewise-linear equilibrium policy rules, imposing a parameter restriction to avoid further
complications. More specifically, we conjecture that a strategy and exploration rule of the
type (6) solve problems (1) and (10), and proceed to determine the resulting coefficients
A, B, C and D.
    We can apply the envelope theorem to the government’s value function (10) to get

                                     V 0 (et−1 ) = (1 − δ)τt∗ ≥ 0.                               (D.1)

    Supposing the next period’s government will follow a linear policy function, the first-
order condition now takes into account the effect of present exploration on future tax rev-
enues:

   Substituting in the (supposed linear) policy function and equilibrium exploration effort

We can solve for the coefficients. This involves a quadratic in AC, and we rule out one of
the roots as it satisfies AC < −1, which would yield an unstable tax transition; such a case
does not conform our assumption that the next period tax rate is always given by the rule
τ ∗ (e) = Ae + B. The explicit expressions for the coefficients are

   The tax transition is still τt+1 (e∗t (τt )) = AD + B + ACτt , and the steady state tax is
            AD+B
given by    1−AC .    We have to impose three restrictions. For the government’s problem to
have a solution, we require 1 − βx2 ≥ 0. For the tax transition to be stable, we require
AC > −1. Finally, we must ensure that a zero tax leads to an exploration rate which is
then followed by a tax rate strictly below unity, we require AD + B < 1. This yields the
restriction x <    √1 ,    or
                    1+β

In fact, (D.3) is sufficient to guarantee the other two restrictions also hold.
   We also need the expression for the value function for the proof of Proposition 3. From
(D.1), we know that the first derivative of the value function is linear in the state et−1 .
We thus expect the value function to be quadratic in the region where τt∗ (et−1 ) < 1.24 So
conjecture
                                   V (et−1 ) = Z2 e2t−1 + Z1 et−1 + Z0 .
 24 The   value function is linear for higher et−1 and easily calculated, but we do not need it.




                                                      39
We can find the coefficients Z2 , Z1 and Z0 by first calculating the value from the definition
by substituting in the optimal policies:

        V (et−1 ) = τ ∗ (et−1 ) ((1 − δ)et−1 + δe∗ (τ ∗ (et−1 ))) + βV (e∗ (τ ∗ (et−1 )))
                  = (Aet−1 + B) ((1 − δ)et−1 + δ(ACet−1 + BC + D))

Once we put the previous two equations together, we can then equate the coefficients on
the quadratic, linear and constant terms of et−1 . These are easily solved:

                        δA(x + AC)
                   Z2 =            ,

Proof of Proposition 2. We see from the tax transition and AC < 0 that the tax oscillations
occur even with a patient government. Deviations from the steady state die out at the rate
                                          ∗
                                         τt+1 − τss
                                                    = |AC| .                                    (D.6)
                                          τt − τss

From (D.6), it is clear that deviations from the steady state decay faster, the lower is AC
in absolute value. We can differentiate |AC| with respect to β:
                                               2
                                        1 − βx2 − 1 − βx2
                                                  p
                               d|AC|
                                     =−         p         <0
                                 dβ        β 2 x 1 − βx2

as it is easy to confirm that the numerator is positive. Thus, an increase in the discount
factor makes the decay rate slower.

   The reason for the higher persistence of cycles under higher patience is that the rate at
which tax cycles disappear is decreasing in the reactivity of the government and the market:
highly responsive taxes or investment will cause more persistent cycles. The government
indeed becomes more responsive when β is high. To see why, take future governments’



                                                  40
decision rules, and the firms’ exploration function, as a given. A government today optimally
equates the marginal benefit of increasing the tax rate – the total size of a period’s tax base
– with the marginal cost of lowering exploration, thus shrinking the tax base. For a patient
government, shrinking the tax base is undesirable because it lowers the tax take today and
in the next period. However, as the next period’s government will lower the tax rate in
response to a smaller tax base, this marginal cost is partially offset: higher taxes today
mean lower taxes tomorrow, so that lower investment today hurts less. A more patient
government perceives this offsetting effect on future revenues as more important, so that
high government patience implies a relatively flat marginal cost curve, and thus a greater
tax response to a shift of the marginal benefit curve. Such a shift would result from a change
in the stock of pre-existing mines.
    The firms, on the other hand, become less responsive when the discount factor rises.
This is because they weigh future revenues relatively more, so that changes in current tax
rates are less important in determining investment.
    In equilibrium, of course, all policy rules adjust. A more responsive tax policy in the
future will constrain the equilibrium exploration rate more tightly. This is because a reduc-
tion in taxes today has a weaker effect on exploration if the next government is expected to
respond to more investment by raising taxes a lot next period. Thus exploration becomes
even less responsive to current taxes ( ∂C
                                        ∂β > 0, recalling C < 0). This change in the market
response further increases the government’s incentives to set a highly responsive tax policy:
if raising taxes today has less of an effect on investment, there is a greater incentive to set
them high (if the pre-existing stock is high), reinforcing the direct effect of higher patience.
                                                          ∂A
Overall, then, tax policy is certainly more responsive:   ∂β   > 0. More responsive tax policy
and less responsive investment have countervailing effects on the overall persistence of tax
cycles, but the former dominates the latter, so that increasing government patience makes
cycles more persistent.


E     Proof of Proposition 3
The proposed strategies form an equilibrium as longs as the government does not wish to
deviate from the equilibrium strategy, and the exploration firms find it optimal to follow
the exploration rule. The purported equilibrium is constructed from two ‘regimes’: the
                                                                                      1
‘commitment’ regime under which the government always sets taxes equal to             2;   and a
‘punishment’ regime, which is the Markov-perfect Nash equilbrium (MPNE). A Markov
equilibrium is a special case of sustainable equilibrium—one in which the history dependence
reduces to the dependence only on the current state variable et−1 (for the government) and
the current tax τt (for the firm). Thus Proposition 2 establishes that the punishment regime
is, indeed, a sustainable equilibrium, for all histories. Hence, it remains to obtain conditions
under which

 (a) no firm would want to deviate in the ‘commitment’ regime;


                                              41
 (b) the government would not want to deviate from the steady state of the commitment
     regime (which is reached in the period after the initial period); and

 (c) the government would not want to deviate in the initial period 0.

   Following Proposition 2, we will denote the Markov strategies by τ ∗ (e) = Ae + B and
e∗ (τ ) = Cτ + D, and the associated MPNE value function by V (e) = Z2 e2 + Z1 e + Z0 , with

The initial period is taken to be 1. The period-1 value for following the ‘commitment’ regime
is denoted by V1C , and the value obtained in the steady state of the commitment regime
(reached by period 2) is denoted by VtC , t > 1.
   In the steady state, the tax rate is constant at τ ∗∗ =     1
                                                               2,   and from the firms’ FOC,
equilibrium exploration equals
                                     e∗∗ = δτ ∗∗ (1 + βx).

This is the unique optimum for the firms, given that firms expect the next period government
to follow the purported tax rule, ensuring (a) holds.
   We next derive conditions for (b), i.e. that the government does not have a profitable
deviation from the steady state of the commitment regime if and only if β is sufficiently
high. The government’s flow payoff in the ‘commitment’ regime is τ ∗∗ e∗∗ = 12 e∗∗ , and total
discounted payoff is

                                   VtC =         e , t > 1.

Clearly, as any deviation leads to a Markov continuation, the Markov strategy is the optimal
deviation given any initial e0 . Thus, the difference in the payoffs between the commitment

VtC ; and using δ =   1+x .   It is straightforward to verify that this expression is negative in
the limit β → 0, and goes to infinity as β → 1. The expression is also continuous in β for
admissible parameter values. The value is greater than zero when the term in the brackets
is greater than zero, equivalent to
                        p
                2(1 + x) 1 − βx2 − x2 (1 − β)(1 + βx) − 2(1 + x)(1 − βx2 ) ≥ 0             (E.8)

   We will show the LHS of (E.8) increases monotonically with β. Differentiating with

Note that as x2 < 1+β , 1 − βx2 > 1+β , so that 1 − βx2 > √1+β  > 12 . Thus √1+x                <
                                                                                        1−βx2
2(1 + x) < 3 + x + 2βx, so that the LHS increases monotonically. Together with continuity,
and the fact that ∆Vt is negative for β → 0 and is positive as β → 1, implies that the
difference (E.7) changes sign at most once. For values of x close to 1, ∆Vt < 0 for any
admissible β. However, for larger x, ∆Vt > 0 iff β is sufficiently high.
   Thus we have shown that, for any high enough δ, there is a unique β1 such that, for all
β < β1 , the Markov payoff from the steady state of the purported commitment equilibrium
would yield a higher payoff than following the strategies suggested in the proposition, so
that a profitable deviation would exist; and vice versa for β > β1 .
   We finally turn to (c), and show that the strategies yield a higher payoff in the initial
period if and only if β is sufficiently high. We first tackle the case in which the initial stock
is not so high that the Markov tax would hit unity. Then, the difference in the initial period

Fixing e0 and δ, the second and third terms are positive and, by inspection, can be seen to
increase in β. To investigate the behaviour of the first coefficient we differentiate it:
                                  p        !                    p
                       ∂       1 − 1 − βx2     2(1 − βx2 )(1 − 1 − βx2 ) − βx2
                             −    p          =                     p

which has the sign of the numerator. Thus, the coefficient increases in β if
                                              p
                                  −2(1 − βx2 ) 1 − βx2 > βx2 − 2(1 − βx2 ).

This will never hold if the RHS is positive, since the LHS is always negative (since βx2 <

                     2      3                                                            1         3
it will hold if x <        4β ,   which will always hold as we have assumed x2 ≤        1+β   <   4β .
      Thus, ∆V1 (e0 ) is always increasing in β. It is easy to show that ∆V1 (e0 ) is strictly
negative as β → 0 and goes to +∞ for β → 1 (see (E.9)). Thus, for any δ and e0 such that
the Markov taxes are strictly interior, there is a unique β2 such that for β < β2 the Markov
strategy provides a higher initial payoff, and for β > β2 , the commitment strategy provides

Also, limβ→1 ∆V1 = ∞ as the second term in (E.11) is divided by (1 − β). Hence, for very
low discount factors, the Markov policy always yields a higher payoff, and for high enough
β, the commitment regime does. We now proceed to show that ∆V1 can change signs at

The RHS is positive if
              p                                   1                 5

We will show that

              p                                         2x + 21 x2 + βx2 − 3βx3 − 25 β 2 x4

which ensures (E.13) holds, as the RHS is always weakly greater than the RHS of (E.13).
                       p
Multiplying through by 1 − βx2 , this condition is equivalent to

                            4 + x2 − 8βx2 + 2βx3 − 2βx4 + 7β 2 x4 > 0.

It is straightforward to demonstrate that, in the closure of the square x ∈ [0, 1], β ∈ (0, 1),
the only critical points of the LHS are at x = 0. As the LHS in continuous in this region,
any extreme values have to lie on one of the four edges of the square. Thus we only have to
check the minimum values at the edges; the lowest of these is at (x, β) = (.7, 1), at which
point the LHS takes the value of 2.457 > 0. Thus, the inequality holds everywhere, ensuring
(E.13) holds also, so that ∆V1 is increasing in β at any point at which ∆V1 = 0.
   Thus, for any δ, e0 there exists a unique β3 such that for β < β3 the initial payoff from
the Markov strategy exceeds the payoff from the commitment regime, and vice versa. This
shows that there exists a β3 ∈ (0, 1) such that for e0 for which τ ∗ (e0 ) = 1, the commitment
tax is preferred over the Markov tax.
   Define                                      (
                                                   β2    if τ ∗ (e0 ) < 1,
                                 β23 (e0 ) ≡
                                                   β3       otherwise.



                                                    46
Endogenous commitment is a SPNE iff β > βC ≡ max{β1 , β23 (e0 )} ∈ (0, 1) which has a
unique solution since β1 , β2 , β3 are all unique for any given δ, e0 . We also need to ensure
that the resulting pair (βC , δ) lies in the feasible region for the patient government case,

                                                 1
                                           x≤       .                                       (E.14)
                                                1+β

For low e0 , the critical value is β1 ; the intersection of (E.14) and (E.8) is given by β 3 + 2β −
1 = 0, implying that δ has to be higher than .547. For higher e0 , first β2 and eventually
β3 become binding. The resulting βC shifts right for any δ; in the limit as e0 becomes
                                                                                     √
                                                                                       2
arbitrarily high, feasibility is guaranteed by (E.14) for β → 1, implying δ >         √
                                                                                    1+ 2
                                                                                           ≈ .586.
This proves Statement (i ).
   Statement (ii ) can easily be seen to be true by inspection of (E.10). For any β, δ, the
expression is negative for sufficiently large e0 .
